Extrapolate as many relationships between teams as possible from the text and provide a list of relationships. Teams may be affiliated with universities, labs or colleges.

If a relationship is found, provide ["TEAM 1", "LABEL", "TEAM 2"]. 

"TEAM 1" is the team who wrote the text.
"LABEL" is a description of the relationship.
"TEAM 2" is a team that has a relationship with TEAM 1.

example: We are team Greendale. We collaborated with team City College on our project this year and mentored iGEM Harmon College.
relationships: [["Greendale", "collaborated", "City College"],["Greendale","mentored","Harmon College"]]

example: We are team Mideastern. We received financial and material support from Addgene, and plasmids were generously gifted to us by the Baker lab at Southwestern University. We co-organized a meetup with Branch Western. We also participated in a survey run by Barkley.
relationships: [["Mideastern","support from","Addgene"],["Southwestern University" ,"gifted","Mideastern"],["Mideastern","co-organized meetup","Branch Western"],["Mideastern","participated in survey","Barkley"]]

If there are no relationships in the text, provide [].
