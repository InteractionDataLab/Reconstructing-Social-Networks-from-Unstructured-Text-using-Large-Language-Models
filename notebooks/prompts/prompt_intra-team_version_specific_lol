The following text describes the relationships between people and the activities they performed as a part of a synthetic biology team. 

Extrapolate all these relationships, and if a relationship is found, provide ["MEMBER", "ACTIVITY"]. 

"MEMBER" is the name of the team member.
"ACTIVITY" is the activity they performed as described in the text.

If a member is involved in multiple activities, report each activity as a separate relationship.

example: Marcus North - project conceptulisation, outreach.
relationships: [["Marcus North", "project conceptualisation"],["Marcus North","outreach"]]

example: We are team Mideastern. Our team members Brad Hogg and Sophie Devine performed wet lab experiments. Andrew Symonds was responsible for collaborating with other iGEM teams.
relationships: [["Brad Hogg","wet lab experiments"],["Sophie Devine","wet lab experiments"],["Andrew Symonds","collaborating with other teams"]

Please make sure there is no additional text in the response other than the relationships in the prescribed format.
