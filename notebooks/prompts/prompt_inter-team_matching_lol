Given a new list of names - find the closest match of each element in the new list with the first list.
          
Some names could be matched with abbreviations or expansions - so please select the closest possible match. 
If there is no possible good match - please mention 'other'.
         
Provide the output as a list of lists: [["team name from the new list", "best matching from the first list"]]         
            
example: 
list of teams: Gifu, CCU_Taiwan, Peking_China
list of names: Team Gifu, Chung Cheng University, pectinase
matches: [["Team Gifu", "Gifu"],["Chung Cheng University", CCU_Taiwan"],["pectinase", "other"]]
