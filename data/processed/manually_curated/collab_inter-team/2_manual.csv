Collaborating with Team Aachen
Like in all other fields of modern science, collaboration between different work groups is a beneficial way to combine experience and knowledge in order to achieve proper project results. For that reason, iGEM teams from all over the world collaborate to help each other with complex and challenging tasks on their way of accomplishing their specific project aims. In this year, our team joined forces with Aachen in order to improve both of our projects.
Since the primary purpose of our project was to design and create an artificial compartment, orthogonal peroxisomal protein import is one major part of achieving our objective. For that reason, we needed to deactivate natural protein import facilitated by the two receptor proteins Pex5 and Pex7. Initially, we possessed yeast strains which are deficient for Pex5 or Pex7, but we additionally planned to create a yeast cell line which is unable to express both import proteins, resulting in peroxisomes lacking luminal proteins which are called ‘ghosts’. Subsequently, we will integrate our own protein translocation system, allowing us to completely control the protein content of our artificial compartment. We consulted iGEM Aachen which already had lots of experience and knowledge regarding gene knockouts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The double knockout was performed successfully by team Aachen, allowing us to get rid of the natural peroxisomal protein import machinery. Conclusively, through this collaboration with team Aachen we were able to improve our final results significantly.
Thanks to the double knockout for the import proteins Pex5 and Pex7 we obtained completely empty ghosts. Thus, verification of the function of our orthogonal peroxisomal protein import machinery was feasible. We therefore accomplished to transfer our artificial Pex5",TRUE,Aachen,Material Transfer,Team cologne needed a certain strain that aachen had performed successfully for their experiment.

Since iGEM is not only about lab work but also about spreading the knowledge about synthetic biology into society, each team was asked to make a postcard depicting their project or more general a subject from synthetic biology. On the back of the postcard, a small informational text can also be found. This was a very easy and fun way to incorporate outreach into our project! Every team also received a batch of postcards from all the other participating teams. It was very interesting to see the postcards from the other teams and made us curious for the presentations at the Giant Jamboree.

Characterization of Toehold and Toehold+Trigger for ATOMS_Turkiye
In the search of collaboration with the ATOMS_Turkiye, we have agreed with the Turkish squad for us to characterize two of their parts. We conducted a protein isolation and yielded results.
5 ml cultures containing the Toehold and toehold+trigger parts were incubated at 37 C for 16 hours. 1mM of iPTG was added at the end of the 16. hour. Another 4 hour  incubation was conducted. The proteins in the incubated cultures were then isolated. A flurometric measurement was conducted at 473 nm of emission and 510 nm of excitation values. The difference in between the measurements for the protein isolates of the two parts can be seen below:

Visit to INMEGEN
Alongside iGem Team TecCEM_HS and both other high schools and undergraduate classes, we visited Mexico’s National Institute of Genomic Medicine (Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica). For a whole day, we assisted to different workshops, visits to the laboratories of the institute, etc. Where we were able to exchange ideas, opinions and recommendations about both our respective projects and synthetic biology as a whole. On top of that, we were introduced to the principal diseases that affect the Mexican population nowadays and that have been found to have an important genetic factor to their origin.
Meetup Latin-America
As it’s become a custom for Latin-American teams, the iGem Latin-America Meetup took place this year in Guanajuato, Mexico. We were present in all the videoconferences between the main teams who organized the meetup and helped with the overall organization. The Meetup represents and opportunity for a variety of iGem teams from High school to Undergraduate school to exchange ideas and recommendations about each other’s work.
Sponsorship partnering across Tec system
Alongside most of the iGem teams who come from Mexico and from the Tecnológico de Monterrey system of schools and colleges, we cooperated in the searching for sponsorships, especially regarding a sponsorship for flight tickets to Boston.
We are also in the process of discussing a system for delivery of the iGem kits for future competitions from a single Tec school to the rest of us as we believe that would better the efficiency with which every team receives the parts and reduce delays.
Surveys
We cooperated with a wide variety of iGem teams by answering surveys which were sent to us about many different topics. We believe that even every action such as these, small as they are, can help improve the modelling and information available to every team, and thus help to improve everyone’s project!

Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.
Which other teams can we work with?
You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration gold medal criterion .
In order to meet the gold medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.
Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:
Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device
Characterize another team's part
Debug a construct
Model or simulating another team's system
Test another team's software
Help build and test another team's hardware project
Mentor a high-school team",FALSE,,,,,

When we were doing our interlab measurement, we were not able to transform the plasmid into our competent cell DH5α. After doing the transformation four times without a successful result, we started debugging and also searched for assistance.
We are thankful for the NYMU-Taipei team, who gave us a hand after we told them our dilemma. They reviewed our lab notes to help us debug. Furthermore, we met each other online to discuss the problem together.
Also, as a backup plan, we borrowed from them E. coli which they had successfully transformed with plasmids for the interlab.
Plates from NYMU
With their timely help, we were able to conduct the following experiment including the conversion between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads. Without their help, we merely could complete the measurement of the silica beads and we would not have been able to calibrate against a known concentration of fluorescent molecule to reduce the variability in measurements between labs.

Sample ：20ml, positive control and 0.3g corn straw was added,                                          Abs600 was not certain because we had added straw.
Ferulic acid by GC ： 0.53 mg / L
Ferulic acid in straw：0.3 g * 1.15% = 0.345 mg
Ferulic acid degradation rate：(0.53 * 20*10-3)/0.345 = 10.6%
Xylose in 1kg straw ： 1kg * 30% * 10.6% = 0.0348 kg
With NCKU system, E. coli consumed xylose to uptake CO2.                                          The xylose consumption was 23.864 kg to uptake 1kg of CO2.                                          In conclusion, every 685 kg straw can be used to capture 1 kg CO2.                                          In other words, capturing 1% annual CO2 emission of                                          small and medium enterprise, which is 20 tons CO2 require 16 tons straw.
Straw was a biowaste in agriculture while it wasn't easy to decompose.                                         UESTC-China solved this problem with synthetic biology successfully.                                         Through our collaboration, they can not only produce bioenergy, but have                                         another powerful application in CO2 emission problem. NCKU-Tainan provided them                                         a valuable and also applicable way and helped them design a draft of device.                                          The xylose source from straw was really important to E. coli CO2 utilization system                                          which changed the positive carbon footprint into negative carbon footprint.                                         CO2 emission problems is a big issue in the world. The main solution can be                                         separated into two part, CO2 downstream processing and Alternative Energy. Both                                         NCKU-Tainan and UESTC-China contribute to this serious issue and our                                         collaboration could solve both the energy problem and environment problem.

COLLABORATIONS
Collaboration was a very important part of our project.  Having a large team with diverse students working on four subprojects (lab, modelling, Second Life and Human Practices), it was very important that team members communicated and collaborated well with each other.  We had a variety of ways to do this.  First, through our blog, ' Synthetic Blogology ', we were able to keep everyone up to date on what each of the different subprojects had accomplished on a weekly basis, as well as what their goals were for the upcoming week.  We also had weekly team meetings where we would discuss accomplishments and future directions.  Lastly, our Wiki Notebook, where team members recorded what they did on a day-to-day basis also helped us keep everyone on the same page.
Collaboration between teams is a very important part of the iGEM competition as well.  Not only is helping another team a gold medal requirement for the competition, but it's a great way to meet students from around the world and learn a bit about what they're up to. We are all working towards the purpose of promoting a synthetic biology community, and this clearly requires cooperation between teams.  Beyond collaborating within our own team, this year we had a variety of opportunities to collaborate with other teams.

Questionnaire in our survey
We conducted a wide survey targeted at the general public, with respondents ranging from high school students to working citizens, in collaboration with the Kyoto Institute of Technology KIT-Kyoto and Ehime-Japan . The survey had two objectives. The first was to find how Japanese people feel or think about synthetic biology and its associated issues such as bioethics and safety. The second was to capture the public perception of radiation in Japan. We surveyed people who came not only from biological backgrounds but also from various other fields of study. We also obtained feedback from visitors to our universities' open campus events. In addition, we made an online version of our questionnaire to survey even more people from various walks of life.
Attributions & Acknowledgements
We take pride in the fact that all experimental work - part design, construction and testing - were done by ourselves, without relying on outside help. However, directly or indirectly our project has benefited from help from the following parties:
Professor Todo and all the members of Radiation Biology and Medical Genetics Lab at Osaka University for lending us lab space and putting up with our intrusion
Issay Narumi of Ion Beam Mutagenesis Research Group at Japan Atomic Energy Agency for supplying us with D.radiodurans genomic DNA as well as helpful information and invaluable advice concerning the RecA promoter, etc
Professor Hayano of the laboratory of Hayano at the University of Tokyo and ASACUSA at CERN for invaluable advice concerning biodosimetry and dosimeter.

They took an in-depth understanding of the iGEM competition, mentoring us on establishing a team and registration, as well as telling us a series of precautions. Their help is really important for us to build our team this year.

Brazilian Meet Up
In collaboration with other Brazilian teams USP-Brazil and Unesp_Brazil , and also with former and future iGEM teams, we organized and participated in the Brazilian Meetup: Jamboré Brasuca. This event, named in honor of the Giant Jamboree, is a tradition among Brazilian teams, happening since 2010.
This year, the Jamboré took place at USP-ESALQ (Piracicaba-SP) on March 2nd and 3rd. There, we presented our 2018 project and saw other team projects from 2017 and future ones. Also, we had several lectures with synthetic biology experts including the international speakers Drew Endy, David García Gomez, Thomas Landrain and companies like Braskem and SENAI-CETIQT.
Latin America Meet Up
On early July, the Tec CEM iGEM team hosted a meet up for the Latin America teams. Via Skype, we presented our project's development until that point and received some great feedback.
Many of the comments that were made helped on the improvement of our presentation and our wiki, specially related to the Background and Design of our project.
The event had the participation of 8 teams, these being teams from Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and México. Also, with these same teams it was created a WhatsApp group for us to keep communicating.

Tec CEM team also had the amazing idea of creating a parody of “Girls Like You” and “Moves Like Jagger” by Maroon 5, and invited all iGEM teams to participate. For us, it was a really funny moment that made our iGEM routine happier. These are the teams you can see on the video:

★  ALERT!
This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the team collaboration silver medal criterion .
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.
Which other teams can we work with?
You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration silver medal criterion.
In order to meet the silver medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.
Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:
Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device

Cambridge-JIC,2015,"
DNA Extraction:
Adapted from: Extraction protocol
Cut center of circles out of the filter paper
Added 50 µl of EB buffer to resuspend DNA
Pipetted up and down to mix
Transformation:
Adapted from: Transformation protocol
Add 1 µl of DNA extract to thawed out competent Top10 E. coli cells (except control plate)
Mixture allowed to stand on ice for 15 minutes
Cells heat shocked for 30 seconds at 42˚
Mixture allowed to stand on ice for 5 minutes
100 µl of LB added at room temperature
Cells incubated for 1hr at 37˚ with shaking at 120 rpm
Cells plated out on Amp plates containing rich medium
Imaging:
Fluorescent samples were then visualised with OpenScope using two set-ups:
Standard set-up, using single LED illumination (470 nm, 100mW) and GFP epi-cube
Non-standard set-up, using high brightness LED (470nm, 3W) and GFP epi-cube
Results:
Earlier testing using the standard set-up (single LED illumination, GFP epi-cube) indicated that visualising fluorescent beads was possible with OpenScope (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1: GFP-coated fluorescent beads visualised using OpenScope under standard set-up. Images were captured on 14.09.15 using the Webshell, and are unedited.
Testing using the commercial fluorescence microscope confirmed that the samples had phenotypes as reported by William and Mary. Both constructs resulted in GFP expression in E. coli. J23106+I13504 demonstrated increased fluorescence intensity relative to J23117+I13504.

Collaboration with iGEM Graz
At the European iGEM meet-up in Delft (Netherlands) we met the current iGEM Team from NAWI Graz and recognized several opportunites to help each other out. We were happy to share our experience about project funding and the iGEM competition with a younger, highly motivated iGEM Team. One big issue for all iGEM participants is the funding of their project. In this context we could help the team from NAWI Graz with the acquisition of interested sponsors by arranging for contacts between them and potential supporters. We further also discussed possible wet-lab collaborations. As our chitin deacetylases (CDA) produce acetic acid as a side product, we thought about measuring  our CDA’s actitivity with the help of NAWI Graz’s pH-sensitive E. Coli strain. Unfortunately the generated acetic acid level would not be high enough for activating the pH-sensitive system. We are glad that we could exchange experiences with iGEM NAWI Graz and look forward to future collaborations of our teams.

We took cognizance of the fact that a technical project on mutagenesis and the underlying principles of synthetic biology may not be unambiguous to the general public. Hence, when IGEM NYU Abu Dhabi forwarded emails looking for science sketches that could simplify the presentation of the underlying principle of the project, we were more than happy to collaborate with them.
The science sketch is a diagrammatic representation of the project over a series of frames. Our science sketch started by addressing the most basic question of what mutagenesis is. Furthermore, we explained what mutants are with relatable examples and explained the ideas of restriction digestion and ligation using depictions of scissors and glue respectively in an attempt to illustrate their synonymous functions. The sketch also explained the conventional mutagenesis system of Palter and the drawbacks associated with it before introducing our system. It involved an illustration of our screening procedure and a relevant conclusion.
Through the sketching and filming processes, we realised what an important tool visualisation can be and the importance of public understanding of even complex scientific discoveries. We used the simplified explanation of our project for explaining it to many others. It also served as an inspiration for the Spot the mutations game we conducted as a part of our human practices campaign in an attempt to explain the concept of mutations and mutagenesis to tiny tots.

Experimental Help to BNDS-China
BNDS-China aims to soften the hard water. To achieve this goal, they decided to synthesize the E. coli backbone with ciaX that enable the bacteria to absorb Ca++. Same with us, they are a first-year high school team. Due to the limitation of their high school lab, we provided them with the access of our lab at Institution of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences. We did the PCR amplification of ciaX for them and provided the reagents needed for digestion and joining of DNA, including Phusion DNA polymerase, Taq DNA polymerase, PCR purification kit, gel purification kit, plasmid extraction kit, and restriction enzyme for Xba I, Xho I, EcorI and Pst I. We provided the relevant laboratory apparatus as well. In addition, we guided them through the usage of some of the reagents and instruments and sent them some pBS1c3 parts and pGEX-KG expression vectors for them to later clone the target gene to the expression vector and construct parts.",TRUE,BNDS_China,"Material Transfer, Advice","CIEI shared materials (apparatus, bioparts, reagants) and offered advice to BNDS",st,

Cornell,2017," iGEM visited the Ithaca Farmers’ Market as well as the Ithaca Commons during our annual Apple Harvest Festival to collect survey responses. We also visited the Great New York State Fair in Syracuse to gather responses from people across the state of New York. Stony Brook collected responses at their campus and online. Altogether, we had 92 survey participants. Our survey questions can be found here . We hope that other iGEM teams will follow our lead and conduct similar analysis in their communities.
Key Takeaways
A larger percentage of people in Stony Brook claim they know what synthetic biology is compared to people in Ithaca. This relationship is statistically significant (p = 0.01).
A larger percentage of people in both Stony Brook and Ithaca believe that synthetic biology/genetic engineering has a positive impact on the world.
However, many people still believe that synthetic biology should be limited to certain areas in future science.
There is a negative perception of the term GMO compared to the term synthetic biology. This reveals that there is a stigma against the phrase “genetically modified organism” even if the idea of synthetic biology is actually not opposed.
Demographics do not significantly affect perceptions of synthetic biology.
Regional Differences
When we started this survey, we wanted to know if people’s perceptions of synthetic biology changed depending on where they lived. Would people be more accepting of synthetic biology in New York City or Ithaca? What do they foresee in the future for genetic engineering? We had lots of questions, but few answers. Our survey allowed us to see the bigger picture.
We first asked, “how would you rate your understanding of synthetic biology?”. A summary of their answers can be found below:
Figure 1: Frequency count of people describing their understanding of synthetic biology
While the graphs of both locations have the same shape, it is clear that in Stony Brook, a larger percentage of people in their sample claim that they know what synthetic biology is compared to the percentage of people in Ithaca. After running a T-test, this was confirmed to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.01. This is an interesting result, since Cornell is a larger institution with easy access to events, seminars, and programs. However, perhaps it shows how segregated Cornell’s student body is to our community, and how we need to interact with our town more.
We also wanted to know how people felt about synthetic biology, so we asked “how do you feel about the impact of synthetic biology on the world?”.

The surge in popularity of Synthetic Biology as an engineering discipline in recent years can in many ways be attributed its passionate community [1] [2]. Much effort has been spent on promoting SynBio as an excellent media for boundaryless open scientific collaboration, exchanges and education, surely inspired by the success of the Open Source initiative [3] [4]. The arguably most important event in the encouragement of this pragmatic Linus’ law-inspired engagement of Open Synthetic Biology is the annual iGEM competition during which students partake in developing the tools of trade.
To mold the future of the discipline, cooperation, respect, good sportsmanship and celebration of the collective efforts are some of the core values presented by the iGEM Foundation. The most lucid manifestation of this is the endorsement of scientific collaboration between project groups - in stark contrast to the more commonly found mano-a-mano style competition. As a team that chose to work with microplastics for the joint opportunity to not only contribute to synthetic biology but raise awareness of how we can collectively make strides toward reducing plastic pollution, these values resonated with our beliefs as a group of aspiring ecoconscious scientists. Thus, we engaged in as many exchanges as we found possible, to varying degrees of comprehension.
We want to extend our sincerest gratitude to all the teams that we have been in correspondence with during the passing year. Your passion, optimism and tenacity inspired us to make the most out of the iGEM experience.

After an extensive skype meeting with the iGEM team of SVCE Chennai in which we exchanged ideas, suggestions and well-wishes, we stumbled upon the opportunity to assist them in their project. They had set out to create a library of adaptors between transcriptional and translational regulation in E. coli by combining the translational regulatory system of the tna operon in combination with riboswitch like elements responding to the physicochemical conditions of the cell. However, as they had limited prior experience with modeling of biological networks, they were unsure as how to proceed with the synthesis of reaction rate equations for a quantitative description of the gene expression dynamics. Coincidentally, we had just finished a similar analysis of our project and all parties collectively agreed that we would attempt to model their system. After a few",TRUE,SVCE_CHENNAI,"Advice, Work",Chunk incomplete - hints at working together,,Check
SUSTech_Shenzhen,2018,", teams from the mainland of China, Taiwan and Japan had a great experience.
During the time in NCHU, we presented our idea to several teams and professors. We included the background of our double-emulsion system, the experiment, the modeling and the human practices in a way similar to what we will be doing at the Giant Jamboree. Professors inquired us of our double emulsion rate and how our modeling exactly works, which was extremely informative to us.
When it was our turn to be the audience, we got inspirations from several teams, especially two teams from Taipei. They used self-made icons and animations to substitute traditional PPTs. Through their presentation, they presented their ideas similar to telling a story rather than simply reporting the project, and we were amazed by the simplicity and integrity they had and modified our presentation methods after we got back.
CCiC Conference
Thanks to team Shanghai_tech this year, our team got the opportunity to attend the 2018 CCiC Conference held in Shanghai, from August 24th—August 31st
We presented our project at CCiC, and we are grateful to the iGEMers that had given suggestions on our presenting methods. They pointed out that although we have done a lot of work, much of which sounded somewhat irrelevant to synthetic biology. We appreciate their suggestions and have made corrections on our presentation and poster to make them more clear and logical.
We are also grateful to Shanghai tech for providing the chance of a special face-to-face Q&A session in the evenings during CCiC. It was then when we encountered and discussed not only our own projects but what we had learned and what we hope for iGEM with professors from the iGEM committee.
We also had a conversation with Dr.Zhang Haoqian from Langene technology company. We discussed over how and what to do to improve the public’s understanding of biological concepts and the questions involved in our CCC project as well. We also mentioned our wish to hold the 2019 CCiC Conference so that we could also provide such a brilliant opportunity for iGEMers to communicate.

Aachen,2016," the cells. Image was taken with the help of the fluorescence microscope.
In our work we built an expression system for the iGEM Team Technion from Israel containing a Tar receptor-GFP fusion protein. In contrast to the iGEM Team in Israel we decided in agreement with their team members to test the expression without putting any linker between the two components. Thereby, we wanted to test the influence of a linker and try the possibility of working without any linker.
We can confirm that a missing linker between the two proteins could cause a weak GFP signal or a misfolded protein, which makes a localization of the Tar receptor impossible. In most of the cases the fluorescence signal was detectable in the cytosol, which indicates that the Tar-GFP protein did not fold in the right way to localize in the membrane. But we can also see that our expression system in general worked, because we were able to detect the fluorescence at the poles of some cells.
Because of our work the iGEM Team Technion knew that working without any linker could result in native folded proteins but is not the best option for secure results in their further project. The linker could still play an important role in the folding process of the Tar receptor and therefore influences the position of the Tar receptor in the membrane of E. coli .
All in all, we showed that detection and correct location of the fused proteins could be possible even without linker. However, the rate of positively measured fluorescence in the requested/desired location in the poles of E. coli was very low, which illustrates the importance of a linker between both proteins. With this work we could help the iGEM Team Technion finding the right focus of their problem by trying a different way of expression for them.
iGEM Team Technion Israel for iGEM Team Aachen
The first approach of the iGEM Team Technion to help us was to model the incorporation of the non-canonical amino acid DMNB-serine in the active site of subtilisin E. As this did not work out as expected, they helped us to confirm the idea of theoretical inactivation by talking to several experts in their university. Based on the native structure of subtilisin E and the structure of the used non-canonical amino acid, they all agreed on the prosperity of that method. So we had an independent opinion about our project idea and were assured in following this theory once again. Moreover they gave us some useful hints on how the modelling of our protein had worked out and which parameters are needed to model the effects of the incoporation of our amino acid DMNB-serine.

Prof. Dekker as a pioneer in biophysics gave us a glimpse into his research on synthetic biology. We were really excited to see the extent of possibilities that exist nowadays.
Dr. Stemmering was a positive boost to our fading belief in the usage of our project. We thought that the introduction of our genetically-modified yeast in other countries or cultures would     be difficult, if not impossible. In his presentation, he assured us that a GMO which is helpful and solves a problem would be accepted in other cultures as well.
Prof. Murphy brought to us to the idea of using data in a much better way, and how to try to connect the information technology creating gigantic throughputs of data with actual results      that can be used. For us as young researchers, the work with these new data technologies is of extreme importance.
After the presentations and a great meal, we met up for a poster presentation from every attending team. This was by far the best opportunity to spark up collaborations with other      teams. Through this poster presentation we finally got the idea that we could make an awesome Wet Lab collaboration with the iGEM Team Cologne/Duesseldorf.
Delft was all about making new friends, contacts and collaborations as well as just thriving on the awesome iGEM spirit. So all in all it was a really great experience.

Stockholm,2018," To serve our great interest in public engagement and education, we came up with the idea of hosting a panel discussion. The event was called ""Limits of Life” and aimed to tackle two essential aspects within the field of synthetic biology; the limits of scientist health & well-being, and the limits of biohacking. For this event, iGEM Lund was also involved in planning and executing the event. The event was a success, and it was able to captivate people from all educational backgrounds, even people who studied humanities.

Besides sharing an interest in solving the rising problems in water purification, we noticed that our Human Practices outreach strategies focused on bringing the fun of synthetic biology to children. iGEM Warwick helped us to distribute our children’s book on several events in the UK. Furthermore, we created a "" Synbio for Kids Guide "" to give future iGEM teams a supportive booklet at hand, filled with tools and strategies in how to teach synthetic biology to children. Together, we hope to not only spread the word of synthetic biology to young future aspiring scientists but also joy through our iGEM meme collaboration. Recently we made a Facebook group open for Jamboree participants, a place to unleash our creativity and share our love for memes. This we believe will also give people the opportunity to meet before the Jamboree, and help us feel more relaxed during the competition.

Exeter,2016," (Nagasaka and Nagashima 1981) and thus can be described by the equation:      $$ \lambda = \frac{Q}{4\pi\Delta T}\ \ln{(t)}$$ where $Q$ is the power per unit length of the wire,      $Q = \frac{(I \times V)}{Length}$, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature over time $t$.
We found the thermal conductivity of LB and M9 to be similar to that of water,    at 605 $\pm$ 20 $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$ and 570 $\pm$ 30 $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$ respectively.   A linear fit of a $T$ vs. $ln(t)$ plot following only the reading from the liquid medium thermocouple      will yield the conductivity (Fig. 2).

The Purdue team, for part of their human practices, aimed to create a user friendly database of past iGEM projects, making it easier for future iGEM teams to search through relevant projects and develop their own ideas. Through a series of Skype calls, we were able to set up a collaboration between our two teams. We would be writing summaries for Purdue’s database, and in return, Purdue would run a continuous culture of a kill switch and send us the resulting data.
Our team helped Purdue with this by logging data for the 46 iGEM projects, and critiquing ease of use and effectiveness of the database.  Purdue told us we were instrumental in getting up the 2015 section of their database due to our contributions to writing up the project summaries.
For each team we produced a description of what their project was about (including anything that was particularly notable about the project), the project track, the number of team members, the chassis used (if relevant), any research benchmarks, a list of submitted parts with part numbers, descriptions and links, the medal achieved, and any awards and nominations.

Figure 1 shows nalidixic acid induces all MT promoters, albeit MT1 and MT2 most strongly. Interestingly, induction via nalidixic acid appears to be 50% stronger than H2O2, a chemical commonly used to induce cellular stress (Figure 2).
This data shows that over the concentrations we tested, nalidixic acid has the potential to cause cellular stress to both bacteria and mammals, an interesting result especially due to nalidixic acid’s pharmaceutical uses. Further testing, using additional and/or therapeutically relevant concentrations are necessary to follow up on this result.

Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Trinity - towards an engineered co-culture toolbox
Abtract
Co-cultures are found in all conceivable entities, such as the human gut, cheese or plants, but good tools to study those communities are currently not given. Indeed we created a modularly built toolbox using not only three different dependencies but also three different organisms: With Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Synechococcus elongatus our team engineered a system based on nutrient exchange. Here phosphate is provided through oxidation of phosphite, nitrogen source produced by melamine breakdown, whilst carbon source is provided by Synechococcus elongatus. Two additional independent approaches are designed, too. The first includes regulation via cross-feeding by amino acid auxotrophies and production: lysine by Escherichia coli and leucine by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The other utilizes regulated self-lysis via quorum sensing molecules, to control cell density by a phage lysis gene. This engineered toolbox opens a wide range of possibilities to create microbial communities for different purposes, such as synthetic probiotics.

Trinity - towards an engineered co-culture toolbox
Abtract
Co-cultures are found in all conceivable entities, such as the human gut, cheese or plants, but good tools to study those communities are currently not given. Indeed we created a modularly built toolbox using not only three different dependencies but also three different organisms: With Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Synechococcus elongatus our team engineered a system based on nutrient exchange. Here phosphate is provided through oxidation of phosphite, nitrogen source produced by melamine breakdown, whilst carbon source is provided by Synechococcus elongatus. Two additional independent approaches are designed, too. The first includes regulation via cross-feeding by amino acid auxotrophies and production: lysine by Escherichia coli and leucine by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The other utilizes regulated self-lysis via quorum sensing molecules, to control cell density by a phage lysis gene. This engineered toolbox opens a wide range of possibilities to create microbial communities for different purposes, such as synthetic probiotics.

Participation in iGEM Japan
iGEM Japan is an alliance of Japanese iGEM teams conceived as a platform for enhancing communication and cooperation between teams, as well as collectively promoting iGEM in Japan. We participated in several meetings to discuss the direction, membership and activities of this group. Two of iGEM Japan's major activities this year were the iGEM Japan Meet-up and a comprehensive, nation-wide Human Practices survey. Please look at the result for further information.
Attributions & Acknowledgements
We take pride in the fact that all experimental work - part design, construction and testing - were done by ourselves, without relying on outside help. However, directly or indirectly our project has benefited from help from the following parties:
Professor Muranaka and all the members of Cell Tech Lab at Osaka University for lending us lab space and putting up with our intrusion
Issay Narumi of Ion Beam Mutagenesis Research Group at Japan Atomic Energy Agency for supplying us with D.radiodurans genomic DNA as well as helpful information and invaluable advice concerning the RecA promoter, etc

William_and_Mary,2015," the impact of specific archaeal RBSes in protein expression. Since there is little existing framework for archaeal work, the collaboration effort promoted the utilization of methanogenic archaea or methanogens as a potential substitute host for situations when E. coli is not the logical choice. The study could lay the framework for a new archaea-based InterLab Study modeled after the existent iGEM-sponsored E. Coli InterLab Study. The team imaged 29 samples for the UGA iGEM team and recorded fluorescence measurements for the samples. Data was reported to the UGA iGEM team.
Collaboration With Cambridge-JIC
Cambridge-JIC iGEM 2015 is working on Project OpenScope, an initiative to create a 3d-printable programmable digital microscope. Upon request, we provided them with replicates of fluorescent constructs which we created for the Interlab Measurement Study (J23106 + I13504 and J23117 + I13504). They wanted green fluorescent samples with which to test the imaging capabilities of their microscope and the collaboration allowed us the opportunity to confirm that our some of our InterLab constructs were actually fluorescing as they should. Cambridge was successful in visualizing the fluorescent constructs and sent us images.

3. Unsolved ethics: Is your project suitable for supervillains? In this workshop the participants could discuss the ethical impacts of their projects and reflect on additional steps which could be taken to make their ideas more acceptable by the general public.
4. Funding the fun: The road to Boston In this workshop the participants could discuss how they went about to making the journey to Boston possible. Some important questions that were discussed included the amount of money required, the type of sponsorship obtained from companies and how to approach them in the best way.
5. After iGEM: Unexpected applications In this workshop the discussion focused on how to make the projects available to the community and also if they could have any additional applications other that what the teams had already thought of.
The workshops were divided into two sessions of 1 hour each, and the participants got to sign up for the two workshops that they found to be the most interesting. This part of the NiC was very well thought out and provided many interesting ideas on improvements that can be made, both for the teams and on the iGEM management’s side of things.
Following the workshops, the prestigious prize ceremony was held, announcing the winner of the all-time first Nordic iGEM Conference. Our congratulations go to the Stockholm iGEM team who managed to claim the Golden Pipette. After an amazing dinner, it was time for the Bar Crawl. This was a really fun opportunity to get to forge deeper connections in a relaxed setting and at the same time discover the beauty of the Uppsala University nations. The Bar Crawl was a great ending to an amazing day, which had been full of new experiences and meetings with really wonderful people.
The last day all of the participants could take it easy and enjoy a sightseeing tour of the town of Uppsala. The NiC ended at midday and it was time to say goodbye to all the people and new friends we had met during the weekend. We want to thank Uppsala and Stockholm for a really great event as well as all the other teams who attended for being awesome. We hope that NiC go on to become an annual event and we look forward to seeing you all in Boston.

iGEM Work Environment Evaluation
As a part of our subproject with the booklet , this year's human practice group have created a form to evaluate the work environment in the iGEM competition. In order to get as many representative answers possible, we posted the evaluation form on the iGEM collaboration page and on the iGEM community page to be able to let iGEMers worldwide answer our questions. Several teams chose to collaborate with us by filling in the form and we could not have completed the evaluation without their answers. This gave us valuable content for the booklet and a broader perspective of how extensive the problem of burning out is for iGEM participants. However, we want to continue this investigation and would be thankful if even more teams would like to answer this survey . Help us build a better iGEM environment!

We Helped Five other iGEM teams
1. UGA-Georgia iGEM Team
We helped the UGA-Georgia iGEM Team by characterizing their mCherry-based reporter system
The Genspace iGEM team helped the University of Georgia iGEM Team by participating in the Archaeal InterLab Study to further characterize the reproducibility of their mCherry reporter system. We received frozen  cell lysates from them and followed the protocol below to develop the mCherry RFP overnight with shaking at 30C. The samples were then read in a plate reader with an excitation wavelength of  590nm and an emission wavelength of 645nm. The data were submitted to the UGA-Georgia team via their data submission form. A table of the data is presented below.
Here is the UGA Archaeal Collaboration Study Protocol:
As soon as you receive your samples in the mail, place them in a freezer (-80C) in order to reduce potential protein damages that may incur from freezing and thawing.
We recommend that you place your samples in the freezer and take time to read over our protocol as well as prepare  your plan of action.
You have been given 30 total samples, (i.e., triplicate cell extracts obtained from 10 colonies, and please stay in accordance with our labels throughout your experiment.)
&nbsp
Each sample contains 10 ul of cell extracts. The buffer used is 25 mM PIPES pH 6.8. The PIPES should act as a negative control in your experiment. If PIPES is not available, a buffer with the same pH may be sufficient.
Remove samples from the freezer and place in a shaker at 30C for overnight incubation. (This step is necessary because our cells are grown anaerobically but the fluorophore of mCherry fluorescent protein requires sufficient oxygen exposure for maturation.)
Using “8B” determine the linear range for your measurement device.
We recorded the highest fluorescence from sample “8B,” so if this is found to be in the linear range, then all the other samples will be as well.
Our device required a 200 ul sample, so",TRUE,UGA-Georgia,Work,Genspace participated in an interlab study where they replicated the system of UGA and shared the results with them. Conflict if it is work or 2-way material transfer,st,Check

USTC-Software
UTSC-Software has been one of our traditional collabrators. Focusing on the establishment and improvement of a online synthetic biology community this year, we, as potential users of their bio-hub, provided our opinions and needs in application design and homepage design. For example, we suggested adding an online forum named ""iGEMers' Notebook"" in which iGEMers can exchange important information and ideas concerning this competition. We also helped them with biological problems they came across, such as the biological background of comparative sequence analysis. UTSC-Software shared with us some useful tricks and their experience in website making and modeling, which helped speed up our work.
ShanghaiTech
Last year, team ShanghaiTech used CdS nanoparticles to utilize light energy. This year, coincidently, we also need to use CdS nanoparticles to generate electrons for photosynthesis. To have a positive control in our experiments, we use this CdS quantum dots to play the role of light catalyzer, proving that our concept can function as we expected. In addition, we also help them to make a further validation of the CdS quantum dots’s  function and improve the characterization of the CdS quantum dots. Link in ShanghaiTech University's Wiki
NPU-China
For team NPU-China this year, they have a complex metabolism pathway to realize their goal—— synthesize as much DHAP as possible. To optimize the system, they want to adjust the ratio of two enzymes they use for DHAP synthesis. But to find out the best ratio of these two enzymes’ expression and the proper promotor or RBS we need to use, we need to model this metabolism pathway. This is where our team USTC put our efforts into. We help them to model this complex pathway and valid their project’s feasibility.

Collaboration with NJU-CHINA
Our team helped the NJU_CHINA team design two sequence of BCL2-siRNA(siRNA 3 and 4 ).
The sequences are as follows:
As soon as these siRNAs have been designed, NJU_CHINA sent the sequences of them to us. We synthesized these siRNAs for them and tested the gene silencing effect of these four sequences. The result showed it is the BCL2 siRNA-2 that has the best effect.
The NJU_CHINA team helped us to detect the expression level of Myc-CAR-CD20 and IL-17RA-SynNotch with Western blot. Flag-FOXP3-Jurkat cells expressed the proteins after transfection by electroporation. The result is shown in the figure. They also provided us with human IL-17RA antibodies.
According to the figure, we confirmed that the electroporation was successful and thus we were able to continue our experiments. We would like to thank the NJU-CHINA team for the great help for our experiments and for the provision of IL-17RA antibodies.",TRUE,NJU-CHINA,Work,NJU shared material which CPU tested and shared the results back with them.

SoCal Meetup 2018
We organized a meet up in July that Team UC San Diego, Team Tec-Monterrey, and Team UC Davis attended. At the meet up, each team presented their project progress and received feedback from the other teams. Through this meet up, we were able to provide opportunities to troubleshoot, exchange contact information for future potential collaborations, and discuss with the North America iGEM Ambassador, Amy Chen.
Team UC San Diego
Team UC San Diego presented their project on an easily accessible cancer detection test. The main input they wanted related to their team logo. Through this meet up, UCSD was able to share information with UCD due to the shared project focus on biosensors.
Team Tec-Monterrey
Team Team-Monterrey presented their project on a proposed bacteria database. Because the team representatives were more focused on the collaborative aspect of  their project, the other teams were able to help them further understand the lab and research components. Team Tec-Monterrey was able to share their extensive lists of collaborations and the importance of their integrated practices. Team Tec-Monterrey collected water samples from various water sources in their region to test for chemicals, and educated people to spread awareness. After hearing about their integrated practices, we provided them with water samples from San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant. In turn, we based our Collaboration Post on this interaction to collect data on where our toxicant is prevalent globally. We were also inspired by their integrated practices to participate in a beach cleanup day where we shared our research with fellow volunteers.
Team UC Davis
Team UC Davis presented their project via Skype on physiological effects of toxins on Mammalian cells. Through this meet up, UCD was able to share information with UCSD  due to the shared biosensor topic between their projects.

NEU-China,2016,"asmid into Bl21 strain in 3 50ml centrifuge tubes respectively.
Cultured at LB liquid medium with ampicillin antibiotic. Induced time was set as 4h, 8h, 16h.
Ultrasonication in the protein lysis buffer.
Reserved the supernatant after centrifuging.
SDS-page electrophoresis.
Coomassie blue staining after times of washing
We could see from the below picture (Figure 1) that the quantity of the expression protein was increasing with the time increasing. Concerning the obvious death of bacteria beyond 16h culturing, we recommend NEFU-China to induce the protein around 16h.
Figure 1
In order to compare with the control apparently, we contrasted the 16h induced protein and not induced protein. The result we got was illustrated as below (Figure 2) . We put these results together and send to NEFU-China, hoping what we did would helped them.
Figure 2
we also asked NEFU-China to help us detect the function of a plasmid which could express GFP. That really saved us amount of time. The final effect was pretty good, we had build a closely cooperation relationship! Both of each sides were looking forward another collaboration!
Abstract:
To exchange ideas with others, to cooperate with each other, you can broaden their thinking, improve the efficiency of the experiment. We hope to have more opportunities to contact the team around the world, we suggest that the headquarters could establish a more convenient platform for the communication among iGEMers, not confined to their own country. Because of the limited time, we have not been able to try more cooperation, but we cherish the friendship with the above team. We all learned from the collaboration that: help each other and make progress together!

Collaboration connecting Theory and Experiment
This year our iGEM team established a transatlantic collaboration with the iGEM team 2016 from Lethbridge , Canada. Our joined attempt was to determine the evolutionary stability of kill switches from both, theoretical and experimental side. While we were contributing the theoretical modeling part, our colleagues in Canada worked on the experimental evidence of our drylab predictions. We worked on suitable experiment design for their hands-on part together. To help them out we had also the necessary genes for the MazF kill switch synthesized and shipped. Figures 1 and 2 show experimental work with the BNU China 2014 kill switch: Before applying UV light, the kill switch works and kill the cells reliably (figure 1). However, after application of UV light that mutates the cells, the kill switch is destroyed and genetically modified cells survive the escape into wild life conditions (figure 2). This emphasizes the danger of evolutionary unstable kill switches. Further details on their procedure can be found on their wiki .
Figure 1. Cell cultures with implemented BNU China 2014 kill switch before exposure to UV light. The working                 kill switch ensures cell death once released into wild life conditions.
Figure 2. Cell cultures with implemented BNU China 2014 kill switch after exposure to UV light. The kill switch has been destroyed through mutations and cells survive release into wild life conditions.

Imperial College London
Thanks to our presence in the Young Synthetic Biologist 2.0 meeting held in London we were able to create contacts with other teams from the UK.  Both the Imperial College London team’s project (link to their wiki https://2014.igem.org/Team:Imperial) and ours had as goal water filtration and we both had focused our efforts in using phytochelatins as mechanism for metal ion chelation.
Although in early stages of the development of ECOCadmus we considered using synthetic phytochelatins we had to discard this idea because of the difficulties synthesising parts of high repetitive sequence.
The Imperial College London team however was able to obtain synthetic phytochelatins and they also created phytochelatins with cellulose binding domains at the N- or C- terminus.  The University of York iGEM team will help to characterise their parts using Cadmium since they had no access to it.

The most important documents related to GMMs are concerned with biosafety, food, trade and production processes. In places such as India, European Union, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, there are many different laws regulating each of these issues. On the other hand, Korea, Indonesia, and Australia have only one or two laws governing all these issues.
Intra-Provincial Collaboration: Alberta Strong
This iGEM season the UAlberta Team participated in a province-wide collaboration by hosting the Alberta iGEM Meeting, called aGEM, for all the Alberta iGEM teams this September. At aGEM, teams were able to present their progress on their projects and get valuable feedback from previous and current iGEM judges. There was also a free-for-all session that enabled teams to get together, discuss issues and solicit suggestions regarding different aspects of the project (e.g., wetlab, fundraising, human practices). In addition, we also submitted monthly updates documenting Team UAlberta’s adventures to a monthly newsletter assembled by UCalgary.

NCTU iGEM Conference
Three of our members joined the International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference at National Chiao Tung University from July 19th to 23rd 2015. As a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, it was an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology. And we received questions and precious suggestions from other participants after presentation and poster time, which turned out to better improve our project design :
Will L. casei secret too many CPP-PYY complexes and cause people unwilling to eat for a long term of time, which might cause malnutrition?
Will your product affect the sensitivity of hypothalamus to PYY? And is there a safety maximum concentration of PYY in blood?
How do you measure the concentration of PYY in blood?
How long will your product stay in human body?
When should people take the capsule? Before or after meal? And how many times should people take the capsule a day?
How do you measure the concentration of PYY in blood?
Can gastrointestinal tract digest CPP-PYY complex before it gets through intestinal membrane?
Question from TCU: Why not use a patch instead?
Suggestion from ZJU-China:
(1) We suggest you change the suicide mechanism, because there’s only one promoter before the gene circuit of CPP-PYY and CI. This might cause L. casei die before it works.
(2) Will holin and endolysin in the suicide mechanism harm other cells? Why not change suicide mechanism into quorum sensing?
What is your product’s positioning? Is it used as food or as medicine?
As we know, L. casei is prokaryote. Can your CPP-PYY complex fold correctly through L. casei?
Will patients be hungrier after they stop taking capsule?
Will immune response arouse by CPP-PYY complex?
Is there any chance that plasmid transfer to other cells and affect the colony in intestine?
Is pLP825 too small for the three parts of genes to fit in?

UCAS,2017,". Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.

University of Waterloo We provided cloning expertise to their wet lab team, to help specifically with primer design. Our figure can be found here . We filled out their survey which was sent around to see if 3D printing could be used as a cost-effective way to make lab equipment. They welcomed us into their lab space and created an open area to discuss the details of our projects currently, and in the future. They gave us priceless training in the building of functional metagenomic libraries and told us about the magic cloning helper Guanosine. University of Toronto We answered questions about our iGEM team over skype to help them create a podcast series on iGEM. They filled out an in-depth questionnaire on science communication to help us get insight from a young group of scientists. University of Calgary/Canadian iGEM We provided the University of Calgary iGEM team a two-page summary of our work for their monthly newsletter in August, September, October, and November.

Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.
Which other teams can we work with?
You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration silver medal criterion.
In order to meet the silver medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.
Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:
Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device
Characterize another team's part
Debug a construct
Model or simulating another team's system
Test another team's software
Help build and test another team's hardware project
Mentor a high-school team",FALSE,,,,,

We have been all up in our own project lately so it is nice that someone came and burst that bubble for us.  The hunt for a microphone has been an adventure during the summer! During the spring we had the profit of using a microphone at Mjärdevi Creactive here in Linköping. Mjärdevi Creactive is a place where students can sit and study and they always have coffee available. Practically a dream for everyone with a severe caffeine dependence. But now, during the summer, we had to find another solution. Thanks to one of our teammates that sometimes is lost in the world of gaming and likes to record music, we found a solution to our problem.
We could not be happier with the result, since we sound no stupider than we normally do!

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.
Results

This year, NYMU-Taipei 2017 has been collaborating with iGEM teams from all over the world!
(1) Taiwanese Universities
Chung Cheng University (CCU Taiwan)-Experimental Help
We introduced iGem members of CCU Taiwan to running Fusion PCR through webcam. We taught them the principle of Fusion PCR while sharing our experience and reminding them of some precautions of running Fusion PCR. On the other hand, they helped us characterize our suicide mechanism and sent us the functional test results.
Chung Shan Medical University (CSMU NCHU Taiwan)-Team Establishment
NYMU-Taipei assisted CSMU NCHU Taiwan to establish their iGEM team. We gave them advice about how to form a successful iGEM team and gave them a brief overview of the competition rules.
Chang Gung University (CGU Taiwan)-Education
This year, NYMU focuses on the Energy track, and CGU Taiwan focuses on the Environment track. In August, NYMU Taipei collaborated with CGU Taiwan in Wego Bilingual High School education. Through presenting different dimension of global crisis, we believe that these kids could be more acquainted with iGEM.
(2) High School
Taipei American School (TAS Taipei)-Experimental Help
NYMU this year collaborated with TAS Taipei, and they helped us with suicide mechanism functional test. Their test results make us more certain that our suicide mechanism is reliable, so our project is without biosafety concern as well. Moreover, we also educated Taipei American School how to conduct site-directed mutagenesis and assay biofilm production, which is also a great progress to their project",TRUE,CCU_Taiwan,Work,CCU characterised parts of NYMU and shared results,ts,

This year, we collaborated with Canmore. Our goals was to get the opinion of another team in order to get an impartial and unbiased analysis of each others projects. We wanted to get another opinion on the usefulness of our biobrick along with any concerns about practicality or safety. Below are the write ups down by both teams.
Canmore:
Canmore’s project deals primarily with the issue of hair and feather build up in the water treatment systems. This is clearly a major issue and can use extensive amounts of money and time to remedy. There is an extreme amount of inconvenience to unclog the water treatment systems once they get to this point. Creating a BioBrick to produce keratinases could be an effective and cheap solution to the problem and also in preventing the problem.
Our concerns for Canmore lie in the prototype and safety. The specific engineering and prototyping of a bioreactor is extremely important. The conditions required to keep the bacteria alive, the amount of keratinases that would need to be produced, and the length of time this process will take are all aspects to look into when designing the bioreactor. Their plan to use the membrane bioreactor is a very good and easily applicable idea but the research as to optimum conditions concerning the production of the gene is incredibly important. Having a viable analysis of the cost, time and resources required to make this something we can implement is society is also an important consideration. The time frame of how long it takes to break down the keratin is also something to look into. The comparison of the time requirements to break down other pollutants in the bioreactor chamber compared with the time to break down keratin. Knowing this will allow a design maximizing potential.
Other thoughts for them to consider include: what types of bacteria are already being used in the bioreactor? What are they breaking down? Is there a way to genetically modify bacteria already in use to contain the kera or karus gene? This would eliminate the need to introduce another species and readjust conditions while allowing maximum productivity.  Overall, I believe this project could introduce a valid and much needed solution to the issue of hair build up and could be quite effective, quick and safe. As the bioreactor is not connected to the main water line and is completely contained, contamination of water with E. coli would not be an issue. The proposed prototype",TRUE,OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,Advice,Get each others' opinion?,"st,ts",

Thanks to these various collaborations, our project grew in depth and scope, putting the importance of relationships at the forefront.

Our team finished the inter-lab with the ASTWS-China and WorldShaper-XSHS. In this inter-lab activity, they gave us some really effective help. For instance, they provided substrates to us in the case that we did not make enough substrates, which helps us save time in the experiment. In return, we assisted some materials to WorldShaper-XSHS. After the Inter-lab experiment, we exchanged our data with the other teams, which made the data more accurate.Furthermore, because of laboratory located the same building with ZJU-China in July then we moved to another building which ASTWS-China and Worldshaper-XSHS located in August, we have many collaboration for the project experiments, such as discussion on difficult technique problem or lent experimental materials.
Picture1: The group photo of representatives from 6 IGEM team and an official from Zhejiang Science Museum.
Different from the last HP, which had been held by only high school teams, this time we were co-operating with three college teams to organize the activity. As we have known the basic procedure and organization form of this activity from the experience of the past HP, our team members gave a lot of useful suggestions on the online meeting, including how to teach kids about synthetic biology and some advice about game rules.
Picture2: Our group members are showing participants how to play the game we prepared.
Through this activity, we learned a lot of skills and knowledge because of the participation of those college teams. Haosen Hong, the leader of IGEM team from Zhejiang University really worked hard for the activity: from the way of attracting participants to purchasing materials for HP to the revision of our team’s PPT, he helped us a lot in the process. We felt lucky that we could cooperate with those college teams. With this special lesson, we will be more enthusiastic about communicating with other teams in the future cooperations to broaden the outlooks.

Dear fellow iGEMers,
As some of you may already know, Vine is a new app that takes 6 second videos and has been trending all around the world for the past month. You take a vine video from your phone and upload it directly to a twitter account (such as VINEiGEM2013). They get REALLY creative!
Seeing as there are roughly 200 teams competing in iGEM this year, we figured it would be an awesome idea to try to compile all the projects and biobricks in as little time as possible. We want to challenge you to describe your project and biobricks in 6 seconds using as many creative tricks, backgrounds and costumes as possible. You only have 6 seconds, so MAKE IT COUNT!!!! We believe this will help iGEM teams to get a glimpse of what is happening around the world and compile a quick way to look through the available parts.
Here are the steps to uploading your vines:
Download Vine app on your smartphone (it is free)
Follow the introduction steps to create your video(s)
When finished, publish it to the twitter account:

TU-Eindhoven,2018," and centrifuging. This was necessary to remove as much salt as possible to prepare for the electroporation. After that the protocol would exactly follow the Cell Measurement Protocol from the iGEM Interlab Study. Afterwards electroporation was used for transformation instead of heatshock. However, when we were preparing the high OD600 stocks something went wrong when centrifuging and washing. We tried to get the required OD600 of 16, however we did not have enough volume and bacteria to further concentrate and got stuck at an OD600 of 11 with only little volume left. Evaluating to iGEM Marburg we told them what we thought went wrong. Unfortunately we were only sent a set of chemicals for one try of their Interlab Study and therefore we were not able to complete their Vibrio natriegens interlab.
Dutch Mini Jamboree
On Friday the 19th of October, iGEM Eindhoven hosted the Dutch Mini Jamboree. This was an event to practice for the real deal in Boston a week later. All of the six Dutch iGEM teams (Delft, Utrecht, Leiden, Rotterdam, Groningen and Eindhoven) came to Eindhoven University of Technology to present their project and have a final practice session with all of the teams. It started with a poster session followed by a lunch. After lunch, the presentations started. These presentations were performed in front of four experienced judges. This jury consisted of Will Wright (European iGEM Ambassador), Pieter van Boheemen (Dutch Institute for Public Health and Environment), Maaruthy Yelleswarapu (PhD in Nijmegen, has previous iGEM experience) and Bob van Sluijs (1st runner up overgrad in 2014 with Wageningen RU). These judges gave feedback to the teams so that details could be finalized to give the best possible presentation in Boston. Also, feedback on posters was provided. The event was concluded with an ‘’After iGEM’’ talk by Will Wright. After that, we had dinner with pizza and we went to the bar of our study association for some fun and drinks.

Valencia_UPV,2018," team has been working on the development of a new biomaterial to speed up the healing in bone injures. This biomaterial called C-lastine, is based on the cross-linking of bacterial cellulose and the fusion protein CBD cipA-BMP2. This cross-linking is mediated by a carbohydrate binding domain (CBD cipA) while the osteogenic activity by a potent osteoblasts differentiation inducer (BMP2). To achieve this objective they are using E.Coli as a biofactory, specifically BL21(DE3) strain which is resistant to some toxic proteins such as cellulose synthase operon protein D, codified by gene bcsD and responsible of pore formation in the membrane allowing cellulose to exit the cell. The final result is a bandage matrix that can be applied to the wound during a surgical intervention.
Collaboration
If we think about it, Printeria is a kind of biofactory so, we thought that trying to make Ecuador's team biomaterial in Printeria would be a good trial to show that Printeria is ready to become something greater in the biotechnological industry and why not, it could be used in hospitals as well. However, due to the fact that there were problems with the size of the parts for Golden Gate and with the customs, it could not become a reality. This idea would be developed with Imperial College. Instead, we did several things.
We did a survey to get some feedback from the potential users of both projects. It consisted in a video in spanish and then a survey to fill out. In our case, the survey was made to know what do users think about Printeria and synthetic biology. In any case this survey represents the collective of users (only 15 people were surveyed) it was just made to have an idea. Here you can download the results of both surveys:

Valencia_UPV,2018," team has been working on the development of a new biomaterial to speed up the healing in bone injures. This biomaterial called C-lastine, is based on the cross-linking of bacterial cellulose and the fusion protein CBD cipA-BMP2. This cross-linking is mediated by a carbohydrate binding domain (CBD cipA) while the osteogenic activity by a potent osteoblasts differentiation inducer (BMP2). To achieve this objective they are using E.Coli as a biofactory, specifically BL21(DE3) strain which is resistant to some toxic proteins such as cellulose synthase operon protein D, codified by gene bcsD and responsible of pore formation in the membrane allowing cellulose to exit the cell. The final result is a bandage matrix that can be applied to the wound during a surgical intervention.
Collaboration
If we think about it, Printeria is a kind of biofactory so, we thought that trying to make Ecuador's team biomaterial in Printeria would be a good trial to show that Printeria is ready to become something greater in the biotechnological industry and why not, it could be used in hospitals as well. However, due to the fact that there were problems with the size of the parts for Golden Gate and with the customs, it could not become a reality. This idea would be developed with Imperial College. Instead, we did several things.
We did a survey to get some feedback from the potential users of both projects. It consisted in a video in spanish and then a survey to fill out. In our case, the survey was made to know what do users think about Printeria and synthetic biology. In any case this survey represents the collective of users (only 15 people were surveyed) it was just made to have an idea. Here you can download the results of both surveys:

Furthermore we provide them with a special strain called BL21(DE3). This was really important for them due to the fact that without it, they could not continue with their iGEM project.

Do you know that there is something that grows faster than a common E.Coli? If it grows faster... why not use it as a chassis to do pharmaceuticals and chemicals in the industry? This is the fantastic idea that Marburg team has developed. They want to demonstrate that working with V.natriegens is cheaper, faster and possible with todays methods.

After this four-day event, we learn a lot from these Asia iGEM teams and knew that we still have much room for improvement in our presentation skills and poster design.
Domestic team collaborations, we collaborate with Taiwan university teams. We mentor Chung Cheng University through teaching Fusion PCR. Besides, they conduct experiment to ensure our suicide mechanism. Inviting Chang Gung University during Asia Pacific Conference, we host education in Wego senior high school together.
Chung Cheng University
Last year, NYMU team helped students from National Chung Cheng University form their own iGEM team. Excitedly, they will participate iGEM competition this year as team name “CCU_Taiwan” and share their project with all iGEMers on stage in the Giant Jamboree.During the 2017 iGEM Taiwan Conference and the 5th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference, we have a wonderful time discussing on each teams’ project and give each both team suggestions for further improvement. We just build strong bond with them and look forward to their results this year at Giant Jamboree!
Mentor about the fusion PCR
After the team meet-up, we showed them how the Photo-Bioreactor functions, taught them how to run Fusion PCR through webcam, and inform them of team operations and matters.The following links were videos of the process of NYMU team taught CCU team how to work on Fusion PCR. It was quite interesting and educational.
Assit our characterization of suicide system
On the other hand, CCU team help us characterize Holin- Endolysin- NrtA system ( BBa_K2350021 ), the so-called “suicide system”, and measure the growth curve of Escherichia coli DH5α, by adding lactose to induce kill-switch mechanism, in order to determine whether the system works and ensure the biosafety of our project. With their assistance, we can verify that E.coli significantly decrease in several hours, after kill-switch functioned in different lactose concentrations.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Tsinghua July 19th, 2016
On July 23th, we went to Tsinghua University with our questions and initial ideas to communicate with the members of Tsinghua team. They helped us solve the problems and taught us more about iGEM and genetic biology. Then we discussed the ideas and programs of the iGEM teams a few years ago. This communication helped us build up a clearer understanding of synthetic biology and iGEM.
 
BIT-China July 23th, 2016
In the middle of July, We visited the iGEM team of BIT-China. They showed us the programs they made in the past two years, shared with us the difficulties and challenges they met and the ways for them to solve the problems. They also guided us on the designing and making of wiki.
Through exchange with the seniors, we got a more profound understanding of genetic engineering, which helped us to form a more reasonable and practical project.
 
 
BNDS-China
On October 2nd，2016, some members of BNDS-China visited us  to exchange their work with ours. Both of the teams presented their ideas, experiments, and results. Through this discussion, we got to know about their amazing idea and were enlightened by some of their suggestions. Meanwhile, we also gave them some advice  and showed them some good aspects of our project. To communicate with the high-school team made us understand iGEM even more deeply, helped us to check our shortcomings and improve our results.

Collaborations
Collaborations are crucial in iGEM and in scientific research in general. Sharing ideas and experiences with other teams can be of great help for improving the respective projects. Also, iGEM teams collaborate on human practices, joining their ideas to bring synthetic biology closer to the general public. During our iGEM journey we had the chance to collaborate with several teams from around the world.

As last year the first-ever Estonian team had collaborated with Aalto-Helsinki team, we were glad to be contacted by this year’s team and continue the tradition. Besides sharing some useful tips and advices on our projects during the Skype meetings, we decided to collaborate on public engagement. On the 22nd of September, members from the Estonian team traveled all the way from Tartu to Helsinki to help us during our exhibition at Heureka. At Heureka, they brought their fun games about synthetic biology and explained their project to visitors. On the 28th of September, some of us went to Estonia and took part in the AHHAA science fair where the Tartu_TUIT team was engaging the general public, and the children in particular, with a play-based learning approach. We also took part in this by explaining our plasmid game to AHHAA visitors. It was great to be able to meet the team in person and we think that both our human outreach activities benefited from gaining a more international perspective!

Model a sequence using our software tools & GMOS ‘S regulation in France
Our collaboration with the team Chihuahua started on the 10th of July. We first did a skype to present teams and projects.                     They were interested in our model part, so we offered them our help using our model softwares to get a clearer view about the possible interactions of their enzymes together.                     In order to do so, we used the website Phyre2 to model the only sequence not present in the PBD register: yhiH.
We tested the sequence during all July. Using Phyre2, the molecule was modeled with high reliability and corresponding to other existing close models.                     Using Pymol, we studied the molecule’s identity matching.
We provided a document about the French regulation to help them with their Human project to develop a new law for GMOs regulation in Mexico.
They helped us to build our interactive map, providing us information about synthetic biology in their country and spreading two of our surveys: the first one to their society to understand the society’s GMO perception, and the second one was for their winemakers in Chihuahua.                     They organised a skype with a winemaker, in which we had the chance to interact directly with her and talk about climate disorder, how it affects their vineyards and know their opinion on using SofterShock as a potential solution.
The results from the collaboration were very satisfactory: their sequence was very likely to be the one obtained by experimentation, we obtained several feedbacks from the society and winemakers, and they had extra elements to write a new law for Mexico.
""Besides good friends, the collaboration with IONIS team brought us some improvements in our project, mainly in our modeling. The IONIS modeling team helped us to visualize one of our enzymes: “yhjH”. Based on bibliography and the enzyme optimal conditions, they managed to simulate it in silico, helping us to establish and assume model parameters and enzyme behaviors, among other things.

1.BIT-China
We cooperated with BIT-China this year, a team from Beijing Institute of Technology in China and we helped them build a part. So, they can have a better way in testing the expression of membrane protein.
In their project, they mainly want to express C-type GPCR (T1R2＆T1R3) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this process, they are concerned about whether protein can be successfully expressed in the cell membrane. So, they want to fuse BCP（Blue cytochrome protein）to the N-terminal of T1R2 and it could be observed the protein T1R2 on the membrane by confocal fluorescence microscopy. We synthesized the gene for them. Here's the result:
(A)
(B)
Figure 1. Synthesized T1R2 proteins. A. Schematic representation of the structure of fusion T1R2 proteins. B. Gel electrophoresis of the positive result of T1R2.
Gal1 is an inducible promoter which is induced by galactose. BCP is blue cytochrome protein, it can be observed by fluorescence confocal microscopy. T1R2 is a membrane proteins which can sense galactose. CYC1t is a terminator in yeast.
From these experiments, we help BIT-China to build the part to confirm that their membrane proteins can express. Here is the link to their wiki .
BIT-China helped us check whether our system could work to validate our design. They used plates with different kinds of inducer and detected the growth of bacteria with TA system.
The results show that, toxin can suppress the growth of bacteria and the expression of anti-toxin can get rid of the suppression of toxin in bacteria.

In spring of this year a producer of robots for pipetting automatization, Opentrons, announced an event, where iGEM teams from around the globe would get a chance to win one of 10 free OT-2 robots. The condition was sending an abstract of our project and arguing how exactly our team would benefit from this addition. We sent our freshly written scientific abstract and we were among the 10 winners out of the 77 teams who had applied. We were more than happy to get our hands on an OT-2 and very thankful to Opentrons for giving us such an amazing opportunity!
We also had the great honor to personally skype with one of the Opentrons and iGEM Measurement Committee members and this year’s judge, Kristin Ellis. She was very kind and offered us help with anything we might need in the next few months. In addition to that we were invited to subscribe to the Opentrons forum and stay in touch not only with other iGEM teams who won the same robot, but also with the Opentrons community.

OUC China
A great way to educate kids is through pictures and stories. Since we knew about OUC China’s idea to create a comic book about synthetic biology we were on fire to help translating everything into German and Italian. The final comic book is really cute and explains the basics of synthetic biology in an easily understandable and educational way.

Their topic for this year is to create an easy, time-saving, and affordable screening model in order to determine the effectiveness of hair loss treatments.
Our project also involves detection techniques used by NYMU this year. While NYMU and us use the techniques to build quite different things, we have the common goal of eliminating the use of ELISA in the domain of interest for that ELISA is a detection technique too expensive to be widely applied.
Both of our teams have common in finding another countermeasure rather than using ELISA. We both wish the best for our projects’ successes in iGEM competition. But most of all, we hope our ideas have global impact and improve our lives in our future.

This is the first year that IvyTech from South Bend, IN has an iGEM team! The team reached out to Carnegie Mellon University in order to collaborate with us and help us out in any way that we needed. Since school had started up, the outreach duo could not take the time to experiment with dyes we wanted to incorporate into the wheat germ experiment if only for the simple reason that we wanted the DNA that kids can visualize at the end to contrast more against the solution in the tube. Sending out one of the kits to IvyTech was a brilliant way to get results, have another team help, and encourage camaraderie. IvyTech was able to tell us whether the dye should be added before or after the isopropyl alcohol, as well as give us different color examples and the concentration amount needed to achieve the desired effect. The results looked great and we were able to confirm that we want to include dyes in the kits for visual aide and how high the concentration would have to be in order to get the optimal visual. Now, whenever a wheat germ kit is being borrowed from DNAZone, a pro-mega (blue and orange) or methyl orange dye will be included in the teacher’s kit to give to the students should she or he wish to do so. Thanks IvyTech!
A Collaboration: Helping Out the Pitt iGEM with Modeling
Our team helped the iGEM team from the University of Pittsburgh develop a boolean logic based model.
A Collaboration: The iGEM Interlab Measurement Study
The goal of the Interlab Measurement Study was the collect fluorescent data from three devices from iGEM teams all around the world. The Carnegie Mellon teams participated in this study and submitted fluorescence data for the three designated devices as shown below.
In addition to this, the CMU iGEM team collaborated with other teams by participating in their surveys
