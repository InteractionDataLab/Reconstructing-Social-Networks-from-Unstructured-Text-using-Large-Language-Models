University of Toronto iGEM
This year’s iGEM team from the University of Toronto has been working on a cell-free method of detecting gold on a paper-based biosensor. Their goal is develop a cheaper, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly method to detect gold for the mining industry. Their detector is GolS, a transcriptional activator that binds gold ions in solution. Following gold ion sequestration, the protein binds to a specific promoter called the P(golTS) promoter region and activates downstream transcription.
IgeM UofT sent us two plasmids of their design. One plasmid (called GolS hereon in, BBa_K2048001) contains the sequence of GolS under regulation of a TetOn promoter and a downstream P(golTS) promoter linked to a LacZɑ sequence, contained in pSB1C3. The other plasmid (called P118A hereon in, BBa_K2048002) contained the same DNA sequences, however the GolS sequence has a point mutation changing a proline to an alanine at position 118. Wild-type GolS in Salmonella enterica is known to bind to other metal ions, such as Cu, but the GolSP118A mutation abolishes specificity for Cu while only slightly decreasing specificity for Au ions1.
One of the goals of our project this year is to synthesize gold nanoparticles. When we found that iGEM UofT was working with a gold ion sensor, we became excited at the possibilities of collaboration. After some brainstorming, we came up with the idea of characterizing GolS in vivo to add onto iGEM UofT’s current data (mainly in vitro, but some in vivo).
We were informed that UofT had performed an analysis of the ability for GolS and GolS_P118A to react to copper",TRUE,Toronto,Material Transfer,The chunk is incomplete and only confirms material transfer of plasmids - but the plans of concordia are to characterize toronto'sparts and add information which suggests dependency and working together.,ts,
Purdue,2016,"This year the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology’s (RHIT) team looked to control the aerobic respiration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by manipulating the expression of the mitochondrial protein mRPS12. In order to verify if their negative control ∆mRPS12 knockouts were successful, RHIT tagged the protein with a yeast-enhanced GFP so that under fluorescence microscopy they could easily see if their recombinants’ mitochondria were green or not.
Although RHIT did not have access to a fluorescence microscope on their home campus sufficiently powerful for that purpose, after a series of emails between RHIT and Purdue iGEM the logistics were laid for our teams to come together and tackle that problem in the early morning of August 10th, 2016.
After booking a time with Purdue’s Bioscience Imaging Facility Dr Andy Schaber our teams (or Rose-Hulman’s and Biomaker Barrett Davis) were able to meet up, verify the proper positional expression of yGFP in RHIT’s constructs, and still have time for lunch.
In return, RHIT contributed (like the University of Exeter’s team) to our team's past project database and provided feedback on our teams protocols for biosafety involving the sol-gel immobilization process.

Athens,2018," are planning to keep on working on their projects after the course of the competition, we decided to set a common timetable on realizing our kits. To this end, we will evaluate if parts of our kit could be 3D printed and put together to a final product.
iGEM Community encounters
During the summer months, many team members from other iGEM Teams visited our city, Athens in the frame of their summer vacation. When they contacted us, we were quick to set up a meeting in order to know each other and talk all things iGEM. We had the pleasure of meeting with Nicholas Kakaroubas from the UNSW 2018 iGEM Team. We presented each other with our projects and gave feedback on the enzymatic issues we shared. We also gave Nick a tour of one of the labs were we work and spend a day doing lab work together, while we exchanged many wet lab tips. Our team also met Alexis Casas from the iGEM Paris - Bettencourt Team with whom we had a very interesting conversation about our projects!
Surveys
Throughout the iGEM year, we completed as many surveys provided by other teams as we could, in order to help them form their project or gain an understanding about the way their peers view certain subjects. Specifically we completed surveys from the teams:
iGEM Bulgaria Questionnaire: Survey concerning CRISPR, GMOs and our view about them.
iGEM Dusseldorf: Survey about probiotics.
iGEM Montpellier 2018: Survey concerning contraceptive methods and the possible use of engineering bacteria for this purpose.
UNAMBG iGEM 2018: Survey about antibiotic resistance.

＜May Festival＞
On May 20th and 21st, as iGEM JAPAN, we participated in university festival of University of Tokyo, ‘May Festival’. In this festival, with KAIT JAPAN team, Tokyo Tech team, Kyoto team, Kobe team, Nagahama team, and Gifu team, we held an exhibition booth and presented our projects with posters. Since May Festival is one of the most famous university festivals in Japan, many people including middle school or high school students, university students, many professors and many researchers came to the exhibition booth. They listened to our projects and gave us a lot of opinions from many perspectives. Since many teams of iGEM participated, we discussed our project and deepened our knowledge in details especially the protocol.
＜Creating a document about GMM(GMO) legislations＞
Genetically modifying is a technique of modifying DNA using genetic engineering methods. This technique is used in food, agriculture, and many other fields. In Japan, there are quite a lot genetically modified foods, and we are quite familiar with GMO regardless of pro or con. (Find out the survey that we took on human practices page!) However, in Japan, there are both people feel positive about GMOs and people who feel negative about GMOs. Having this background, and also thinking of safety and conservation of ecosystem, we consider that these are the reasons why the GMM(GMO) legislations are quite restrict in Japan. On the other hand, if we look outside Japan, the legislations are really different in each country and area.

Alina, who was in charge of our security level 2 lab, contacted Jérémy for further troubleshooting, hence we had starting issues with the protocol. Continuous communication between our team and Jérémy helped us to fix our issues. We needed to tweak the PCR reactions due to some chemicals, enzymes being unavailable to us, being inexperienced with the method we needed council to make sure our changes would not alter the outcome.
Eventually Alina was able to troubleshoot the Golden-Gate-Assembly with Jérémy’s help so that we were finally able to amplify the whole construct with 6107 bp. Which we were able to verify by colony PCR and sequencing.

Second our projects are basically designed to work together, Delft worked on a crispr-cas based detection method for multiresistant bacteria, and we developed a new antibiotic compound to target some of those. Sadly, this would involve both teams completing their projects before we start a collaboration. Which might have worked, in reality we both found out that synthetic biology often takes a lot of time and the verification of the own experiments has to be prioritized.
Nonetheless we made plans, even though they never came to fruition. The planned cooperation involved Delft identifying enterobacteria that are carbapenem resistant, identified strains would then be tried with our novel antibiotic compounds and tested for siderophore receptors. All in all we would have been able to identify and eliminate multiresistant bacterial threats.

Peshawar – Tutoring the first Pakistani team
We provided guidance to iGEM Peshawar , the first team to represent Pakistan. We assisted them with                various aspects of Mathematical Modelling, Human Practice and cloning.
An opportunity for collaboration unveiled itself when we learned that the Pakistani team from Peshawar                University is focusing on detection as a project. During the initial conversation we were amazed to learn                that the said group is the first Pakistani team to compete in iGEM, thus they were in need of guidance with                most aspects of the competition. We decided to aid them and share all the knowledge and experience that                was accumulated in our project and in past Technion iGEM teams. To achieve this, we used different                platforms for communications mainly a Facebook group, where the Peshawar team could get an immediate                answer to any question they had, and multiple Skype sessions each with a different focus such as                mathematical modeling, Human practices, Cloning and more.
Mathematical modeling
We aided in the modeling process of Peshawar’s system, specifically using differential equations and logic gates.                The aim of the model was to predict the expression of the reporter protein as a function of the inducers’ concentration ( View PDF ).
Cloning
The Peshawar team had issues with the plasmid transformations into competent cells. After we got                a full report on the exact steps they followed, we helped debugging their protocol.
We also shared our protocols of chemical transformation and competent cells preparation with them.
These instructions helped the team overcome their obstacles and proceed with the project.
Human practices

Moreover, we advised the team regarding                an appeal to the government with a request to promote",TRUE,Peshawar,"Advice, Material Transfer","Israel gave advice and helped peshwar with several technical aspects of their project.

Collaboration
Since SFLS team and us both used the S30 cell-free system in our projects, so we assisted each other on different aspects. Our team helped SFLS team to validate the viability of gene expression in S30 cell-free system. Here is a link to their collaboration page: https://2016.igem.org/Team:Shenzhen_SFLS/Collaborations
Here is an abstract from SFLS team:
Team BGIC China>>Us
Team BGIC China were working on a programmable and open-source Next Generation Bio-Chip (NGBC) which allows user with knowledge in synthetic biology to easily re-program and re-construct it in order to make new bio-chips with different functions. They based their NGBC on E. coli S30 Extract System for Circular DNA(Promega), the same with ours. They also utilized enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ) as one of their reporter gene. So they helped us to test whether S30 system was qualified as a platform for translation of enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ). Here is their result.
The blue liquid in the small eppendorf is the S30 system with gene circuit coding enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ) and its substrates, X-gal, after hours of reaction.
It qualitatively proved that our S30 cell-free system works well.

We also tested this with a different reporter gene, luciferase. Check our results in the “Proof of Concept” section of our wiki.

Evry Paris-Saclay team
We met the Evry Paris-Saclay team in Paris during the 3rd Parisian meetup. Evry Paris-Saclay team project is focusing on the production of D-Psicose, which might be helpful for diabetic patients. Unlike us, their team has knowledge about legislation and market study that none of us has. On the other hand, our team has skills in biochemistry, structural biology and in enzymology.
After few skype conferences, a collaboration was born! Therefore, we offered them our help to study the enzyme responsible for the conversion of D-fructose and D-psicose , the D-Psicose-3-Epimerase (EC 5.3.1) (see here) and members of Evry Paris-Saclay team offered us help with the regulatory framework of GMO research and the release in the market of our product. You can check out their research here .

Tec-Monterrey
We turned our attention to computer-based modeling of biological systems as a less resource intensive and time consuming alternative to iterative experiments.
We had hoped to be able to build a reliable tool to predict the behavior of our co-culture, however, our team lacked the necessary experience in this field. As such, we were happy to be offered the possibility of a collaboration with the iGEM team of Tec-Monterrey. This team, unlike ours, is more experienced in modeling.
The model they provided to us uses the following equations:
Where [A] is the population of organism A, CA is it’s consume constant, iA is the Input resources available for A and Am is the maximum sustainable population.
And:
Where KA[B] is the influence of organism B on the resource availability to A, KA[C] the influence of organism C and the other variables are defined as above.
This is far more simple than our approach. It has however, also produced results that were useful to us. The model provided by Tec-Monterrey took a different approach to the concept of co-culture and it offered us new insights into our model. By allowing us to refocus our attention we were able to bring our own theoretical work to a point that is closer to reality than it had been previously.

Concordia,2016," that blue color formation was due to the presence of GolS and P118A. Blue color seems to have appeared in the GolS M9X construct, as well as all ion constructs, possibly indicating that GolS reacted with some ions in the M9 media (which contains calcium and magnesium). However, a darker blue color was observed with the 5 µM Au GolS construct, indicating higher LacZ activity caused by GolS in the presence of Au, as compared to the other ions. This is a confirmation that GolS is performing its intended function of binding to gold ions.
Interestingly, we have found that the GolSP118A construct can clearly bind to gold, copper, and silver ions. Silver ion binding by GolS and has not been documented in the before for GolS, so we have characterized GolS to another degree. Both GolS and GolSP118A do not show any binding affinity for Al ions.
We also wanted to obtain quantitative values from this data, so we attempted to extract the blue insoluble pigment in DMSO. We first spun down the cells (4000 RPM, 5 min), got rid of the supernatant, and lysed the cells with a commercial E. coli  lysis buffer. We then added the commercial neutralization buffer, spun the cells again, removed the supernatant, and resuspended the pellet in DMSO. We then obtained absorbance values of our wells.
We found that the solubilized blue pigment had absorbance maximum at 640 nm. As can be seen in the spectrum above, the untransformed DH5alpha incubated with Au ions (which did not have blue pigment) did not absorb at 640nm.
We measured the absorbances of the solubilized blue pigments in each well at 640nm. The absorbances are written under each well. These quantified absorbance values add onto the qualitative data we have generated for our collaboration.

We did not directly collaborated in the lab but we have done something so much bigger. With igem.today , we joined 30 teams on the same platform and helped them communicate their project while sharing their surveys, their funding campaign as well as what they were going through. We had the chance to meet students from very different backgrounds yet all with the same passion for synthetic biology.
We may not have a full lab-collaboration, but we’ve set up a system for the future to come, making it easier for new teams.
iGEM News
After spending some time in the iGEM community, we found that it was really difficult to be aware of the work of the other teams, even the ones that are geographically close to us. Additionally, many teams that we interviewed were searching for collaboration and struggling to find the right team. Notably, we thought that teams can greatly benefit from the experience of other teams: What drives other teams? And why did they decide on that topic? How do other teams solve their issues, be it technical or social? Or simply to discuss projects with other teams.
We set out to find a way to improve this. Therefore we decided to create an online platform on which we hosted short team interviews and project descriptions which are simple and highly personal. Through this process, we created igem.today : an entertaining and educational place where teams around the world can share their project and learn about other team’s projects.
We contacted the teams through social media (Twitter and Facebook) and obtained positive responses from 30 teams in different countries and continents.
The discussions and interviews we had over Skype were really constructive as we learned about each others projects and how they were going. This also allowed us to meet great people from all around the world and see how they dealt with different obstacles like managing to work as a team or founding their project. Additionally, because of this platform, we now already know a couple of teams that we would like to meet and chat more to at the Giant Jamboree in Boston at the end of October. Not only knowing a few teams before meeting them is an advantage, it also can be beneficial during the iGEM experience over the",FALSE,,,,,

Data Collection for the EtBr Spot Protocol
We want our standard curve to be able to predict concentrations from varying levels of pixel intensity. In order to do so, we needed a larger and more diverse dataset. So we asked iGEM teams to perform the following task: dilute 1 uL of DNA of an unknown concentration into 9 uL EtBr (1 ng/uL), photograph the samples under UV light, and send us the images. Using ImageJ®, we compared the pixel intensity of the sample with a known DNA concentration to the predicted pixel intensity based on our standard curve. Special thanks to HD Resolution from the US and Tec de Monterrey_Gdl from Mexico!
Predicting Collateral Cleavage Activity of Cas13a
Cas9 - a cleaving RNA in CRISPR technology
We collaborated with the Columbia University iGEM Team to help them model the collateral cleavage activity of Cas13a, an enzyme used to cleave RNA in CRISPR technology. Our team provided the base system of equations and simulated the equations. See the details here.
Exchanging Ideas
Thanks to the HD Resolution Team in NYC, USA, we collaborated to host an event to present our projects to each other. They learned about the EtBr Spot Protocol and the light operon and we learned about their goal to cure Huntington's Disease. It was a great experience!

The Cell-Free Interlab Study
Cell-free expression platforms allow the production of proteins from DNA without live cells by making use of modified cell lysates. Their application is increasingly popular in synthetic biology where they allow fast iteration of design-build-test cycles of genetic parts and gene circuits. Now is the time to prepare for the widespread adoption of cell-free methods by iGEM teams.
Following into the footsteps of the iGEM interlab study, we prepared a pilot-scale interlab study to test the variation of cell-free expression systems between labs. This was made possible by our generous sponsor Arbor Biosciences, who provided the myTXTL cell-free expression system to our team and others.
Results
Preparation of the cell-free interlab protocol
We selected a GFP expressing plasmid (BBa_I20270) from the iGEM 2018 distribution kit and used pTXTL-p70a-deGFP as an optimized plasmid for high cell-free expression of GFP. We prepared a standard protocol to distribute to participating teams. Our protocol makes use of fluorescein as a fluorescence standard, allowing measurements to be compared across labs.
Distribution of the cell-free interlab protocol
We recruited team GIFU iGEM from Japan to participate in this study with us. Thanks to GIFU iGEM for their patience and great work!
Interlab variation in cell-free expression yields
Figure 1. Comparison between cell-free expression of GFP between Paris_Bettencourt (A) and GIFU (B).GFP fluorescence measurements were made at 0 hour and 15 hours of cell-free expression. The values presented here are normalized to respective fluorescein calibration curves prepared by the teams.
As observed from figure 1 (A) and (B) the high expression plasmid (pTXTL-p70a-deGFP)  gives comparatively similar magnitude of fluorescence, indicating a low variability of the cell-free expression system. However we do see a difference in the magnitude of low expression GFP plasmid (BBa_I20270), which could be a result of difference in the way we cloned,",TRUE,Gifu,Work,GIfu did interlab with bettencourt and shared data after validating their protocols,ts,

Tortilla Party and evening activities
According to our sustainability goals of iGEM goes green we greatly reduced the amount of meat provided for the Tortilla Party and invested in vegetable and soya fillings with various delicious dips instead. Furthermore, we avoided the use of disposable tableware and provided public transport tickets for the teams during the Meetup.

Guest Speakers
Prof. Dr. Thorsten Mascher
Chair of General Microbiology (TU Dresden)
Dr. Mascher is the supervisor of the TU Dresden iGEM team and serial competitor in iGEM, leading the LMU Munich teams in the past. His research focuses on Bacillus subtilis, a spore-producing bacterium, and focuses on gene networks and systems biology. His talk discussed B. subtilis as a model organism and his previous endeavors in iGEM competitions.
Marcel Thiele
Promega Represenative
Mr. Thiele is the Dresden regional representative for Promega. He gave an interesting presentation discussing hints and pitfalls when performing RT-qPCR to get optimal results.
Prof. Dr. Hans-Georg Braun
Institute of Biofunctional Polymer Materials (IPF)
Dr. Braun is a professor at the Leibniz Institute for Polymer Research in Dresden and his research focuses on micro- and nanostructuring techniques for polymers and liquids. His presentation focused on the self-assembly of diphenylalanine motifs and its mechanism as well as discussing his experiences in judging and supervising a team in a different biology competition.
Teams
9 Teams attended the German-wide Meetup:
Aachen
Berlin_diagnostX
Bielefeld-CeBiTec
Cologne-Duesseldorf
TU Darmstadt
Franconia
Freiburg
Munich
Potsdam
Conclusion
The meetup was important for many reasons as it created an environment of collaboration for the teams, a pillar of the iGEM competition. With the time during the speed dating and the workshops, strong bonds were made between the iGEMers that will help for the competition but also for future endeavors after the iGEM Giant Jamboree. The experience for our team to set up this big event is also valuable as it takes a team effort in multiple areas, fundraising, planning and scheduling, getting guest speakers. It was all worth it in the end as the teams enjoyed themselves and we shared a lot of laughs. We can’t wait to see you all at the Jamboree",TRUE,"Aachen, Berlin_diagnostX, Bielefeld-CeBiTec, Cologne-Duesseldorf, TU_Darmstadt, Franconia, Freiburg, Munich, Potsdam",Meetup,,,

Every member from our team owns a positive  attitude towards team collaboration. We had enjoyable collaboration with team  SJTU, SYSU and Tsinghua A.
During our initial seek for an idea project, SJTU  provided us several plasmids containing the light system because they have used  similar proteins before. Apart from sharing similar parts with them, we also  invited two students from SJTU to Tsinghua University for a visit when they  came to Beijing in August. They said that they had a good time in the campus  and looked forward to better cooperation with us.
We are also grateful that SYSU later began to  collaborate with us after a conference in Taiwan. They kindly shared their  plasmids encoding recombinase with us. Besides this, we also held a meet-up in  Beijing in August, during which we not only discussed the technical obstacles  we encountered before but also shared useful tips for later experiments. As an  exchange, we spotted out several wrong description or sequencing errors in  their plasmids, which at first might be misleading.
The collaboration with Tsinghua-A was a bit late,  but of great help to us – we provided them a hardware prototype and asked for  their advices, and indeed they provided us very useful feedbacks. Besides,  their senior advisor pointed out a potential problem for us. As the only two  iGEM teams in our university this year, we believe this collaboration is  necessary.

Collaborations
During the project we collaborated with many iGEM teams, institutions and organizations, as visualised on the above shown map.
The iGEM team Copenhagen performed a series of experiments in a Martian chamber to assess survival under Martian conditions. This Martian chamber made it possible to test the survival of wildtype bacteria in different conditions similar to the environment on Mars, for example radiation, low pressure and high levels of CO2. For our project, it was very interesting to know whether our E. coli bacteria would survive on the surface on Mars in the worst case scenario they would escape their contained environment of the bioreactor. [LINK] The Copenhagen team therefore tested for us what the effect of the low pressure atmosphere is on bacteria. The team exposed E. coli-strain DH5α, which we used to transfer our detoxification system to, to the pressure levels present on Mars, which is between 0.5 ad 0.7 kPa. Then, they measured optical density (OD) to study how many of the bacteria were still alive. Their results, though very small in sample size, suggest that E. coli has very low, if any survival at all. Thereby, the rod-shaped bacteria seemed to show a slightly shorter and thinner, more rod-shaped phenotype under a reduced pressure of 0.5 kPa in comparison to these bacteria grown under normal air pressure (1 kPa). This shows us again, just as in the Random Positioning Machine [LINK], that Martian conditions certainly will have an effect on our bacteria on Mars.
Figure 1: The martian chamber
Figure 2: Low pressure chambers
Still, there was one condition their Martian chamber wasn't able to test that we could provide the Copenhagen team with: the reduced gravity on Mars, which is only 38% of the Earth's gravity. By using the Random Positioning Machine, which rotates the samples inside in a pre-programmed way such that it only experiences a part of the Earth's gravity level (normally 1g), which you can vary between 0g and 0.9g. We were able to show that Bacillus subtilus 168 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 grow to higher densities in simulated Martian gravity (0.38g) in comparison to bacteria under the Earth's gravity on the same time interval. This experiment showed thus that their bacteria would survive the gravity levels on Mars and might even experience growth-benefits from it, which is highly",TRUE,UNIK_Copenhagen,Work,Copenhagen team performed experiments for Leiden,ts,

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

This year, ZJUT-China has cooperated with Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Normal University, Zhejiang University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong in different degrees of all wet experiments, modeling and human practice. In the process of working with other schools, we constantly improved our own project and helped with other teams’ projects.

In addition, we are actively seeking collaboration on projects. Fortunately, this year's BNU-China’s project wants to achieve a self-enrichment system that replaces traditional antibiotic screening to reduce the use of antibiotics. And our project is working on solving the problem of superbugs. So we found the opportunity to collaborate. In order to make the government and the public aware that biology lab may exacerbate issue on superbug, we have jointly drafted a manifesto calling on the government and the public to pay attention to biosafety issues and improve relevant laws. It is hoped that through our efforts, the current status of bacterial resistance will be changed.

In addition, we have established long-term online contact to discuss issues we encountered during the competition.       BIT also gave us a lot help in the process of perfecting our project. In order to improve the performance of our light-controlled system, BIT presented us a plasmid containing BBa_K2305016 after we actively discussed problems with them.

The RMSD (root mean square deviation) over all frames in regard to the initial conformation was computed for both structures (figure 10).
Figure 10: RMSD of subtilisin E wildtype (red) and the mutation variant (blue) in regard to the initial conformation.
The conformation with the smallest RMSD towards the consensus structure was chosen to represent the overall conformation (figure 11).
Figure 11: Overlay of subtilisin E wildtype (red) and mutant variant (yellow). The mutated amino acid sidechain is displayed as blocks in PyMOL.
It is evident that there is no relevant difference between the wildtype structure and the mutant variant. Therefore we can conclude that the incorporation of ONBY at tyrosine 77 is not sufficient to alter the structure. This can be traced to the fact that ONBY is introduced at a surface position.

In August, one of our team members paid a visit to Tokyo Institute of Technology for the purpose of searching for team collaboration and friendship with IGEM Tokyo Tech. We sincerely appreciate the warm welcome and excellent reception from all members of IGEM Tokyo Tech. We exchanged information of our idea of IGEM, current work of our projects and future potential collaboration.We held a modeled presentation, provided a constructive suggestion for one another and tried to improve some parts of our projects that might be challenged in Jamboree. Their project this year is about constructing a new co-culturing system across bacteria, plant cells, and animal cells through the signal molecule. ,
Adopt advice to our project
In 2009, team Tokyo Tech focused on the topic of Terraforming of Mars. An elaborately described method of creating blackened Escherichia coli was displayed on its wiki. After consulting IGEM Tokyo Tech and delving into their project, we intended to construct a plasmid containing Melanin sequence and further transform the plasmid into microalgae. Apart from in 2012 distribution kit was used, which was submitted by IGEM Tokyo Tech in 2009, when constructing Melanin plasmid. We sincerely appreciate the help from team Tokyo Tech for consulting and discussion.

iGEM Göttingen - ITC measurements
iGEM Göttingen is trying to detect and inactivate glyphosate using B. subtilis and E. coli. This year, together with the Research group of our first PI Gert Bange, we helped the iGEM Team Göttingen by trying to detect the protein interaction between the substrate glyphosate and the EPSP synthases AroE and AroA from B. subtilis and E. coli. Pietro Giammarinaro instructed us for the ITC measurement. Unfortunately, we could not detect any interaction.

iGEM IIT Madras - ChassiDex
iGEM IIT Madras is developing new tools for working with Acinetobacter baylyi. With this they want to establish this organism as a possible new chassis organism in synthetic biology. Last year’s team established a database for host organisms other than E. coli which can be used in synthetic biology. The team continues their site called ChassiDex this year as well, so we had the chance to contribute our knowledge about Vibrio natriegens. Hopefully we can help the scientific community by sharing the knowledge we gained and protocols that worked for us in the past months.

iGEM Thessaloniki - InterLab
The Divices 1-4 from Thessaloniki and our negativ control.
We collaborated with this year’s Thessaloniki iGEM team by taking part in their InterLab. They are working on a synthetic biology circuit which ensures a stable protein expression. By making the gene expression independent from the potentially fluctuating copy number of plasmids, better predictions can be made about the stoichiometry when metabolic pathways are integrated into the chromosome. In this experiment we tested their four test devices.
We hope our results represent the desired outcome of the InterLab. We cultivated the cells in an incubator that was in frequent use by other team members, so the cultures weren’t shaken for multiple short intervals. If our data varies from what was expected, one explanation could be, that the Escherichia coli cells didn’t incubate correctly and therefore didn’t grow as well.

Rice University Collaboration
Members of our team met with Rice in late June to practice presenting our projects and discuss future collaboration efforts.
Members of our team present our project to the Rice University iGEM Team
The UT-Austin team reached out to the Rice team early in the Summer of 2018 to determine if our teams could help each other. We decided to meet at the Rice campus and share our project ideas.
At the meet-up, we presented our project ideas to each other and discussed ways in which we could integrate our projects. Rice’s project revolved around modifying the T7 Expression system to be more broad host range, which fit with our goal of creating a broad host range plasmid kit to easily and efficiently transform non-model organisms. They suggested they could benefit from using some of the promoter part plasmids we created to test transcription independent of translation. We were able to provide a protocol for transforming Acinetobacter
We also gave them a one tube reaction with a protocol to test to act as a prototype of the complete kit. Once they transformed the one tube containing our assemblies  into their organisms of interest, they could determine which origin of replication functioned and utilize that information.
Albert Truong, of the Rice 2018 iGEM Team , provided their results and feedback when transforming our assemblies into E. coli in their lab. The Rice team also provided us with valuable insight and suggestions on how we could improve our kit protocol.

Interlab Study in V. natriegens
Our goal is to bring Vibrio natriegens and all its advantages to the synbio community as a whole. To do that, we need to learn more about how it behaves in other labs. In order to find out more about this was to have other iGEM teams conduct experiments with V. natriegens. With this in mind, we decided to expand on the InterLab study, because the participants were already  familiar with it. The plan was to include as many teams as possible and provide them with the same protocol, V. natriegens, and have them conduct the same simple experiment, the InterLab Cell Measurement.
The original InterLab was designed to solve one of biology’s biggest problems, inherent unpredictability of living organisms, like bacteria. This unpredictability makes it difficult to compare measurements  and compare devices from one lab to another. Therefore, a common basis of comparison is paramount for scientists to be able to build on each others work. This is especially true in synthetic biology because our models that require precise measurements. This engineering approach makes standardized units even more important. With this in mind, iGEM created a GFP measurement procedure and compared the data from labs all over the world (Beal et al., 2016) . All teams tested the same constructs, the only variables being the lab. Since we want Vibrio natriegens to become the new go-to chassis, testing it like E.coli can give us valuable insight.
Nearly everything was done the same as in the original iGEM InterLab, E.coli was just replaced by Vibrio natriegens. The teams transformed the plasmids into Vibrio natriegens and conducted GFP measurements. This gave us invaluable insight into how people unfamiliar with Vibrio natriegens adapt to using it.
To complement the results of your experiments we asked all participants to fill out a quick survey.  We wanted to hear about their",FALSE,,,,,

With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and",FALSE,,,,,

The  schedule of the meeting is the simulation of Giant Jamboree in Boston, consisting of project presentation, poster display and so on. It is an excellent  time for all the iGEM teams in China to spread the idea of biosynthetic to the  public of China and to interact with other teams ahead of time to make progress together. We undoubtedly seized the excellent opportunity to demonstrate our  project to all teams in China and learn from others. During poster display, we had close conversations with several teams, making proposal on the problems we  came up while listening to presentations of other teams, communicating with  teams sharing the same track with us and advising each other for better  promotion. The special event, trouble shooting also inspired us in several  aspects, such as the form of our presentation and the style of our poster.
During the time of photo shooting for all  the participants together, we were honored to have a special moment chatting  with Mrs. Megan. Her enthusiasm and smile gave us lots of strength to go on  overcoming any obstacles to come.

ETH_Zurich,2018," European iGEM Meetup in July, we realized that both of our teams were working on chemotaxis-based biosensors. Although our projects are based on somewhat different methods and applications, we did struggle with similar         complications at the time. Therefore, we decided to stay in touch and update each other about problems and solutions, which formed the base for our collaboration. An example of our similar approaches was found in the way both our         teams dealt with our intended use of split luciferase. Both our projects included using the reconstitution of a split luciferase to create a read-out signal from the chemotaxis pathway. Especially when searching for the right luciferase for our         application, we were happy to split tasks. We shared outcomes with each other, which led to our current solution using firefly luciferase.         In the future, we also aim to integrate the engineered bacteria from the Utrecht iGEM team on AROMA. We hope their biosensor will improve the range of detectable concentrations, while also broadening the range of substrates that could         potentially be sensed.

The changed immune epitope count of serveral of the individual amino acids in Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2 shows, that especially the clustered regions with many epitopes were edited by our algorithm. This can be explained by the fact that a single mutation in this area has probably the biggest impact on the immunogenicity.
Figure 5.1 T-Cell immune epitopes before the deimmunization workflow shown as combined bar-/lineplot. For each amino acid position, the number of MHC class II epitopes  is plotted. Note that there is a prominent cluster of amino acid between residue 100-130 which are part of many immune epitopes.
Figure 5.2 T-Cell immune epitopes after the deimmunization workflow shown as combined bar-/lineplot. For each amino acid position, the number of MHC class II epitopes  is plotted.
Structural Verification
To validate whether the change of amino acids at these three positions still results in a stable protein, we did another MD simulation of 25 ns of the mutated protein with and without the fusion domain of the structures of previous MD simulations. Both RMSD plots show a RMDS of < 0.15 nm, which is a very stable conformation regarding the introduction of three point mutations (Figure 6.1/6.2). All three amino acids have their side chains oriented outwards relative to the protein core (Figure 7) and do not interfere with any present secondary structures of the protein or any other amino acids. This also suggests that our algorithm made a good choice regarding the substituted residues.

LASA High School
We have also reached out to help another high school team, team Austin_UTexas_LASA , a high school team from the Liberal Arts and Science Academy in Austin, Texas. Their team is working on a L-DOPA production, sensing, and control system using a two-plasmid regulation system. One plasmid, a “production” plasmid, produces L-DOPA in vivo. Another plasmid, a “detection” plasmid, detects L-DOPA and uses a Venus gene as a reporter system.  In addition, they are also planning to integrate a control system in which the Venus reporter will regulate the production plasmid. They hope to use this system as a new exciting way to elucidate the mechanisms of Parkinson’s disease.
We had a videoconference session to give advice on their project design, offered advice and critique on their wiki, and our presenter and leadership team has given feedback on their presentation.
We are amazed at the amount of effort this new team has put in! We wish them the best of luck at the Jamboree and hope to develop more collaborations with them in future years!

iGEM Franconia
Asist team Franconia on their education project
We noticed an interesting collaboration request on iGEM Community Collaboration page and decided to communicate with the Franconia team. NYMU team got this amazing opportunity to collaborate with iGEM teams around the globe by designing and finishing the translation of the biological themed card (whose idea originated from Franconia team) into universal languages. The biological themed card is a card game where the basic deck contains cards that can be pathogens, cures, preventatives, or anything that influences human health. Since the NYMU team has specialists in the field of medicine, we collaborated with team Franconia and other iGEM teams to help the iGEM community translate the biological themed card into traditional Chinese.
We believe that this cooperation is significantly meaningful because not only does this card game raise people’s awareness of pathogens and biosafety issues, but also the translation of the basic deck into universal languages can help the biological themed card itself extended to more areas in the world. We are honored to collaborate with these teams and deeply believe that our translation can make people stay away from anything that negatively impacts their health. The following PDF file is our translation.

Asia Pacific Conference
Later in July, we attended the 5th Annual Asia Pacific Conference held at National Chiao Tung University. During the four-day event, we had the opportunity to meet around 25 iGEM teams – from Taiwan, China, Japan, and the US. The conference began with each team displaying their posters and getting a big picture of what everyone’s project is about. For the following days, each team would each hold a 40-minute presentation session with Q&A time. Through our presentation, our presenters acquired a sense of what the final presentation at Giant Jamboree will be like. Furthermore, during the Q&A session, we received many feedbacks in regards to improvements that could be made -- including the utilization of waste proteins that are produced in the cycle of biofuel. For the rest of the conference we attended others’ presentations; by listening to every team’s progress and obtaining a sense of the field they are researching in, we were able to acknowledge the pros and cons of our own project while seeking for possible collaborations.

UCAS,2017," metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Collaborations
Our team was fortunate to have multiple productive collaborations with other iGEM teams from around the world. In addition to discussing details of our projects with members of other iGEM teams including William & Mary, Helsinki, and NYU Abu-Dhabi, we offered our support to four teams from around the world.
University College of London
We volunteered to test software developed by the University College of London’s iGEM team for designing gene circuits. We shared our experience using their software and suggested several changes to improve its versatility.
Rice University
We were also proud to help mentor a new iGEM team. Rice University’s iGEM team was interested in incorporating software into their project, but to do so they needed a stronger background in coding. Since our team has a history of integrating complex software with our projects, notably for this year’s project and last year’s, we asked our experienced members to lend their expertise. We were in contact with their team and gave advice on software.

TU Darmstadt
We contacted team TU_Darmstadt to search for help and advice in June. Because this is the first year for our team             to participate in iGEM competition, we are unfamiliar with operating such a project requiring cross-disciplinary             collaboration.
TU Darmstadt is an outstanding team participating in iGEM competition for years. We hoped to learn how they organize             a successful team in both short term and long term. Since one of our team member Yu-Hsuan was studying in Darmstadt,             they kindly invited her to visit them.
During the meeting with TU Darmstadt, they shared their experience and a lot of great ideas about team building,             project designing, fundraising, and more. We also shared ideas about our projects with each other. After talking             to them, we were much clearer about what to do next.
We greatly appreciate the advice and motivation given by team TU Darmstadt, and wish them all the best at the Giant             Jamboree!
HUST-China
NCHU_Taichung was the first time to join iGEM. Early in our tram's formation, we usually encountered some                   problems with no direction at all. Modeling was one of them. We didn't even know how to start, and what                   we should do. At that time, HUST-China contacted us. They needed the shuttle plasmid of Rhodopseudomonas                   palustris-E. coli from our PI. We help them get the plasmid and gave some suggestions on cultivation and                   transformation. Simultaneously, when HUST-China knew that we were frustrated with modeling, they gave advice                   on the direction of modeling, and help us to build it.

Nanjing-China,2016," NEFU-China are excited about this invitation and expressed intense interests in collaboration. Therefore, about one month later, they invited us to their lab for a visit. Team members of our team gave presentations in their lab and both of the teams had a great team communication about iGEM and experiments. However, because of the long distance and the big expenses, they cancelled the plan to come to our lab proceed experiments. Nevertheless, we are communicating through emails and we have supported them with experiment materials as well as suggestions on their experimental design.
 
 
3. Team UCAS
 
We formed collaborations with team UCAS during CCiC’s poster time. We are impressed about their hard work and great courage because they are the youngest team and the oldest students of their school (UCAS has been established three years ago). During the conversation between two teams, they put forward their future plan to use a kind of reusable materials to adhere bacteria, which is exactly the same as we tried last year. The adviser of our team realized immediately that they might have chosen the wrong reusable material. Therefore, we gave them suggestions about choices of reusable materials. Students of their team were grateful hearing this useful suggestion. Moreover, we also provided them with materials shown in the picture, which is used for bacteria aggregation in solution. No doubt that we saved them a lot of time choosing the reusable material and building the right equipment.
Establishment of New iGEM Teams
 
1. Southeast University
 
Students from Southeast University are interested to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuit. However, they are not familiar with characteristics of DNA. They are also unaware of iGEM. They came to us for suggestions about how to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuits and expressed their interests in participating iGEM in 2017. Thus we assigned one of our team members, Zhen Li to help them with their project design as well as give them information about the iGEM competition. From then on, we formed intimate collaboration relationship with them and discussed with them every week to track their progress. We even specially designed a brochure containing detailed explanation of iGEM competition to them. ( Click here to get the PDF file. ) The collaboration goes smoothly and they have already formed ideas about the project in next year’s competition. They will establish a new iGEM team next year with our help!

Collaboration with the Marburg team
IGEM Marburg asked us if we would like to participate in their collaboration project, which is an Interlab Study of their own design. They wanted us to measure the growth rate of the marine bacterium Vibrio natriegens, by growing it in a liquid LB V2 medium and check the OD600 value every 10 minutes over a period of 5 hours. The measurements were done using spectrophotometry and we made a growth curve of V. natriegens for Marburg.
V. natriegens is a fast-growing bacterium, with a generation time around 8-10 minutes. As of today, E. coli is the commonly used laboratory bacterium, however this bacteria’s generation time is around 20 minutes. V. natriegens could potentially be a substituent as a laboratory model organism, due to their shorter generation time.
The goal of this collaboration is to investigate if the growth rate of V. natriegens is consistent between all the iGEM teams that are participating in Marburgs Interlab study. We did the growth experiment two times and obtained the growth curves illustrated in Figure 1 and 2.

Introduction
Comic Book
Surveys
Introducton
Synthetic biology is a relatively new field just recently receiving more and more attention here in Lithuania. For example, in Vilnius University the synthetic biology courses only start in Master degree studies. For that reason, undergraduate students rarely know anything about the basics of Synthetic Biology.
This year we have started to build the Synthetic Biology community here in Lithuania by revamping Synthetic Biology Organisation by setting its direction and goals, starting a synthetic biology education cycle in university and giving popular lectures to students in Life Science Center.
However, we wanted to make the education process more engaging and innovative - as it is not always easy to grab the attention of the youngest students. That is why, for some time, we have actively searched for ways we can engage students in a more fun and attractive way.
Educational tool - Synthetic Biology Comic Book!
That is why we were extremely surprised and happy to receive a collaboration proposal from OUC-China . They have created a 28-page comic book about the principles of Synthetic Biology. The content was explaining in a fun and engaging manner with the help of colourful illustrations. It was called “Spaceship E. Coli”.
Therefore, we have accepted their collaboration proposal right away and translated their comic book into our native Lithuanian language. Also, we have adapted it to be most suitable for the young students here in Lithuania. After translating the book we have created a shareable PDF file. We have then distributed this comic book on various websites and social networks to the Lithuanian students and the general public that, we hope, after reading the comic book have developed an interest in synthetic biology.
As the online sharing was a huge success, together with OUC-China iGEM team we have decided to take our collaboration one step further and a physical version of the Lithuanian “Spaceship E.Coli” comic book. We have hoped",TRUE,OUC-China,Other,Translated the comic book of OUC into lithuanian. Unsure if that is material transfer,,Check

Official Mentoring Program Cooperation with Team Munich
The German Meetup in Marburg was the initial chance for us to meet many other iGEM teams from all over Germany. We received a lot of helpful advice regarding team structuring and organisation and became interested in the official mentoring program. Later at the European Meetup in Munich we finally initiated a mentoring cooperation with team Munich and together we are now taking part in the official mentoring program. As a very successful and well-established team they are the right contact persons to help us with different problems that need to be solved during the process of evolving our project. Our team on the other hand, recently funded and full of iGEM youngsters, we can ask them everything about team organisation, sponsoring or iGEM deadlines quickly receiving helpful answers. Read our monthly mentoring reports for further Details.

Mentoring report August JMU_Wuerzburg
Our mentoring partner from Munich always supported us concerning various tasks and provided us with help whenever necessary. At first, they helped us with working out regulations for our team to ensure that every team member is properly working on the project. Furthermore, Team Munich supported us with our InterLab Study by sending us their remaining silica beads for the experiment and answering all our remaining questions. They also advised us for the track selection, when we were not sure if we had to choose the track “diagnostic” or “open”. To help us improve our sponsoring outreach, they sent us their sponsoring brochure as an example for us to create our own. With the help of their guideline we improved the design of our brochure. We hope that this helps us getting more recognition from sponsors for our project. In addition, they gave us hints, how to reach out to more sponsors. Furthermore, Team Munich helped us with the wiki. We followed their idea of a premature wiki freeze to increase the amount of contents in our wiki.

Hallå!
We are the Dalhousie iGEM team from Halifax, Nova Scotia in Canada.  Our team is comprised of 15 undergraduate university students, 7 mentors and 2 faculty advisors.  We are from a range of programs making it a fun and interesting summer working with so many diverse backgrounds!
We wanted to tackle a local issue for our 2018 project: an increased amount of aluminium present in Nova Scotia’s freshwater systems due to acid rain.  These increased aluminum levels have been responsible for environmental challenges such as a decline in the Atlantic salmon population.  Our goal for the season is to develop a sensitive and inexpensive bacterial biosensor with Caulobacter that can detect toxic levels of aluminum.  This biosensor can be developed into a “point-of-care” diagnostic for Nova Scotia rivers at risk and would be more accessible to community groups that protect Nova Scotia rivers.
Good luck with your project!

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015," specific characteristic that we could do directed evolution on- finding a high temperature functioning mutant is a possibility, but many Keratinases have already been identified from hot-spring bacteria (I think, might be wrong on this) that naturally function at high temperatures; simply finding a mutant that ""has greater activity"" doesn't seem particularly fruitful since the main problem isn't low activity intrinsic to the enzyme but instead its recombinant overexpression at industrially useful levels. We also tried looking at was possible applications of using the byproduct of the reaction besides chicken feed (the degraded feather waste is sometimes reused as feed for chickens), maybe to make a useful biomaterial or something- but had no luck after a decent amount of searching. Of course, it would be cool if we could get an actually functional Biobrick of any given Keratinase in the registry, so that by itself would be a great potential goal for you- we just wanted to go beyond that. Obviously recombinant Keratinases have been successfully expressed in many other contexts/papers by multiple different approaches, so it is definitely possible. Also, if you find anything else that we missed, that would be cool too- for instance we hadn't thought of the wastewater plant application. Let me know if we can help you with anything else, as we would definitely be interested in collaborating/helping to mentor your team. We'd definitely be very interested to find out what approach your team ends up going with this project. I'm sure you've read some papers on Keratinases already, but I've attached the reading that I've found to be most helpful in terms of overall orientation in the field (starts Chapter 33, p. 881). Sorry if I went too detailed into things- I had a bit of time between experiments so decided to elaborate a bit. Hope this was helpful.

Hi,
Firstly we would like to thank you for giving us so much advice. We have already designed our biobrick for this year, but will take many of these considerations into thoughts for upcoming years. We had some questions about the cleaving of the feathers. You said that a Keratinase alone could not cleave the disulfide bonds of the feathers, but would that cleavage be possible if first we put the feathers through a manual mechanical treatment beforehand, to allow for them to be broken down as much as they can be when we put them into the Keratinase solution? We had thought about this when brainstorming.We also wondered how you would implement the enzyme, or the bacteria safely in the poultry industry",TRUE,UChicago,Advice,Text shows the email exchange between of chicago member and OLS team's project.

We were mentored by iGEM Team IIT Kanpur 2018 in troubleshooting few issues we faced while working on our project. Team IIT Kanpur is working on degrading SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulphate) in water, which is in principle similar to our project of degrading paan stains. So we approached them for a few brainstorming sessions via emails and Skype calls. We discussed various aspects of our projects right from project design, modelling to interlab and human practices.   Team IIT Kanpur also helped us in troubleshooting issues we faced while cloning by suggesting some changes in our cloning protocols. We were keen to do modelling with their help but could not do it because of time constraints.

Calgary,2017," viewed using UV light.
Figure 2. Final results of the E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 plates after the addition of DNAzyme. No bright fluorescence can be detected throughout the plates. The areas circled in red indicate the location in which the DNAzyme was dispensed on the quadrants containing the growth of E. coli DH5α (left) and B. subtilis WB800 (right).
Conclusion
We did not see the expected results, despite our troubleshooting efforts; therefore, further troubleshooting of this collaboration with iGEM McMasterU is required, as we did not observe the expected result. Fluorescence should only be detected within the quadrant containing E. coli DH5α and not in any of the other sections. As shown in Figure 2, no fluorescence can be seen in any quadrants of the two plates. There is a slight change in agar colour that can be seen in the circled area of the section labelled as B. Sub, for B. subtilis WB800. However, it is unclear whether this change in colour was caused by the DNAzyme or other factors. Due to limited amounts of DNAzyme sent by iGEM McMasterU , we were unable perform this experiment again.
We could look into using a Typhoon Imager, which was the suggested viewing device, in order to better match the McMaster University protocol. Due to the constraint of time, we were unable to find a laboratory that had this equipment available for use by us. By using this technology, we would be able to better troubleshoot this protocol by analyzing results under specific parameters, such as absorbance, that a traditional UV light cannot provide.
Throughout the process of this wet lab collaboration, we were able to test the DNAzyme, named GLOWzyme, synthesized by iGEM McMasterU , and assess the plausibility of incorporating it into our PHB system on Mars. Further testing is required to determine the efficiency of the DNAzyme to detect the presence of E. coli, which will provide insight as to whether we should integrate GLOWzyme into our system or look for other possible detection methods.
In addition, if the GLOWzyme system is to be incorporated into our project, there are two design elements that will need to be addressed. Firstly, the DNAzyme system has to be engineered in a way where little effort from the astronauts is required to maintain its working capacity. Also, a secondary system will be required to be hybridized to the GLOWzyme system such that when an E. coli leak is detected",TRUE,McMasterU,Material Transfer,Mcmaster shared material with calgary - but there is mention of how the experiment was unsuccessful and the challenges to incorporate it into their project,ts,

Overview
As a software team, we felt obligated to help other team with our expertise in software development and data processing. Besides, for experiments aspect, we thought we have plenty of experience to learn from others. Thus, we decided to join the community vigorously and reached out for 4 registered teams this year in traditional tracks: SCUT-China_A , NJU-China , Hong_Kong_HKUST , and SYSU-CHINA . And we also worked with SCAU-CHINA who will participant iGEM next year (They conduct their project for two years) for holding a synthetic biology conference on their campus.
SCUT-China-A
Background & Demand
We met SCUT-China_A in April on a meet-up meeting among teams in Southern China. This year they use the Mer-merr bi-direction promoter to sense mercury (Hg) in the environment. If the concentration of Hg transcend a threshold, Hg can repress the repressor of cds of SRRz protein, which will lead to the expression of SRRz protein. Cells lysis process could be detected because the release of the beta-galactosidase which is not able to spread cross the cell membrane at a normal situation will trigger the chromogenic reaction of oNPG whose tube will turn yellow. Since they were not aware of whether the design could work and the approximate range of expression level of the SRRz gene before the experiment, they reached out for us to do a simulation for their genetic circuits.
Solution & Result
We built a model for their project using the same algorithm that utilized in our software simulation section.

5th CCiC
The 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (2018 CCiC)  was one of them. This year, it was held by ShanghaiTech University in 8.28-31. We delivered a formal presentation and explaining our projects in front of other teams both on the stage and by the poster exhibition. Judges also provided us with ideas on the demonstration of our project. We also communicated with other teams, exchanged our ideas about projects and posters design, and helped other teams deal with bottlenecks. We had great fun in CCiC!

iGEM-Team FAU_Erlangen
For the Erlangen - Team we translated a text into Austrian dialect. They used this text as subtitle for their project video on youtube. Therefore, they sent us a text in English and we translated the text into Austrian-German. In addition, they implanted an Easter egg of our team into this video. (Perhaps you will find it)
Austrian Slang Translation
Original Text: Life itself depends on a huge variety of enzymatically catalyzed reactions. For example, in your liver, multiple enzymes break down the polysaccharide glycogen into its better processable subunit glucose-6-phosphate, which acts as an essential energy source in the body.
In general enzyme cascades can be imagined as various process steps in a company. Think of every enzyme as an employee in an office. When an order is placed, a chain of process steps is triggered, leading to the eventual fulfillment of the order. The first employee fulfills his task and then passes the order on to the next employee in the process chain, who passes it on to the next and the next… and the next…
Unfortunately, the office layout is not optimized and we have long pathways between the different office rooms. This leads to significant delays.

The presentations were followed by two seminars on Intellectual Property and the permanent exhibition of a drone model provided by the Civic Drone startup company.
The event also included several social gatherings between the teams such as breakfast, a picnic and a gathering after the Meet Up. We believe, as one of the organizing team, that these moments were also of great importance since they allowed the teams to know each other professionally and individually, an essential step towards a full engagement with the iGEM ideal of partnership.

The team was present at the great European Experience 2016 in Paris, a European meet-up organized by iGEM IONIS and iGEM EVRY teams. This event was a big gathering of European iGEM teams where everyone could meet and talk about their projects. We had the opportunity to present the first scratch of our final poster. Also this meet-up helped the iGEM teams to start new collaborations. The event was followed by conferences of researchers and experts of Synthetic Biology. The conferences ended with the inspiring speech of Randy Rettberg.

To know about the exact situation of antibiotic resistance in the hospital, we visited Doctor Gong Yali, who works at the burn department in the Southwest Hospital. She did a lot of researches related to antibiotic resistance. She introduce that currently antibiotic resistance is a really urgent issue that needed to be treated seriously. For example, one of her researches demonstrated that the Acinetobacter baumannii was resistant to many antibiotics. We introduced our project and explained our goal of establishing a markerless integration visual selection system. She agreed with our idea and praised us for concerning antibiotics resistance. She compared the counter selection with our visual selection system and discussed with us about their value, on the basis of which she gave her advice. Thanks to her guidance, we had a better understanding of antibiotic resistance and we were enlightened to do more.

""What I cannot create I do not understand.""

Collaborations
One of the biggest opportunities in iGEM is the contact and collaboration between teams of different backgrounds, which makes it possible to get inputs from various points of views and to establish a network of young scientists with the same interests. We took advantage of this opportunity and established contacts to teams from several continents.
Stockholm
Since the very beginning of our iGEM summer we were in continuous contact with the team from Stockholm. We realized soon that our projects were going into a similar direction, both focusing on cancer detection in samples of bodily fluids with the help of engineered bacteria that will bind to cancer cells. In contrast to our project, Stockholm’s ABBBA is focused on the detection of one specific type of cancer at a time. In several Skype meetings we exchanged our ideas about the best possible setup for single cell analysis and signal integration of the bacteria upon binding to a cancer cell. We provided the team from Stockholm with inputs on microfluidics as a setup for the final analysis and they helped us when we were struggling with the recovery of our gene fragments. The best opportunity for joining forces was the rather extensive experience in mammalian cell culture and bacterial-mammalian coculture our team had gathered in the course of our project.

COLLABORATIONS
Collaborations and Outreach
In iGEM Uppsala we believe that collaboration and outreach is an important part of our project. Helping out other iGEM teams, but also asking for help when we need it, is as important as anything else in a successful project. This year was no different. We collaborated with teams all around the world in our webinars and in a postcard challenge. Additionally, we also had collaborations a bit closer to home. Such as in June we took part in the Nordic iGEM Conference (NIC) in Copenhagen. We also collaborated with other Swedish teams during our iGEM run. The biggest collaboration there was the organization of a panel discussion with the Stockholm team. We also helped iGEM Lund with their newly established team that is having their first run in 2017. Of course there is no way we could have done iGEM without receiving some help! Here we would like to thank all the teams from Sweden, Denmark and Finland for giving us constant insight and answering the burning questions we had. Also, a special thank you to iGEM Stockholm for helping us with clarifications around the InterLab study.
Now, let’s take a more detailed look into the collaboration we had this year!
Webinars
This year our team wanted to discover a bit more about the ethical part of our project and science in general. After some discussion with the ethics experts at our university we felt a need to talk with other iGEM team. Therefore, we decided to host three webinars with topics relating to ethics in science.
These webinars were based on our chapters in the ethics guidelines and the answers given by the teams were taken into consideration for designing our guidelines. The three webinars topics were Social Responsibility, Genetic Engineering and Property Rights. Five teams from all around the globe participated in each webinar and discussed three questions about the topic, shared their opinions and experiences. The sessions were live streamed on YouTube and the recording can be found at iGEM Uppsala´s YouTube channel .

We collaborated with other iGEM teams in two primary ways: providing data through surveys and receiving assistance in dealing with a growing team from Cornell iGEM.  We provided data to the IIT Kanpur iGEM Team for their project that worked with other aspects of water pollution, namely detergent degradation, which is one area we are interested in as a team.
Perhaps most significantly, we also collaborated with the Cornell iGEM team after a member of our lab met with, and was able to tour the Cornell iGEM Lab spaces over the summer! This initial interaction and discussion of how the Cornell iGEM team is organized led to future collaboration between our two teams looking at how as a team we can practically implement some of the strategies Cornell iGEM has used to manage their large team size. We have been excited to have a large influx of members this fall, but have struggled to effectively communicate and delegate assignments for the team. As a result, the methods for team member evaluation, establishment of sub-team leads, and meeting schedules with the various sub-team leads that we received from Cornell iGEM have aided us greatly in setting more concrete standards for communication and team operation. Additionally, we have been trying to find a way to better ingrain our iGEM team into our institutions research program and with some help from the Cornell team we have made significant progress in setting standards of evaluation and a more defined structure for our team. This necessary structure and method of evaluation were previously lacking in our team, but with the suggested revisions suggested we will now be able to be more formally recognized by our home institution and receive official acknowledgement for our work.
Finally, we have also been immensely grateful to collaborate with a team of software developers at our home institution, W.A.S.D., to construct and implement our Wiki!

The collaboration with TJU
We started our contact with team TJU from the very beginning of the summer. Since both teams are working on the MFC system, we have shared a lot of experience on it, including the MFC device setup, medium condition control and part characterization. Additionally, we had lots of online and offline discussion with them.
In the middle of the project, we came to Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering (Tianjin University) to have a project seminar with them. During the discussion, we knew that they have constructed a lactate producing part named ldhE. However, their characterization of this part was faced with some problem. To be specific, engineered E.coli strain bearing the ldhE part showed little difference with the wild type. (shown as follows)
Fig.1 The production of lactate in MG1665-WT. The cells were cultured in 37C for 15h and the lactate concentration was measured by HPLC.
For the lactate producing system, we have helped team TJU to optimize and characterize the ldhE part. From their introduction, we know that LDH is an enzyme catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate with NADH serving as the coenzyme. Initially, they intended to introduce high-yield u L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhA) from Lactobacillus, which could produce a relatively larger amount of L-lactate for Shewanella. Consequently, we decided to focus on the assistant method to help them resolve the problem.
After some consultant, we noticed that the wild type E. coli's LDH reaction is not as competitive as the reaction through PFL, which might result in the ineffectiveness of ldhE.[1] Therefore, knockout of the PFL related genes will contribute to redistribute the metabolic flux. In addition, we searched in the part registry of IGEM and found the part BBa_K341458 and part BBa_K341002, which revealed a more effective and easy-to-use method for gene knockout.

Groningen,2018," participate in the biohackathon and set to brainstorming. As we were throwing around some ideas for the hackathon in our office, some of our lab experts came to us. They told us they were making buffers for the lab, and that they were wondering if it would be possible to automate this task. This initial thought spawned the idea of buffy the bufferbot, our automatic buffer adjusting robot.
Soon we flew to Vilnius, Lithuania and were greeted by the the Vilnius iGEM team’s charming Lina and Ieva, who graciously hosted us during the weekend. The biohackathon took part from friday till sunday, and was concluded by pitches from every team. It was decided that we would create the brains of “buffy” at the hackathon and work on the hardware aspects of the project after we returned to Groningen. We presented a demo of our project, which uses carefully designed machine intelligence to keep track of the pH of the buffer and to make predictions of how best to adjust this pH to reach the desired goal. After careful deliberations, the judges awarded our team the prize for the best pitch!
Concluding the hackathon, there was a fruitful meeting between the present iGEM teams, Groningen, Lund, Helsinki and the Vilnius team themselves. We discussed our projects and offered each other useful feedback. We look forward to seeing all the teams again during the Giant Jamboree and we are especially grateful for the Vilnius team’s amazing hospitality.

UCAS,2017," expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

After several times of discussion with us, BNU-China understood the background of our modeling part and the problems they were about to settle. Meanwhile, they helped us to find some bugs in modeling, such as the inconsistency of some variable values in each group of equations, and the problem that parameters of some equations don’t accord with the fact.
First of all, BNU-China adjusted a series of independent variables and corrected the parameters. Then they found the solution of the equations by applying the Runge-Kutta Method. The method could be used in differential equation system in different dimensions with high efficiency. According to concentration of hydroxyl ion in equation ABCDE groups, pH of each equation was obtained and was used to judge the termination condition. In equation C and equation F, concentration of specific substances were used to stop the conditions. The initial value of each equation group was the terminal value of the last equation group. By this way they achieved the whole cyclic process and finally got dynamic image of pH(Fig.5).
Fig. 5 The dynamic change of pH during the regulation process
The initial concentration of OH- is 0.2×10-6, and the initial pH is higher than 7.0, so the whole reaction starts from Group A, and the reactions are in the order of Group A, B, C, D, E, F, A, B, C, D, E, F.
○ The detection of protein NhaA and NhaB by BNU_China.
BIT-China’s project this year is to regulate the pH in fermentation environment and to strengthen the competence of microorganism to survive in both acid and alkali. Therefore we want to express two kinds of membrane proteins, NhaA and NhaB. Considering the fact that membrane proteins are particularly hard to express and detect, BNU_China helped us to establish this part. To this end, they reviewed amounts of relevant articles and consulted several professors in this field, on which basis they tried various protocols to express, purify and detect NhaA as well as NhaB.

MUSE Bio
MUSE Bio is a local start-up company based in Boulder, CO that uses powerful bioinformatics and novel molecular approaches to generate low-cost libraries of thousands of designer protein, pathway, and genome variants. In teaming up with MUSE Bio, we were able to generate a library of genomic edits for EutS and library of naturally activated EutSMNLK compartments.
CRISPR genome editing
Using the CRISPR based CREATE system designed by MUSE, we were able to extend the edits we were making to our plasmid to the genomic level. We did this by expressing the native EutSMNLK compartment in E. Coli cells by introducing an IPTG inducible promoter and then transforming the cells with two sets of genomic edit libraries, provided by MUSE. The first was a library in which each amino acid was replaced with the every other possible amino acids, one at a time. The second provided library contains the amber stop codon at each codon within the genome. With the special tRNA expressed by the Schultz plasmid, the amber stop codon can actually be used to introduce azobenzene to the compartment. The collaboration with MUSE has allowed the team to extend the range and shorten the time required for adding mutations to our system as well as will yield a comparison of the engineered EutS protein to the native EutSMNLK.
Muse Library Integration
We are hopeful for mutations in the genome that create a successful nano- compartment and may improve the stability of the compartment. Ethanolamine is toxic to the cells and is metabolized in Eut complexes. To test the mutations, the two libraries will be grown on ethanolamine plates, with varying concentrations of ethanolamine. Only mutants that can successfully create the compartment will survive on these plates and, theoretically, the plasmids with a beneficial mutation will be found only on the plates with a high concentration of ethanolamine. To test which mutations survived as well as the frequency of these, we will use high throughput sequencing to verify the mutations and quantify which mutations yielded as successful compartment. These data will provide insight into the location of the genome in which mutations are favorable to form this compartment and set up further research into the use of these mutated compartments.

USTC-Softeware and USTC are like sisters and brothers for we both are USTCers, for we recruited and brainstorm together and for we went through all the processes beside the other. We frequently meet and exchange our advice on each other's project.
This year USTC-Software build a software to find the center of a circular interference pattern (available online, https://fringe.herokuapp.com/#userconsent# ). And they tested their softeware using Spring. After testing, their arithmetic turned out pretty quick, but they also found some disadvantages. By finding the closest two points on two interference lines and lining up them, the center is on the line. But if there only part of the interference line, the result comes out wrong. So the accuracy strongly depend on the lines you chose.

USTC-Softeware and USTC are like sisters and brothers for we both are USTCers, for we recruited and brainstorm together and for we went through all the processes beside the other. We frequently meet and exchange our advice on each other's project.
This year USTC-Software build a software to find the center of a circular interference pattern (available online, https://fringe.herokuapp.com/#userconsent# ). And they tested their softeware using Spring. After testing, their arithmetic turned out pretty quick, but they also found some disadvantages. By finding the closest two points on two interference lines and lining up them, the center is on the line. But if there only part of the interference line, the result comes out wrong. So the accuracy strongly depend on the lines you chose.

Besides that, we also helped them with biology, as almost all of them major in computer science and math. They build software for biologists so they must know our needs. All in all, our suggestions are extremely useful for them.

CityU_HK,2015," 3.9, GFP specific nanobody becomes the limiting reagent, so the final molarity of the nanobody-antigen complex equals to the initial molarity of the GFP specific nanobody.
Another observation is that, as the concentration of the antigen increases, the rate of the reaction (i.e. formation of the nanobody-antigen complex) reaches equilibrium faster (Figure 3.5 to Figure 3.9). This can be explained by the increased forward reaction rate which depends on the concentration of the GFP specific nanobody and antigen (GFP).

Fudan University: We partnered up with Fudan University to complete the Interlab. Since our school’s plate reader was unable to measure fluorescence, Fudan University’s iGEM team was kind enough to let our team use their lab and borrow their plate reader. They provided us with all the necessary lab materials and instruments needed to complete the study. We would like to extend our sincere gratitude and appreciation for all the members on the Fudan iGEM team for providing us assistance on the Interlab.",TRUE,Fudan,Material Transfer,Fudan provided NYU with lab materials,ts,

By mentored from college team, we could get a lot of useful advices not only for our experiment but also for our overall progress for IGEM. We also learned that sharing different genuine thoughts and applying different ideas from many people is the crucial way to improve our project.
3. YouTube Collaboration
We contacted with East Chapel Hill High school team in North Carolina through our facebook page and made YouTube collaboration. We first contacted through our facebook page and decided to make tutorials of lab techniques and lab safety with many other teams which is called Tasty-Style Lab Technique Videos. We could choose any of our lab techniques from our experiment and create a short 1-2 minutes video. So our team created a ‘Ligation prep’ video for about 2 minutes and made collaboration with Peshawar 2017, UNBC 2017 and East Chapel Hill 2017. We first discussed what technique to choose and when we made the lab meeting, we made this video. Not only our team but also each of team created a great lab video. For Peshawar 2017, they made a transformation procedure video, serial dilution method for East Chapel Hill 2017 and Agarose gel method for UNBC 2017. By doing this collaboration, we could not only look through other teams method for their experiment but also how different methods could be use in different application of synthetic biology.
4. Wiki Revisions
To potentially improve our team’s wiki, our team basically checked many other teams wikis and vice versa. After the process of contacting with many teams, we finally get to contact with igemusp(Brazil) team, British_Columbia IGEM team, UiOslo_Norway team, and Bordeaux team. They sent us some comments after reviewing our wiki and our team reflected the comments and made revisions. During revisions, we pointed out improvements of each other’s’ organization of the wiki such as defining terms before the result section to trivial mistakes like grammar errors. Our team was surprised by imaginative ideas and visually conspicuous graphic and was able to receive innovative ways to portray our project on wiki better. We were also able to get inspirations from these teams’ projects by going through their wikis. Especially, in team Britain Columbia, we were really surprised by using  CRISPR/Cas9 to combat virulent bacteria although they were lack of collaboration and exposure of validation of modeling.

REC – CHENNAI
Team REC_CHENNAI is a debut team in iGEM and it is for this reason that we decided to mentor them. From helping them design their gBlocks to troubleshooting experimental problems, we guided them in all possible ways by informing them about the intricacies of iGEM.In addition, we also collaborated with them and conducted the Biofair as part of our Human Practices. We also built a quorum sensing coupled temperature sensitive system for the contolled release of their anti-microbial peptide. We also provided them BL-21 and DHP-alpha strain.
UCL
Since neither of the teams had any prior experience in mathematical modelling, Team UCL and Team SVCE_CHENNAI regularly collaborated and sent each other useful resources on how to model biological pathways and reactions.
Once we started forming the reaction pathway, we exchanged our differential equations and parameter values. Then each team provided valuable feedback to the other as to how we could better our respective models while at the same time making the information that we provide easy for anyone to understand.
LUND
LUND played a key role in forming the reactions and differential equations for our mathematical model, as we were new to modeling and hence required help. They also made sure to guide us every step of the way during our whole modeling process and to check for any corrections while helping us to formulate our final model.
Nawi_GRAZ
Both the teams, NAWI_GRAZ and SVCE_CHENNAI  were working on pH as well as temperature regulatory systems, which provided an  avenue for collaboration. Since we had some issues with changing pH in our medium, NAWI_GRAZ team helped us out by giving us some useful suggestions. In-turn, they seeked our help in solving the precipitation issues that they had faced while preparing the M9 media. In addition to this, we also decided to test each others pH parts and compare the results obtained.
