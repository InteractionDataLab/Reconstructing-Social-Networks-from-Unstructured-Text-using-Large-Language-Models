Trinity College Dublin & University College London
This year, Cork iGEM collaborated with both the Trinity College Dublin and the University College London iGEM teams. The Basehunter system was put together in an anonymous way so that the participating teams could not see what reagents were present or absent in order to avoid biased results. Cork iGEM put together tubes containing mastermixes and labelled them using unbiased characters such as A,B and C that were then sent via post. The participating iGEM teams agreed to test the systems and give feedback regarding the protocol. We were unfortunately unable to obtain test results from the UCL team due to time constraints. They did however successfully receive the kit. Mariola Sebastián gave us feedback regarding out Basehunter System,""I really liked that the tubes were labeled with numbers and letters. I think its great because you don't need to know what each one contains in order to follow the protocol, which makes it more accessible, and the simple labeling makes them easier to find and work with. In the final version of the kit. I think it would be great if you could add more of the needed things, like sterile plates and sterile LB Media, to speed and simplify the process"".
Mariola from UCL iGEM working on our protocol
The aim of this collaboration was to investigate if the Basehunter system could be both easily transported and explained with a protocol. A written protocol and a video protocol were prepared. The video protocol can be seen below and the written protocol can be seen here .
Trinity tested the system and these were the results obtained in the blind testing; Sent to the team were 6 tubes containing the HPV 55bp Detector. Tubes 1-3 were to be positive controls, while tubes 4-6 were to be negative. This was not disclosed to the experimenting team at TCD.
Feedback from the team was positive and they reported - “The Protocols were very clear indeed and easy to follow, and it helped greatly that there was an alternative to using the PCR machine when incubating the coloured tubes.”
These results proved that the detector could be posted to other labs and that the protocols were simply followed. In addition, results achieved were consistent with those obtained in our lab at UCC. See figures 1 and 2 for results reported by TCD.
Also, to assist TCD, we researched into"

Aachen,2017,"chiers held a guest lecture about his field of work and the future of biotechnology which in his opinion lies in in silico simulations.
Next up was a Dr. Maximilian Hörner from the University of Freiburg, who talked about optical control of signalling in mammalian cells.
Team Cologne Düsseldorf presented their idea on how to modify peroxysomes in yeast cells to make an artificial compartment. They want to use their artificial compartment to produce Nootkaton, the natural occurring aroma substance in grapefruit which is used to prevent mosquito bites that transmit dangerous pathogens like malaria or the Zika virus.
Next was Team Bielefeld with their idea to expand the genetic code with an artificial nucleotide which can be used to incorporate multiple non-canonical amino acids into proteins.
Dr. Tobias Erb showcased his institute’s efforts to improve photosynthesis by developing a synthetic metabolic pathway to fix carbon dioxide.
If you ever had troubles with clogged drainpipes in your shower or bathtub, Team Stuttgart is working on an innovative approach to solve your problems. They are developing a genetically modified E. coli which will remove hair and fat residues from your drain, while producing a pleasant citrus or rose scent.
In the end, we had an ethical discussion led by Christopher Coenen whose expertise is to assess the impact of new technologies on the general public. The discussion mostly circled around green biotechnology, which is a very controversial issue in Western Europe.
iGEM Aachen - iGEM Worcester
Research Collaboration
In the research phase of our project, there was also an exchange with other iGEM teams who had decided to work in the field of environment and water pollution. During the first Skype talks with the      iGEM Team Worcester it soon became clear that there were many overlaps between our projects.
At this time, the iGEM Team Worcester worked intensively on a biosensor system in which organisms can display the lead content in a body of water and can also absorb this lead to clean the water from heavy metals.
In the discussions we found out that both projects relate to a local problem in the region of the respective team. The question quickly arose as to whether this problem with the drainage of      drinking water is also a problem in Germany and whether American waste water is contaminated with salts as well. Because both teams had difficulties with this research, which was also due      to language barriers with German literature team Worcester needed, we opted for an investigation collaboration between our teams.
We investigated the contamination of drinking water with lead in Germany and translated, among other things, the German Drinking Water Ordinance, the government's information material to     lead"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid"
Aachen,2015," each team presented their project followed by a little discussion and receiving feedback. We were fortunate to get valuable ideas concerning using our pumps in microfluidics. As a consequence, we adjusted the design of our devices and customized the control program software to support this field of application.
Some weeks later, we could return the favor:  Team Bielefeld was searching for different sources of water to test their genetically engineered machine. Therefore, we took two samples, one from a pont in a parc of our city and an additional sample from the famous warm sulfurous terrestrial spring, which was already the favourite place of Charlemagne the founder of Aachen.

Survey and tubefront Feedback from Team Heidelberg
In July, Michael visited team Heidelberg and introduced them to the prototype of tubefront . At that point we were preparing a survey on laboratory organization and the feedback by team Heidelberg helped a lot to improve the questions of the survey. On their collaborations page they also wrote a nice review of that early version of tubefront.
Cooperation with industry
Interview with Sunfire CTO Christian von Olshausen
Sunfire
The sunfire company was one of the reasons to go for our project. We first met them at the research center in Jülich, where they convinced us of their efficient technical conversion of CO2 and water to methanol and other fuels. With such an efficient area independent way to get a sustainable, high energy chemical, it was a natural decision to find a way to integrate it into the bioeconomy.

Cargill
Early in the project we visited a production plant of Cargill. They process around 2.000 tonnes of maize each day. Their main products are starch, sugar and a prestep of vitamin C. We got an excellent impression of the current starch industry in europe and globally, including resources, prices, products and customers. Though they were interested in our project, they did not want to sponsor us because of the difficult reputation of genetic engineering especially in the food industry. However, they helped us with all our questions regarding the starch industry throughout the project.

Macquarie_Australia,2017," absorbance of proteins.
A) Lane 2 contains gRNA (trRNA and crRNA) corresponding to two bands at ~150bp and 50bp. Lane 2 (B and C) contains target PCR product (~950bp). B) Lanes 3-5 contain commercial Cas9 (with nuclease activity). The gel shifts indicate the binding of gRNA to commercial Cas9 (lane 3), specific binding of Cas9/gRNA complex to PCR product (lane 4) and nuclease activity of Cas9 causing cleavage of the PCR product (~800 and ~200bp lane 5). Lane 7 contains WT pre-incubated gRNA, the gRNA gel shift, similar to lane 3, suggests binding of gRNA to protein. Lane 8 contains WT incubated with gRNA and PCR product, a protein shift suggests specific dCas9 binding. Lane 9 contains denatured WT and no gRNA complex can be observed suggesting strong binding of dCas9 to protein and no cleavage of the PCR product. D) and E) The coomassie stain (E) displays the band weights of the purified truncated proteins (highest intensity). The smears in pre-incubated samples (lanes 3, 6 and 9) indicate gRNA binding to protein. The disappearance of higher protein bands in incubated enzyme and PCR samples (lanes 4, 7 and 10) suggests dCas9 binding the target sequence. The high intensity bands of ~1000bp show excess PCR product not being bound by dCas9 and in denatured samples (lanes 5, 8 and 11) no cleavage of the PCR product is observed. All samples contain faint lower bands indicative of gRNA, suggesting binding is not as strong as in WT but still occurring.
Manchester Collaboration
H2ydroGEM collaborated with iGEM teams from nine other countries (EU, USA, Brazil, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Korea, Canada and India) to create a comprehensive document on GMM (Genetically Modified Materials) legislation around the world. Each team conducted extensive research into the laws surrounding GMM inclusion and labelling in commercial products. This research was then collected and summarised to produce integrated responses to the following six questions:
1. What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?
2. Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?
3. What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?

SMMU-China,2018," The different views of the masters on synthetic biology inspired us to look into the problem we met in our research in another way.
As a preview, three of our team members gave a presentation of our project in English and answered questions from judges and other iGEMers attending to the meeting. During the process, we found many drawbacks of our program, such as the bio-safety parts and modeling parts. We were suggested to hand over the safety form to the organizing committee of iGEM due to the use of AAV. We were also recommended to build a mathematical modeling, which is closely attached to our research, to guide the production and ensure the effects of the antibodies. These parts were not considered in our project because we were not familiar with the rules and the competition. But, luckily, these problems were pointed out by the judges and iGEMers. In the poster presentation, our team visited many outstanding teams’ posters to learn about their experiment design and other good points in human practice, mathematical modeling and so on.
Near the end of CCIC, we joined in the round table conference with Meagan Lizarazo, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the iGEM Foundation. In the conference, Mrs. Meagan shared us experience on the Giant Jamboree, like how to deliver a good speech, attentions on the trip to America and so on. Through CCIC, we learned more about iGEM not only in the attentions and points, but also attracted by the positive research atmosphere. Everyone in the iGEM team had tried their best to fight for more and more achievements and came up with new and better ways to fix the teams’ trouble.

Frozen stock of each strain about to be put into the incubator for overnight growth.
Our team worked closely with Vanderbilt University’s iGEM team over the summer to help them troubleshoot issues they had been having regarding a promoter and to come up with questions to ask our panel.
Vanderbilt had issues concerning part K314100, which is a constitutive promoter. There were concerns that the promoter had nonhomogeneous expression despite its identity as a constitutive promoter. Additionally, Vanderbilt asked us to test another part, R0010, under the same conditions. We took their parts and induced them with IPTG to determine their effectiveness. We ran a total of 6 induction experiments, three using our lab’s induction protocol and three using their lab’s induction protocol. The parts were transformed and induced in DH10B as well as MG1655. The specific protocols we used can be found under the “Materials and Methods” section of the wiki.
Our protocol required the growth of a stationary phase culture to begin the experiment. After leaving a tube of culture sitting in the incubator overnight, we took that culture out the following day and diluted it in a new culture to an OD of 0.1. We grew that culture for another 2 hours. Afterwards, we prepared 8 serially diluted IPTG concentrations in corresponding mixtures of LB and antibiotic. Then, having pipetted those solutions to different columns in a 96 well plate, we pipetted the newly grown cultures into their separate rows. We incubated 3 of these plates for 7 hours.

Similar to our project, team Exeter is working with a cell extract to translate proteins. They designed a synthetic toehold switch to detect specific RNA sequences. They aim to use that switch in a cell extract for further use in diagnostics. In terms of collaboration, we communicated via Skype and email. To help them to determine further applications of their project, we calculated the price for a single reaction of our crude cell extract in the size of their reaction and provided a table of contents.

UESTC-software,2016," up lots of their time and energy.
So they sought for our support of programming expertise. We carried forward the spirit of collaboration to solve their problems relying on our skills.
Solutions
In the communication process, our team members joined the lab to have an idea of what we could contribute. Through the analysis of the process and the dynamic combination of the varied data number, we decided to design an algorithm for the fast simulation and solve the complex work with MATLAB.
1.  We batched import data collected in the experiment to MATLAB to generate a matrix, which can give the results they need quickly and accurately. Besides, it can generate EXCEL files automatically to help them do further analysis.
2.  Another function is that the system can find out large data errors and remove these bad data. In this way, they don’t have to manually check, greatly improving the efficiency even more.
3.  On this basis, we also provided a further function of curve fitting. With smooth curve instead of scattered data points, it makes the results more intuitive, easier to understand and analyze.
Some results are shown in Fig.4 and Fig.5:
Fig.4. Enzyme activity data simulation.
Fig.5. Enzyme activity data analysis.
The program we designed helped UESTC-China reduce the time of data processing, made them come to conclusions and start next step as soon as possible.
Wet-lab help from UESTC-China
We cooperated with the team UESTC-China to accomplish the validation of our experiments. We thank our collaborator for helping us with patience and making such strong contribution to our work.
We created a platform for information storage in synthesized DNA. This coding tool can create a convenient DNA storage information workflow, so researchers can choose any file they want to encode and focus on synthesizing DNA. And we wanted to demonstrate our tools’ capabilities under real-world condition. So UESTC-China mentored us on how to design the gene sequence which contains the suitable restriction site. They helped us amplify the genes and put the genes into the plasmids. UESTC-China also transformed the plasmids into the E. coli TOP10 and extracted them from E. coli for sequencing.

Collaborations
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. With characterization of the production strain Vibrio natriegens we participated in an InterLab study and supported iGEM Team Marburg . Additionally, we recieved BioBricks from iGEM Team TU Darmstadt . Besides providing us the BioBricks, they gave us useful information about how to produce chitosan.
Vibrigens InterLab Study
Introduction
The iGEM Team in Marburg is focussing on a new potential host for synthetic biology: Vibrio natriegens. V. natriegens can reach higher maximum specific growth rates than the current standard organism Escherichia coli. For the collaboration study our team performed the InterLab Study Vibrigens. This method ensures reproducibility of the experiments in different laboratories. The procedure of this experiment is comparable with the iGEM InterLab Study.
The aim of the experiment was measuring fluorescence and OD600 of V. natriegens cells transformed with different devices.
Results and Discussion
First, electrocompetent V. natriegens cells were prepared, aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. The competent cells were used for transformation of six different devices, additionally one positive and one negative control (table 1).
Table 1: Devices and corresponding Part Number used in the experiment.
First colonies on the plates appeared 7 to 8 hours after plating. For further measurements two transformed colonies of each device were picked and inoculated for overnight culture.  The next day, OD600 was measured. The cultures were diluted to a target OD600 of 0.02 and incubated for another 3 hours. Samples were taken at 0 and 3 hours. OD600 (figure 1) and fluorescence (figure 2) were measured afterwards. All measurements were performed with BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader with a 96-well black flat bottom plate with clear bottom.

New England Biolabs Representative : Chris Cook
In the spring, a representative from New England Biolabs, Chris Cook, came to our school to discuss restriction enzymes and other products that we use in our lab.  The presentation was helpful not only on the scientific side, but also because he discussed career opportunities beyond a research lab.
Alverno California and CAPS_Kansas
Our team collaborated with Alverno Heights Academy, a fellow high school iGEM team in California, and the CAPS Kansas iGEM Team. We set up a video call with them and discussed our project as well as helped them with understanding the iGEM Jamboree, and emailed multiple times back and forth, answering questions about the process of competing in iGEM and various requirements for Jamboree.
Georgia State University
We collaborated with the Georgia State iGEM team in order to host our booth at the Maker Faire Atlanta. Members of GSU iGEM volunteered at the event and discussed their project with us during the breaks. They also generously donated materials we needed for our activities and were greatly helpful. We could not have hosted our booth without them!
Lambert High School: Engineering and MSA
In order to make our lightbox device, we collaborated with the engineering department at our school. A member of that department, David Park, helped adjust our existing blueprints and allowed us to use his 3-D printer. In addition, David also helped troubleshoot when we had problems assembling the lightbox and gave us ideas to improve future versions of it. We also collaborated with MSA, Lambert's very own Medical Science Academy, who helped us with events and volunteered for set-up and clean-up for our outreach.
iGEM Twitter Group
Thanks to Twitter, iGEM teams from all over the world are in a group chat where we can easily communicate and ask questions about iGEM, Jamboree, wiki, and much more! iGEM teams have easy access to other teams and can ask questions about their projects, send out surveys, or promote their apps/programs through this platform.

UCAS,2017," device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP"

We collaborated tightly with Wageningen UR and Pasteur Paris. Besides that, we also filled in a lot of surveys.
Wageningen
The collaboration between our team and the team from Wageningen consisted of two parts: Using a plate reader, they measured the spectrum of our fluorophores and in return, we imaged vescicles for them using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). You can read more about our collaboration on their wiki .
Transmission electron microscopy
The iGEM team of Wageningen wanted to encapsulate fluorophores in vesicles. To prove that they were indeed able to make the vesicles,                                  they needed pictures made by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to confirm the presence of the vescicles and characterize them.                                  Since the Wageningen team did not have access to a TEM, we made the images for them using the TEM.                                  Electron microscopy is an imaging technique that can acquire images with resolutions far above the optical limit due to the small wavelength"

6. USTC
Since the USTC did a project related to Shewanella last year, we contacted the team members of this iGEM team and they provided us with the wild type of Shewanella and the shuttle plasmid of Escherichia coli- Shewanella pYYDT. In addition, they also provided us with some experience and suggestions on the cultivation and integration of Shewanella.
7. NCHU_Taichung
Besides that we contacted team NCHU_Taichung and they gave us the shuttle plasmid of Rhodopseudomonas palustris-E. coli. Furthermore, they also gave some suggestions on the cultivation and transformation of Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In addition, since team NCTU_Taichung was the first time to participate in this competition, they may be lack of experience of modeling. Thus, they wrote several emails to ask our team members about this part. We gave assistance to them on structure and direction.
8. Tianjin
In the course of project researching, our team was fortunate to read a paper from Tianjin University, which is of great help to our project. Therefore, we contacted the students of team Tianjin and contacted their instructor. The instructor answered many questions about the paper patiently and gave some advice for our project. In late August of this year, our team's student, Cheng Long , had an opportunity to communicate with their iGEM team members about their programme which was focus on Shewanella , visit their laboratory and power generation equipment. Furthermore, this year team Tianjin has designed a synthetic biology picture book for children’s enlightenment. When they told us their intention, our team found that it was a meaningful thought and could help children know more about synthetic biology which was good for their growth. Therefore, our team came up with some suggestions on stories for their picture book.

Hamburg,2018," their gel proved to be resistant to dextranase, an enzyme specifically for the degradation of dextran, they asked us to try dissolve it under varying conditions.
There are two questions to be answered:
What conditions are ideal to dissolve the dextran gel while ensuring survival of embedded bacteria?
If the gel can be dissolved while embedded bacteria stay alive, what are implications for biosafety?
iGEM Eindhoven sent us their gel, and we developed strategies to dissolve it. Eindhoven told us that they were able to dissolve the gel at very low pH, which would not be a feasible environment for bacteria contained within. Based on this information, we set up two moderately acidic conditions: An Aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid at pH 3, at which E. coli is able to survive, but that is not realistic in most environments in which the gel would be used, and a solution of lactic acid at pH 3.6 1 . E. coli produces lactic acid both naturally, and at higher rates in our project 2 . While we do not think that a pH of 3.6 would occur evenly throughout the entire gel, overproduction of lactic acid may lead to locally raised lactic acid concentrations that come close to our artificial condition.  Additionally, we set up two basic conditions: the agarose-dissolving buffer from Thermo Fisher GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit at pH 8, and an aqueous solution of NaOH at pH 9.
Results
We incubated 190 mg gel pieces at 37 °C in 1 mL of aqueous solutions of NaOH, HCl, lactic acid and the Thermofischer GelEx-Kit Binding Buffer for 2 hours and checked for decomposition.
After two hours, the gel piece in aqueous NaOH-solution seems to slowly dissolve as indicated by a decrease of mass (165 mg after 2 h). In aqueous HCl-solution the gel seems to be stable (no change in mass after 2 h). In Thermo Fisher GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit Binding Buffer the gel seems to soak in the solution but not to decompose (215 mg after 2 h). In aqueous lactic acid solution the gel seems to be stable (no change in mass after 2 h).
After 24 h the gel pieces were weighed again. In aqueous NaOH-solution the gel further dissolved as indicated by a decrease of mass to 150 mg. In aqueous HCl solution the gel seems to be dissolving at a slower, but measurable rate to 170 mg."

This year, our program held tight to the ethos of collaborations. In the very beginning stage of brainstorming, we exchanged ideas with Team BITChina2017 about building biosensor in modified pheromone pathway in yeast, and obtained yeast modified by the team. While Team BIT-China2018 worked on their program this year, we reciprocally offered them help in modeling and data processing. Additionally, we cooperated with team Tsinghua in both stages of experiment and human practice, and hosted exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum in joint hands. We sincerely express our gratitude towards Team BIT-China and Team Tsinghua for their help and its profound assistance to our work.

Tuebingen,2015," regarding the modelling of the Dronpa activation with Team Valencia. Team Valencia attempted to implement the systems equations of their biological circuit with ‘pure/vanilla’ matlab. Our own project however required probabilistic elements due to the discrete nature of the population encoded sensor information. From our discussion with Team Valencia, we concluded that SimBiology was not the optimal tool for our task however team Valencia might profit from it. We profited insofar as our understanding of certain modelling elements was improved as well as mutually reviewed our implementations.
This exchange of ideas particularly improved the mathematical formulations, because the peer review process provided a necessary sanity check, and we could train how we should present the theoretic part to people that are unfamiliar with our projects.
Team UCSF kindly provided us with their Cadherin-construct from 2011, sent us the plasmid as well as sequencing it. Unfortunately we did not get to include this into our project. Nevertheless they did us a great favor and it was fun to collaborate with them!"
Bielefeld-Germany,2013," how to operate the MFC. Additionally we put nafion membranes, gaskets, carbon electrodes and injectors into a package and sent it to York. We hope that this support helped York to generate good results and finish their project.

iGEM-Team NRP-UEA-Norwich
The iGEM-Team from Norwich developed a biosensor which enables the identification of antimycin-producing strains of Streptomyctes. Therefore they asked us to send them soil samples from Bielefeld, which of course we did. The interesting soil samples of Bielefeld are shown below. We hope that our soil samples helped Norwich.

iGEM-Team UC Davis
The iGEM-Team UC-Davis 2013 wants to develop and implement an experimental data depot for BioBrick characterization data and kindly asked us to collaborate with them. They want to establish an easily accessible and comparative platform to share experimental data about BioBricks and are searching for other teams that are willing to help them establish standardized characterization methods. We tested their promoter characterization protocols on the Anderson promoter collection J230100-J230119. The plasmid backbone of these BioBricks J61002 is very suitable for promoter insertion between the XbaI and SpeI sites, which places the promoter upstream of a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene. Depending on the used promoter, the rfp-expression is in- or decreased, while the promoter strength can easily be characterized via fluorescence measurements.
Our team focused mainly on the second half of the collection, which comprises promoters with the below listed strengths.

We carried out an extended, 18-hour experiment , monitoring cell"
Amsterdam,2017," account for fluid dilution rate and passage of fumaric acid from the rumen, which are in vivo factors that do not occur in vitro. In vivo, cattle were fed about twice the amount of fumaric acid (20 g/kg DMI) to cattle as that used in the more recent study (12 g/kg DMI) and, surprisingly, methane production decreased by 23%. However, in that study, only two animals per treatment were used, and methane measurements were made using ventilated hoods, which are known to be problematic. Also note there were differences between basal diets in the studies. This influences the microbiomes and may affect the outcome of the study. The figure below shows the theoretical framework made by iGEM UNL, that demonstrates the diversion of hydrogen away from the methanogens and to the process of fumarate production which in turn produces succinate and propionate. It is known that the higher the propionate to acetate ratio, the less methane the cow produces (Mcginn et al. , 2004).
Figure 3. The theoretical framework of  the effect of fumarate on methane synthesis in the ruminants. The synthesis of succinate out of fumarate competes for H 2 with the synthesis of methane. With a reduced concentration of substrate H 2 for methane synthesis reaction, less methane will be formed. (Adapted from Morgavi et al. (2010))
Strategies to overcome the problem of anaerobic production
Another way to get fumarate into in the microbiome of cattle would be to have bacteria produce fumarate in a bioreactor, and then dry and directly mix them with cattle feed. This way, there is no need to extract fumarate from the cell mixture and we also overcome the problem of anaerobic production. We could try to test different types of microorganisms and see which would be the most efficient and cost-effective at producing fumarate. Once the cells have produced enough fumarate, we, dry them and feed them to the cattle. We could compare the proposed E. Coli mutants, that produce fumaric acid and cyanobacterial cells from iGEM team Amsterdam that produce fumarate and see which one is more efficient at producing and delivering fumarate. As we aim to reduce greenhouse gasses in both our projects, we think it would be sensible to define the most efficient producer as the one that is the most carbon efficient. As calculated by team Amsterdam, this will most likely be the Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria convert CO 2"

UCAS,2017," traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time"

Rewarding Collaborations
UC Davis and UC Santa Cruz iGem teams (Photo provided by the UC Davis iGEM Team)
We the UCSC iGEM Team were fortunate to have had the opportunity to engage in multiple rewarding collaborations with other talented, hard-working iGEM teams. Our collaboration story began at the 17th Annual UC Systemwide Bioengineering Symposium hosted by the Bioengineering Institute of California. The iGEM team at the University of California, San Diego, were kind enough to invite the UCLA iGEM team, the UC Davis iGEM team, and ourselves to meet at the Symposium in San Francisco. Each morning of the Symposium, June 13th-15th, we all met in a reserved room at the Symposium to present and discuss our projects with another. It was a valuable and much-appreciated opportunity to connect with other iGEM students, engage in exciting discussion, and form relationships with passionate, creative, and intelligent individuals. It was over the course of these few days that we first met the UC Davis iGEM team in person, who became our long-term collaborators over the course of the summer.
Due to both the UCSC and UC Davis iGEM teams using the same organism, B. subtilis, collaboration at a more technical level was possible. Discussion with UC Davis helped our team make specific strain decisions for our project. From them we then acquired B. subtilis 3NA and B. subtilis PY79 . Using the same organism also allowed protocol collaboration, where we confirmed that electroporation was the best general approach for transforming a non-sporulating strain of B. subtilis, such as 3NA. Although it turned out that for integrative plasmids such as ours natural transformation is more optimal, this collaboration gave us a better understanding of the specific strains we had chosen.
Santa Cruz Farmers Market
In collaboration with the UC Davis iGEM team, we also conducted a research study on public opinion for the definition of ‘Natural’, and its relationship to GMOs. Each team traveled to the local farmer markets in our respective cities to interview the key demographic that we hoped had the greatest connection towards ‘all-natural’ movement, and could provide the best insight into these key questions. This intervention collected valuable information on public opinion, in addition to"

Aachen
During the German wide Meetup we discovered that our new immobilization matrix, the Peptidosomes, would fit perfectly to the goal the iGEMers from Team Aachen want to reach. They are modifying the baker yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the aim that it can uptake salts, mainly NaCl. With this skill the yeast could help to e.g. purify industrial process water before it is released into the environment.
As discussed in our safety section it is not easy to get a permission to use genetically modified organisms (GMOs) outside of S1 laboratories. Our Peptidosome could be a further step towards the permission for placing them on the market or a deliberate release. Working as a safety tool, additionally to the membrane system Team Aachen developed, the Peptidosomes could prevent the escape of the GMOs into the environment.  To prove that encapsulation of yeast is possible, we performed a growth experiment and demonstrated with a plate reader assay that yeast was encapsulated in our Peptidosomes.
Figure 1: The results of the well-scan measurements for the detection of fluorescence are shown. If no signal is detected, the field of the matrix is green, otherwise red.
As it can be seen in Figure 1, the well scan of a Peptidosome with encapsulated yeast is positive. With the well-scan mode, we detected the fluorescent signal of S.cerevisae expressing the red fluorescent protein (RFP).   Thereby, we proved that the encapsulation of yeast in Peptidosomes is indeed possible.
iGEM goes green
Our iGEM Goes Green initiative aims at motivating other iGEM teams to make lab work during their project more sustainable and to think about the ecological consequences of their research. By providing the teams with knowledge and resources, we gave the first impulse and received a lot of input from teams all around the globe.
We took the great opportunity at the German-wide Meetup to share our vision about green labwork.

Notre Dame Collegiate
We first came into contact with the Notre Dame Collegiate iGEM team at the aGEM competition in September, where we watched them present about their project ""The RMS E. coli"". They were working on creating E. coli that express an esterase capable of breaking down ""fatbergs"" that cause issues in wastewater treatment facilities. During this presentation, they indicated that they were interested in using spectrophotometry to gather quantitative data pertaining to enzyme kinetics under different reaction conditions. However, as a first year high school iGEM team, they had limited access to certain laboratory equipment.
We helped them design their spectrophotometry experiment and helped them run these assays using our spectrophotometer. They travelled from their neighbouring town of High River to our lab at the University of Calgary multiple times to attend a workshop hosted by our team's graphic design specialist and to perform the spectrophotometry experiments.

University of Lethbridge
Even before meeting at the North American iGEM Kickoff, the Calgary and University of Lethbridge iGEM team had hoped to build a proof of concept to integrate the strengths of their respective systems. It was a match made in biomolecular heaven: Calgary provided the gene editing machinery, while Lethbridge offered the delivery vector. By their forces combined, a scenario could be envisioned where Snip Equip Flip could be delivered in vivo, similar to a traditional viral vector, but while avoiding many of their intrinsic risks. After having brainstormed possibilities at the North American Kickoff for how the entire Snip Equip Flip system could be encapsulated in Lethbridge's PNCs, it was decided to first work towards validating that the encapsulated CRISPR component could be effectively delivered to mammalian cells in culture. For Snip Equip Flip to be fully implemented within a PNC-based delivery system, the donor DNA and integrating plasm"

UGA iGEM Collaboration
Over the summer, we were able to collaborate with the University of Georgia Atlantic iGEM team. UGA iGEM aimed to shift the most commonly used chassis in synthetic biology, E. Coli, to Methanococcus  maripaludis, a model organism for methanogens. The rationale behind the shift in chassis stems from the  inefficiency presented by E. coli. E. coli use expensive feedstocks such as sugars and oftentimes  produces CO2, a waste product that wreaks havoc on the environment. The benefit of using methanogens  can be observed in their autotrophic metabolism, as well as their ability to produce highly valued  biochemicals such as methane.
Our study consisted of measuring the ribosome binding site specificity in Methanococcus maripaludis.  UGA iGEM sent cells tagged with mCherry carrying over 30 point mutations in the ribosomal binding site,  which we then measured with a Tecan plate reader. The methanogens were grown using mCherry just  upstream of the ribosome binding site, were lysed, and resuspended in PIPES buffer, which then released  mCherry proteins in the cell extracts. The cell extracts were then subjected to oxygenation in an effort to  activate the fluorophore.
The 30 cell extracts (1A...10A, 1B...10B, 1C...10C) were subjected to an excitation wavelength of 562  nm, an emission wavelength of 650 nm, an excitation bandwidth of 40 nm, and an emission bandwidth of  75 nm. 10 flashes were used with a gain of 50 using a dichroic 630 mirror to measure the following levels:
Once the relative fluorescence levels were measured, a BCA protein assay was then used to measure the protein concentrations. The standard curve was produced using absorbance and concentration from  the BCA protocol. A standard curve was generated, which allowed for a fluorescence/protein  concentration graph to be made.
The absorbances were then measured for all thirty cell extracts. Those values were entered into the  standard curve, which yielded the following data:
From obtaining the concentrations in each of the wells, we plotted the fluorescence against the concentration in an effort to see a correlation.

Wageningen_UR,2017," Surveillance Secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Health.
Local insights
Through a Skype meeting with iGEM USP-Brazil we really got to know the local situation in Brazil. We gained valuable insight into the measures being taken by the government and the population to prevent infection by mosquito-borne diseases. We learned that the government does not put enough effort into stopping the spread of the diseases. It is advised to wear long-sleeved shirts in the evening and at night, which is the time mosquitoes are most active. Furthermore, individuals should spray themselves with an anti-insect solution. Moreover, as mosquitoes are located close to water sources (e.g. ponds and lakes), the removal of still water would aid in reducing the mosquito population. However, in the rainy seasons, this is nearly impossible. The bad water distribution system makes people store their water in boxes that are breeding places of the mosquitoes. Waste is also a problem, as every bottle cap can be a breeding place after the rain.
We also learned that in Brazil, you can go to the doctor for free. However, most doctors do not have the equipment to perform diagnostic tests. Also the limited production capacity of tests is the main bottleneck. A diagnostic test for viral diseases that is cheap and can be used by these doctors would be beneficial, especially to test pregnant women or decide on further treatment options.
Current serological diagnostic tests and other point-of-care tests are not reliable enough. More tests, like PCR and ELISA-based tests are needed for confirmation.
Due to this Skype meeting and the information from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, we realized that many people are affected by these terrible diseases and everyone in Brazil knows someone who at least is, or has been, infected by viral diseases like dengue or Zika. These diseases have a great impact on the patient, the people close by and society in general.
Combining our projects into something bigger
The project of USP-Brazil covers fighting mosquito-borne diseases from within the mosquito. They engineer symbiotic bacteria living in the guts of mosquitoes that can fight the viruses when the mosquito is infected, during the so-called paratransgenesis. One issue is, however, that this symbiotic bacteria should only start to produce the toxins in infected mosquitoes. Our project can be a nice addition by combining our engineered bacteria with their toxin system of the symbiotic bacteria. The resulting fusion is then able to detect the virus with the affinity body on the surface, after which our downstream signaling pathway results in the activation of the symbiotic bacteria to fight the virus or kill the mosquito.

We held direct collaboration of projects with team NUDT-China (National University of Defense Technology) and XJTLU-China (Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University). We also had communications with the team Gifu from Japan. To improve the understanding about brain diseases and the possibilities of synthetic biology through public engagement among high school students, We held a special event in Nanjing_NFLS (Nanjing Foreign Language School) .
NUDT-China
We appreciate the great help of NUDT-China. They gave us some precious advice about our project and helped us carry out the cell viability experiment, which proved that our manipulation did no harm to the cell, setting up a good start of our project.
XJTLU-China
This year, the project of XJTLU-China is related to our project in 2015, the opioid, so we gave much help of their project. We instructed them to improve their experiment plan, since we have more experience manipulating the exosomes. In addition, they brought their cells to our lab, and with our facilities and our instruction, they extracted the exosomes and did NTA (nanoparticle tracking analysis) in our lab. When they were in great need of staining reagent, we provided them with our pigment Dil.
Gifu
During the giant jamboree last year, team Gifu and our team established a good relationship with each other. So this year we decided to keep contact with each other. Fortunately, Gifu has recruited a Chinese member, Wei Youyi, so during her summer vacation we invited her to our school to exchange some experiences in the competition.
We started our meeting with the introduction of our project. The team leader of Gifu sent us profiles about their project, and we found that they were working about a mass-production of functional protein with circular mRNA in cell-free system, and we exchanged ideas about RNA elements.
Since we are teams from different countries, we spent some time discussing the way people carrying out experiments in different laboratories. We gave a tour about  academy and labs in our"
William_and_Mary,2017,"ible with copper sulfate and that the RFP produced can be degraded by mf-Lon (Figure 2). We then performed preliminary speed characterization of a subset of the parts before sending them back to Maryland (Figure 3). We also analyzed Maryland’s data of our constructs and found that degradation was in fact occurring (Figure 4). Together these results show that not only can our system degrade in different strains and media conditions, but that it can degrade and change the speed of gene expression for arbitrary proteins. While we didn’t get to characterize the modified parts to the extent that we desired, we did see a noticeable and qualitatively similar speed change in our characterization. We hope that with more testing, we’ll be able to make these parts as consistent as our test parts.
We would also like to note that due to a judging form mishap, we did not fill in the Silver Medal parts requirement with any BioBrick IDs. However, since these parts serve as both new parts and functional proofs of concept, they would be sufficient to fulfill the Silver Medal requirement, we would humbly ask that judges evaluate these parts (among others), as proof of our fulfillment of Silver Medal requirement I. More information on this can be found on our for Judges page, as well as our other part related pages.
Degradation Functionality
Figure 2 shows the results from our plate reader functionality assay.  Cells were grown for 4 hours then induced with either 500µM or 1mM of CuSO4 (to induce copper sensing parts). After 2 hours cells were induced further with .01mM IPTG (to induce pLac mf-Lon). Introduction of mf-Lon clearly decreased the fluorescence of the cells, and based upon the results from this assay, we decided to perform speed tests on these constructs with 500µM CuSO4, and .01mM IPTG
Figure 2: Functional plate reader assay of Copper Sensor pdt parts, values are geometric means of the fluorescence/OD600 of three biological replicates, excitation/emission 584/612, shaded region represents one geometric std above and below mean
Preliminary Speed Tests
Figure 3 shows the results from our FACS speed tests, which were performed in the same manner as previously described . We were able to see a significant, but somewhat noisy speed change. While it was clear that parts with increased degradation rate were reaching steady state faster, it was fairly hard to distinguish them from one another. This is likely because we experienced cell death and toxicity issues with higher concentrations of copper sulfate (1mM"

WITH FJNU-China
This year, we have also established a long-term cooperation with FJNU-China. Their project is to produce a rose-scented bacteriostat. We think their project is very interesting, so we helped them to test the smell of the antibacterial agent. And did some promotion.In return, they investigated the opinions of teachers and students of fujian normal university on our product hyaluronic acid micro-needle patch.
Reference can be seen in the site of collaboration site of FJNU-China .
Project Feedback
This year we attended the 1st Eurasian Meet-up and the 5th CCiC Meet-up in China. We were very grateful to teams TU Delft and Shanghai_tech for their constructive advice, especially in poster design and presentation improvement (See Judging Feedback below). Thanks for their help.
Mentorship
Last year, we had the first ever iGEM team from our school, and managed to complete the project successfully with the help of Dr. Chen Weizhan, who is the PI of SZU-iGEM and acted as a mentor to our team. Our team member Miyo, who participates in both last year and this year’s competitions, became an official mentor to iGEM teams via the Mentorship program (See below). As a fourth year student from information technology, Miyo shared his extensive experience in wiki construction, helped other teams solving problems and making their Wiki pages better. Since July this year, Miyo has helped a number of teams and individuals with Wiki issues, i.e. Jiangnan_China and DLUT_China_B.

IIT_Kanpur,2018,"ISER-Bhopal with their US VISA procedures which eased their application process.      Along the way, we also cleared their other technical doubts and both the teams helped each other out whenever possible.
Meeting with IISER-Mohali
We recently had a discussion with Team IISER-Mohali in which we discussed each other’s project. It was an interesting session, and we found their project an innovative one. Our session was focussed on critically analyzing each other’s project and discussing potential questions that can come up during Jamboree presentation. It helped both our teams to prepare robustly for the same. Since the team had participated in iGEM 2017, they shared their experience about judging criteria, presentation and poster session at the Giant Jamboree which was helpful and gave us additional insight into the competition.
Accepting BioBrick Part from Team TecCEM
In iGEM 2015, Team TecCEM_HS participated and worked upon developing a system to degrade SDS, similar to our project in idea. A member of their team, Borreguin JC,  is participating in this year’s Team TecCEM as well, and he was helpful in figuring out the issues they faced in past project so that we could avoid committing them.
Since isolating the sdsA gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was difficult, we contacted them if they could provide us with the plasmid containing the same. They gifted us the BioBrick(BBa_K1629002) which they had submitted in iGEM with the corresponding gene, thus helping us move forward with our project.
Survey amongst iGEM 2018 teams
A great idea is great not because of its technicalities, but because of the impact it has on the people around it.
To gather an understanding of how water pollution affects different parts of the world, we conducted a survey amongst iGEM 2018 teams to get their views on the problem in their regions. Members of 18 teams filled us in with their knowledge which has given us a wider perspective of the problem around the globe."

NOTEBOOK
Overview
Collaboration has always played a crucial part in human society. So it is with the iGEM competition. Through various  meaningful collaborations with teams around the world, we truly experienced the joy of helping and sharing. Meanwhile, it is also a great chance to spread the idea of iGEM to more people.
In terms of that, we Nanjing-China host our own meet up as well as enthusiastically respond to collaboration invitations from other teams.
1.Language project with IIT Madras
This year, we contacted team IIT Madras and worked with them to make an educational video on synthetic biology. Not only did we help translate the scripts into Chinese, we also recorded the audio of all the lines. Our effort contributed to their multi-language project with the Mandarin version.
Later, we received the finished video. To  make the video accessible by more people in China, we posted it on Sina Weibo  and spreaded it widely. Our efforts were paid by many thumbs up and likes. It  is meaningful and informative to propagate biology in such interesting way so that more people would have a glimpse of the scientific world and gain more interest  in it.

2.Meet up with iGEM teams in Nanjing & the fifth CCiC in Shanghai
We have effectively communicated with many teams in various forms.
To share with each other our project and to chase perfection, we invited Professor Haoqian Zhang and all teams in Nanjing  to hold a meet up at Nanjing University. During the time spent together, we broadened  our horizon by listening to the diverse innovative opinions and gained a lot of joy by sharing stories along the way. Furthermore, through this meeting we  deepened our understanding of iGEM and improved experimental design and methods to optimize our own project.
After that, we also participated the fifth CCiC held by ShanghaiTech University in September. CCiC, Conference"

Host of iGEM Singapore 2018 Meet Up
Picture: Teams from NUS Singapore-Sci, NUS Singapore-A and NTU-Singapore gathering for a photo session over a pizza break in the SPS lounge (June 2018).
While both the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have sent multiple teams to participate in iGEM over the years, most of the interactions have been informal and ad hoc. For the first time in 2018, Singapore has three iGEM teams participating in this year's competition. The three teams that will be representing Singapore this year are: NTU-Singapore, NUS Singapore-A (NUSGEM) and the last being ourselves.
As part of the networking and to foster collaboration, the NUS Singapore-Science iGEM team initiated and hosted an iGEM Singapore 2018 meet-up on June 2018. We invited the teams NUSGEM and NTU-Singapore to come over and mingle with our team over light refreshment. After some friendly chat over pizza kindly provided by NUSGEM, we got down to a serious discussion during which we discussed about our projects and possible areas of collaboration in human practices, modelling as well as wet lab. While the vastly different projects we have committed ourselves to made modelling and wet lab collaborations difficult, some possible collaborations were suggested in the human practices side.
All in all, this iGEM Singapore meet-up allowed all of us to get a sense of what the other teams' projects were about, and have a fruitful discussion on areas where we could help each"

Wellesley Desyne
We are working closely with the Wellesley Desyne software team this year.
On June 3 and 4, we hosted the Wellesley team for a two day workshop.  On June 3, the BU team reviewed some fundamental biology and synthetic biology concepts and held a Eugene tutorial.  We went over some famous genetic circuits and wrote Eugene scripts for them.  On June 4, both the Wellesley and BU teams presented their iGEM projects to each other and provided constructive feedback.  The BU team also held a wet lab tour.
On June 14, we traveled to Wellesley's campus to continue discussing our projects.  The BU team broke up into three small groups and met with each Wellesley project team who described their project and tested out some of their initial software.  Later, we held an open discussion where each Wellesley project group discussed the feedback and suggestions they received from earlier in the day.
Throughout the summer, we have kept in contact with Wellesley to discuss Eugene and Eugenie.  We provided feedback on their existing designs and explained how Eugene is intended to be used and how a visual representation would aid someone who does not understand the Eugene scripting code.  We also provided sample Eugene code for some of our experiments so the Wellesley team could have Eugene code to test their prototypes with.  Members of the Wellesley team came to some of our weekly Eugene meetings with the Eugene team.  They also came to BU to present their paper prototypes of Eugenie and get feedback from the Eugene team and the BU iGEM team.  Furthermore, the BU iGEM team took part in user studies for Eugenie.

CONFERENCE OF CHINA IGEMER'S COMMITTEE
The CCiC of 2016 was held in Sun Yat-sen University from September 2nd to 4th, hosted by SYSU School of Life Science. It was a wonderful jamboree in which 36 participating iGEM teams, including our team SCUT-China_A, from all over the country got together giving great presentations and sharing many different ideas.
After hearing our presentation, HaoQian Zhang，other professors from SYSU and iGEMers from other universities  gave us some valuable advices on our program. Every team showed great passion on the presentation and strong commitment to their project. We also gave advices to other iGEM teams in the meantime as many as possible.
COLLABORATION WITH Team SCU-China
After the CCIC, the project of team SCU-China appealed to us, consequently we start a collaboration with this team. We found they were also facing the problems of heterologous protein expression so we’ve reached an agreement that we provide them with three strains, which are Eco.li RIPL, Eco.li Rosetta and Eco.li pGr07, to help them with their heterologous protein expression. As return, they will send us a special strain of E.coli that has the odour gene knocked out to help with our bacterium stinking problem, which is considered to be a big obstacle to the industrial applications of our engineered bacteria.
COLLABORATION WITH iGEM Team FAFU-China
This year, the project of FAFU iGEM team is aimed at killing the mosquitoes by restructuring Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (a species of algae)and growing them in the waters.
Therefore, the temperature of the mosquito-breeding waters area will be a key to their project. In order to offer them certain help, we chose several mosquito-breeding waters areas in guangdong—one of the most mosquito-breeding regions in China—to"

In July, we received a request for help from team iGEM Bilkent-UNAMBG. They wanted to model their biosensor for detecting VOCs. However, they did not have any experience with either using MATLAB or modeling using ODEs. Therefore, we provided them with support through skype-meetings, MATLAB code and resources for how to find parameters for their biosensor.
Together with iGEM Bilkent-UNAMBG, we conducted a survey covering the public opinion about a mass screening program in both Turkey and Sweden. The results from each country could then be compared to analyze differences in the public opinion about mass screening strategies and how this should be financed. The results of the survey can be found under Human practices, integrated human practices .

Meeting up in Yanqi lake
Team UCAS hosted the meeting to communicate with other China teams，University of Chinese Academy of Sciences、Zhejiang University、Beijing Normal University、Tianjin University of Science & Technology as well as Beijing Institute of Technology attended this meeting to share and discuss the project with each other. All of the teams exchanged ideas about their project and original design, and have a quick exhibition of the  wiki, poster, give some simple but classic presentation. Among which we also try to find ways to better collaborate with other teams, especially in the wet experiment、modelling and outreach. We received more than 10 useful advises about our project and having a great time!
Collaborate with UCAS
UCAS for BIT-China:
Our project’s signal transition mainly based on the GPCR pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In order to tune the system more sensitivly, we decided to optimize the promoter Pfus which is the inducible promoter of detection circuit (Pfus-mRFP-CYC1t). Team UCAS helped us to test the expression of mRFP promoted by different Pfus mutation, through the host strain fluorescence test, they helped us obtain the corresponding data. here is the link to their wiki .
BIT-China for UCAS:
In the 19th session of National Congress of the CPC, because of the limitation of the methanol(AR) procurement，the students of UCAS are in desperate need of methanol(AR) to detect their production，we help them complete their experiment by supplying them methanol(AR).

CityU_HK,2015," are at different values.
Assumptions
1). All nanobodies are bound on the surface of a magnetosome, i.e. no free floating nanobodies.
2). Each magnetosome has the same number of GFP-specific nanobodies adsorbed on its surface. 
3). A magnetosome does not interact directly with GFP molecules nor interfere with the reactions between GFP-specific nanobodies and GFPs.
4). The GFP-specific nanobodies on the surface of a magnetosome have the same association and dissociation rate constant to GFP when compared with the GFP-specific nanobody alone.
5). The binding of GFP with GFP-specific nanobody is in a one-to-one ratio.
6). The reaction follows the law of mass action, which means the reaction rate is proportional to the concentration of the reagents.
Model
Figure 1 shows the model constructed in SimBiology. The blue rounded rectangles represent the reagents, including antigens (GFP), GFP specific nanobody and the nanobody-antigens-complex. The yellow circle represents the binding reaction. The arrow points toward the nanobody-antigens-complex indicate that the complex is the product of the forward reaction. The double arrows above the yellow circle “binding” indicate that the reaction is reversible.
Figure 2. Interaction between antigens (GFP) and GFP specific nanobody to form the nanobody-antigen complex
Result and discussion of the simulation
By using the scan function of SimBiology, the dynamic of the system was simulated with changing the initial concentration of the antigen (the green line) from 0 M to 1.6x10-6 M with an interval of 2x10-7 M.
Figure 3. Simulation kinetics of the interaction between GFP-nanobody and antigen
Two observations were made from the simulation above. First, when the concentration of the antigen (GFP) is below that of the GFP specific nanobody (7.78 x10-7 M, given in the Calculation section above), as shown in Figure 3.1 to Figure 3.4, the antigen (GFP) becomes the limiting reagent and the final molarity of the nanobody-antigen complex (represented by a red line) equals to the initial molarity of the antigen. However, when the concentration of the antigen is higher than that of the GFP specific nanobody, as shown in Figure 3.5 to Figure 3.9, GFP specific nanobody becomes the limiting reagent, so the final molarity of the nanobody-antigen complex equals to"

2.NKU_China
This year, NKU_China constructed a plasmid containing fimS. In E. coli, the expression of the fimbriae component, FimA, is controlled in a binary fashion through the inversion of a 314 bp DNA segment (fimS) that contains the fimA promoter. The inversion of fimS is performed by the DNA recombinase FimE, which binds to two inverted repeat sequences (Inverted Repeat Left and Right, IRL and IRR, respectively) that flank the fimS element. FimE has different binding affinities for IRL and IRR depending on the orientation of fimS, as a result, FimE is able to efficiently cause recombination only when the promoter faces IRR. Therefore, switch inversion is permanent and heritable.
Based on E. coli fimbriae control system (E. coli fimbriae (Fim) phase variation system), NKU_China has finished the switch design, to whose ends both GFP and RFP have been linked. This modified switch has been transformed into BL21 and we helped them to prove it is feasible.
We added 150μl bacteria into two conical flasks containing 150ml LB medium(30μg/L kan+).And we incubated cultures in a shaker until the value of OD600 reached 0.3. Then we added 150μl IPTG (100mM) into one of the conical flasks for induction. After incubating overnight, the value of OD600, red fluorescence and green fluorescence of the two strains of bacteria were measured by a microplate reader.
The results are as follows:

1.HBUT&BNU
In our collaboration with Beijing Normal University (BNU), we helped induce the expression of mCheery by salicylic acid(SA), measured its fluorescence intensity to determine the optimal concentration induced by SA and the optimal induction time at the optimal concentration. And the BNU-China helped us develop a mathematical model of the Nickel Hunter 2.0.

HBUT: Experiment
Overview
Bioengineering uses stable, highly productive mutants, target strains, which contain foreign genes. However, screening these mutants costs vast time and workforce, and it is difficult to avoid using antibiotics. The  philosophy of BNU-China team is to use salicylic acid to induce glucose dehydrogenase expression to enhance the strain's pentose phosphate pathway, giving the strain a growth advantage. EmrR protein can inhibit the role of the downstream promoter PemrR, so that the gene downstream of PemrR can not be expressed, but salicylic acid (SA) can bind to emrR to eliminate this inhibition. BNU-China team sets the gene of PemrR downstream to gdh, using SA to control this route. After the BNU-China team replaced gdh with mCherry, we helped induce the expression of mCheery by SA, measured its fluorescence intensity to determine the optimal concentration induced by SA and the optimal induction time at the optimal concentration.
Protocol
I. Determination of the optimum concentration of SA for induction
Process:
1. Pick a single colony from the top of the board, expand it with liquid LB containing Amp, and control the time at about 11h.
2. Prepare for SA induction verification:
(1) The whole experiment can be done in 3-5 parallel groups. In the ultra-clean platform, the expanded liquid is divided into several 20ml large centrifuge tubes, each tube is filled with 2ml. Pay attention to the cover of the large centrifuge tube when filling the bacteria solution, wrap it with the sealing film, and tighten the rubber band (because the sealing film can be ventilated, if the cover is covered with oxygen, it will be insufficient).
(2) Adding SA, so that the concentration of SA in the"

NTU-Singapore,2018," Indonesia through the help from UI_Indonesia . We prepared the material that we would like to be delivered in this outreach. The discussion was held in September and delivered in their campus auditorium. This session attracted about 60 students from Faculty of Engineering. We are very thankful that UI_Indonesia helped us to extend our outreach to the international community.
iGEM Meet-up Singapore
After a long history of collaborating with iGEM teams fron National University of Singapore (NUS), we were honored to be invited to the first iGEM meeting ever in Singapore. During the meet-up, we were happy to meet with NUS Singapore-A and NUS_Singapore-Sci.
During the event, we had both casual conversations to know each other as well as in-depth discussions about our projects. We were able to propose and find potential areas for collaboration, in both wet laboratory work and human practice. We believe this meet up has laid out a great foundation for our later meetings and collaborations with them.

NUSGEM Singapore
 How the Story Began?
After meeting with Team NUSGEM at the Singapore iGEM meet-up, both teams were able to quickly find area for collaboration. Afterwards, we met multiple times in our laboratory and after a few weeks, we finalized our plan for collaboration.
 How We Helped?
Team NUSGEM ( NUS_Singapore-A ) developed a novel biomanufacturing method and produced a flavonoid dye, Luteolin, in Escherichia coli. Three plasmids were constructed which are pBrep-F3'H-pTet-FNS, pBrep-F3’H and pBAD-FNS. pBrep-F3'H-pTet-FNS plasmid consists of F3’H gene under blue light repressible promoter and FNS gene under pTet promoter. F3’H plasmid consists of F3’H gene under a blue light repressible promoter, while FNS plasmid consists of FNS gene under pBAD promoter. Our team had helped them to quantify each of the gene expression level by RT-qPCR in cells containing these plasmids versus empty cells.
Figures below shows the exponential fold change of the gene, after normalizing with the wild-type cells and the house-keeping 16s gene.

 Collaborations
Science is no longer a work for isolated individuals, it has transformed profoundly. It’s now teams and collaborations that drive high-impact science.       Therefore, we tried to connect with other teams who participate in iGEM competitions during our work. This led us to participation in interviews and skype meetings, which resulted      in formation of both friendship and professional bonds across the world. With synthetic biology being quite a specific area of expertise one who deals with it can      sometimes feel quite isolated, therefore it was incredibly exciting for us to be able to meet other young people with the same love and passion for science as our own.       We can't wait to meet in Boston!
We consider collaboration or providing helpful information a very important part of this project and science in general. It is the base for future projects even those beyond iGEM.
We had skype meetings with many teams, but would specifically like to point out those we were particularly fond of.
Collaboration with the Graz team
We talked to iGEM Team Graz (
1
) and shared with each other our concerns and project development as well as tackling practical problems which occur       after spending a lot of time in the lab. We talked about different methods and protocols we were using and how those could be improved.      We exchange suggestions with the other team in terms of what else they could try to implement in their work. The project team Graz, whose project idea is       bacterial evolution and finding new selection markers, was, at the time, dealing with slow or even nonexistent bacterial growth in liquid media. Based on our       experience we made some suggestions, such as testing different concentrations of antibiotic. We also suggested they might do some mathematical modeling to predict       the outcome of their bacterial fights and thus improve their project. They helped us with suggestions on how to handle our bacteria, which we use for plasmid multiplication,      even though we generally worked on mammalian cells in general.
Furthermore, we participated in surveys for other teams, notably for iGEMnews , News       from EPFL iGEM team which  was a fun way to share our project with the community. We were interviewed ,  about our team and project which we found to be an       entertaining way to connect various iGEM teams and allow us to get to know each other.

Manchester,2017," the environmental risks. The Ministry of Korea Centers for Disease Control and prevention proceeds the former test, and Three institutes, including The Ministry of Environment, Rural Development Administration, and National Fisheries Research & Development Institute proceeds the latter test. About 210 days are required for each of the examinations.
After all the processes, one can finally get the Biosafety report for the GMOs. the result is posted on the site (Korea Biosafety Clearing House) so that the data is available to not only the applicant, but also to anyone interested.
4. As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?
It can be noticed all countries participating in this collaboration, share the standard protocols of good practices in a laboratory, which includes the following:
• Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
• Identify the level of risk.
• Use of necessary safety equipment for each activity.
• Maintain the necessary information and supervision with trained personnel.
• Maintain an infection prevention protocol and equipment in case of emergency.
• Good hygiene of workers.
• Special conditions and restrictions on air circulation.
• Waste disposal protocols, among others.
In the United States, Australia, Brazil and Indonesia, these protocols for the manipulation of biological agents are all that is required to protect the workers involved. On the other hand, the European Union, Japan and India also require medical records of all workers exposed to biological agents to be kept for a specified period of time. Japan additionally requires the employers to hold medical check-ups every 6 months for the exposed workers. The legislations of EU, Korea, Canada, Chile and India group biological agents according to the risk they might create. These groups, in turn, determine what safety measures are to be taken in each case.
In Korea, Canada and Chile, the facilities must also be located in an isolated or secluded location. Chile only requires it for biosafety levels 3 and 4. Finally, Korea and India require the existence of a decontamination room between the work area and the outside.
*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*
Employers are not required to adopt any specific safety measures just because their workers will be exposed to biological agents. Instead, under OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), they are only required to address any health concerns a specific organism might pose.
The specific guidelines facilities adopt depend on the risk group classification of the agents involved. For the handling of biological materials under Risk Group 1, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and CFIA recommends containment level 1 (CL1) safety guidelines,"

We participated in Düsseldorf Cologne postcard campaign in which we designed a postcard combining the Abu Dhabi skyline and the LAMP reaction that is integral to our project. We wrote a small description of our project on the back, and the postcards were distributed to all participating teams from around the world.         Therefore, STEC-illnesses are still a major problem in countries that revolve around street food.
Groningen
Groningen iGEM team participated in our virtual conference, and both the initial call and the follow-up calls were successful. Their project was to build a phage detection for Lactococcus lactis, but were having trouble with the BioBrick 3A assembly and building their device. We suggested that they try using the pJET vector for transformation and implementing a valving system in their device. For the GFP amplification issues they were facing, team Vilnius-Lithuania suggested that they express transcription factors that can bind to multiple sequences at a time to amplify their signal.
Vilnius-Lithuania
Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team participated in our virtual conference, and both the initial call and the follow-up calls were successful. Their project was to have a synthetic replicant to effectively keep different plasmids in one cell with the ability to control the copy number of each plasmid group separately. We looked into the issue of calculating copy number, while they helped us look at our microfluidic chambers.
We participated in the following surveys:
The microfluidics survey for Boston University Hardware.
The cholera survey for INSA-UPS Toulouse.
The cattle survey for University Nebraska-Lincoln.
The air pollution survey for Pasteur Paris.
The GM medicine survey for Cardiff University.
The insulin accessibility survey for University of Sydney.

While running our course in iGEM, despite the help and mentorship of our instructors, we were left with challenges and difficulties                  that only people in our shoes can understand. By this mean, we were in touch with many teams via social network. We communicated                  with teams to help each other out in overcoming the hardships together and met brilliant people. Thus, the collaborations with the                  other iGEM teams: “LACAS BioBots, Warwick, Saint Joseph, iGEM Dusseldorf, iGEM Marburg, iGEM UPF-CRG Barcelona, iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania,                  iGEM Michigan State University, iGEM Paris Bettencourt, iGEM Oxford, iGEM Oxford, iGEM Imperial, Bilkent UNAMBG, Acıbadem Istanbul,                  Bielefeld” which are mentioned below in a more detailed way emphasize our joy and efforts spent during the exchange of ideas and knowledge.

About the Interlab process; we gave them suggestions based on the difficulties                  we faced and shared our own experiences as we were ahead of them during that time. We gave them the key points of some protocols                  as we had setbacks due to misunderstandings. Moreover, we wrote a paragraph based on art and synthetic biology for a competition                  they were organizing worldwide.

Characterization of part NADPH P450 Reductase and CYP2e1/NADPH P450 Reductase
After excising the target gene NADPH P450 reductase from the plasmid provided by Vanderbilt University, Sanger sequencing is carried out to determine the sequence of the target gene and match it with information derived from gene bank to ensure the precision of the extraction.
After the coexpression construct plasmid containing NADPH P450 gene as well as a P450 enzyme (CYP2e1) gene assembled by 3A assembly is transformed into E.coli, resistance screening of E.coli is carried out to screen out the E.coli containing the recombinant plasmid and further plasmid extraction from the E.coli screened out runs gel electrophoresis and endonuclease identification to prove that the correct segment of the target gene has been linked to the plasmid.
Finally, we plan to carry out western blotting to verify that P450 enzyme express normally in the conexpression construct in E.coli with the help of Homo Sapiens (Human) NADPH reductase gene which donates electrons from two-electron donor NADPH to P450 enzyme in a coupled two step reaction.

 Our collaborations
Collaborations in the iGEM competition are important for us as well for other teams because it’s a source of mutual help. We don’t consider other teams as competitors but mostly as a source of inspiration. We hope to have helped some             teams too. In this competition, mutual help is essential for present a project as successful as possible in Boston.             Networking, sharing and communication are the keys in research and did our best to keep them at the centre of our working philosophy!
OUR MEET-UP: Biotech4Change - 3 mins “Present your iGEM project” pitch
During our meet up at the European Parliament we gave the opportunity to other iGEM teams to present their project in 3 mins in front of the public and the panel of experts! It was a unique opportunity in an incredible venue! Since                 we were the only Belgian team we really wanted to valorize our work and share it with other teams from across Europe!

Exeter and Glasgow iGEM 2016 Collaboration: KillerRed and KillerOrange Promoter Efficiency Experiment
Our collaboration with Exeter iGEM team started when we met them at the UK meet-up organised by Westminster iGEM team. It stemmed from our issues with cloning the parts for our SIM (self-inactivation mechanism) device, in particular the toxin part of the toxin-antitoxin system, so they agreed to help us by sending us one of their kill switches to use in our system. In return, we agreed to test the efficiency of the lac-repressible (and therefore IPTG-inducible) promoter they were using to expression two phototoxic fluorescent proteins, called KillerRed and KillerOrange.
Methods
First, we transformed the plasmids for testing promoter efficiency into the E. coli strain DH5α.Z1:
BBa_J04450 (RFP with a lac-repressible promoter) in pSB1C3
lac-repressible promoter + KillerRed in pSB1C3
lac-repressible promoter + KillerOrange in pSB1C3
Next, we set up 5ml LB broth cultures in boiling tubes with 25μg/ml chloramphenicol for the strains with plasmids, and incubated at 37°C (shaking at 225rpm) overnight. For each of the following we set up two cultures, one with 1mM IPTG and one without:
DH5α, no plasmid
DH5α, J04450-pSB1C3
DH5α, KillerRed-pSB1C3
DH5α, KillerOrange-pSB1C3
DH5α.Z1, no plasmid
DH5α.Z1, J04450-pSB1C"

SBiDer: Synthetic Biocircuit Developer
Abstract
Genetic circuits are often difficult to engineer, requiring months to design, build, and test each individual genetic device involved in the circuit. SBiDer, a web tool developed by the UCSD Software iGEM team, will leverage existing devices to construct a database with consideration for the function of each device interpreted as boolean logic. The data can be queried by the user through SBiDer's visual interface to explore circuit designs. Users can search for existing circuits that can be used to assemble a complex circuit. The displayed circuit's literature reference, characterization data, and images of included devices can be viewed through the built-in table. We also provide a standalone modelling Python package that can be used to model circuits given by our online webtool. SBiDer's web of information can be expanded through user-generated additions to the database to improve the efficiency of the application and the accuracy of the models.
Project Description
Problem Statement
Synthetic genetic circuits created by synthetic biologists have yielded exciting applications such as biofuels production and cancer killing bacteria. These circuits are often difficult to engineer, requiring months to design, build, and test each individual genetic device involved in the circuit. Although there are many genetic devices that have been built, re-using these devices often requires a time-consuming review of the literature. The UCSD Software iGEM team will address this challenge by creating a web-tool that leverages existing genetic devices to create complex genetic circuits. We will accomplish this by:
building a comprehensive database that captures the behavior, composition, and interactions of existing genetic devices in the literature
constructing and visualizing the network of all synthetic genetic circuits that can interact with one another
devising algorithms to search this network for the set of genetic devices that can be used to construct a complex genetic circuit.
Perform some basic validation via kinetic modelling.
Aim 1 - Building a Database
We will mine the scientific literature for existing genetic devices and then construct a database that captures device characteristics such as:
composition of devices
function
characterization data
literature reference
We will design our database by rigorously constructing an entity relationship diagram and then normalizing these relationships to construct tables for a relational database.
Aim 2 - Constructing Network of Interacting Devices
We will connect known"
INSA-UPS_France,2017," an expected decrease of CFU in both milk and water (approximatively 35% of decrease after one day of freezing). In the following days, CFU counts from milk have stabilized to approximatively 4.109 CFU/ml while CFU counts from water have stabilized to 3.109 CFU/ml. Despite there were more CFU counted from the milk Eppendorfs we can’t conclude milk is a better way to maintain Lactobacillus spp than water because bacteria quantities were not the same at J0.
But we made an interesting observation about Lactobacillus colonies. Indeed we noticed that after a while (approximatively 10 days), half of the colonies coming from the sterilized water conditions were significantly smaller than the ones which were maintained in milk.
Our conclusion is that the freezing induces a loss of approximatively 35% of bacteria and that both water and milk are good choices to maintain Lactobacillus spp at -20°C. It’s interesting to add that it looks like this bacterial strain could have been keep longer in the fridge and that the milk solution seems to offer better maintaining conditions because colonies were bigger on petri dishes.
Cloning
From : BOKU-Vienna
During our 3 months of experiments we did several genomic integrations in Pichia pastoris. But a part remained non-integrated despite all our efforts. We sent to the BOKU-Vienna Team our yeast strain and the construction below. They succeeded the genomic integration and thanks to them we did a fluorescence experiment to characterize the GAP promoter activity.
Thanks to their work we obtained results showing that the GAP promoter we were working with is functional. As you can see on the figure, the Pichia pastoris strain they engineered shows a higher fluorescence than the wild type, proving the functionality of pGAP. The functionality of pGAP has been further demonstrated later with an halo assay.
Creation of mazes
Done for : NAWI-Graz Team
Their project:
The aim is to create a robot-bacteria interface in which information processing is done by a bacterial culture that exhibits a feedback loop with a mobile robot. In this concrete case changes in pH and a corresponding change in fluorescence of the bacterial culture are the means by which communication is achieved. Additionally, one of the fluorescence proteins used is under control of an acid inducible promoter, which they aim to further develop and characterize.
Their tool:
To test their algorithm they created a tool that iGEMers can use. The idea is to let people draw different mazes so they can test"

Collaborations
Collaborations are essential for each team to develop parts of the project they could not do another way because of a lack of means or skills. This way, expertise can extend the possibilities of the team to propose a more complete project. Moreover, collaboration teaches us solidarity and teamwork which are essential qualities for every single scientist who works in a team.
iGEM Aix-Marseille (HP/Bio)
During the Parisian Meet-up organized by iGEM Pasteur at the Institute Pasteur, we met the iGEM Aix-Marseille Team that solicited our help for their human practices. iGEM Aix-Marseille is producing a modified bacteriophage that could prevent the spreading of Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterium that ruins cereals and olive crops around the Mediterranean Sea. To provide this phage to farmers, iGEM Aix-Marseille needed the authorization of the European Commission for their GMO production. That’s why they asked for the help of our lawyer, Maxime, to accompany them through possible legal pathways which were entirely different from those we used to place Psicose on the market ( See the dossier on the iGEM Aix-Marseille Wiki ).
For our part, we needed characterization of our Psicose producing enzyme, the D-psicose 3-epimerase, to qualify our model. iGEM Aix-Marseille has a team of skilled bio-informaticians that could take over the description of our Psicose epimerase characteristics such as catalytic activity, 3D representation, affinity constants and kinetics compared to other epimerases of our enzyme’s family ( See details on our Scientific Part ).
Both teams were highly satisfied with each others work and brought a great contribution to each others project.

As fellow scientists exploring the field of targeted evolution, we helped the iGEM-team Heidelberg by conducting an experiment for them, to validate their results in another lab. Our colleagues used three different mutagenesis plasmids (MPs) created by A. H. Badran et al. in 2015: #1, #2 and #3, as they are named by the iGEM team. The MPs build up on each other in accession of their respective numbers.
#1 increases the mutation-rate through arabinose induced expression of dnaQ926, an ineffective E. coli DNA Pol III proofreading domain.
#2 also contains the gene encoding Dam methylase under arabinose induction, as well as the gene seqA under low-level expression. Dam methylase is crucial in mismatch-repair in E. coli, as it methylates the parental strand in DNA replication, making it distinguishable from the new daughter strand. If Dam methylase is overexpressed, the daughter strand is methylated too quickly, which impairs the mismatch-repair mechanism. seqA encodes a protein that delays the function of Dam methylase, which solves some issues of the arabinose induced promoter being not completely tight.
#3 contains the additional genes ugi, cda1 and emrR. ugi encodes cytidine deaminase, which catalyzes cytosine to tyrosine transitions and therefore causes base substitutions in the host’s genome. This transition goes through a deoxyuracil intermediate, which may be excised by uracil-DNA glycosylase during the native uracil-excision pathway. cda1 is a natural inhibitor of uracil-DNA glycosylase and therefore acts synergistically with ugi. emrR is a gene repressor for a number of different multidrug resistance pumps. The exact mechanism is unknown"
Imperial_College,2018," that we would all be quite stressed about trying to complete everything in time for the wiki freeze. We predicted that the pressures at this stage of the competition could cloud our judgment and prevent us from thinking clearly about our problems, and we knew that we would not be the only team facing these problems. So, we reached out to our fellow London iGEM teams and organised a troubleshooting meet-up well in advance, so that we can all tackle each of our roadblocks as an iGEM community. As well as troubleshooting, we invited graphic design students from the University of Arts London Central St Martins (see below) to give us feedback and advice on our wiki and poster designs. Thank you UCL, KCL and Westminster for all your support and advice towards overcoming our problems, and thank you to the UAL graphic design students for helping all of us with our wiki and poster designs.
Building our PixCell construct using Printeria
This year UPV Valencia developed Printeria, a novel microfluidics-PCB based technique to precisely mix DNA parts for Golden Gate assemblies. When we heard about their idea through one of our supervisors, we instantly contacted them to begin a collaboration. In our collaboration we sent the parts for our PixCell construct to them for assembly. We had manually assembled our construct using Golden Gate, but with great difficulty, and we were interested to see whether Printeria could succeed and how the circuits would compare.
The UPV Valencia team were able to assemble the PixCell construct, but due to limited time we were not able to test and publish the results on our wiki. Regardless, we would like to thank UPV Valencia for coming up with such an innovative technique and we wish them all the best at taking Printeria to the next level
Reviewing our Communication Strategies Guide
Communication is the key theme of our project and it resonates throughout our work. As part of our human practices, we wanted to provide people, and academics in particular, with tools to improve science communication and help deliver information efficiently to any kind of audience. For this we have created our target=""_blank"" style=""color:#24305E""Communication Strategies Guide , which went through several iterations of improvement, thanks to the feedback given to us by the KUAS Korea, NCTU Formosa, MethuHS, KCL and Warwick teams. We would like to thank them for all their advice and helping us to refine our work.

We collaborated with the UT iGEM team, helping them with wet lab work in carrying out their Redesigning Decaffeination Plasmids experiment. We streaked plates with bacteria containing various combinations of three genes, to test the effectiveness of the genes on detecting three methyl groups (positions 1, 3 and 7), positioned on caffeine at different locations.
We helped run a 'Painting With Bacteria' booth with the UT iGEM team at the 2015 SXSW Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas where we informed the public about basic synthetic biology concepts and guided visitors in streaking fluorescent bacteria on agar plates ('painting' with bacteria). Pictures of the booth can be found here .

One of the core value and spirit of iGEM is working together with other teams to solve problems and share resources. As such, we did our best to extend a helping hand when needed.
Team UGA-Georgia (University of Georgia)
UGA iGEM has asked us to help in their effort to characterize archaeal ribosome binding sites by measuring the expression of mCherry in their sample as a proxy for RBS activity. As such, we measured the fluorescence and protein concentration of 30 samples (triplets of 10) at an excitation wavelength of 590nm and emission of 645nm and at OD280, respectively.

Team Genspace
Genspace iGEM members were having trouble with a quorum-sensing related promoter that was controlling the expression of red fluorescent protein (RFP). The RFP was meant to only be expressed when a threshold cell density was met, but was being expressed below this threshold. As a result, we suggested that they had their construct's base RFP expression level measured via our fluorometer and how this compared to fluorescence levels after the threshold density was met to better characterize what was going on with their part. Since Genspace is a community biolab that is not as well-equipped as an institutional laboratory such as ours, we offered help by means of equipment that we are more fortunate to have.

Tel-Hai,2016," in front of a large crowd. We also had the chance to meet all of other iGEM 2016 participants representing Israel this year.
European Researchers’ Night
The ""Researcher's Night"", an evening event funded by the Ministry of Science and the EU throughout all of Israel and Europe that aims to enrich students' knowledge and love of science through various creative activities. We produced and executed the event held in Kiryat Shmona (of the Northern Galilee), joined by the iGEM Technion and iGEM Danzinger teams as well. At “Researcher’s Night”, we organized activities in the fields of biology, chemistry and physics, alongside researchers from the MIGAL Institute. Additionally, we presented our iGEM project and performed an activity extracting DNA from wheat germ.
Helping “Danciger Darca Comprehensive High School” with their poster and T-shirts
People always say that family is the most important thing you have. Our group is located mostly in Kiryat- Shemona (in the Northern periphery of Israel), and another group that is participating in the igem- high school track ( Danciger) is from Kiryat Shmona as well. This is a group of bright students studying Biotechnology who have developed an interest in science from an early age and are eager to constantly learn more.
In preparation for the competition , we helped them design the shirts with which they come to Boston, and helped them create and design the poster for the Giant Jamboree.
Such cooperation is always welcome. They liked the design we created for them,  and we helped them raise their morale. It is important to remain unified as we represent the same place, and want to bring it much pride.
Brainstorming over Skype
We held skype conversations as well with Lithuania and Freiburg regarding all of our teams’ projects. We brainstormed ways to progress and discussed the difficulties we had encountered and the solutions we had tried to find thus far.
Our Journal Entry
XMU China created a yearly journal prior to the iGEM competition, including articles from multiple teams regarding their projects. We collaborated with them by submitting an article."
Duesseldorf,2018,". They characterized one of our quorum sensing plasmids and checked the amounts of acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) to be added to achieve a certain amount of lysis. Moreover we also supplied them with n-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine-lactone, a quorum sensing molecule that they required and were not able to synthesize themselves.
We were really happy to hear, that the AHL has helped them in characterizing their system. It was able to induce at least one of their systems (Figure 1), showing that their iGEM project cannot only be used to test biological, but also chemical cross talk.  Moreover they also tested one of our constructs, which we sent as well with the AHL molecule. They found out, that with concentrations of AHL from
0 mM
to
10-4 mM
of AHL, barely a difference compared to the corresponding control was visible. This data is consistent with our findings, which show that a minimum concentration of
0.05 mM
AHL was necessary to present a visual difference between the uninduced variant.
With this we did not only assist a team to characterize a system, by supplying them with a missing molecule, but they also have supported us a lot, by confirming our achieved findings.
Manchester
iGEM Manchester is working on the characterization of different promoters this year. They are creating an assembly of various promoters and asked us to add our promoter to their library. For this purpose we sent them the sequences of all of our synthesized promoters, mostly quorum sensing promoters, and therefore successfully achieved a further collaboration.  We were really glad to have successfully collaborated with another team as well. Within a few weeks, they have generated an optimized version of our promoter sequences, by designing the promoter once with decreased and once with an increased activity. They did so by running each sequences through an online algorithm which predicted the -10 and -35 region of each promoter. Then they identified regions in our promoters that would benefit from a point substitution and recorded the likely change in activity associated with the sum of these changes via MatLab.  Below you can find an overview with the optimized sequences. The parts that we sent in and are optimized are signalized in yellow. In green are the sequences optimized for increased activity and in red are the sequences optimized for decreased activity.

Duplicate J23117+I13504 samples were then tested using standard set-up and the non-standard set-up, but the brightness was insufficient to image the fluorescence. This confirms the reduced fluorescence intensity of the J23117+I13504 samples compared to the J23106+I13504 samples.
Glasgow Team
We can see how you fluoresce
Collaboration with the Glasgow iGEM Team was also based on fluorescence imaging: as part of their project, the Glasgow team are characterising different fluorescence constructs expressing RFP and GFP. It was therefore beneficial for them to have an independent group analyse the bacterial expression of their constructs, and for us to have some living fluorescent samples to image. Specifically, the bacterial transformants they supplied were reported to have the following phenotypes:
DH5α - No antibiotic resistance, no fluorescence (control)
DH5α - Kanamycin resistance, GFP and RFP fluorescence (in the same cell)
DH5α - Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, RFP fluorescence
DH5α - Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, GFP fluorescence
DH5α - Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, mostly GFP fluorescence with a small proportion of cells on the plate expressing RFP
Our objective was therefore twofold: firstly to test the capabilities of OpenScope in analysing bacterial samples for GFP and RFP fluorescence, and secondly to report back to Glasgow with our phenotypic analysis of their bacterial strains.
Results:
After preliminary testing using the RFP epi-cube, it was decided that imaging of RFP at this stage would not be possible. Hence only bacterial strains expressing GFP (as confirmed earlier) were tested against the control.
Testing using the commercial fluorescence microscope confirmed that the samples had phenotypes as reported by Glasgow. From tube 5, a small proportion of the cells were expressing RFP and the majority expressed GFP as predicted.
Results from preliminary testing of DH5α cells with p126.1 and p56.1 (confirmed: GFP expression only) using the standard set-up indicated illumination brightness was insufficient to detect GFP. The non-standard set-up (with a brighter LED) was used, and GFP expression was confirmed in p126.1, p126.+p56.1 and p126.1+p80.1 cells as expected (Fig. 3a-d). The images display an artefact of the square shape of the LED used, as there is an area of increased fluorescence in the outline of a square at the centre of the images ("
Groningen,2016," assumed the other teams did not include a whole genome     sequencing in their finance plan. We sent this CryptoGErM protocol     along with the message to the mentioned  teams. The short version     is, they germinate the spores on spectinomycin LB agar plates and     from those colonies the message can be acquired via colony PCR.     Primers for the PCR are provided (primer sequences can be found here ). This PCR product is sent for     sequencing. The received sequence can be copy pasted to our     decoding program. Now they only need to know the digital key that     we used to encrypt the message. We were kind enough to tell them     the digital key beforehand.
Figure 2. (A) Members from iGEM team Eindhoven 2016      decrypting our message sent in spores. (B) Also the iGEM team Wageningen is happy to decrypt our message. Blue arrow indicates decrypted message.
It works! The iGEM team Eindhoven and Wageningen could read our     message which was: “The world is full of obvious things which     nobody by any chance ever observes.” The digital key to decrypt     this message was: ”Autoclave after reading!” We hope the teams did     this with our message after the decoding.
Characterization of the BioBricks ( BBa_K1913011 ) B12 biosensor and ( BBa_K1913012 ) guanine biosensor from the iGEM team Wageningen 2016
The aim of the Wageningen iGEM 2016 project is to construct an Escherichia coli strain that effectively kills the mite Varroa     destructor within a bee hive. One step towards this goal is the     design of a system that regulates gene expression upon presence of     the V. destructor mite, which is indicated with an increase of     vitamin B12 and guanine concentration. Vitamin B12 and guanine     riboswitches are used to design two constructs that provides E.     coli with a plasmid that regulates gene expression based on the     vitamin B12 or guanine concentration. For the design, the sequence     of the btuB gene vitamin B12 riboswitch of E. coli and the sequence     of the xpt-buX operon guanine riboswitch were used. The sequences     have been elongated with fifty amino acids downstream of the     riboswitch in the original genomic sequence of B. subtilis and E.     coli to potentially increase the     stability. It is followed by the sequence of the TetR"
EPFL,2016,"EM Today, I think we all agree what an amazing idea that was. Not only did they make it look really professional, but we also found some interesting articles about other IGEM teams’ projects. It just makes discovering other teams projects more awesome and easier. The page called ’Social media’ is a real treat, with all the humorous twitter and instagram posts from iGEM teams.
Thank you EPFL! You guys rock!”

“Our team loved to read about what everyone else was doing on iGEM Today!  We were excited to share our project and information about our team with other groups before the jamboree. But after reading articles on iGEM Today we were even more excited to see the posters and presentations of the other teams featured on the website in Boston!  As a whole, this project made us feel grateful to be a part of the iGEM community.”

The pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase miRNA Target Expression Vector was stored in our laboratory plasmid library, and two types of the target sequences (perfectly complementary or not, abbreviated as p and np) of miR-654 were provided by team NUDT_CHINA.
The target sites (each includes eight repeats of the target sequence) were synthesized and inserted into pmirGLO Vector respectively through enzyme digestion and ligation. Then a dual-luciferase miRNA target expression plasmid was constructed.
After that, the purified plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells to test their functions. Twenty-four hours after transfection with the plasmids, cells were analyzed for luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Beyotime, RG027) and a Thermo Scientific™ Fluoroskan Ascent™ FL. Normalized firefly luciferase activity (firefly luciferase activity/Renilla luciferase activity) for each construct was compared to that of the pmirGLO Vector no-insert control. For each transfection, luciferase activity was averaged from three replicates.

It's smart to take part
Knowing how important it is to collaborate with other iGEM teams, sharing knowledge and helping improve each other, throughout the year we ""AFCM Egypt"" team filled in the surveys of many teams ,which helped the other teams get more accurate results, and had several video calls with three teams and we helped each other with different aspects of our projects exchanging ideas about the our proposals and discussing the hypotheses , study designs, the novelty of the ideas and most important of them all how to apply the idea in real life and how it impacts our communities. It was so fruitful. We enjoyed a lot, but the most funny part of our collaborations was the selfies we took every time by the end of our calls ^_^
First collaboration was with the Swedish team ""Lund "". As each team explained their project to the other. And we helped Lund with the methods of characterization as by providing suggestions on how they'll characterize the part they use in their project.
The second team we collaborated with was the French team "" iGEM IONIS "". It was a great team; as we know iGEM is not only about science, we had so much fun during our calls even while we were explaining our projects and the hard steps that faced us during our work and helping each other to find solutions for the problems. We also helped Franconia with their survey as our team members translated it into Arabic and also asked our colleagues at the college and other non-medical individuals from different educational institutions in Egypt to fill-in the translated survey for them. We're preparing to exchange online lectures as we will give a lecture via video conference to the students in their college speaking about our project and lab work in exchange with a lecture they give to our college students in the same way. They also sent us the name of an RNA modeling server which helped us modeling our protein parts.We really enjoyed our time with that team.
Last but not least was the German team ""iGEM Franconia"". The most innovative team we ever met. As usual we started our calls by explaining our projects. Then we discussed the modeling part as we offered them help"

Lethbridge High School iGEM
For the 7th consecutive year, we collaborated with the Lethbridge High School iGEM team . We provided mentorship and assistance with wet lab work. Since both of our projects involved working with protein capsids from viruses, we helped each other design our constructs for these components. We also connected the high school team to previous collegiate team members who worked on our tailings pond projects since the current high school project is focused in that area. Collegiate team members Sydnee Calhoun, Chris Isaac, Luke Saville, and Kristi Turton acted as advisors for the high school team providing guidance in all areas of their project.
University of Calgary
To show that V.I.N.C.En.T. has the power to help other iGEM teams, we worked with the University of Calgary iGEM team. They are working on a system to make CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing even easier and more precise. Check out their wiki for a more detailed description of the awesome work they are doing.
To help the Calgary team deliver on their project, we sought out a protein nanocompartment that was capable of encapsulating the Cas9 protein. We found that by fusing Cas9 to the scaffolding protein of the P22 bacteriophage PNC it was possible to load it with Cas9, complexed with a desired guide RNA, and deliver functional concentrations of the gene editing protein to cells [1]. We requested samples of the DNA encoding these constructs from the Weidenheft lab at Montana State University, expressed the protein components in E. coli and delivered these protein samples to the U of C team for them to load with their custom guide RNA and evaluate their applicability in their project. Those tests are currently ongoing, and we are excited for you to hear about the results in Boston!
Florida State University
For the second year, we worked with Florida State University providing mentorship to them on different aspects of their project.

UAlberta,2017," the United States, and Australia have more specialied committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.
In the European Union, the European Commission is responsible for enforcing the GMO laws to be followed by all member countries. Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology, but has responsible institutions when commercing or trading.
2. Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?
We can distinguish two different administrative ways in which countries decided to regulate the use of GMMs. One way government regulate GMMs is by establishing a special, often non-governmental, organisation, which usually also acts as an information centre in the field of synthetic biology. The other way involves assigning conventional ministries to regulate the use of GMMs in their respective fields.
The European Union, Australia, and Indonesia belong to the first group. For example, in Australia, Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee takes charge of making decisions on products’ approval. Competent authorities in the European Union and The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety in Indonesia have similar roles.
Brazil, Canada, Chile, Korea, India, Japan and the US belong to the second group, where conventional ministries are responsible for their respective fields. Even though the names of these ministries might differ amongst the countries, it seems to be a more prevalent way to regulate GMO. Additional information centres might be present to help the ministries make decisions, nonetheless.
3. What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?
The legal requirements in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and India are very similar. All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production. The exact procedures related to obtaining permissions to use GMOs in the production vary, however, according to the target use of the final products or the way the GMOs are handled in the production process. As a general rule, products related to human health as well as those used as food or feed have to follow stricter GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labelling your final products in a predescribed manner. Environmental release of GMOs is also given serious attention although the procedures are not as tight, just as in the case of contained GMO use. Usually, the target use also dictates which Ministry will be responsible for the evaluation and approval of the planned GMO use. These could include Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Food, Fisheries, Forestry, Environment and many more.
In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a"
Heidelberg,2017,"In our directed evolution approaches PREDCEL and PACE, we select for beneficial mutations in a protein of interest encoded on a M13 phage genome. In order to generate a pool of protein mutants to select from in the first place, the efficient introduction of mutations during phage genome replication is essential. Mutagenesis-inducing plasmids (MPs) that enhance the mutation rate in E. coli by inhibiting DNA repair mechanisms have been described
badran2015development
. When transformed into E. coli hosts, these plasmids should cause mutation rates several orders of magnitude higher than usually expected under laboratory conditions.  The exact mutation rate induced by different mutagenesis plasmids could, however, vary between laboratories, as E. coli growth conditions and hence expression strength of the mutagenic proteins (e.g. error-prone polymerase subunits) could differ. However, robust induction of high mutation rates are critical for the success of PREDCEL and PACE and hence of major importance for other teams to reproduce our directed evolution methods. Therefore, we performed a small inter-lab study to evaluate the performance of different mutagenesis inducing plasmids and find the construct setup most robust and hence suitable for future iGEM teams to use for in vivo directed evolution.  To enable an inter-lab comparison, we developed a standardized mutagenesis plasmid test kit and assay and distributed it to iGEM team BOKU Vienna , ETH Zurich , Freiburg and Stuttgart . We are very grateful for their kind support and excited to share the results from this small inter lab study with all iGEM teams
Mutagenesis Assay Kit
We shipped 3 mutagenesis plasmids (#1-3). All mutagenesis inducing plasmids contain an arabinose inducible promoter PBAD. Upstream of PBAD the araC protein is encoded in the opposite direction and regulates the activity of the PBAD promoter. The expression cassette downstream PBAD comprises multiple, different mutagenesis supporting elements, e.g. error-prone polymerase subunits. According to literature
RN46
the mutagenesis plasmids #1-3 were expected to cause increasingly high mutation rates.
Mutagenesis Assay – Spontaneous Resistance Acquisition
Due to exceptionally high mutagenesis levels of E. coli cells transformed with one of the mutagenesis plasmids, these cells can more quickly adopt to environmental changes. Hence, one way to measure the mutagenesis levels is simply to quantify the level of spontaneous antibiotic resistance acquisition. Therefore, E."

It was also very important to know the laws of other countries and see how GMOs are seen around the world.

From September 28th to 31st, we participated in the fifth CCiC held in Shanghai, China. It was a great experience for us to share and learn with dozens of other Chinese IGEM teams. We recieved many helpful feedback of our prototype shown in our presentation, which helps us to refine the performance and safety of our final product.
Bluepha Conference
Basic information
Date: 2018.6.24
Address: Qinghua Information Port, Shenzhen Guangdong
Number of teams attending the conference: 6
In this conference, we firstly presented the whole idea about our experimental design and concluded all the investigation we did until then. Nevertheless, although the principle was already clear, we had no concept about our product design, which means that we did not consider how to maintain the efficiency to process formaldehyde, ensure that the E.coli is safe to human, and dispose the dead E.coli without polluting the environment. Under the help of tutor from Bluepha, we got several useful suggestions. First, it is necessary to design an experiment test the efficiency of our product as well as how long it works. Second, to consider how to design the container of our product to separate E.coli from users is better than to consider if the product is safe enough to touch.
