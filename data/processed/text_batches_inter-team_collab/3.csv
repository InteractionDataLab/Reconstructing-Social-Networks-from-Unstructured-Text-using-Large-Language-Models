Growth study of B. subtilis and P. fluorescens
In exchange for recording the script in English, we studied the optimal growth of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens for the Imperial London College team . First, we did an experimental plan to observe if pH is in interaction with temperature. Finally, the conclusion was that pH and temperature were two independent parameters. We ran the experiments again, changing only one parameter.

The Colorado iGEM teams met up at Colorado State University to present their projects.
Colorado iGEM Meetup
On August 30th, Colorado State University’s iGEM team held a meetup with University of Colorado-Boulder’s iGEM team . For the past 2 years the teams have collaborated by testing each other’s parts, which proved difficult this year due to project complexity. Instead, we decided to hold a meet up this year. CU-Boulder traveled to CSU and the teams each presented their projects. Both teams were able to receive feedback on their presentations from people who had never heard it before. The meet up also gave the teams the opportunity to make meet new people, develop useful relationships with fellow scientists, and learn about the other team’s work on a personal level.
CSU iGEM also invited Dr. Jeff Kasser, professor of philosophy at CSU, as a guest speaker. He spoke to the teams about the philosophy of science and biology. Kasser dicussed whether there was a way to distinguish science from pseudo-science, discussed laws of nature, and the reduction of one science to another (e.g. is psychology really just a sub-science of biology). Both teams and Wade Troxell, mayor of the city of Fort Collins, discussed with Dr. Kasser genetic engineering and the public perception of genetically modified organisms. The talk incited conversation and thoughts around the responsibilities and standards that synthetic biologists do and should hold themselves to.
Other Collaborations
Our team also participated in upwards of 15 surveys, and added our team and project to Paris-Bettencourt's iGEM Rhizi. This year, we also participated in the 2015 Interlab Study , including the extra credit."
ShanghaitechChina,2016,". Click here for more details about our collaborations with future member in the iGEM community.
iGEM at Tsinghua University
This year, our team launched collaboration with the iGEM team at Tsinghua-A University.
Tsinghua-A’s iGEM project aims at constructing a synthetic biology circuit to seek insights into noise propagation as well as measure the capacity of parallel information channels. To better scrutinize the information flow mechanism, they planned run computational simulations on Matlab combined with the wet lab work. However, when they were simulating their system with Gillespie Algorithm, they fell short of computing power when it came to scanning the parameters. Due to the limited time frame, it was indeed a big challenge for them to deal with the difficulty shortly.
Knowing about their urgent need, immediately, our team decided to assist them by utilizing the equipment resources as well as team members with required intellect. Through a series of online conversations, we soon figured out the background information about their project and planned out a feasible solution to help them out. We actively communicated with several relevant research groups at ShanghaiTech as well as the nearby SARI (Shanghai Advanced Research Institute) to seek qualified computational platform. Then, we modified and operated the algorithm where we mainly scanned several key parameters, Ka (dimer association rate) and Kd (dimer dissociation rate constant). As later commented by the Tsinghua-A iGEM Team, it was our timely help that significantly boosted the efficiency of their project.
Meanwhile, benefiting from this connection, frequent team communications were raised as well. After exchanging the idea with regards of the projects, members from the Tsinghua-A showed strong interests in our Solar Hunter system. To better illustrate our biofilm-based platform strategy, the wiki-design team at Tsinghua-A depicted a brief mechanism of our project in a cartoon style, which provided us some inspirations to design our own big picture later on. The figure they drew is used and also can be seen on our Wiki page.

To better test their idea,various cancer cell lines were required for the further explorations. However, when they turned to work on the cancer cells, they realized"
Worldshaper-Wuhan,2017," presentation and activities, and finally we decided doing science-related experiments would be fine as the condition in the museum wouldn’t allow the kids to sit down and wait. It’s also hard to decide the type of experiment regarding safety, short duration and equipment availability. On the other hand, we started our preparation on the PPT and graphs that are needed for demonstration.
On July 28, we went to Zhejing University where the lab of Worldshaper-XSHS is located. We visited their lab and the team leaders discussed about the usage of Bio Parts sent by the committee as ours seemed have already denatured due to preservation problem. Recently, there were a few technique-related problems in our experiment. The leader and members from experimental group discussed about the possible cause and showed us their colony of fungi， given that we had trouble developing colonies and there were too few of them in each trial. While we were trying to figure out the usage and possible solution for our Bio Parts-problem, we visited the lab of iGEM team at Zhejiang University. Our leader and Worldshaper-XSHS’s team leader talked to the team members of ZJU-China about the problem we had. At about 3 pm that afternoon, we gave a presentation to students and teachers from Yiling Highschool. ASTWS-China talked about synthetic biology, Wordshaper-XSHS talked about “What is iGEM”, Wordshaper-Nanjing and our team introduced our projects to the audiences. The short video made by Worldshaper-XSHS gave us an idea of making short videos teach others about the knowledge and technique we used in the project. (We had thought about making a video but it’s more like a propaganda.)
July 29 to the morning of July 30, the four teams sent their representatives to mathematics modeling class which was told by a professor from Zhejiang University. Other team members had to decide the experiment we are going to do, and the leader of Worldshaper-XSHS helped us bought the equipment we needed.
July 30, we held the activity in the China Zhe Jiang Science and Technology Museum. Short videos about iGEM and the teams’ projects were released. There were fun experiments that attracts kids and their parents. The team members went out to hand out the fans with texts that introduce our projects printed on them. There were parents that felt curious about the competition and our projects. The activity lasted until the museum closed. From this meet up, we learned a lot from our experiences and had a better idea on how to introduce synthetic biology as well as our projects to"

How can Iron Guardian affect the world? This is the question we asked ourselves. And how can synthetic biology affect the world? That is the question we want to ask all iGEMers. To answer this, we collaborated with different teams from different parts of the world and learnt different lessons. Though the subjects iGEMers are working on vary from team to team, we all wish to utilize synthetic biology to solve practical problems and create a positive contribution to the world, and collaboration, without any doubt, is the best way for us to NOT ONLY KNOW MORE about other projects, BUT TRULY PLAY A PART in them, and unite us together to serve the world.
3+ net
As an increasingly powerful tool, synthetic biology can help us solve many practical problems, and the use of genetically engineered bacteria for environmental bioremediation is currently one of the most economic methods. However, the limited application scenarios and biosafety concerns always pose a barrier to the practical use of genetically engineered bacteria. As a team under the track of environment, ECUST raised the new concept of “3+ net” (Applications+, Biosafety+, Society+), collaborated with other teams under the same track and put forward some guidelines in order to help us better understand our situation and improve our projects. The Application+ part consists of two aspects. One is to develop specific protocol on how to eliminate the resistance of chassis and utilize essential genes to prevent the plasmid loss, and the other one is to make a list to summarize the non-antibiotic selection systems for different chassis organisms and make detailed records on how to construct them. Biosafety+ involves developing biosafety regulations on remediation by genetically engineered bacteria (RGEB) based on opinions from iG"

Northwestern University
With our projects united in their focus on outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), Northwestern University and UNSW came together for what felt like a very natural collaboration. Skype calls and emails enabled our two teams to overcome the distance barrier, and share critical information and advice that aided the progression of our two projects.
Northwestern University began their project with the use of a ready-prepared TolA knock-out strain of E. coli that also overexpressed TolR. This strain was given to them by a laboratory contact who had already demonstrated demonstrated OMV overproduction in this strain. For our team, this information validated our choice to include a TolA knock-out strain, and TolR overexpression strain in our library of E. coli for comparison of OMV production alongside our other strains. By including these two strains in our library and comparing their OMV production capabilities against other strains, our results can help validate the results of Northwestern University.
Importantly, throughout the iGEM competition both of our teams openly shared protocols for OMV purification. These protocols were essential for the success of both our teams, and by actively sharing feedback, troubleshooting and advice on the operation of these experiments, our results were largely furthered. For example, our team suggested alternatives to ultracentrifugation, since access was an issue for Northwestern University, and we both shared outcomes achieved with the use of different filter sizes. Furthermore, both of our teams were also testing periplasmic localisation of fluorescent proteins, and thus this was another area of protocol and results sharing.
This was a far-reaching collaboration, that reached the core of both of our projects, and we thank Northwestern University for their extensive communication with our team throughout the competition.
Please visit the experiment page to see details of our protocols, including the ones developed with the Northwestern University iGEM team.
Sydney Australia
Unlike our collaboration with Northwestern University, our partnership with the University of Sydney iGEM team was not limited by geographical distance. Thus, we made the most of our ability to share wet-lab materials and perform experiments in order to validate each other’s expression systems.

Irritating corrosive substances（i.e. Highly corrosive acid: sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid. Strong alkili: sodium hydroxide, aqueous ammonia)
When these types of substances accidentally drop on your skin, wipe out the substance first and flush the infected area with water.
The reason is that for example concentrated sulfuric acid reacts with water to emit a large quantity of heat and hence washing the affected area with water directly might lead to burning injury. Therefore, wiping out dry first and then flush with water.
Toxic chemical substances (Deadly substance via inhalation: mercury, cyanide, Khun compound, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide etc.)
If the devices containing mercury is broken, do not touch it without protection. All lab members should be evacuated and maintain the room with good ventilation.
Personnel dealing with mercury spills should wear a hat, mask, gloves; you can use a rigid paper roll, tin foil, tape, moist cotton swab to collect the mercury; place it in a sealed bottle; cover its surface with glycerine liquid.                             When the droplet is too little, cover these droplets with sulfur and convert them into mercuric sul-fide. Leave it with few hours and do the cleaning.
Biochemical reagents dye (such as agarose gel EB, dimethyl yellow)
Due to the toxicity of ethidium bromide, we should first purify the EB solution before the                             disposal after an experiment.
If the dye come into contact with skin accidentally, flush it with water.

Aim 2 - Constructing Network of Interacting Devices
We will connect known genetic devices together via device input and outputs to create a network of devices that can interact. We define a genetic device as a DNA construct transformed into cells that can cause expression of some protein in response to stimuli (or input). We will  develop a web interface to facilitate access to the complex network that we have constructed. Our Web interface makes extensive use of Cytoscape, an open source bioinformatics software package for metabolic network visualization and simulation.  In addition, the interface will generate SBOL Visual Images, a standard language that is easily understood by synthetic biologists all over the world. Users can also update our database with additional devices through this interface.  Using the Cynetshare framework, users can share their circuit designs
Aim 3 - Searching the Network
This interface will allow researchers to query our database network for a circuit design expressed as logical operators such as “AND”, “OR”, and “NOR”, and retrieve the subnetwork of genetic devices that satisfies the circuit design. To Perform our search  we modified several traditional graph search algorithms to traverse this graph, including but not limited to Prim’s algorithm (minimum spanning tree), Dijkstra’s algorithm and a breadth-first search. Results are visualized graphically in our web interface.
Collaborations
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.

2017 is the first year in which a team from Florida has sought to compete and complete an iGEM project. Luckily for us, we did not have to go through iGEM initiation alone! Florida State University happened to join us on this pioneering journey into the realm of synthetic biology. Along with a few other experienced teams, we engaged in varied collaborations that allowed us to share, learn, and overall gain a deeper understanding of the true potential of iGEM’s scientific community.
Team FSU
While our two schools might be known for an infamous athletic rivalry, that could not stop our two iGEM teams from working together to make it to the finish line as one. Initially, we used video chats to meet and discuss our experimental undertakings. We soon realized that it would be more significant to move our troubleshooting discussions to a public platform.  A joint YouTube channel was then created in order to expand on to the general populace. It was felt that the process of designing and accomplishing an iGEM project could be explained in a manner understandable to anyone interested. These videos feature a repertoire of one team answering a certain protocol/design problem and then querying a solution to one of their own. Our teams utilized this forum to develop our projects while also showcasing the collaborative values of iGEM and the synthetic biology field. In addition, these videos might inspire those previously uninformed about iGEM to develop their own project for future competitions.
Team Franconia
Although the project deadline might have passed, does that mean the work is truly done? Apparently not! Team Franconia plans on unveiling an elaborate augmented reality game at the 2017 iGEM Jamboree. This smartphone app will be themed around the epidemic spread of viral pathogens and requires collaboration between any and all iGEM participants. Different schools will attach QR codes to their displays which will provide ‘antidotes’ to combat the pathogens. UFlorida plans to not only facilitate the game by presenting a code but to also participate in the investigative efforts. This game will extend the scope of scientific collaboration by coordinating the efforts of young researchers in an innovative and engaging manner. By linking all these bright minds to a common goal, international unification is possible.

WASHINGTON
Washington realized that teams use several different ways to communicate between them, so they though in a platform to centralize them. Before that they asked several iGEM teams what resources do they use in order to establish a collaboration with others and we were happy to answer their survey.

SYDNEY AUSTRALIA
Being diabetes a trouble for those who suffer, Sydney studied different ways to make insulin more affordable. But that required to exhaustively know the current situation of diabetics around the world. They put on iGEM collaboration page a request to fulfill a survey about the situation in Spain, so we gathered our diabetic friends and ask them to answer it for us.

Collaborations
An important part of iGEM is collaborations. For us, the collaborations served to demonstrate whether we could feasibly incorporate microfluidics and our system TERRA into the synthetic biology workflows of other lab groups. In return, we provided these other teams with a more automated method of performing some of their necessary tasks. During this iGEM season, we collaborated with the BostonU, Harvard, and MIT iGEM teams.
Harvard Collaboration
Droplet Generation
This chip was designed to encapsulate sodium alginate, calcium chloride, and cells suspended in media in droplets for later use in the Harvard iGEM team’s keratin skin patches. The Harvard team needed to find a way to control pore sizes of alginate, which were used to suspend E. coli and would only allow the desired treatment to be secreted through the pores. Our microfluidics-based system offered a controlled and precise method that would alter the amount of E. coli in each alginate suspension droplet, as well as change the pore size with of the alginate gel with calcium chloride, due to the features of a microfluidic chip. Our teams conducted literature review to design a microfluidic device to provide an solution for the Harvard team’s project.
Version 1
Since this chip passed the proof of concept experiments using colored water, this was the chip used, in combination with the TERRA Adapter during our collaborative meeting with Harvard on August 9, 2018. The chip was tested with biology a total of 4 times, each time eventually leaking before creating a stable stream of droplets. An analysis of the failure concluded that pressure around the chip was ineffective at keeping the requisite area around the channels sealed given that there was too much empty space between the channels and the pressure
applying binder clips. The future chip should either be smaller in overall area or the channel design should be spread out over a larger portion of the chip area. Harvard iGEM left us with the material needed to attempt to encapsulate their droplets on our own for when the new chip is assembled and tested.

We wanted to understand how our assay will work after traveling for a long distance, which led us to ship our assay to the Northwestern Team. After having them go through the test using water, we discovered that our instructions need to be clearer. When going through the protocol, the Northwestern Team misinterpreted how our assay should be used. Although we did not obtain results on how our assay worked after traveling, we did learn that we need to work on giving better instructions. How we changed our assay based on this collaboration can be seen here.

SULSA TALKS
In June SULSA (Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance) held a conference in Dundee     and on the second day, the Scottish iGEM teams had the opportunity to present our project      ideas to each other. This was our very first opportunity to pitch our project idea, and it was     great to get some feedback from the Edinburgh and Glasgow team as well as find out about their projects.
UK MEET UP
The UK meet up was held by the University of Westminister’s iGEM team.     The whole team travelled down to London for this event and presented our project.     This was a nice practice before the big event in Boston and a fantastic experience.     We chatted with familiar faces from Edinburgh and Glasgow and met some of the other     teams from the rest of the UK.
AALTO-HELSINKI
Near the start of the summer the Aalto-Helsinki team got in touch with us and we arranged to chat over skype.      We described our projects to each other and discussed different methods for modelling enzyme kinetics.
BIELEFELD-CEBITEC
We collaborated with team Bielefeld-CeBiTec who are also constructing a chromate sensor based on the chromate resistance operon of Ochrbrobactrum tritici 5bvl1. However, we are using the part in very different contexts and configurations.      Team Bielefeld is using a chromate sensor to detect the contamination of drinking water, whereas we using it     to detect traces of stainless steel. This opened the door for our collaboration. We shared our results and     exchanged our constructs so that we could also test the other’s systems. They helped characterise our chromium sensor by testing our codon optimized sensor in their in vitro system for cell-free protein synthesis.
AIX-MARSAILLE
We answered some questions that the Aix-Marseille team had regarding the twin-arginine      translocation (Tat) pathway. They wanted to know whether we thought it would be possible to      transport something with a tat signal linked to something else with a secretory pathway (Sec)      signal together through the Tat system. Using knowledge from Tracy Palmers lab at the university,     we were able to advise them that this approach is unlikely to work and offered an alternative approach      to try.

Cornell,2017," where both questions have the same answer
The line y=x corresponds to people who provided the same answer to both questions. People who understand more about synthetic biology than GMOs lie above the line; people who understand more about GMOs than synthetic biology lie below the line. Most people appeared to have an equal understanding of synthetic biology and GMOs. However, there are more people clustered under the line rather than over the line, indicating that people tend to have a better grasp of GMO than synthetic biology. While a few people answered that they had never heard of synthetic biology, no one answered that they had never heard of GMOs. This is likely due to the media attention placed on GMOs. When we tested for regression, we found that the difference in response was statistically significant (p = 3E-53), indicating that people had different understandings of the terms synthetic biology and GMO.
With all the adverse attention focused on GMOs, we also wanted to know if that affected people’s perceptions. We asked people about their thoughts on the impact of synthetic biology and the impact of GMOs.
Figure 5: Comparison of people’s answers to the questions “how do you feel about the impact of synthetic biology?”versus “how do you feel about the impact of GMOs?” on a scale from -2 to 3. -2 is highly negative, 0 is neutral, 2 is highly positive and 3 is unsure. Sizes of the points correspond to the number of people and the line y=x shows where both questions have the same answer
Points on the line y=x show indicate people who felt similarly about synthetic biology and GMOs. Above the line is people who felt that GMOs have a more positive impact. Below the line is people who felt that GMOs have a more negative impact compared to synthetic biology. There are a significant number of people who feel the same way about both, but we can see that there are far more people below the line than above the line. This demonstrates to us that people feel more negatively about the GMOs compared to synthetic biology (p = 2E-17). This confirmed our hypothesis, that society has twisted our views of GMOs as unacceptable, but hasn’t said anything about synthetic biology.
External Factors On Survey Responses
We analyzed whether external factors impacted a person’s answer. We considered many variables, but here we highlight the results for education level and political affiliations.

Atlanta Science Festival #ASF2015!!!
BioBricks, Synthetic Biology in Atlanta (GSU/GaTech iGEM)
The Atlanta Science Festival Atlanta Science Festival is a week-long event dedicated to the celebration of science and technology. This year the festival attracted over 45,000 people
This year, GSUiGEM collaborated with the Georgia Tech iGEM team for this event. During the Exploration Expo, these main topics were discussed with Atlantans: What is iGEM/Synthetic Biology?; Ethical Concerns and Careers in Synthetic Biology. In addition, children (and even adults) could build their own Biobrick with legos
GSU Discovery Day
Day 1: Atlanta Science Festival
The Atlanta Science Festival consisted of over 100 events strewn across Metro Atlanta.  This event brought together science lovers and the curious together to learn more about science.  Events included nature walks, scientific movie breakdowns, and even a lecture from Neil deGrasse Tyson himself at the Fox Theater.  This year, GSU-iGEM participated in two events to help educate the public about synthetic biology.  "

Short Summary
The main idea of iGEM is an easy way of biological engineering realized by standard biological parts (BioBricks) and an open source database. These make synthetic biology accessible to everyone. The whole concept of BioBricks is based on sharing parts freely across the community. The community connects different iGEM teams to help each other, learn from each other and finally to achieve their desired goals. The collaboration of individual teams is one of the most important aspects in iGEM. For our iGEM project we worked with several other iGEM teams. We collaborated extensively with the iGEM team UNIFI 2017 and CU Boulder 2017 . Team UNIFI participates for the first time in the iGEM competition and our aim was to help them getting jump started into the iGEM competition and coaching them in order to direct them towards a successful project. iGEM UNIFI helped us with the characterization of the transporter ptNTT2, using their more precise equipment to recording growth rates. Next to this collaboration we sent plasmids from former iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec"

SDSZ-China,2017,"’s safety and environment protection concerns. Therefore there are not                         too many factories that manufactures UDCA medicine.
Maybe there are only two factories in China that manufactures this active pharmaceutical                         ingredient (API) officially; one is in Shenzhen and the other is in Suzhou.
……After biliary drainage, it is very likely that bears will suffer from diseases all over their                         body, which is a torture to them. To resolve this problem, researchers and scientists in our                         country wish to convert CDCA in order to receive UDCA. Currently, their methods are deeply                         restrained by the use of sodium due to its danger and difficulty. If you can convert CDCA to                         UDCA successfully using enzymes, you are making a huge contribution.
Also, there are a lot of problems in the production of UDCA in medical industry. For instance, we                         need to consider the safety and profits of this drug. Thus, there are still a lot of aspects                         need to be considered and experiments need to be done when involved in industrial                         production.
Q: Thank you for your suggestions.
Q4: Could you briefly introduce the issue concerning costs and profits?
A: It is complicated because hydrogen needs to be removed. The chemical composition of UDCA needs                         to refine repeatedly, which is tricky. For example, a concentration of 70% of UDCA? require                         three times of refinement at least in order to reach the standard. Also, the raw materials or                         substances need to be recollected and there will be turnovers and other complex factors during                         the process. So the profits is limited. And now the biggest issue is that the danger of                         production overweights its potential profits.

Prof. Xu Jianhe
Prof. Xu Jianhe is a well-respected professor in Biocatalyis and Bioprocessing State Key                         Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering in East China University of Science and Technology.
With many questions regarding to complex bioprocessing and enzyme catalysis, we write to Prof.                         Xu, a very famous professor in China and also expert to get further instructions and                         professional help. At the beginning of our experiment, we decided to employ a two enzyme in one                         pot catalyzed reaction(see figure.1). However, after our initial attempt, we found out that the                         reverse reaction was more prevalent than the forward reaction. Thus because of this, the product                         was actually CDCA, the initial reactant, instead of UDCA, our expected product. This conundrum                         stopped us from reaching any further into the experiment. At this"

Overview
Ni2+ is one of the heavy metal pollutants in our environment. In order to detect the concentration of the Ni2+, our team are going to use the NcrB protein operon to achieve this goal. In this system, the nikABCDE gene will express the NikABCDE protein, which belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter. It can transport Ni2+ from the environment into the cell consuming ATP at the same time. And Ni2+ is the signal we need to detect. At the same time the ncrB gene will express NcrB protein, which is a repressor combining with the pncrA promoter, inhibiting the expression of the downstream gene luxCDABE. However Ni2+ will bind with the NcrB protein, causing the NcrB protein drop from the pncrA promoter. In this way, the luxCDABE gene will express. And the LuxCDABE protein can give out light by consuming energy in the cell. Thus we can detect the concentration of Ni2+ by measuring the luminescence intensity.
Hypothesis
1. The hypothesis on the diffusion equilibrium of Ni2+
We assume that the ions distribute uniformly inside the cell immediately after they are transported into it through NikABCDE. As long as the speed of transportation is lower than the speed of diffusion, the ions are unlikely to aggregate around the transporter protein(e.g., NikABCDE). According to our knowledge, most of the transporter proteins do not possess such a high transporting efficiency, which means this hypothesis is valid in a larger degree.
2. The hypothesis on the relationship between NcrB concentration and the copy number of the recombinant vector
Since each of the recombinant vector contains only one copy of the target gene, we can assume that the vectors have the same ability of expressing NcrB. Furthermore, it’s reasonable to assume that the final concentration of NcrB is proportional to the copy number of the recombinant vector.
3. The hypothesis on the concentration of NcrB during the process in which Ni and pncrA bind with NcrB competitively
There are three subtypes of NcrB in the cell: the free state NcrB, the NcrB binding with pncrA and the NcrB binding with Ni2+. We assume that the concentration of total NcrB is not influenced by the expression of NcrB gene or its degradation process, because the speed of these two processes is relatively low compared with the competitively binding"

iGEM Austin LASA
We were very excited to collaborate with Austin_LASA and exchange ideas, given the similarities in our project. Both of our projects rely on Cas12a-fluorophore-based assays in order to create an assay that will allow early detection of HIV                 in infants (as Austin_LASA is performing) and early detection of cancer-relapse.
We have developed our Cas12a assay with the purpose of detecting point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements found in ctDNA as well as the detection of an amplicon that contains an amplified miRNA sequence to target. These processes are               explained in detail on our Project Design page.
During our project, we spent a long time working with these Cas12a assays and there was a lot of effort that went into the optimization of these assays that came with many trials, in terms of Cas12a pre-incubation             time, activator concentration, DNAse alert concentration, etc. We had a very insightful discussion about our experiences and shared our knowledge and advice on working with such Cas12a assays. Here are the protocols that we shared with the             Austin_LASA team, hoping that it would provide useful insights for their Cas12a experiment designs.
In both of our projects, the ultimate goal was to design a “kit” and part of this kit would require an isothermal amplification step of a DNA target sequence. We learned that Austin_LASA’s team had successfully performed Loop mediated isothermal                 amplification (LAMP) for their project and we took this opportunity to learn about this possibility of isothermal amplification, as well as the implications of performing it successfully. It was a pleasure to exchange ideas with them.
NUS Singapore-Sci iGEM Team
We were very happy to get the change to collaborate with the NUS Singapore-Sci iGEM Team . Our collaboration was based on ethical reflections linked to the project, in particular to the methods used and the social implications.
The NUS Singapore-Sci iGEM Team had created a survey on the myths and misconceptions associated with Synthetic Biology. After sharing this survey with us, we entered a discussion that lead to our team deciding to also create a survey that                   aims at capturing the general public opinion concerning our project. After investigating the nature of the components in our project, we followed two approaches: firstly to study the impact of the techniques used in the project as well                   as the awareness of those performing them, second"

Genspace Collaboration
A huge part of iGEM is working with other teams to further the research of both parties.  This is exactly what we did when we collaborated with the 2015 genspace igem team.  One of the major obstacles in research today is the high price of new lab equipment.  Often times, an expensive device is needed to carry out a one time procedure.  Buying the device makes no sense, but you still need to use it.  We circumvented this by sharing equipment between our two teams.  The Genspace iGEM team came to Cooper Union in early August.  They had several samples of DNA whose concentrations they needed to determine.  To help them achieve this, we showed them how to use our Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer.  This device measures the absorbance of a small volume of liquid and then calculates the concentration of nucleic acid present in the sample.  After a brief tutorial, they were quickly able to measure the concentrations of all of their samples.  To repay this favor, the Genspace igem team helped us by lending us their vacuum oven.  This device was necessary in the protocol for the silanization of glass slides.  In order for our DNA synthesizer to work, the DNA must bond to a glass slide so that it is not lost in the wash steps.  This was done previously by forming a disulfide bond between the DNA oligonucleotide and the glass.  To test this ourselves, we ordered sulfonated oligonucleotides and made silanized glass slides.  Genspace’s vacuum oven was useful because the glass slides need to be kept in an anhydrous environment for part of the procedure.  With the vacuum oven, we completed this protocol and were able to yield results on the effectiveness of bonding DNA to glass slides.

The collaboration involves sending the English script to the collaborator, who translate it into another language record the translated script and send us the audio file(s). We stitch together the audio clips and the presentation slides to make the video.
We have had 13 different iGEM teams collaborate with us, resulting in language project videos in 17 different languages for a total of 25 videos. Through these collaborations, we were able to interact and share with all these teams, and it formed a big part of our iGEM experience to talk with such a diverse group of people working for the same goal.

""Unity is strength. . . when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved."" -Mattie Stepanek
UBonn HBRS 2016 iGEM team
The team of the University of Bonn aims to revolutionize paper recycling through a new approach of de-inking the recycled paper. Since both our teams are working with Bacillus subtilis we supported their team with our optimized and functional protocol for the transformation of B. subtilis (Link to our protocol). Thankfully they gave us a protocol for making competent cells to establish in our project. Since we all struggled with the varieties of protocols we came up with the idea to write a guide for “How to Bacillus subtilis”. Both teams tested and evaluated protocols to choose which ones will make it into the final manual.
Bacillus subtilis Manual
-
A Collaboration
This guide offers step-by-step introductions for preparing basic mediums, inducing sporulation, competent cells and the transformation of cells. Our goal is to share this manual with future iGEM teams, lab groups and basically anyone who starts working with Bacillus subtilis. Therefore anybody can benefit of our collected knowledge.

Technion Israel 2016 iGEM team
The Technion team uses the principle of chemotaxis, the movement of bacteria in response to chemical stimuli, as an innovative and easy-to-handle detection method. To determine the behavior of the swarming bacteria, mathematical models are needed. We are glad that we were able to help them in modelling missing parts of their project- the aerotaxis. We were able to model the oxygen distribution for time and location and also the internal energy distribution for the bacteria.

The iGEM Meetup hosted by Carnegie Mellon University
Carnegie Mellon was able to host an iGEM meetup on Saturday, September 6th at the Mellon Institute. A total of six teams and about 50 participants attended including a high school team that the University of Pittsburgh had been mentoring. The following teams were in attendance:
University of Michigan
University of Michigan Software Team
Pennsylvania State University
University of Pittsburgh
Montgomery High School
Carnegie Mellon University
The day started with each team presenting their respective projects while the other teams wrote down feedback and questions. We then transitioned to a Q&A panel of past participants and their experiences with iGEM. Some Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh advisors as well as some members of the Michigan teams had previously participated in iGEM and answered questions relating to the Jamboree, forming a team, picking a project, etc.
As the final part of the meet up, all of the teams socialized and discussed projects while rotating through the workshops we had set up. There were initially three scheduled workshops: poster, public speaking and wiki. However, the representative for the poster workshop was unable to attend. The presentation and wiki workshops were very successful in helping teams recognize their strengths, weaknesses, and working through any technical issues as far as the wiki. Professor Julia Deems of Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business specializes in communication. She was able to give each team feedback specific to their presentation on what they can do to make more of an impact at the Jamboree. The wiki workshop was led by Jonathan deWerd, a graduate student in biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, and he was able to provide feedback to any teams that had questions about putting together their wiki.
Over the course of the day, all of the teams were able to learn more about other iGEM projects as well as advance their own project further due to the conversation and feedback that comes from collaboration. We had great fun learning about what everyone else had been to this summer and we will definitely recognize the"

Collaboration with Edinburgh iGEM
In August, Edinburgh iGEM approached us asking if we were able to assist them with programming the function of stepper drivers which they used to operate syringe drives. They required the stepper motor to adjust pace based on a number of parameters to give a desired flow rate.
Figure 1: Collaboration with Edinburgh iGEM
A day was arranged when the two teams should meet mid-August. When we met, we first spoke to one of our advisors, Julien Reboud . Following an hour long meeting with Dr. Reboud, we proceeded to discuss the part Edinburgh iGEM hoped Glasgow iGEM could help them with. Their design consisted of two microfluidic flows that would be able to sort cells depending on their fluorescent output when observed underneath a fluorescent microscope. When the threshold level of fluorescence was reached, one of the microfluidic flows, controlled by the stepper motor, would increase in flow rate such that the cell would be “pushed” to a different output due to the shear forces imparted on it. As none of the Edinburgh iGEM team had any experience of programming, we offered our assistance in this area.
Our initial focus was to produce a code that would be able to produce a desired flow rate over a total distance, based on the following parameters:
User’s Desired Flow Rate
Syringe Inner Lumen Diameter
Total Distance of Syringe Travel
Having established these input conditions, we set to work for the next 3 days to write code which would be able to perform as desired. This code is shown below.
//This code should give you the flow rate you enter into the code for a threaded rod of pitch 0.8mm
//
// The limits in flow rate [FOR A SYRINGE OF 4.73mm INNER LUMEN DIAMETER"

Collaboration is a powerful driver of progress in science. To stand on the shoulders of giants is increasingly unrealistic in a globalised world where scientists work in ever more specialised areas and without geographic or language barriers.
For science to continue to benefit from globalisation, we must advance the axiom and seek to build a human pyramid from the shoulders before and around us. Collaboration and open source data are at the heart of iGEM and so too the heart of Incell.
Below we describe our most significant collaborations within the iGEM community. The symbiosis we strive for in our project has shone brightly through the partnerships established with teams around the world. Our story — and the stories of our friends — have been mutually shaped by the diversity of our shared experiences, knowledge and perspectives.

The 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community
This year, we participated into a great party hosted by ShanghaiTech University——Conference of China iGEMer community (also known as CCiC). During this conference, amazing presentations were performed to show out every team’s creative project. In addition, during the panel session, members from each team came up to the stage to share their experience in this iGEM competition, either the happiest one or the most sorrow one. And also we communicated with a lot of teams about every we learnt"

In the end, we shared many ideas with them on how to arrange team members, how to improve working efficiency and so on.
Even though the meeting lasted only about 3 hours,it waslong enough to build precious friendship between all of us from two different teams. And we sincerely hope our advice do help them with their work.
Apart from communication between team members, our teacher, professor Ma Gang also warm-heartedly participated in the construction of iGem team of ShanghaiTech University. In the beginning of 2016, Professor Ma Gang was invited to be the judge of the university-wide iGem competition. In the competition, Professor Ma offered his own advice and judgements on their projects and helped select the representative project of these teams. According to Professor Ma, this is a brilliant competition which improves him a lot.

Hence, we get the fringe number.
Fringe Spacing
Store the fringes as undirected graph: By travelling all elements in the matrix, we add a edge in the graph for all fringe (represented as 0)
For example, a matrix like this:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\

We can obtain the table of edges:

((2,1),(3,1)) \\
((3,1),(4,1)) \\
((0,2),(0,3)) \\

Do the depth-first-search for the users’ input ending pixel: We obtain the DFS spanning tree, which records the fringe the ending pixel is in.
Calculate the distance of consecutive pixels in the fringe that users choose by the starting and ending pixels to obtain the fringe order: Users choose a pixel, and we find the corresponding fringe, then calculate the distance of these pixels. We set the minimum distance as the fringe spacing.
Fringe Order
We suppose the fringes are concentric circles by the theory in optics(Team USTC used Michelson Interferometer in the SPRING hardware).Meanwhile, the relationship of fringe order and fringe radius is as follows:
$$r=\alpha\sqrt{n}$$
$r$ is the fringe radius, $n$ is the fringe order, and $\alpha$ is a constant set by users.By this equation, we can get the fringe order from the fringe radius.In the experiment of Team USTC, the relationship is $\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{\lambda r^2}{2h}}$,where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of laser, $r$ is half the thickness of thin-film, and $h$ is the distance from film moved by bacterium to the film’s original place.
Now, we derive uncertainty formula: supposed that the first point's fringe series which users select is $n$, the fringe radius is $r_n$, the second point's"

The next day, we spun down 500μl of each culture, resuspended in 1ml PBS buffer, and took OD600 measurements to calculate the relative cell density of each culture. For the fluorescence measurements, we used a Typhoon FLA 9500 with the samples in a 96-well plate. Each of the 16 samples were pipetted into 3 wells with 300μl each. The settings on the Typhoon were: 1) excitation laser at 532nm and emission filter above 575nm and 2) excitation laser at 473nm and emission filter above 575nm. Both were across the whole 96-well plate, but the second lower excitation wavelength was included in case the first was too high to excite the KillerOrange protein.
Results
For each of the wells, a fluorescence value in arbitrary units (au) was calculated using ImageQuant software, where we set the 3 wells of PBS only blanks as 0% fluorescence, and the well with the highest value as 100% to convert au into percentage. Next, we normalised for any natural fluorescence in the cells by subtracting the average of the “cells only” wells (DH5α, and DH5α.Z1, both with and without IPTG) from all wells, and then corrected for the difference in cell density between samples by dividing the normalised fluorescence measurements by the OD600 values. For each sample, the average across the 3 wells was plotted on a graph:
These data indicate that there is no difference in fluorescence between either KillerRed or KillerOrange and the cells only control either with or without induction with IPTG. There could be several reasons for this, including the light was not intense enough to excite the fluorescent proteins, however no fluorescence from this type of the test with a laser for excitation would be unlikely.  It is also possible that no protein is being produced, which could be due to insufficient IPTG. However, the RFP in BBa_J04450 under the control of the lac-repressible promoter BBa_R0010 clearly shows that in the DH5α.Z1 strain, there is less fluorescence without IPTG, than with IPTG. While this does show that 1mM IPTG is sufficient to induce"

iGEM Aachen - iGEM York
Providing strains
The iGEM Team York built a digital in-line holographic microscope (DIHM) this year. To validate its function, they used a number of different microorganisms that iGEM teams      worked with this year. We provided the iGEM Team York with several mutants of our S.cerevisiae strain (Fig.).
iGEM Aachen - iGEM Knoxville
Mentoring and Troubleshooting
For a successful project, a critical and objective review of the progress and problems is necessary. To ensure this objective view, we have conducted repeated discussions with the iGEM Team Knoxville.     In addition, we held a mentoring session focused on the problems of iGEM Team Knoxville regarding the  recruitment of a new team. We discussed ways to improve the this process in the future      to form a larger team for the coming years.
In troubleshooting sessions, a detailed description of the problems of the respective projects was discussed. With the results obtained from these sessions, we improved our project several      times and adapted our work so that our project is easier to understand and our laboratory work becomes faster. Especially our Project Presentation was really complicated and misleading in the      beginning and has been improved a lot with the help of the iGEM Team Knoxville.
iGEM Aachen - iGEM Delft
European Meet-Up
The Delft european meeting was our first international meet-up. This brought along a lot of positive effects on our whole team as a whole and on our working goals towards the Giant Jamboree.
At first, we arrived at a camping place after a long trek in the beautiful suburbs of Delft surrounded just by nature. In this camping place we got the opportunity to meet a few other members      of the attending teams. Starting from there the whole experience was full of interchange with our iGEM peers. That night we went out and got to get a glimpse of the city and exchanged our      ideas accompanied by the warmth of a good pub.
On the second day, we attended the scheduled symposium where we got to listen to three uppermost interesting presentations by Prof. Dekker, Dr. Stemering and last but not least Prof. Murphy.
Prof. Dekker as a pioneer in biophysics gave us a glimpse into his research on synthetic biology. We were really excited to"

TU_Dresden,2017,"We took the great opportunity at the German-wide Meetup to share our vision about green labwork.
We informed and involved nine teams from Germany in an interactive workshop .
The Teams from CCA-iGEM (San Diego, USA) and the iGEM Team Lund (Sweden) came up with great ideas to extend our GoGreenGuide .
We also developed a Carbon Footprint Calculation Tool , where teams can easily determine the environmental impact of their laboratory work. Our team from TU Dresden, the iGEM Team of SDU-Denmark , Team Potsdam and Team Aachen have calculated their Carbon Footprint using this tool.
As a symbolic act of sustainability, we asked all teams to plant trees. Here, the Teams of iGEM SDU-Denmark , iGEM Peshawar , and CCA iGEM got involved, too.
However, many more iGEM Teams participated by saving consumables and energy in the lab, biked to work or even became active in environmental projects.

German-wide Meetup
All participants of the German-wide Meetup
The Idea
The concept of the German-wide Meetup was as to gather all the teams to network and set up collaborations for the iGEM Giant Jamboree.
In the beginning of October, the team was a small group of Bachelor’s and Master’s students with very little diversity. By November, the team doubled in size and included members from many departments: CRTD, BIOTEC and the Biology Department at the TU Dresden. We became a truly international iGEM team, covering many disciplines and nationalities. With the resources we had pulled together now, we thought we can plan something big, a German-wide Meetup.  We could host the meetup, using the whole of Dresden and be able to accommodate all the German iGEM teams. Out of the 13 that were invited, 9 came to the assembly, with a total of 50 people attending. The goals of the meetup were:
Sharing our iGEM experience so far
Getting to know the projects and visions of all attending teams
Train the pitch and presentation skills in order to prepare for the Giant Jamboree
Finding collaborations and strengthen the bonds between the teams
Increasing the general knowledge about Synthetic Biology through conferences and events
Having a fun weekend together
Preparation
To prepare for the meetup, a team was assembled to manage and organize the scheduling, food costs, designs and logos, accommodation, etc. Sponsors had to be found and boxes had to be checked to"
SVCE_CHENNAI,2017," they had faced while preparing the M9 media. In addition to this, we also decided to test each others pH parts and compare the results obtained.
They characterized the alx system with both the promoter and the pH riboswitch, while we did it only with the riboswitch, this gave us an oppurtunity to compare the effect on pH sensitive regulation by the RNA thermometer and pH riboswitch.
University of Sydney
University of Sydney has helped us to troubleshoot the problems that we were facing with ligation. They suggested some ideas that aided in the improvement of the protocol that we followed and also pointed out some of the possible mistakes that we could be making while ligating  our parts. We were also provided with a protocol for troubleshooting ligations and transformations which enabled us to  optimize our protocols. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE PDF.
Indian iGEM Meet-up
We had the chance of meeting all the other Indian teams at the All India iGEM meet-up held at IISER Pune. Each team presented their project, received valuable feedback and explored various avenues of improvement. It was also good to know about the projects that the other teams were working on which helped us to consider the possible platforms for collaborating with them.

We collaborate with Team NJU-China for help of part construction. Though we have achieved tangible results of antibody responses, the lab in the Center for Disease Control does not provide additional Biobrick parts construction due to the Chinese laws. Plus, we didn’t receive the official kit until early September. So we turned to Team NJU-China for help. After the discussion about the project, we decided to use psb1c3 as the Biobrick assembly plasmid. In addition, they helped us to design and build the primer of our parts as follows:
Moreover, they let us use their facilities and labs for further experiments. Without them, Biobrick parts could never be constructed."

USTC-Software,2015," we display a more graceful style:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{U_n}{n}=\frac{2c\delta_n}{c\delta_n-\delta^2_d}\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_n}}{\delta_n}+\frac{2(c\delta_n+\delta_d^2)}{c\delta_n-\delta_d^2}\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_d}}{\delta_d}
\end{align}
$$
For more derivation, we suppose that the distance between any fringes is a constant because the density of fringes is enough. So, we would get:
$$\delta_d\approx\Delta d\cdot\delta_n$$
In the formula, $\Delta d$is the distance between fringes. Continuly, we would get:
$$
\begin{align}
\delta_d^2 & =(\Delta d\cdot\delta_n)^2 \\
& = c\delta^2_n\cdot(\sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt{n})^2 \\
\end{align}
$$
Because the density of fringes is enough, the value of $n$ would be large. As a result, we could get $\sqrt{n+1}\approx\sqrt{n}$, so, the $(7)$ means:
$$\delta_d^2\lt\lt c\delta_n$$
So, we could simpilfy the $(5)$ and we could get:
$$\frac{U_n}{n}=2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_n}}{\delta_n}+2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_d}}{\delta_d}$$
Based on The Most Uncertainty and The Average of Principle of Uncertainty, if we want to $\frac{U_n}{n}\le 5\%$, we would assure that $2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_n}}{\delta_n}\le 2.5\%$ and $2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_d}}{\delta_d}\le 2.5\%$, that's to say:
$$
\begin{align}
U_{\delta_n}\le 2\cdot2.5\%\delta_n \\
U_{\delta_d}\le 2\cdot2.5\%\delta_d \\
\end{align}

In terms of our testing picture, the value of $\delta_n$ is $50$, so the value of $U_{\delta_n}$ is $0.625$, and the error of"

Great work is done by joint hands. This year USTC had extensive collaborations with iGEM teams worldwide. We cooperated with BIT, USTC-Software, HFUT-China, SCU and UCAS, and took part in meet-up held by NCTU-Formosa and Peking University, and send newsletters to Amoy. During these cooperation, we learned novel idea from other teams as well as helped them with their works.
USTC and BIT both focus on measurement and hardware this year. Thus we face the same challenges. We are really glad that we can have collaborations in experiment, hardware and modeling.
Process
We got in touch with BIT in 2015 iGEM Asian Conference in NCTU (Hsinchu, Taiwan) at the end of July and both of us are interested in each other’s projects. In Beijing during CCiC conference, we deeply exchanged our projects and opinions on each other's project. In this meeting, we determined that we can cooperate in the aspects of experiment, hardware and modeling. After that, we assist each other though Internet and made great progress.
Figure 1. Collaboration with BIT
Result
Ultimately, USTC helped BIT building a better model while BIT assisted USTC with bacteria freeze-drying. As both of us built hardware, we shared our opinions and advice which worked in our benefits.
Modeling
For years, USTC is famous for advantage in math. When BIT met difficulty in build a mathematic model for a competitive biochemical reaction, we proved them with a solution and helped them found proper variables.
Bacteria freeze-drying
Bacteria is hard to transport, but with freeze-drying technique, plasmids can travel far away. So we hope we can freeze-dry bacteria. Important as this experiment is, we really appreciate that BIT helped us with this.

HUST-China,2016," year we’ll have a new iGEM high school team in the Giant Jamboree!
Team experience sharing
New team
NWPU is a newly founded iGEM team this year. We had a meetup with them on May 22th and shared our experience in team organizing, training, project preparing and some tips on attending the Giant Jamboree abroad.
We are glad to be helpful for them to their participation in iGEM this year, and we look forward to their performance in the Giant Jamboree.
Shanhai-Tech is also a new team this year. We made acquaintance with them during iGEM HUST-Cheering （ click here if interested to know more ） and kept close contact with each other afterwards. They were impressed by our passion during the meetups and we gave them detailed suggestions on part submissions, part documents and and filling of judging form. And we also shared some experience on how to get important information from official website and some reminders of the due-date. We expect to meet them again at the Jamboree!
Wuhan iGEM Committee
After the frequent communications and collaborations last year, we had established Wuhan iGEM Committee with HAZU-China and WHU-China. Earlier this year, on April 17th, members from the three teams met together at HUST. We exchanged our preliminary ideas of our 2016 project and discussed the matters on interlab collaboration among three teams.
Wetlab cooperation
Experimental design help out
In order to test our engineered strain in a more elegant way, we planned to make a time gradient visual aid. We set GFP and RFP as report genes to detect the switch function through time.Team JSNU-China knew about our project and they are interested in this characterization, so they volunteered to do a pre-experiment for us. We delivered our test samples to them and their feedbacks are promising. They proved the possibility of the method and suggested that we improve the detailed process to make the result more convincing and concrete. We really appreciated their contributions!
Equipment help out
Team HZAU-China has always been good at modeling and measurement. We have been in good connection and often discussed problems about team construction and experiment with each other. During the iGEM HUST-Cheering! meetup, we put up our suggestions on their circuit design to help them build more concrete regulations on bacteria movement. And we also helped each other on experiments.
Owing to limitation of experimental conditions, we got a problem of measurement this year. HZAU-China generously offered access to their lab and microplate reader"

EPFL,2018,", we followed two approaches: firstly to study the impact of the techniques used in the project as well                   as the awareness of those performing them, second to study the controversies that might occur in the future implementation of our project.
The survey was distributed in two stages, aimed at two distinct stakeholders of synthetic biology. The first stage was a formal EPFL questionnaire distributed among second year Life Sciences Engineering bachelor students during their laboratory                 practicals. It was included as a reflection part of an ethical course of engineers in biotechnology. The second stage was a distribution externally to the campus and country on animal experimentation, patient biological data protection,                 vaccination and biotechnology in general.
The questionnaire differs from that of the NUS Singapore-Sci iGEM Team in terms of content and is focused on gathering data specific to our project so that we can understand how to implement that data, however the discussion and exchange                 of ideas that we had allowed us to clarify our intentions in terms of the subjects we wanted to touch on for our surveys.
iGEM XMU China
We were very excited to get contacted by this year’s XMU iGEM team who are working on their own assay called the Aptamer Based Cell-free Detection system (ABCD system). They are using Cas12a in an ingenuitive way to detect proteins through                   the intermediary of aptamers. Indeed, aptamers have the capacity of recognizing a specific protein and by doing so will release a ssDNA that will be recognized by Cas12a. Since both of our teams are working on a Cas12a detection using                   fluorophore quencher it was natural for us to give them all the knowledge we had gathered over the summer about our Cas12a assay.
In addition to their detection method, XMU’s team worked on improving protein’s conservation and were kind enough to share their information on using SAHS proteins as a Cas12a protective agent. It was obvious for us that we could immensely                 benefit from this to bring our follow up cancer surveillance closer to the point-of-care. Unfortunately because of time restrictions we were not able to integrate their assay. This collaboration was nevertheless extremely conducive to                 reflect on how we would get closer to our end product and for this we are very appreciative!
iGEM Athens
The collaboration with the Athens IGEM team started early in the summer, after members of both teams identified multiple shared attributes between the two projects, namely cell free expression, and diagnostic kit development. Thus, the contact started with             multiple video conferences over the summer. These conferences discussed iGEM EPFL’s experience with cell free systems optimization,"
BostonU_HW,2018," under a continuous influx of media. The outputted media would then be analyzed to see if the inhibitor molecules they were looking to produced had been secreted. After doing some literature review on cell culturing microfluidic devices, we designed a chip with two sized cell traps, one to trap the bacterial cells, the other to trap the mammalian cells. Unfortunately, the necessary size of the bacterial cell traps were features too small for us to fabricate. We sent the MIT team our SVG design files for the chip in case they wanted to manufacture the chip through some other means."

CollaborationWe got a lot through our iGEM journey, and one of the best and most valuable among them was our cooperation with other iGEM team. In this win-win process, we exchanged our ideas, inspired creativity, and even helped each other to run experiments. Collaboration With iGEM Team BGIC China Team BGIC China>>Us Team BGIC China were working on a programmable and open-source Next Generation Bio-Chip (NGBC) which allows user with knowledge in synthetic biology to easily re-program and re-construct it in order to make new bio-chips with different functions. They based their NGBC on E. coli S30 Extract System for Circular DNA(Promega), the same with ours. They also utilized enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ) as one of their reporter gene. So they helped us to test whether S30 system was qualified as a platform for translation of enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ). Here is their result.
Figure: The blue liquid in the small eppendorf is the S30 system with gene circuit coding enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ) and its substrates, X-gal, after hours of reaction. It qualitatively proved that our S30 cell-free system works well.
We also tested this with a different reporter gene, luciferase. Check our results in the “Proof of Concept” section of our wiki.
SFLS>>Team BGIC China We helped Team BGIC China by constructing plasmid pfadr for them. Plasmid pfadr is already in the parts collection and is modified to be responsive to fatty acid. Here are some of the results we got in the process.

We have really close relationship with Team BGIC China, because we share the same laboratory with them and received training on the cloning cycled together. We also shared a great part of cloning materials in the beginning of our experiment because our materials haven’t arrived yet. We always had great communication about our projects and on our testing experiments, since our projects are based on the same technology platform-cell-free system.

Our team has successfully and directly followed the meaning of the word “Collaboration”, which originated from Latin con- (“with”) and labōrō (“work”). We found several iGEM teams that we happily involved in our activities and dry lab development of SynDrop, as well as joined their initiatives and proposals. Entering into relations with like-minded people and broadening our scientific network came as mutual benefits which may evolve to common projects in the future as well.

iGEM teams participating in BioHackathon
As you may have already read in other sections of this wiki page, our team has organised BioHackathon - the international coding competition. Since symbiosis between Life Sciences and IT fields in Lithuania still is in its initial stage, we considered about gaining valuable experience from other countries, especially from other iGEM teams. Because of that we have invited iGEM teams to visit Vilnius and take part in 48 hours-lasting BioHackathon: Lab Issues event. As a result, team Aalto-Helsinki (Finland), team Lund (Sweden) and team Groningen (Netherlands) accepted the invitation. We considered it to be a very meaningful collaboration because everyone was working on the same goal – to create programmes or tools which were supposed to ease teams’ everyday laboratory life. Most of the BioHackathon ideas grew from from difficulties faced while working on their own iGEM projects. In that case, final applications and tools, created during BioHackathon, had improved their projects or at least relieved the realization of ideas. Some teams have been in touch with mentors after the event and received qualified advices. We have also used some created tools including team Lund search-engine that helped us in searching for particular BioBricks. Additionally, as team Aalto-Helsinki stated, it has been a great chance to learn about other iGEM projects, exchange knowledge and experience as well. As BioHackathon took place in the Life Sciences Center where the major part of our project development happened, teams had an opportunity to take a look at our laboratories and daily workspace. We strongly believe that such an event might become a pattern for the future collaborations.

Styczynski Lab at Georgia Tech
Our iGEM team was inspired for our project by the work in the Styczynski Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Professor Styczynski and his graduate students, Monica McNerney and Daniel Watstein are currently working on engineering a zinc biosensor.  (Watstein, McNerney and Styczynski 2015) Their use of the violacein and carotenoid pathway as a biosensor for zinc micronutrient deficiencies led us to investigate other visual detection sensors.  Chromoproteins from the Uppsala 2013 collection seemed to be a natural place to start.  The Endy Lab and Edinburgh's 2014 projects into ""degrons"" or degradation tags were also inspirations for our project.
In addition, Dr. Styczynski and Monica McNerney have been mentors and advisors to us. They have met with us multiple times to revise our project and troubleshoot issues both in person and by Skype calls. Dr. Styczynski has also generously provided materials that a high school lab does not have access to, and has periodically allowed us use of his lab for training and use of specialized equipment. We could not have completed our project without this collaboration!
Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
In order to further understand the impact of our project, we discussed micronutrient deficiencies with Dr. Ralph Whitehead, a researcher from the CDC. During the interview we asked questions about micronutrient  deficiencies in multiple regions around the globe. The insightful answers gave us a better understanding of the micronutrient problems that affect different areas. Micronutrient deficiencies are often unspecified through different regions because micronutrient amounts available in the soil can vary between agricultural fields within the same village. He shared the specific process of blood analysis for micronutrient amounts. He also named other organizations that are working on the development of a household indicator for blood analysis. The process from blood sampling to results and actions to resolve the deficiencies can take weeks and has enormous resource costs. The blood samples must stay refrigerated and travel long distances to clinics or labs. The results of the tests then needs to be delivered back to the patient and caretakers. Dr. Whitehead also touched on the CDC’s specific process"

COLLABORATIONS
  This year the collaboration of our team with SCU_China team and UESTC-software team were very smoothly as expected. We helped each other from the aspects of experimental design, experiment results verification and software to reach the iGEM spirit of resource sharing. The following is a detailed description.
In 2015 iGEM, we CHINA_CD_UESTC team collaborated with SCU_China team and UESTC-software team. We communicated several times, helped each other and shared our resources, which generated a great atmosphere of cooperation and mutual assistance. Indeed, we helped SCU_China team finish the prediction and experiment design about RBS in their project.
In this process, our team had completed two aspects of the collaboration work:
(1) Help SCU_China team to design the experiments and complete the experimental demonstration of RBS forecast outcomes.
(2) Provide the theoretical support of developing SD Finder software aiming to predict the ribosome binding site (RBS) position to UESTC-software team.
Design experiments for SCU_China team
We helped SCU_China team design the experiment. In order to find the unknown RBS position and standard it, we designed the folowing experiments for them:
1. Demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifD
2. Mutant demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifD
3. Demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifK
4. Mutant demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifK
CHINA_CD_UESTC team finally completed the design of these experiments, which helped SCU_China team accomplish the work of forecast RBS position.
SD Finder Theoretical Support
It was in our theoretical knowledge support that UESTC-software team helped SCU_China team develop a RBS prediction software which named SD Finder. The two teams, CHINA_CD_UESTC team and UESTC-software team, made up deficiencies in theoretical support and software technology to each other and cooperated to complete the SD Finder smoothly. The main function of SD Finder is helping user predict the"

SYSU Software iGEM team visualizations
Our team began to scrape team data and abstracts from the iGEM database using a web scraper, with the aim of                 identifying common themes between different teams, so as to create a tool that could potentially help teams                 find others with similar topics in the future. We wish to further improve the database by converting the                 csv file, which contains a lot of keywords, into a visualization where the output will be a visualized diagram                 that is easier to search, more creative and more user-friendly. Because our modelling team is not expert                 in making visualization using JavaScript, we decided to post our collaboration request on iGEM collaboration                 page to seek help from iGEM teams to improve the visualization for interested iGEM teams to use in the future.
SYSU software team was enthusiastic about this collaboration. We have achieved our final goal for this finished                 product, which is to put the Network Visualization on our wiki page!
This is how we make the visualization happen: CLICK ME
Modeling and characterization collaboration with CUHK
For modelling collaboration, our modelling team bidirectionally cooperated with CUHK's modelling team in the early summer.                 We contributed two Python scripts for CUHK team. One of them was for simulating and plotting an ODE-based                 model using Euler's method. The other was for simulating and plotting a stochastic model using a Gillespie                 algorithm. Both of these scripts were used for them to model the proportion of active and inactive toehold                 switches in their project.
In the opposite direction, we received from CUHK iGEM team a Python interface implemented with Cython that would                 allow us to call functions from a library called ViennaRNA which is written in C. Since it can be quite difficult                 to use functions between different languages like Python and C, and CUHK team’s interface greatly simplified                 our workload for modelling. We used this interface to estimate the dissociation constant for the antis"

Mentoring Local High School Team
United Christian College (Kowloon East) in Hong Kong is the first high school in Hong Kong to participate in iGEM.            Since its establishment, HKU Team has been mentoring this new team which we believe will be the role model for future high school iGEM teams in Hong Kong.            We provided this team of budding synthetic biologists administrative guidance through regular joint-team meetings,            helped them with their ideas developing stage and offered them technical support in later stages of their project.            It was our pleasure to share our 7 years of iGEM experience with the UCCKE team.
We were impressed by the fascinating new ideas from UCCKE team in the brainstorm session held in March at HKU.            Our team members gave UCCKE team some advices on iGEM and commented on their project designs.             Another meeting was held in August, in which we focused on troubleshooting and laboratory collaboration.
We have delivered a sharing session at their school as well to provide another perspective in synthetic biology to more high school students.
Global Collaborations
In emphasizing the ‘I’ in the iGEM, we have been very active in seeking collaborations between local institutes as well as international ones.              We approached teams from several universities worldwide to seek possible inter-institute collaborations, these includes Dundee University, Imperial College London, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) and National University of Singapore.
At the end of the day, we helped NUS to distribute over 100 questionnaires on the issue of cancer treatment at HKU.              This act helps NUS to collect data oversea and obtain an alternative perspective.

This year,the WLC-Milwaukee iGEM team was able to send one of our team members who was in Taiwan over the summer to the Asia Pacific iGEM Conference!
Over the course of the Conference, our attending team member received valuable feedback from teams on the operation of our system and the specifics of a color change based system. Participating teams gave and exchanged ideas during the poster and presentation sessions where we gained valuable input on the availability of other cheap test kit options in Asia that allowed us to better consider the marketing of our test kit in Asian communities. We were also able to improve the physical design of our test kit based on suggestions from various teams and the questions other teams had for the practicality of our system.
Overall, this was an exciting way for our team to collaborate with and get to know iGEMers in different regions of the world building friendships and connections that will aid in future collaboration efforts."

Inter-team collaboration is a hallmark of iGEM. We collaborated with three different teams in the 2015 iGEM season. We assisted the University of Maryland team with the Interlab Measurement Study. We also helped out the Cambridge-JIC team by supplying them with fluorescent constructs to serve as positive controls for their Project: OpenScope 3D Printed Fluorescent Microscope Initiative. Finally, we participated in a collaborative effort with the University of Georgia iGEM team to determine fluorescence values for mCherry proteins controlled under an archaeal RBS library.

To use GMM products in these countries, the government formalities should be done before use, as stated in their laws and policies. In Brazil, there is a registry for biological products. In Japan and Korea there is no such law for GMM products. In Indonesia, supplementary documents must be submitted to use GMM biological foods and products. In Australia, there is no such law for GMM products.  In terms of international trade (export, import), countries like the United States, India, and Korea have clear laws detailing the procedures. They have taken permission and submission of documents to the law regarding this export and import of GMM uses. In European countries, these directly come under the laws of regulations of GMMs. There seem to be no specific laws regulating international GMM trade in Australia, Japan, Korea and Canada.   The most important documents related to GMMs are concerned with biosafety, food, trade and production processes. In places such as India, European Union, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, there are many different laws regulating each of these issues. On the other hand, Korea, Indonesia, and Australia have only one or two laws governing all these issues.

On September 10th, we met up with a team member of Manchester team. We mainly discussed differences of GMM legislations between Japan and Europe. We realized that both Japan and Europe have strict legislations of GMOs, but Europe has stricter obligations for companies to label products containing GMOs. We also talked about Japan’s interesting labeling, which many company spontaneously write ‘This product is NOT genetically modified food’ on the package. We also exchanged our information and opinions on the projects and also differences of the environment around the teams and the managements of the teams.

Public Activities Collaboration
According to the result of public survey, we found that the understanding of synthetic biology and genetic-modified related works is clearly insufficient for general public. For Team HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS, Worldshaper-Wuhan, Zhejiang University (ZJU-China), Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT-China) and as well as Jiangnan University (Jiangnan), they were also aware of this problem. So we cooperate with each other to hold public science activities for the same purpose.
In Hangzhou low carbon science and technology museum China, our team, together with HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS, Worldshaper-Wuhan, held one united public event to publicize our project and related knowledge of synthetic biology and genetic engineering. We have conducted in-depth cooperation from various aspects. For example, we discussed the activity plan, prepared the materials we needed. When we were understaffed, Worldshaper-XSHS and HFLS_ZhejiangUnited helped us to undertake the DNA extraction experiment and maintain the order, respectively. The event achieved a good response.
We also had lots of fun working together towards a shared goal. On the day of practicing in Hangzhou low carbon science and technology museum, we gathered together earlier than the opening time. After briefly talked about each team’s responsibility in the activity, we started preparing our own tasks. Our team’s job was mainly focused on setting up different stations demonstrating science experiments about our topic and generally Genetics. While the other two teams had their own stations and were responsible for a reward station to encourage kids to finish the activities in every station, we held by giving out gifts for accomplishment, as well as,  maintaining the order in stations. As the main demonstrator of the experiment of gene extraction of bananas, we lectured kids about genetics and the lab procedure. In the end, almost everyone, no matter what team they were in, worked together to help out with each and every level of the experiment.
In Zhejiang science and technology museum, we held a bigger event, called 2018 Shengxi Science Day, on Aug. 19th. In this event, we not only cooperated with two other high school team (HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS), but also cooperated with three university team including Zhejiang University (ZJU-China), Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT-China) and Jiangnan University (Jiangnan).

4. Keep good hygiene
a. Provide workers with appropriate clothing
b. Provide appropriate storage for the equipment
5. Provide workers with relevant training
For more details, read Directive 2000/54/EC.
Currently there are no limits to worker exposure to biological agents. However, employers are required under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 to provide a safe working environment that minimises health risks. This can include providing information, supervision, training and protective equipment (if necessary). A risk assessment must also be performed and the employer must take required measures to reduce these risks.
There are no rules regarding specifically the exposure to biological agents; the employers must monitor the exposure levels under the same rules for other substances (Act 3214/1978).
Ministry of Health by the Public Health Institute (ISP) provides the following services:
1. Generation of protocols for risks and exposure evaluation.
2. Specific actions over biological agents and disinfection.
3. Elaboration of guides for reception, manipulation, transport and biological agents diffusion in the labour place.
4. Generation of new protocols associated with the area as elimination and disposal of dangerous biological residues.
5. Certification of bio-clean areas, biohazards control zones and sampling of viable bioparticules.
General requirements for biological agents manipulation:
1. Use of personal protection equipment (PPE) according to the activity (D.S. N°173/82 by Health Ministry).
2. The PPE must not hinder in the work done. Workers must be informed about the right use of PPE before to start working.

In return, CGU_Taiwan helped us independently verify that overexpression of OmpR234 (BBa_K2229200) produces more biofilms than control (BBa_K342003).
A) Our experimental results showed that E. coli overexpressing OmpR234 (BBa_K2229200) is producing more biofilm than a control which does not overexpress OmpR234 (BBa_K342003). B) CGU_Taiwan independently tested our constructs using crystal violet, a dye commonly used to quantify biofilm formation. BBa_K2229200 showed higher absorbance compared to the control BBa_K342003, reflecting the formation of more biofilm, which matches our results. Experiment: Yvonne Wei

They designed their wiki barrier-free and additionally gave us very helpful tips to improve our guide to an accessible wiki. Using their tips, like e.g. adding examples, our guide is now easier to understand so that even beginner wiki managers can use our guide to design an accessible wiki.
When contacting the iGEM team of the Kings College in London, our call for an accessible iGEM competition was met with a (to us) new idea. KCL has a public campaign in which they ask to design websites accessible for people with special educational needs (sen). We were  happy to participate in their campaign. It’s just as easy to design your wiki suitable for sen people as it is to design a wiki accessible for people with visual impairment!
To conclude, through this collaboration with all these amazing teams, we could improve the Human Practices part of our project by spreading awareness on the inclusion of people with disabilities into the scientific community. For the future, we hope for the iGEM community to adopt this design and by this to be a shining example for the rest of the scientific and general public. One possibility to do this could be to embrace accessible web design as a medal criterium or a requirement in general.

Collaboration
UC Davis iGEM team has benefitted and supported the UC Santa Cruz iGEM team this year, through several skype calls, a meeting at the UC Bioengineering Symposium, and UC Davis hosting a delegation from UC Santa Cruz and collaborating on Human Practices work and sharing Bacillus subtilis plates.
Key Points:
Collaboration on Human Practices: Both teams followed Institutional Review Board review process and received exemption for our surveys.
Collaboration on Bacillus subtilis: The UC Davis team shared several subtilis strains with permission from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center, as well as protocols from both the stock center and advisers.
Human Practices
The Human Practices Collaboration included a survey that complied with IRB regulations. To see these regulations in greater detail, please see the guide, including details about both UC Davis and UC Santa Cruz’s respective IRB systems as well as our consent disclosures. We worked to ensure that both teams went through the required human subjects trainings and that these interventions were carried out to the highest ethical standards. We had multiple skype meetings, met up at the UC Bioengineering Symposium, and shared a meeting with some team members over the summer.
Between the two teams, we collected 44 responses. Some initial analysis is visible here:
The results are further analyzed throughout the wiki, and have provided an essential resource in coming to our policy conclusions.
Here are pictures of our teams meetings:

Collaboration With AiJu
As one of the most successful social enterprise in China, AiJu offered great guidance to our team during the development of 1kg Bio-Box.At the first meeting, we primarily talked about the topic of the box, whether it should be biobricks, experiments, or others. Eventually, considering the limited chemistry and biology knowledge of our potensial user, we put our focus on biobricks, the base and one of the key concepts of synthetic biology, which is comparitively easy to understand and can also provide a peek of synthetic biology. Afterwards, we began to draw the outline of the box's design and divided our team into two groups, one focusing on the hardware part of the box while the other designing the contexts, games, and rules. The next time we met with AiJu aimed at improving the draft of the box from the perspective of professional education tool kit developers. We learnt a lot from the suggestion from AiJu about the essence of innovative education and how to make your product understandable by comics, figures, analogies and so on.
MEETUP IN GUANGZHOU
The first meetup among undergraduate teams and high school teams includes SYSU_CHINA , SYSU_SOFTWARE , SCUT_CHINA , and SCUT_SOFTWARE from Sun Yat-Sen University and South China University of Science and Techonology, and SKLBC_CHINA and SKLBC_GDSYZX from various high schools.
At the beginning of the meetup, all the participants get to know each other by ice-breaking self introductions and form an initial impression on each team's projects.
The second part of the meetup consist of presentations of projects from all the participating teams. During the presentation, all the teams showed great passion and commitment in their projects. Particularly, our team not only learnt a lot more about advanced technology but got a lot of inspiration from other projects as well.
After presentation, all the participants are divided into groups to held a world cafe section on the relationship of software, experiment. We echanged ideas and opinions on this issue with undergraduate students. It was an inspiring and insightful discussion that provides us an extended vision to analyze this multi-dimensional problem.
After the meetup, we kept close contacts with other teams and shared project updates or experience throughout the preparation for iGEM. The collegiate"

BIT-China for BNU-CHINA
This year, we collaborated with BIT-China team and BIT-China held a meeting on 11st. Jul. In this meeting, we exchanged our ideas and communicated about our project. Finally, we confirmed our collaboration relationship between our two teams.
Fig. 1.4 Meeting with BNU-CHINA
Because most of our members are fresh, we did not have enough experience on iGEM competition. After the discussion, BIT-China decided to help us finish part of our gene circuits. Meanwhile, they suffered some difficulties in characterize two basic parts, NhaA and NhaB. They also meet some problems in modeling, so we helped them with characterization of their parts and modeling part of their project.
They helped us finish the light regulation system (Pcons+B0034+PcyA+B0034+ho1). In this system, Pcons is a constitutive promoter family member (from BBa_J23100 to BBa_J23119) which can be used to tune the expression level of express part and what they choose is BBa_J23100. BBa_B0034 is strong ribosome binding sites (RBS). PcyA and ho1 are two requisite genes which are required for the transformation from heme into PCB. Ho1 will oxidizes the heme group and then generate biliverdin IX alpha, and PcyA converts biliverdin IX alpha into phycocyanobilin (PCB).
Fig. 1.5 Gene circuits of light regulation system
The overlap extension PCR (OE PCR) was used to finish our gene circuits. However, there are secondary structure in this part. So they could not get the part at first. Then they changed DNA polymerase Pfu to PrimerSTAR, another kind of DNA polymerase which performs better than Pfu. Finally the construction of light regulation system is successful.
Fig. 1.6 The construction result of light regulation system
In this period, we also had some discussions about experiments and modeling face to face. Through these discussions, we learnt more about each other and made progress together.

Collaboration with iGEM Chalmers Gothenbourg
In July, requested for help from team iGEM Chalmers-Gothenburg.Although we have some experience with using MATLAB, we are not modelling experts. We wanted to model our biosensor for detecting VOCs. Therefore, iGEM Chalmers-Gothenburg provided support through skype-meetings. Together with iGEM Chalmers-Gothenburg, we conducted a survey covering the public opinion about a mass screening program in both Turkey and Sweden. The results from each country could then be compared to analyze differences in the public opinion about mass screening strategies and how this should be financed. The results of the survey can be found here .

Pretoria_UP,2016," text"" boxes, a ""slider"" and eight ""static text"" boxes. Saving this layout generates a skeleton code.
Once the desired layout was achieved, Matlab generates a skeleton code upon saving which can then be used to assign the various functions to the various handles. Attached is the code as well as the GUIDE layout structure that was used to generate the interactive graph. Three additional functions were added to the code. The first function, “plotter”, was used to generate the actual graph. This function requires three inputs, the total duration of time (in days), the total enzyme concentration as well as the ALA concentration. The second and third functions were required to model the actual concentration changes as a function of time and were provided by team Macquarie.
The two “edit text” handles were then programmed to allow the user to enter their desired enzyme and ALA concentrations. The slider was also programmed to extend or reduce the time duration (X-axis) of the plot. Lastly one of the “static text” handles was programmed to inform the user of the position of the slider, namely a value between 1 and 16 days. A zooming toolbar was also added to the GUI to allow the user to zoom into sections of the plot.
Running the code starts the newly programmed GUI with which the user can now change the various variables and see the effect it has on the concentrations. Figure 2 is a few screenshots of the GUI in action. Due to the nature of Macquarie`s experiments the graph was crucial to make an accurate conclusion about their results. We also helped them to solve coding problems on MatLab.

Collaboration with Heidelberg University
Team Heidelberg was the second runner up during the finals in the 2015 iGEM competition. In our project we needed to design an aptamer that would specifically bind to a target site of a protein present in the Photosystem II (PSII) complex of the thylakoid membrane. Normally the only way to developget target specific aptamers is through the process of SELEX (Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment). However, SELEX would not indicate to us clearly what the target protein is, and overall is a very challenging and time consuming process. Fortunately for us, Team Heidelberg-2015 developed a software tool known as MAWS (Making Aptamers Without SELEX) which requires a PDB (Protein Data Bank) input file to generate an aptamer that binds specifically to a target site.
We decided to use this software"

During our time in their lab, we helped each other go through protocols and compared results of experiments. For instance, for two of the calibrations, they aided us in using the equipment to measure absorbance and fluorescence and for cell measurement, we shared our results to help them find errors that had led the rejection upon their first submission. The photos below demonstrate how we closely collaborated each step of the way. We had frequent discussion through the whole process about the protocols, the experiments, data processing, etc. We also set up a WeChat group for further discussion after the experiment. Our collaboration eventually led to both of our successes in completing InterLab. The following demonstrates in details how we have collaborated during and out of InterLab.
How they helped us?
-----Laboratory and equipment: They kindly shared with us their lab and equipment to measure absorbance and fluorescence for the InterLab study, due to our lack of a suitable equipment. In the photo below, they were helping us prepare the 96-well plate for measurement of absorbance and fluorescence.
-----Transformation: They helped us perform transformation and amplification of plasmid pSB1C3-vHB from well 16E of Kit Plate 5. This is a key part of our experiment, we really appreciate their help, which made our experiment possible.
How we helped them?
-----DNA kit plate: We provided them with DNA Kit Plate 1 after they used up all of their plasmid in well 4L for transformation that unexpectedly failed.
-----Ligation: We aided them in the ligation of 2x20ul of pSB1C3-LuxG using a Quick Ligation system from New England BioLabs, which can complete the entire ligation process in 10-15 minutes.
-----Competent cell: We provided them with 3 tubes of E. coli DH5-α competent cell for transformation of their pSB1C3-LuxG after their lab ran out.
-----Troubleshooting: We helped them troubleshoot when their InterLab"
Heidelberg,2017," environmental changes. Hence, one way to measure the mutagenesis levels is simply to quantify the level of spontaneous antibiotic resistance acquisition. Therefore, E. coli were transformed with mutagenesis plasmids or remain untransformed (as control) followed by incubation in presence or absence of different antibiotics on agar plates. After 18-21 hours of incubation at 37 °C, colonies are counted. A higher number of colonies (i.e. clones with spontaneous resistance acquired) thereby indicates a higher mutation rate in the corresponding E. coli population due to the presence of the mutagenesis plasmid.
Results from the Study
To decide which mutagenesis plasmid to recommend to future iGEM teams for in vivo directed evolution approaches such as PREDCEL, it was essential to determine the mutagenesis plasmid setup most robustly functioning across different laboratories. The results of iGEM team BOKU Vienna, ETH Zürich, Freiburg and Stuttgart indicate that MP #1 induces mutations most reliably . Hence, we recommend to use mutagenesis plasmid #1 for PREDCEL experiments, which is also noted in our corresponding RFC .
Cloning a Positive
Control for Freiburg
Collaborating with the iGEM Team Freiburg we cloned a positive control for a subproject of their CARTEL™ project.
Under normoxic conditions HIF1A cannot interact with HIF1B to form the transcription factor HIF1, because its hydroxylated and marked by the E3 ubiquitin ligase for degradation by the proteasome

.  Therefore the elimination of the two hydroxylated amino acids, that are prolines at the positions 402 and 564, would generate a HIF1A, that is stabilized and interacts with HIF1B under normoxic conditions

to activate the hypoxia response element (HRE).
Because we wanted to collaborate with this year’s iGEM Team Freiburg , we offered to help them with our  Golden Gate cloning expertise to perform a site directed mutagenesis and generate the constitutively active HIF1A. It would be used Freiburg as a positive control for CoCl2 induction in analysis of HRE.
For the aforementioned two amino acid exchanges alanine to proline we decided to utilize PCR amplification followed by Golden Gate cloning for site directed mutagenesis. To insert the two point mutations three steps were performed. We divided the ~7.9 kb plasmid into three"
UCAS,2017," In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved"
Kent,2015," to two national meetups to prepare for the Giant Jamboree. One was organised by Birkbeck and one was organised by Westminster ; both have been wonderful opportunities for us to improve and perfect our project thanks to the feedback received from the other teams. Unfortunately for UNITN, they are the only Italian team participating in iGEM this year, and therefore they did not have a chance to participate to any national meetup. One of our team members, Anna, flew to Italy in order to offer feedback on their presentation and offer precious insights acquired during the meetups. The presentation was well executed, with the exception of the order of topics discussed. They welcomed the feedback and made appropriate changes."

Synthetic biology relies heavily on collaboration within the scientific/engineering community, so it is of the utmost importance to develop and foster continuous relationships with other lab groups and the community. We have worked extensively with the University of Texas, University of Valencia, and University of Virginia iGEM teams in order to facilitate the communication and relationships necessary for the success of synthetic biology in the modern world.

Amsterdam,2015,". The cyanobacteria produce sugars and oxygen from CO2 , water and light; known as photosynthesis. In their prototype consortium the sugars are used as a carbon source for, E.coli, which uses it to create a desired end-product. In their proof-of-concept bio-factory this product will be isobutanol, a potential biofuel. That said, their cyanobacterial carbon fixation module can be coupled to a multitude of biotechnological production processes to make these processes more sustainable. Using TU Delft’s 3D printer could improve both the reproducibility and specificity of a biofilm-based consortium. The 3D printer would, for example, be able to print a layer of cyanobacteria in between two layers of E.coli to create specific patterns that optimize carbon sharing and product formation in Amsterdam’s consortium.
The Bio-composite Leaf,
Besides potentially optimizing the productivity of  Amsterdam’s consortium in a bioreactor, accurately printing biofilms allows for a whole range of novel consortia applications. One of these is the so-called ‘bio-composite leaf’, an approach described by Bernal et al. as ‘[an] approach to improve solar energy harvesting capacity [by] fabricating inexpensive water- based ‘‘cellular biocomposite’’ materials that mimic or exceed the function and stability of natural plant leaves by ordering layers of closely packed living photosynthetic cells on a surface with a non-toxic adhesive polymer binder’ (2014). Such multilayered composites of densely packed cells could significantly improve the low light harvesting capacity of cyanobacteria commonly observed in photobioreactors.
Re-invented
Packing cyanobacterial cells together without losing photosynthetic capacity poses a scientific challenge. The most successful method used to date exploits adhesive colloidal polymer particles that bind the cyanobacteria to a leaf that consists of porous paper, which hydrates the cell coating via the fluid in the paper pores below the coating [figure 1]. Although this approach generates high photosynthetic rates, creating the latex coating is a time-consuming, complex process that has not been optimised for uniformity of the coating. A standardised, relatively simple process for creating such coatings could not only overcome these problems, but could ultimately enable the mass-production of bio-composite leaves for high-yield sustainable bioproduction.
A new approach
That’s where TU Delft’s 3D-printer for biofilms comes in. By using their biobricks that enable rapid immobilization of organisms via nanowires, together with the ability to accurately print these in the form of bio"

To pursue with collaboration in a more practical way we came up with an interactive         bilateral collaboration. The idea was based on visiting each other’s biggest science         events. On 23rd of September part of our team travelled to Finland to organize a         workshop at event of Heureka’s Science Centre! We explained synthetic biology         principles and our project idea in a play form to local visitors (check our board games         instructions!)

Our team was happy to welcome Aalto-Helsinki team         members in Tartu, Estonia, and help them with translation and explanation of their         experiments to local visitors!
Photomosaic challenge
In the beginning of September we contacted iGEM teams all over the world and offered a         collaboration opportunity! The idea was to create a photomosaic of stylish lab photos,         which would make up the word ""iGEM"" and express unity of iGEMers: combining the         world, synthetic biology and teams in lab all around the world. For a collaboration we         asked teams to send 3-5 photos with an original lab-look/ composition.

UCAS,2017," supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a"

Flavia, Leda and Farhan represented the UEA-NRP team by presenting our project to members of around a dozen other UK iGEM teams, and fielding questions from them.
In addition to the team presentations, we were also lucky enough to attend talks by representatives from Desktop Genetics, Synbiota and Synthace on some of the latest developments in molecular biology, and emerging cloning technologies. Throughout the day we were also able to mingle with the other teams - a great opportunity to make friends before Boston and to trade success and horror stories from our respective labs.

We got to know Jilin-China at the iGEM summit initiated by NKU-China. This year both of our projects pertain to     gene synthesis, so we have been in close contact since. Jilin_China constructed some heat-inducible RNA-based     thermosensors onto the pSB1C3 vector, and installed the Anderson promoter J23104 upstream, super"
Linkoping_Sweden,2017," you see academic research relating to biomanufacturing as different from industrial research related to biomanufacturing?
What do you think you or the government could do in order to encourage the industry to change its way of production to biomanufacturing?
All the contributed questions from the teams were compiled by team Harvard and a Google Form was created. The survey was then sent out to as many people as possible in the areas of interest.
The result from the survey came from 30 people from the countries Brazil, Finland, France, Sweden and USA. The majority of these people (16) was involved within the academia, nine of these had industry as primary area of expertise, two participants who answered were politicians and three participants answered “other area” than those areas mentioned above.
The survey consisted of several statements where the survey-takers could indicate their level of agreement. The statements appeared in different ways depending on how the participants answered. Results from a few of these statements can be seen in the three figures below.
A few questions in the end of the survey had open-ended questions, which we thought was very interesting.
Some of the answers to the question “what are the major roadblocks to the progress of the field of biomanufacturing?” included; environmental safety issue, costs, development difficulties, market acceptance and biosafety.
An answer that occurred several times, and people thought could be a problem, was about the governmental regulations and the laws. However, these responses did not come from any politicians.
When the survey-takers gave their opinions about what they thought will be the direction of the field of biomanufacturing, medicine/the pharmaceutical industry was a repeated answer from many. A few other answers, to give some examples, were – focus on specialty chemicals, additives in cosmetics, replacement in current animal based food production and rationally designed cells as biofactories.
Through this survey, we have obtained a good overview about people’s interest, knowledge and thoughts about biomanufacturing.

Dejana from UiOslo tried our system, and thought it was a very good idea to have a searching engine for different             projects, teams, biobricks, etc. in previous years. It is effective – saves a lot of time which is very precious             to all of us.
Dejana said: ""Recommending semantically similar keywords to inspire further searching is great! I liked design             of user interface, especially the Gene Relationship part – quite simple and elegant."""
ULaVerne_Collab,2018," goal to degrade toxicants in water. We arranged a Skype meeting to discuss protocols, findings, and to exchange data. Team Stockholm shared information regarding microplastics from Stockholm wastewater treatment plants and other water treatment plants in their region: although microplastics are a widespread issue, wastewater plants filter out approximately 99% of microplastics into sludge material. This is the same information we received from Bellanira Lynch, a Microbiologist from our local wastewater plant, San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant. They also shared information from Novozymes that suggested washing machines are a significant source of microplastics, which is the same conclusion we reached after researching microfibers. This discussion further validated the direction we are taking with our project. In return, we contacted San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant to collect data on antibiotics, specifically Sulfamethoxazole, to further Team Stockholm’s data on the prevalence of their toxicant."
Tec-Chihuahua,2017,", and that was the reason why our Human Practices members helped them. After the meeting with our member in Finland, Aalto team send us patents and patents applications so we could double check the analysis that previously the Aalto team did. We investigated about the regulation of the European Union patents, the duration, and their effects. After that, we send them our conclusions so they could apply their knowledge and ours on their wiki.
Tec-Guadalajara
Unfortunately, the iGEM Tec-Guadalajara team got their kit late because of border control issues, plus it also it seemed to be damaged. This problem did not allow them to perform the necessary transformation required to meet the bronze criteria. But this didn't stop them from doing their project; the collaboration between our teams, involved us to do two of the transformations that they needed, the first was BBa_I744204 -plate 3, well 20F-, in E. Coli BL21B3. The second part, BBa_K137055 -plate 4, well 13I-, was also transformed in E. Coli BL21B3. There was no inconvenience in the transformation protocol, and the procedure was successful, with the expression of the corresponding proteins that Tec-Guadalajara needed for their transformation. On October 24th, both transformed bacteria were shipped through DHL from Chihuahua City to Guadalajara.
Tec-CEM
In order to promote and reinforce the relationship with our brother team Tec-CEM, we asked for their help to characterize one of our BioBricks, (T7 promoter + RBS) + (epsE) + (T1 terminator), which can be found here as a whole [BBa_K2471002] , the individual parts being (BBa_K525998) + (BBa_K143032) + (BBa_B0010). This BioBrick is an essential part of our project, as its expression confers the capacity of inhibit the virulence factor of motility in the bacteria.  The collaboration developed as follows: On October 15th, we shipped the BioBrick to Tec-CEM, which they characterized by SDS-PAGE. Once the results were obtained, they shared them with us, completing a successful collaboration. You can review the results on our bronze results section.

HAFS,2018," PLOS is a journal affiliated with iGEM foundation, that allows free access to all published materials. As an aspiring scientist who always had difficult times dealing with journals that costs over $100, we were definitely impressed by the goal of PLOS. Furthermore,This collaboration project was a great opportunity that allowed us to encounter numerous researches that we had never seen before.
    To participate in this collaboration, we started to search a fitting research from Public Library of Science (PLOS).  After much consideration, we selected a research about “Why Treatment Fails in Type 2 Diabetes,” which was written by Anders Rosengren, Xingjun Jing, Lena Eliasson, and Erik Renström. This article was containing several specific parts with Type 2 Diabetes: Failing Insulin Secretion in Type 2 Diabetes, Secondary Failure of Sulfonylurea Treatment, Using Slow-Release Sulfonylurea Pellets in a New In Vivo Model, Pros and Cons of the Present Study, and Clinical Implications. Summarizing this article had several difficulties. Although this experiment was tangentially related to our team’s topic, our Team had to learn this experiment with more depth to interpret. In addition, because we had to create our summarize without hard scientific jargons, swapping this complicated article with plain language was another barrier in this collaboration. Nevertheless, we successfully completed a posting in a title of “ Down but not out: insulin-producing cells can bounce back after drug treatment.” Through this collaboration, we are glad to assist in blog activity which can play a role of spreading valuable scientific articles in intelligible terms.
    The following is the short blog post that we have submitted to the collaboration project! You can read the research article that we discussed here and the original study here.
Title: Down but not out: insulin-producing cells can bounce back after drug treatment
    Insulin is a hormone produced by cells in the pancreas called beta-cells. Insulin keeps blood sugar levels from getting too high (hyperglycemia) or too low (hypoglycemia). Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body either doesn’t produce enough insulin (Type 1) or cannot use the insulin it does produce (Type 2). Managing blood sugar levels is important as high blood sugar can cause complications such as kidney disease, eye disease, heart attack, or nerve damage. Diabetes management includes monitoring physical activity, nutrition, weight, stress, and blood pressure. Type 1 diabetes is always treated with insulin, and Type 2 may require insulin and/or other medications. One such group of"
Freiburg,2015,"iburg tried to measure the binding of the purified HER2-antigen to the His-affibody lysate in iRIf.
Figure 1: Amido black stained Western Blot of His-tagged affibody. No signal could be detected at 10 kDa (size of the affibody)
As the iGEM Team Stockholm 2015 also works on a diagnostic tool, we thought it would be great to combine our two approaches. For early detection of cancer biomarkers, Stockholm tried to establish an affibody based bacterial biomarker assay (ABBBA). We planed to measure the binding of the purified HER2-antigen to the corresponding His-tagged affibody Stockholm sent us, which we immobilized on our Ni-NTA surface. Unfortunately, we realized that the HER2-antigen was also His-tagged, so it was not suitable for an anlysis on a Ni-NTA surface. The HER2-antigen would bind to the surface, precluding a detection of its binding to the affibody.
To circumvent this problem we spotted the HER2-antigen on a PDITC surface and measured the binding of the affibody to the protein. Due to the small size of the affibody (under 10 kDa) it's not possible to observe the binding with iRIf because the detection limit of the system is around 10 kDa.
A third possibility would have been to spot the His-tagged affibody on a PDITC surface and flush the slide with the antigen. Therefore, it would have been necessary to purify the affibody, so we expressed it freshly from the glycerol stock Stockholm sent us. We performed a Western Blot of the pellet and the soluble fraction after lysis of the E.coli cells that expressed the affibody. To identify the expressed protein we used Ni-NTA conjugated HRP antibody. Additionally, we stained the membrane with amidoblack to determine successful transfer of the proteins onto the membrane (figure 1). Unfortunately, there was no signal detectable by chemiluminescence at the expected molecular weight. Therefore, we did not proceed with purification.

Harvard,2018," iGEM Team. Their project, TERRA, is an automated microfluidics system designed to facilitate wet lab experimentation. Their tech was particularly useful for us because cell encapsulation with alginate can be accomplished using microfluidics. This particular technique of forming alginate capsules was not available to us at in our own lab. However, it is advantageous in the respect that using microfluidics allows for precision of cell concentration in each droplet. A microfluidics system also allows us to test many different concentrations of cross-linker and alginate to influence pore size, a feature that would need to be optimized for our keratinases. A still image of the microfluidic chip running with dyed water is shown below. Due to the viscosity of alginate, we were unable to perfect the technique of encapsulating cells with alginate. However, the BU Team allowed us to explore another facet of our experimentation. In addition, we provided feedback on the design and use of their microfluidic device to help them to further optimize its function.
Massachusettes Institute of Technology iGEM
It became clear between the discussions on both of our teams that the use of cell encapsulation was a necessary component in our experiments. Through MIT, we were able to connect with a graduate student at the Langer Labs, Derfogail Delcassian who offered to train our team on how to perform a gel encapsulation. Half of our team members shadowed Derfogail as she went through the procedure, carefully explaining the method for casting the solution into a sterile tissue culture plate, as well as the technique for adding the appropriate cation for crosslinking the gel. This experience proved to be enormously helpful towards our efforts of creating a gel that would enable our keratinases to secrete without having the cells break through the gel. Between the two teams, we agreed to compile a standardized protocol for cell encapsulation that could be used by future iGEM teams.

As a senior iGEM team, Peking University has provided many reliable and effective suggestions for                         our projects. After the introduction of the team project, we started brainstorming on the                         project together, the most prominent of which is the proposal for high-throughput application of                         the test method of the project, and the proposal of team cooperation.
Through this interflow, we have enriched our ideas on this project, and we are also moved by the                         enthusiasm of Peking University students. This is our first collaboration, which provides a lot                         of different ideas for our project.
Northeastern University
Time: 27 Aug, 2018
Location: The Meeting Room of Northeastern University Life Science Building
Participant: Four iGEM teams from Northeastern University and Dalian University of Technology
Content:
The meeting began with the introduction of their project by the iGEM-A team of Northeastern                         University. Team A's research project is engineering probiotics, and they expect to study                         methods to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) that                         may be triggered. The next is the Northeastern University iGEM-B team. Team B students turned                         their attention to wine and its excess lactic acid.
After the students of Northeastern University showed up, the students of DLUT-A team brought                         their team's research on gout disease. High levels of uric acid in human blood may cause acute                         gouty arthritis, etc., and existing methods for treating high levels of uric acid have many side                         effects. The students of the DLUT-A team plan to oxidize uric acid to 5-hydroxyisouric acid by                         engineering bacteria to express a uric acid oxidase. The compound is decomposed and quickly                         decomposed into allantoin which is easily metabolized, thereby reducing uric acid.
Finally, the DLUT-B team brought a portable introduction to the detection of β2-microglobulin. By                         immobilizing the Nanobody on the slide, a change in the alignment of the liquid crystal causes a                         change in the brightness of the image to detect an excessive excess of β2-micro in the urine. As                         a possible marker of chronic kidney disease, β2-micro is an effective and portable method for                         early detection of chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes and hypertension"

Many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than the one where they sprang up.

We collaborated with other iGEM teams in three different ways-
Wet lab work for team IISc Bangalore: Data collection for machine learning
All India iGEM Meet-up at IISER Pune
iGEM groups on social media and Whatsapp
IISc Bangalore Collaboration
Their team was trying to build a precise and time effective way to measure the cell count of yeast cultures. They wanted to collect a huge amount of data to train a ​machine learning algorithm that they had designed for counting these cells. Collecting such huge amount of data means growing hundreds of yeast cultures,collecting samples every hour and then imaging it under the microscope on hemocytometer. It is a tedious task to be done alone by a team.  Thus, with this collaboration our team was expected to generate images for the algorithm to analyze by monitoring one growth curve for Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
An introduction to machine learning that team IISc Bangalore has designed can be found here

One of biggest problems during iGEM project is to learn how to work with Wiki sintaxis. As not everybody is acquainted programming with marking languages like html or xml, managing the wiki is a difficult task for every team.  
Francisco Javier Quero, team leader of Madrid-OLM team, contacted us at the beginning of the summer to ask for help with their wiki. We thought this could be a good oportunity of mentoring so we agreed to help them solve their problems. Our software team (Héctor and Blanca) did a call via Skype to talk these topics:
An explanation of how mediawiki works and the main problems they will find working with it.
Tips when saving the code, for example, separating it in different structures like navbar, main content, footer, etc.
Recommendations at the time of choosing a web template because not all the technologies available will work in the wiki and knowing this will make a big saving of time.

Since UESTC focus on the treatment of environment pollution, we assistance them to detect the TCP(trichlorophenol) remnant in soil by HPLC. Our graph of the result can help them to prove their achievement in the project.
We sent the sample of Trichoderma and the Phytophthora to their team, asking them to inoculate these fungi to the tissue"

Collaborations
Whoever has experience in lab works acknowledges that experiment is a process accompanying with hardships and depending on collaborations. Our team persists in building a good relationship and partnership with other teams and strengthening regional cooperation constantly. We have tight connections with both the HZAU-China and the HUST-China team based on the advantage of convenient geographical location. Besides, our team also collaborates with team Jilin-China on brick-building and we have established reciprocal relationship as well as the trust.
iGEM Team HZAU-China
We provided team HZAU-China two plasmids BBa_K1647006 & BBa_K769001 we work with to help them build the part, especially our photosensitive promoter successfully function in their program. https://2015.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Team/Attributions https://2015.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/OutReach/Collaboration
iGEM Team Jilin_China
We helped the team Jilin-China construct a part, which is used in their program, helping them deliver the plasmid timely. We gave them our last year's favorite part BBa_K1334002 , which is a regulator designed by Haoyuan Sun. In order to promote its utility, they repeated the experiments that we did last year and improved it. The promoter we offered them really helped a lot, they said. Meanwhile, we had a small gathering discussing some practical issues and exchanging ideas about team works. https://2015.igem.org/Team:Jilin_China/Collaborations
