What does DNA stand for? The National Dyslexics Association!
Ignoring the attitudes of Brexit, our iGEM team has set up a two-way collaboration with iGEM Marburg. We’ve worked hard to create easily understandable resources to help teams make the content they produce more accessible for those with disabilities and special educational needs.
iGEM Marburg reached out to us, asking if our wiki fit their criteria for being an accessible web-page. We checked out their page, and we met most of them!
Our wiki has:
Has a high colour contrast. Our text is easily distinguishable from the background, and we do not use a red-green combination to make text distinctive.
Text and headings are distinguished by both size and colour, and is defined in boxes/obvious segmentation. The links we use are descriptive.
The page is scalable- we used % and ems.
Information that belongs together is shown in one frame.
We sent them an infographic (see below) in turn on how to make sure all content the team produces is dyslexia friendly. iGEM Marburg were proud to tell us that they had made an effort tick off every box!
Double Trouble(shooting)
In September, we hosted a troubleshooting meet-up with Imperial, UCL and Westminster that had been in the workings since the Oxford Conference. We were lucky enough to have design students from UAL give us advice on how to make the materials we present look decent, and had the opportunity to discuss our projects.
Imperial were keen to continue our collaboration, and asked us to review the app that they are producing. In turn, they offered to work with our Max to help him with mathematical modelling.
Wading into Research
We kicked off our collaborations by supporting Warwick’s lab research. Our own lab team headed down to London’s “beach” and into the river to collect samples of water and sediment from the Thames."

Throughout the year, we contacted several iGEM teams to collaborate on our projects. We reached out to high school teams, which may not have the resources to sequence plasmids or parts. The two teams that we collaborated with were the Urban Tundra team from Edmonton and Broad Run Northern VA from Baltimore. We helped characterize their parts by sequencing plasmids and aligning them with predicted sequences.
Urban Tundra
We collaborated with the Urban Tundra iGEM team from Edmonton, Canada. The team was unable to sequence the plasmid that they designed, so the ASU team offered to sequence their plasmid via the Core Laboratory at ASU. The sequence information was collected, aligned using Benchling.com, and then the Urban Tundra team was sent instructions on how to view the shared data.
The following plasmids were generated, one with malE SP gene (SP+) and one without (SP-). The aim of this project was to cleanse toxins from Martian soil through the bioreaction of between Chlorite Dismutase and chlorite ions. Sequencing helped them to identify a mutation in one of their constructs!

Introduction
Stockholm team is working on cancer diagnosis by engineering of a bacterial sensor which could detect trace amounts of cancer biomarkers.
Stockholm Abstract:
""Synthetic biology offers many potential cost-effective healthcare technologies. One of those could be new ways to diagnose and treat disease at an early stage. Current techniques for biomarker detection (e.g. ELISA, RIA) are time consuming, expensive and require specialised equipment.
We intend to design a microbiological system for the detection of low quantities of biomarkers. This assay aims to be easier and more cost efficient than existing techniques and possible to perform in modestly equipped settings. Initially, we will focus on the expression of a receptor for the desired biomarker. Depending on the nature of the biomarker, the receptor will be either be native or designed.
Upon biomarker detection, signal amplification will be triggered by our receptor system to activate a read out/detection system (e.g. Luciferase, GFP) inside the microorganism to artificially amplify the extracellular signal. In the next stage, the team will go on to design a read-out system to measure the concentration of biomarkers in body samples. Finally we want to investigate if we can make this system transferable to other biomarkers, changing only the receptor part of the system.
The system would be cheap, fast and possible to distribute without advanced equipment. Our motivation is to improve patient prognosis and quality of life and to improve efficiency and reduce costs within the healthcare system.""
Our assistance to the team is to express a GPI-anchored Affibody [BBa_K1766012] on the plasma membrane of human cancer cells, which can then be specifically targeted by a compatible drug or toxin (Fig. 1).

NEGEM
On Friday June 24th and Saturday October 8th, Boston University hosted NEGEM (New England iGEM), a meetup for iGEM teams all across New England to gather and share their research work and their plans for the Human Practices and Policies portion of the competition. All of the teams in attendance were given 20 minutes to present their research project and their plans for their Human Practices and Policies. Every person in attendance was asked to fill out an evaluation form about the research, P&P, and presentation style for each team that presented. The questions ranged from “Is their idea well-motivated?” to suggestions on ways to integrate research with P&P to “Was the talk engaging?”. After the teams finished their presentations, other iGEMers, HQ representatives, and mentors asked the teams for clarification on their research, future plans for outreach, and some ethical implications of using their project. Both NEGEM meetups were great ways to meet local teams and learn about interesting new research projects."

Finally, we put an effort to create a joint fundraising project for the mutual French region of Occitanie that, while ultimately unsuccessful this year, may lay the seeds for future financial collaboration opportunities.
Collaboration with iGEM Sorbonne Université
After meeting them in Paris, we decided to collaborate with some students of Sorbonne University team.
We decided to help them continue a project started by the previous Sorbonne team: share our passion for biology and our vision of science with high school students. To this end, we decided to create a practical class for 2nd-year high school students. Our course was separated in two sessions: in the first, we gave a basic overview biology lecture with a hands-on practical lab component and in the second we analyzed the results of their experiments and presented the iGEM competition and our projects.
Two members of the Sorbonne team, Asmaa Foda and Saniya Kari, worked with us for the project. They were in charge of the handling supplies for the lab component (e.g. strains and materials). Our team was in charge of the presentation slides for the two sessions (e.g. presentation of the practical course, analysis of the results, presentation of iGEM and our projects). It was incredibly rewarding to discuss with the students about biology and as well as providing an ideal training ground for popularizing our project.
For more information about the lab class see our Education & Public Engagement page.

Aix-Marseille
For our first collaboration we aided the iGEM Team from Aix-Marseille with their project on chewing-gum.
The aim of the project was to collect answers to a questionnaire from people on the street. The questions concerned the use of chewing gum, as well as the public understanding of synthetic biology and genetic manipulation.
We asked over 30 people to fill in this questionnaire, earning us a Gold Medal for the collaboration.
Aachen
At the meetup in Germany we met the team from Aachen, who are working on ""Upcycling methanol into a universal carbon source"". For this project they designed synthetic pathways involving multiple different enzymes.
As our project is based on the focusing of enzymatic reactions onto one scaffold, our flexosome, we had found our first application. The Aachen Team supplied us with their BioBricks for  Methanoldehydrogenase II from Bacillus methanolicus (BBa_K1585210, MDH), 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase from Methylococcus capsulatus (BBa_K1585211, HPS)and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase from Methylococcus flagellatus (Ba_K1585212, PHI). For further information refer to the Wiki from Aachen
We then modeled their enzymes into our system via Clone Manager and created the Primers that would allow us to insert them into our expression vector pBAD.  Following constructs were planned:
Vector: pBAD His A (Arabinose induced expression Vektor with an N-Terminal His-Tag)
Enzyme/Dockerin Fusions: MDH & CTHE, HPS & ACEL, PHI & BCEL
Dockerins from ACEL: , A. cellulolyticus , BCEL: Bacteroides cellulosolvens, CTHE: Clostridium Thermocellum
By the end of the competition, we were able to fuse HPS to the Dockerin ACEL and PHI to the Dockerin BCEL and prove their correct insertion by sequencing. The fusion of MDH to the Dockerin CTHE was thus far not successful."

We reached out to Team Oxford to establish a collaboration that would help them achieve higher expression levels of their copper chelator Csp1sfGFP, and allow us to apply our promoters to the control of a non-trivial gene. Team Oxford also had easy access to a flow cytometer, which they would use to measure the cell to cell variance of our promoter devices. Unfortunately, we both faced unforeseen delays in the experimental assembly of our devices. Although we were in constant communication throughout the project, we were not able to pursue this plan completely.

Networking amongst iGEMers
Apart from the science-related communication, we also find the personal exchange between the teams to be a valuable asset of iGEM. Through the huge field of participating teams from around the world, it is possible to establish valuable connections to other likeminded science students from different parts of the world. To come into closer contact with other european teams, we participated in both the german, as well as in the european meetup, in Marburg and Munich, respectively.
The German meetup in Marburg
German iGEM teams had the opportunity to connect with other teams in order to collaborate or to just learn about their projects at this year’s German-wide iGEM meetup in Marburg.
Three members of our team - Selina, Nico and Robin- didn’t shy away from the long distance and set off for Marburg to attend the German iGEM meetup from June 22 until June 24. On Friday afternoon we arrived at the Campsite Lahnaue, where we were already welcomed by some members of team Marburg. After the tents were set up we slowly entered into conversation with other teams and later spent a lovely evening in Marburg’s old town doing a pub crawl.
On Saturday morning the exciting part of the meetup began. Thirteen teams presented their projects at the first poster session at the local University. It was a promising chance to receive some early criticism or general opinions on one’s undertakings.
After the revealing poster session an executive member of the German Association for Synthetic Biology – GASB e.V. – introduced us to their company an its activities and goals.  Furthermore, several guest lectures, among them former iGEMers, gave interesting talks about synthetic biology. Watching the soccer world cup together, we let the evening find a comfortable end.
On Sunday morning we joined another poster session. For us young scientists it was a great way to practice for the upcoming Giant Jamboree in Boston and the familiar atmosphere even encouraged everyone to be open and come out of oneself. One special feature of the poster session was the embedded competition for the best poster. So, at the end of the meetup every team was given some constructive advice on the layout and content of their work.
Thanks to the perfect organisation of Team Marburg and Team Bielefeld 2017. We lacked nothing and had a great time in Marburg.

This year, our team has developed an online platform named Flight iGEM which can help all the iGEM teams to simplify the procedure of wiki building. See more details about(  Flight iGEM ) With Flight iGEM, each member of a team will be able to participate in their wiki creation, and this will significantly increase their efficiency. We introduced this wonderful platform to other iGEM teams during the CCiC summit. Many teams showed great interests in it, indicating that they were willing to use it. This platform has already assisted the team NUDT_China with wiki creation. We sincerely thank them for their suggestions on the improvement of our platform. (See their wiki here)

UAlberta,2017," series of several days did we train their members in the various laboratory protocols that are commonly used in synthetic biology. This included guiding them through a workflow which included transformation, inoculation, plasmid purification, digestions, ligation, and gel electrophoresis. Though, we ensured that the training had a founding in safety culture that our team upholds.
Beyond this, when Team UAlberta had commenced the InterLab Study Protocols, Team UrbanTundra was essential to our success. We had numerous failed attempts at getting the InterLab devices into E. coli DH5a which eventually consumed our plasmid stock. However, with the help of UrbanTundra, we were able to get the devices transformed. In return, we gave them them purified samples of the InterLab devices for their their own use in their transformation protocols. We also shared our plate reader equipment and gave instruction so that they could also take their InterLab measurements. Without the collaborative relationship with Team UrbanTundra,  we  would not have been able to accomplish what we did.
Manchester
Team UAlberta collaborated with iGEM teams Manchester, Virginia, Macquarie, AQA Unesp, Botchan_Lab_Tokyo, UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB, ITB_Indonesia, KUAS_Korea, and IIT_Delhi on developing a document exploring each nation’s Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) legislation. As a team, due to the challenges we faced explaining our project to the public, we chose to focus on addressing the problem of scientific literacy.  GMOs, with its perceived harmful effects, are often the first thing people think of whenever genetic engineering and synthetic biology are mentioned. Thus, we believe that this report, which discusses GMO legislation around the world, can be a useful tool in dispelling some of the myths surrounding the development and availability of GMOs.
Summary of the Manchester collaboration
1. What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?
The institutional bodies that enforce the laws regarding the use of GMMs differ a lot across the world. In many countries in Asia (Japan, Indonesia, and Korea) and Canada, ministries and departments are responsible for enforcing the laws of GMMs. The kinds of ministries enforcing the laws as well as their numbers vary from country to country, but usually the large organizations are in charge.
On the other hand, countries like India, Brazil, the United States, and Australia have more specialied committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.

European Meetup in Munich
On the 21st and 22nd of July, we attended the European Meetup in Munich.
The different talks were highly interesting and we had the chance to ask Katrin Lang, one of the speaker, for advice about the unnatural amino acid part of our platform. The poster session was a great opportunity to practice the presentation of our project to the other teams. The feedback and tips we received from the other teams were very helpful to improve our poster for the oncoming events. This meetup was also a good opportunity to talk about collaborations and to get to know each other by spending time with the other teams.

They reported that receiving our agar stabs, they streaked plates and incubated them at 37 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. Afterwards, they placed the plates in the refrigerator until they received the arabinose and rhamnose needed to induce pili formation in the experimental strains. Once they had all necessary materials, they grew 5mL liquid cultures of each of the 3 strains in LB in accordance with the protocol. The JW4283 culture was not supplemented with antibiotics or inducers, but the C2M+C5 and C9-3+C5 cultures were supplemented with 5 μL of chloramphenicol, 5 μL of ampicillin, 0.01% arabinose, and 0.5% rhamnose. They prepared the 1:100 dilutions in LB broth and M9 minimal media, which they found to support biofilm formation while designing their biofilm assay. The remainder of the protocol was left unchanged. Below are the results of the assay.
A photo of the biofilm plate after it was stained with crystal violet on 9/3/15. Although there appears to be some remaining crystal violet, biofilm formation was not robust in any of the strains.

According to the results we collected, the Harvard strains with modified pili do not form biofilms under the conditions we subjected them to. These strains may be able to form biofilms under different conditions. Further investigation would have to be done to determine if different if different media types, incubation periods, or transformation into different strains of E. coli  could induce biofilm formation. Determining optimal biofilm formation conditions could allow the Harvard team to use the biofilm assay to gather quantitative results for their various binding assays. However, it is possible that the modified pili interfere with biofilm formation. In that case, the bio"

Construct an alliance to build a worldwide database
Continued worldwide industrialization has caused extensive environmental and human health problems. A wide variety of chemicals, e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, chlorinated solvents, etc., have been detected in different natural resources such as soil, water, and air. Among the pollutants, the heavy metals are of concern to human health due to their cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity.
Under this circumstance, Tianjin Team came up with the idea that we could gather all the iGEM teams whose projects were about water pollution treatment and build an alliance to unite all information and data concerning the social impact, knowledge and geographical advantages they collected during the conduction of their project.
On 12th of August, we had a voice conferencing with Tianjin/SJTU/SCUT/XMU/UCAS/JLU. During which we discussed about how we want to use this alliance, and the discussion led to 2 conclusions:
1. Build a worldwide database for the contents of heavy metals in local soil.
2. Mutually promote the social impact of each parties in this alliance."

1.Fudan-CHINA
We have established a good relationship with Fudan-CHINA this year.
This year the project of Fudan-CHINA is the STEP receptor engineered according to the predecessors. The receptor consists of two chains, one chain is TC chain with a transcription factor and another chain is PC chain with a protease. To test whether transformation and construction of these two chains was successful, they replaced the transcription factor and protease downstream of the two chains with a pair of complementary semi-fluorescent proteins that they self-designed disassembled ECFP.
In order to test whether their ECFP splitting successfully and whether it can apply to other laboratories, our team helped Fudan-CHINA characterize these parts and verified that their design and transformation of ECFP on bimolecular fluorescence complementation is successful in E.coli. By doing so, they can know whether their disassembled ECFP works as expected, and whether the transformation and construction of PC chain and TC chain is successful. The result is very important for their project.
We inoculated 100ul bacteria solution containing pGEX-4T-1-ECFP, pGEX-4T-1-LZ-cECFP, pGEX-4T-1-nECFP plasmids and 50ul bacteria solution containing pGEX-4T-1- LZ-cECFP, pGEX-4T-1-nECFP plasmids to mix. After incubating for 3-4 hours, we made the initial OD = 0.1. When OD was close to 0.6, we added IPTG at 1:1000 to induce protein expression at 16"

Biosafety education video in Chinese
Biosafety is one of the most important issues everyone should be aware of before starting any biology related experiments.  However, the biosafety education in China is far behind the fast development of modern biological research.  In some places, students are not trained properly because of the outdated education material or the language barrier that prevent them from reading biosafety guidelines written in English.
We’ve participated in an intercollegiate collaborating project to produce a series of biosafety education movies, all in Chinese.  This video collection has been uploaded online and is freely available at our homepage on YouTube and Bilibili , a popular Chinese video-sharing website.
Teams participated the production:
ShanghaiTech University
University of Chinese Academy of Science
Tianjin University
Tianjin University of Science & Technology
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China
Beijing Normal University
Wuhan University
Huazhong Agricultural University
Anhui University of Technology
Nanjing Agricultural University
Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University
The link below is the title we made for the promotion video of Biosafety collaboratively made by the 11 universities in China.
The following link is the promotion video we made for the education of Biosafety about the disposal of pollutants in biological laboratories.
Reagent share to USTC
iGEM team USTC is working on the CdS based bio-film. They want to know whether CdS nanoparticles can increase the cathode-current as expected. A key component for one of their experiments requires CdS quantum dots, which they cannot generate by themselves.
We provided them the CdS quantum dots sample. They added our sample into the culture to assist bio-film formation onto the surface of a graphite electrode. Theoretically, CdS quantum dots would be attached to the surface of the bacteria as the bio-film was formed.

Safety perception of RIOT System
The survey results from Australia illustrated in the above table shows that 32.8% of participants were very receptive to the RIOT System (rating it a ‘5’), despite many of them believing that it is not completely safe - only 6% rated safety with a ‘5’. For more details on the analysis of these results, please refer to the Human Practices (International Outreach).
Hong_Kong_HKUST
We assisted Hong_Kong_HKUST with their model, and they helped us to validate our RIOT Sensor in return.
Modelling
The Hong_Kong_HKUST team worked on the tri-stable switch, which required the full treatment of the RIOT Model system. Their intra-bacterial tri-stable switch responds to inducer concentrations in the bacterial environment. As such, the diffusion of the inducers in the environment were modelled in the outer model, and the inducers enter the bacteria at each outer point via free diffusion through the bacterial membrane. Upon implementation, the RIOT Model was sent to the Hong_Kong_HKUST team to experiment with.
Validation of RIOT Sensor
The Hong_Kong_HKUST team kindly helped us to measure the sfGFP expression under the control of different lactate sensors over a range of lactate concentrations. However, the bacteria were unable to grow and the blank media had very high readings. Therefore, we could not use these results to compare with ours.
Hong_Kong_HKU
Hong_Kong_HKU helped us to distribute our survey in Hong Kong.
Human Practices: Survey
With the help of our collaborators from the Hong_Kong_HKU iGEM team, our survey was distributed in Hong Kong. They distributed our survey in their university, the University of Hong Kong, and to the general public. To cater to language barriers, they also did a Chinese translation of our survey to ensure that the survey participants understood the terminologies used in our survey. The raw data obtained from the Hong Kong survey are as follows:

Freiburg,2015,"EM competition together with Paris_Bettencourt and Pasteur_Paris. They provided all iGEM Teams with the possibility to share their project idea, information about experiments they are performing or opinions about critical topics of synthetic biology as well as to ask for help with complications they faced during this summer. All in all, there were seven issues published with different contents, three of them being special issues dealing with setting up an iGEM Team, the current situation of synthetic biology and software used in iGEM.
We were asked to contribute to the work of the iGEM Team and used this opportunity to share our project and thoughts with the iGEM community. We were delighted to be able to contribute to such a great piece of work.
All issues that were published during this year's iGEM competition and further information can be found here .
Collaboration with iGEM Team Tübingen
The iGEM Team Tübingen provided us with a construct coding for the Spy-Tag.
For the establishment of a specific surface on the glass slide of the DiaCHIP we followed different approaches. Among others, we planned to test a surface with SpyCatcher immobilized on top of an activated silane layer. The SpyCatcher would then interact specifically with Spy-tagged proteins. In order to be able to verify the predicted function of our surface before performing cell-free expression , the iGEM Team Tübingen kindly provided us with a purified carboxyfluorescine labeled SpyTag .
Unfortunately, we were not able to establish a SpyCatcher surface and test the corresponding SpyTag we received from Team Tübingen due to time constraints."

Mile High Meetup #1
September 25, 2016 at University of Colorado, Boulder
All three Colorado iGEM teams met up north-west of the Mile High City at CU Boulder’s campus. Along with CU Boulder and Denver Biolabs , we all gave practice presentations. It was a great opportunity to receive feedback and learn about each other’s projects. The conference was still a month away, so it a good chance to figure out how to build up from the foundations of our presentation.
Over burgers and beer at lunch, we learned that Inworks was having trouble preparing homemade competent cells with decent transformation efficiency. We shared our protocol with them to help them move their experiments along on the wet lab front.
Mile High Meetup #2
October 14, 2016 at Inworks
With less than two weeks before the Giant Jamboree, the Colorado based iGEM teams met up once again to debut much improved presentations. The Denver Biolabs team also invited community members to sit in, and they bandied questions that we hadn’t thought to address before such as “How can the sensitivity of quorum sensing mechanism be modulated?”.
While looking at the incredible lab space that Denver Biolabs has managed to put together, we discovered that the competent cell protocol helped greatly to move their project forward as they could start testing their proof of concepts.

Teams that Collaborated With Us
As this is the first time our institution has participated in the iGEM competition, we decided to make a guidebook for future iGEM teams. We reached out to many other teams, particularly in our New Application track, and asked them to enlighten us on some of the hardships they faced throughout this year's competition. With their help, we created our iGEM survival guide for our policies and practices. We hope that our guidebook will be useful for future teams.
A special thanks to Team Lethbridge for helping us through our first competition through collaborative workshops in Calgary and Lethbridge!

Jilin_China,2018,".1. When OD was close to 0.6, we added IPTG at 1:1000 to induce protein expression at 16-20°C overnight. We lysed and centrifuged the four groups of bacteria to get supernatant protein mixture. Then we placed the supernatant of cECFP and nECFP mixture at 4 ℃ and 20℃ to induce ECFP fussion. We measured the fluoresence of these 4 types of ECFP.
Figure 1. 4 represnets the sample in 4℃ and 20 represents the sample in 20℃. They are the mixture of nECFP and cECFP. Blank is the average of individual cECFP and nECFP.
As the results show, the fluorescence density of nECFP and cECFP mixture is higher than blank, which has significant difference between two groups according to statistic analysis (P<0.05).
They also helped us to do some verification work. We designed and constructed hundreds of RNA-based thermosensors this year. We need to measure and get their melting temperature. Temperature dependence of global factors such as the fluorescence parameters of GFP or the activity of RNA polymerase may contribute to the individual thermosensor measurement. They should, however, affect all thermosensors in a similar fashion. Therefore, we focus on the relative difference in the thermosensor activities and we need a positive control to normalize the effects of different temperatures. So we designed two positive control (called NPC, MPC) with no thermosensor sequence to make it less sensitive to temperature. In order to ensure the accuracy of our experimental results, Fudan-CHINA helped us characterize and verify the sfGFP expression of our positive control at different temperatures.
Figure 2. Fluorescence expression of positive control at different temperatures. The figure’s horizontal axis represents the temperature range (28℃ to 42℃), and the vertical axis represents fluorescence intensity of sfGFP. The red line is the sfGFP expression curve of NPC at 8th hours, the purple line is sfGFP expression curve of NPC at 6th hours, the blue line is sfGFP expression curve of MPC at 8th hours and the organe line is sfGFP expression curve of MPC at 6th hours.
It can be seen from the results that the sfGFP expression of our positive control changes approximately linearly with increasing temperature. This is consistent with our own measurement. The results are vital to us because we need to use this positive control when"

Meeting Other iGEMers in Korea
We, as a part of the bigger iGEM community, are expected to be honest with our research, cooperate with one another, practice good sportsmanship, be respectful of our peers and celebrate everyone’s efforts, says iGEM Values.  We were thoroughly thrilled when we learned that this year, high school teams are invited to the Grand Jamboree, instead of playing in our own league. It’s exciting that we will meet wonderful college iGEMers from all over the world.  We couldn’t wait! So, we have decided to reach out to other iGEMers in Korea before Grand Jamboree.  In addition to us, we have one college team at Korea University and one high school team at HAFS in Korea.  We were immediately connected, and have successfully established a cooperative network with them.
Korea University iGEM Team
After communicating for a while through email, we were able to – finally – visit Korea University on July 27. We had great time talking with members of the college team.  Luckily, we had a chance to talk with Professor In Geol Choi.  We briefed him of our project: overview, procedure, lab design, progress until then and problems we have encountered.  We were excited about the experience, and greatly flattered by his positive comments.
We discussed, among others, achievements we made and challenges we faced. It was great that we made our plasmids.  We were going through, however, difficulties with control experiments, and they gave us valuable advice on the fundamental principles of the lab work: “Don’t do experiments with multiple variables from the beginning, but take one critical variable and start with that.”  That was an invaluable advice, and we were able to get good results in our control experiment. Finally, we successfully discovered the critical information of the plasmids that we have created.

We also discussed about the project of the Korea University team, called ‘Gil’ project. It means the road, or the path in Korean. As the name suggests, they’re making a program that finds and constructs bio-chemical pathways.  The program, we were"

Human Practices Collaborations
An important collaborative effort has been made in the frame of our Human Practices activities. We skyped the ULaval iGEM team during the summer to talk about our projects. It quickly appeared that we pursued common human practices goals and that collaborating seemed a great idea. Both teams have advisors who were specialists in ethics and we decided to compare the point of views of Europeans and North Americans visions about ethics. To complete our study, we asked the National University of Singapore (NUS) iGEM team to join us, so we could also have an Asian point of view. From there, we produced together a joint 20 pages document, ""HP Worldwide"", describing how synthetic biology and biotechnologies are perceived on our three continents (see Human Practices ).
Bordeaux iGEM Team
We met the Bordeaux iGEM team at both the French and European meetups. They were trying to find a way to substitute an alternative segment of the traditional petrobased chemistry with a new green bio-based chemistry. Cellulose was a possible substrate for them and they were especially interested about pure bacterial cellulose. We therefore engaged in producing sufficient bacterial cellulose for them. Our initial production rate was not designed for that so we had to improve our production capacity to match their requirement. We were very pleased when we visited them in Bordeaux from the 24th to the 26th of August to give them 5g of beautiful bacterial cellulose so they could test their project using our material. Best of luck guys !
Montpellier iGEM Team
iGEM Montpellier 's project is called Vagineering, and it looks to solve hormonal contraceptive issues with a novel, non-hormonal method. The goal is to create a lasting contraceptive using only bacteria, which can later be reversed by engineering the strain with a kill-switch. Montpellier is participating for the first time in the iGEM competition! We wanted to help them since our two cities are neighbours. We visited Montpellier at the beginning of our adventure. It was a great opportunity for our two teams to build relationships and think together about a collaborative project. After several exchanges we decided"

The 2018 Southeastern iGEM Conference
Our team successfully hosted a web conference with 3 other iGEM teams from the Southeastern region discussing our projects, the iGEM experience, and the social challenges faced regarding genetic engineering in the South. The participants included The University of Virginia Team, The Washington University Team, The Liberal Arts & Science Academy (LASA) Team in Austin, TX, and The University of Tennessee, Knoxville Team. Each team practiced presenting their project and answered questions from each team. We discussed the challenges of genetic engineering and the methods used in our research. We discussed our community outreach efforts and events we participated in such as the Ask A Scientist event where we performed demos and discussed involvement in the science community. Each team provided their own useful insight on different aspects of their iGEM experience. The University of Virginia team provided us with insight on making a successful wiki. The LASA team felt that an effective way to find funding was seeking out businesses you had a personal connection to. The Washington University team discussed the importance of outreach and explained what a member had learned traveling with Engineers Without Borders. We also held a guided Q&A session.
Questions asked to each team:
As a research team, what roadblocks have you faced so far in the research process?
What funding challenges, if any, have you all faced as a team, and what strategies have you taken to fund your team so far?
In what ways do you think synthetic biology and the STEM field in general can be improved in the southeast region? In what ways do you all think outreach can play a role in helping this region be more accepting of synthetic biology?
How has the iGEM experience helped you current or past members in their career development?

Collaborations
A great iGEM team is characterized because of its member’s diversity, its global social impact, its interest for making the planet a better place and being part of things so much bigger. That is why we have decided to help each other among teams and make various collaborations, contributing with each cosmo(igem)vision. After thinking about the main topics to be covered, ideas were highlighted, like “What protocols have to be followed for GMOs manipulation in Chile and the world?”, “How is the pollution problem in other countries?”, “What are other teams working on?”, “How to analyze surveys data quickly?”, “What problems are other teams dealing with for attending iGEM 2017?” ,etc. From this, contacts were made with teams interested in answering the same questions and thus be able to start collaborating.
Our ideas focused on key points like GMO international regulations, environmental regulations, analysis of surveys (to know what people know and think), how to make the information accessible for everyone, etc. According to these topics, contacts were made with teams around the world, depending on which problems their projects are based on. Below are the collaborations made with the respective teams:
Analysis of surveys
In this collaboration, a protocol was made for the analysis of surveys done for studying related factors with each project. For this, skype conversations and mixed surveys were done in order to find a useful system able to show the required information for both teams.
Projects summaries translation
In this collaboration, multiple countries of the world participated, where each one shared a summary in English about their project in an online platform, and from them, a translation was made to the different native languages of the teams. This helped us to know about the projects of each participating team, inform us about the ideas and problems that each one of them are based on, and also, establish contact with teams whose research is related to ours.

ECUST,2018," how to construct them. Biosafety+ involves developing biosafety regulations on remediation by genetically engineered bacteria (RGEB) based on opinions from iGEMers in China and improving iGEM projects accordingly (such as perfecting the suicide switch, visual identification, hardware design, etc.). Society+ mainly requires us to collect opinions from different groups, such as government organizations, enterprises, and individuals. By implementing the main principles of “3+ net”, teams will be able to view their projects from a more comprehensive angle. The concept was raised by ECUST during the trouble-shooting meet-up of CCiC and many teams under the track of environment would like to be a part of the activity and make the meaning of “3+ net” much richer. After discussing together and working independently, all teams finished their own part excellently and the complete 3+ Net Guidelines can be found below. Thanks to FJNU-China, SHPH, WHU-China and SCUT-China for your participation and unremitting efforts!

IIT-Madras
As one of the most important information carriers, languages are always beautiful and full of magic, which is sometimes troublesome if we want to communicate with non-native people freely. To spread the main ideas of synthetic biology to as many people as possible, we collaborated with IIT-Madras to make a short video on DNA&RNA by re-translating and recording the script in Mandarin, the most widely-spoken language in China. Click here to watch the video.
SHPH-SHANGHAI & SUIS-Shanghai
This year, ECUST collaborated with two high school teams on the interlab experiments by providing instructions and experimental equipment. We further collaborated with SUIS-Shanghai by instructing them on how to prepare CAS reagent and discussing their experimental results. In return, they offered their engineered bacteria for our exploring experiments.
NWU-China
With a focus of dealing with problems caused by saline soil, NWU-China collaborated with ECUST on data collection and measurement. Since ECUST has one campus located near the sea, plants on the campus always grow slowly due to the high salinity. By collecting data inside and around the campus, we were glad to be of help for their background information and project. NWU-China also kindly gave us suggestions on our modeling of biofilm degradation.

Toulouse,2015," through a tour of the city to the presentation of each project and activities prepared by some of the teams.
The presentations were held in a museum called CapSciences, dedicated to the popularization of science. We had to present our project both in French and English to a public composed of the other teams and non scientific people. It was very interesting to work on our communication skills and trying to find the balance between simplistic talk understandable by the general public and a scientific communication with our peers. It was also a great opportunity to learn about other team's projects.
On Sunday, the two Parisian teams had prepared activities. Paris Pasteur was a survey related to their subject. Paris Saclay offered us to reflect on biosafety applied to our projects. They helped us identify the potential dangers in our project and how we could act on them. Each team was filmed explaining their solution. You can find our own video here .
All in all this meet-up was a great chance to exchange and get to know other French-speaking teams. We would like to warmly thank the Bordeaux team for the organization of this special event!

Brazilian iGEM WhatsApp Network :
After organizing the Brazilian Meet-Up, Jamboré Brasuca , a group in the application WhatsApp was formed together with members of 6 different synthetic biology “hubs” in Brazil, with teams UNESP-Araraquara and team Amazonas_Brazil . Moreover, the hubs of UFMG, USP-EEL and Esalq/iGEM, and Guilherme Kundlatsch, iGEM “ambassador” in Brazil  are also actively participating. On top of this, people from nascent synthetic biology hubs are always being added. It is really exciting to see the community growing strong!
The group has been used for sharing and solving issues from the bench to hotel reservations in Boston, deadline reminders and sharing surveys. And, of course, sharing ""memes"" and other iGEM related puns, to make the intense lab work more fun. It was great to have this direct channel of communications uniting teams as far as 2600 km (!) from each other, but still inside Brazil.

Collaborations
Collaboration is of great importance in iGEM competition. Through collaborations, iGEM teams help each other to promote a good result for everybody. We have been actively seeking collaborations with other iGEM teams to discuss our projects and learn from their experience.
1. Team Tianjin
iGEM team Tianjin comes from School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University. We helped them to detect the activity of CUP1 promoter. Fluorescence was measured, and the results were presented below:
Besides, Team Tianjin helped us construct a plasmid that can express lyase upon the presence of xylose.
2. Team Jilin_China
iGEM team JLU had problem with the image acquisition of the bacterium, therefore we helped them observe the bacterial morphology under different conditions and took photos. Although it took some time, we are pleased that our work is meaningful to JLU. What’s more, we build up friendship with JLU iGEMers.

IPTG
Ara & IPTG
Team Jilin_China helped us test the work effect of fim system. When IPTG is added, the fluorescence turns from GFP to RFP because the fim system works.
3. Team NEU-China
iGEM team NEU-China comes from Northeastern University. We have communicated a lot about both our projects and have made many useful suggestions for each other.
We helped NEU-China construct the distribution of the olfactory receptor 1D2 with a Rho tag in the N-terminal.
They helped us verify the function of the lyase gene, suggesting our strategy to destroy the bacterium using lyase was practical. After adding arabinose, the bacterium began to produce lyase, leading to their death.
4. Team HFUT-China
iGEM team HFUT-China comes from Hefei University of Technology. We tested their system and shared our feeling. It is a really practical system, which is also convenient for using.

Nankai University No.94 Weijin Road"
Worldshaper-Wuhan,2017,". From this meet up, we learned a lot from our experiences and had a better idea on how to introduce synthetic biology as well as our projects to the public. We got some inspiration from other teams’ performances as well. We were really looking forward to another collaboration with other teams.
Wuhan, China .   New York, USA"
TUST_China,2018," at a Tc concentration of 0 to 200 ug/ml. And this collaboration results would help us verified the function of the gene tetA, which would provide a tetracycline resistance to the original E.coli, and help us better to improve our detecting chasis in the project.
Near the end of the 2018 iGEM competition, we have borrowed the HPLC machine to measure the content of tetracycline in the water samples and degraded solutions.
In this year, TUST-China have a close contacting with the team NKU-China in many aspects, not only in the experiments but also sharing some interesting failure bugs during the project going and established a good relationship.
Collaboration with  XJTU-China
We have exchanged our team logo with the team XJTU-China, and we draw their chemical structure formula with the E.coli including GFP reporter on the petri dishes, and then we have invited some other students into the lab to draw some logos on the dishes. We want to let more people close to the biology.
Collaboration with  Peking
We have attended the synthesis biology lessons in Peking University in the winter holiday. And in this holiday meeting, all of us got plenty of molecular knowledge and those good for us to continue our project in next time.
Collaboration with  Jilin_China
We are invited to attend CCiC in Shanghai. There, we met and exchanged ideas with the members from team Jilin_China. We introduced our projects and built up mutual facilitation with each others. After that, we got contact with them to discuss our projects and possible             collaborations we could do.
Changchun, Jilin is a typical industrial city with lots of heavy industry factories and biological product factories, which could provide us with polluted water for tetracycline detecting and degradation. If we want to detect the antibiotic pollution situation in this area, the team of Jilin_China could provide the local water samples for us to testing. And then, we can use the water sample to measure the tetracycline content with HPLC method.
This year, Jilin_China focuses on SynRT, they did a site-directed mutagenesis of superfolder GFP in iGEM part registry(BBa_I7469616), sfGFP(BbsI free). They would like to construct a standard partof sfGFP(BbsI free)(BBa_K2541401) However, after several trials, they failed in ligation, we helped them to address this scientific barrier."
AQA_Unesp,2017,", human practices and modelling. We shared some information about insulin prices and accessibility in Brazil and Australia. Because we have problems in working with L. lactis and started using B. subtilis as chassis, Sydney team helped us with some protocols and ideas on how to work with B. subtilis.

UAlberta iGEM
As both of our teams were working within the same institution, our team was able to work extensively under the guidance of the uAlberta iGEM team. Their team was very helpful in a number of portions of our project, most notably in the InterLab study. We gave the uAlberta team our InterLab parts from our kit plate, as they had a few unsuccessful transformations for a select number of the InterLab parts. In turn, after successfully transforming the remaining parts, the uAlberta team gave us purified plasmids of the InterLab parts, giving our team an easier time in doing our own transformations. As well, they gave us access to their plate reader, which was integral to completing our InterLab study. All throughout the season, the uAlberta team has also provided us general mentorship in the form of lab training, help with troubleshooting our transformations, running diagnostic gels with us, and being open for discussion whenever we needed them.

This was achieved by holding an event on August 25th,                         the iGEM day, where they presented the projects of several iGEM teams, their experiences,                         and troubleshooting, among others. Gladly, we have the pleasure to share our project and                         our ideas with them.
IGEM IISER Kolkata
Sometimes when you are developing a project that focuses on a big problem but without access                         to a lot of information about it, you can commit some misconceptions. This is what happened                         to IISER Kolkata while trying to attack the high concentrations of Arsenic in pluvial                         systems.
This compound is highly concerning all around the world, therefore, they had to gather                         information of concentrations of Arsenic in other places and also what actions are being                         developed to solve this problem. So, we had the pleasure to gather this information in our                         country and share it with them.
General Knowledge of Burns Survey
Since TecTissue addresses an issue that affects people all around the world, we designed a                         survey to gather information regarding the treatment of burn injuries in different                         countries.

iGEM Düsseldorf Postcards
“A picture is worth a thousand words”. That’s the idea behind the collaboration                         proposed by the iGEM team of Düsseldorf, which consisted of a collection of postcards that                         represented the wide diversity of applications of synthetic biology. The postcards created                         by different iGEM teams from all around the world depicted their projects and helped to                         bring together the iGEM community by randomly sharing the pictures among the participating                         teams.

This time the BIOSINT_Mexico iGEM team had the opportunity to support the new Guanajuato_MX team. This team is made up of students from different universities, who with the intention of starting their experience in this competition, they decided to join efforts to carry out their project. Competition from synthetic biology, iGEM, is not only based on the successful completion of the main idea of ​​the project, but also has other areas of knowledge in which the teams must approach, the development of ethical attitudes and free spreading information are some of them, as well as integration between different teams. Undoubtedly the support and collaboration between different institutions and iGEM team is vital to achieve this goal; there are many problems that arise throughout the development of the project to meet all the objectives; in this case the Guanajuato_Mx team, with all their encourage decided to participate in the annual version of Interlab Study, nevertheless, its iGEM kit was unfortunately not given them, so this study could hardly do. Fortunately for both teams, we were able to be in contact and because BIOSINT_Mexico did have its kit, with great spirits was given them the necessary material, to perform their Interlab Experiment and still participate in the study. That was how Guanajuato_Mx began working to achieve its mission, were later presented other problems, some doubts were clarified between both teams to get results. Finally, although it was a mutual effort to achieve results, different conditions make it impossible to get them; however, the collaboration was always the best intentions of continuous improvement between the teams.
Guanajuato_Mx, thank you for allowing us to work with you and make us participants in these activities, It will be always a pleasure to participate in this kind of stuff whose sole intention is to spread the knowledge in the best way possible, making friends.

1. Exclude the possibility that the pheromone pathway is affected by the native ligand                         pheromone in                         yeast: (Knock out the Ste2 receptor);
2. Exclude upstream G-protein coupled receptor signaling attenuation (desensitization) that may                         result from sustained stimulation. (Knock out Sst2, the GTPase-activating protein for Gpa1p, as                         a                         receptor-desensitizing factors.)
3. Exclude side effects on cell life cycle, cell morphology, etc. due to enhanced MAPK pathway                         signaling in the Pheromone pathway. (Knock out Far1, the cyclin-dependent protein                         serine/threonine                         kinase inhibitor.)
We also shared our original strain CEN.PK2-1C which no knockout of Ste2, Sst2, Far1 was                         performed. And the results of ligand binding response before and after gene knockout of                         pheromone                         pathway were compared to verify the significance of the modification for knocking out side                         effects.

Collaboration with Rathenau Institute
The Rathenau Institute “promotes"" the formation of political and public opinion on science and technology. To this end, the Institute studies the organization and development of science systems, publishes about social impact of new technologies, and organizes debates on issues and dilemmas in science and technology. The institute is part of Synenergene, a European project that aims to foster an open dialogue on responsible research and innovation in synthetic biology (RRI). After winning the Synenergene grant for collaboration in Human Practices supported by iGEM, we worked with Mrs. Zoë Robaey from the Rathenau institute, who was a great help for the development of our application scenarios. Indeed, we had the opportunity to contact her by Skype and received her expert advice on anticipating events related to our project in the developed and developing countries. She also helped us to think about a techno moral scenario, with the aim being to anticipate protocols and actions in case of unexpected problems related to our project. Now we are able to answer these questions: • How to provide support to the population in case of panic? • How to provide maximum security for populations? • How to manage most effectively a problem with our kit? We want to especially thank the Rathenau Instituut for all their help during our project. To check out the results from this great collaboration, click our SCENARIOS .

Figure 2. Gradient temperature PCR for both HT-1 and HT-2 fragments. Note that more than 2 bands could be found in HT-1 and HT-2 fragment. These amplified bands explain that the synthetically designed primers were not specific enough. HT-1 fragment size is 1105 bp, and HT-2 fragment size is 864 bp. The indicated arrows showed the expected amplified fragments.
As a means of collaboration, we desperately tried to contact iGEM NTU for help of ligation cloning of HT into commercial expression vector pcDNA3 on August. Coincidently, Angelysia went back to Jakarta, and we met each other for further discussion in cloning the respective gBlocks. The gBlocks are sent to NTU Singapore on the mid of August. We gave our highest gratitude for team iGEM NTU in helping us to clone the completed linear HT fragment into pcDNA3. The samples arrived back to IHVCB lab on the mid of September. Additionally, iGEM NTU also offers to clone several designed parts of our project related with FRET system into commercial vectors.

We have started to do re-clone traditionally using EcoRI and PstI into pQE80L expression plasmids, and successfully obtained the pQE80L-HT (figure 4).
However, we tried to clone the HT into pSB1C3 and fail twice since both DNA have the same fragment size, and it would be difficult to be done in traditional cloning (figure 5). Therefore, iGEM NTU offers us help in cloning the leftovers HT complete fragment into pSB1C3 while our lab team could start to characterize the HT part along with BFP and DiphTox.

Exchange Meeting with LZU-China
On July 16, 2015, we had exchange meeting with iGEM Team from Lanzhou University, LZU-China, at Hokkaido University. We each had a presentation on what project we were going to work on through the summer.
After that, we held a ""nomikai"", Japanese casual style party.
Synthetic Biology Regulation and Rights by Tec-Monterrey
Introduction
The effect of GMO to the enviroment has been raising a concern, since they disturb the biodiversity of our nature. To solve this, Cartagena protocol was adopted in 2000, Montreal.  Cartagena protocol was adopted for that, ”In accordance with the precautionary approach contained in  Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the objective of this Protocol is to  contribute to ensuring an adequate level of protection in the field of the safe transfer, handling and use  of living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology that may have adverse effects on the  conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health,  and specifically focusing on transboundary movements.” and Japan aceceded into it in 2003.
This regulation about gene recombination is very important for us iGEMers,  since we handle GMO in our daily experiments. Also, the yield of GMO crops has been increasing  and the GMO crops are becoming more familiar to us. Therefore, futher understanding and discussion of the protocol is needed.
So we, Hokkaido University team, participated in online forum held by Tec_Guadalajara in Mexico.
Purpose of this forum
This online forum was held by Tec_Guadalajara in Mexico and for shaping policy for our discipline of biotechnology/synthetic biology. This online forum imitates the real discussion from parties and observers to the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD, part of United Nations). Next conference and meeting of the Parties of the Cartagena Protocol will be taken place in Mexico, so they held this online forum like their government. Hokkaido University team"
Manchester,2017,"MMs in each related field.
The usage of the GMMs in Korea is strictly regulated by the GMO Law, established on Jan 28, 2001. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy takes charge of this law.
2. Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?
We can distinguish two different administrative ways in which countries decided to regulate the use of GMMs. One way government regulate GMMs is by establishing a special, often non-governmental, organisation, which usually also acts as an information centre in the field of synthetic biology. The other way involves assigning conventional ministries to regulate the use of GMMs in their respective fields.
The European Union, Australia, and Indonesia belong to the first group. For example, in Australia, Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee takes charge of making decisions on products’ approval. Competent authorities in the European Union and The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety in Indonesia have similar roles.
Brazil, Canada, Chile, Korea, India, Japan and the US belong to the second group, where conventional ministries are responsible for their respective fields. Even though the names of these ministries might differ amongst the countries, it seems to be a more prevalent way to regulate GMO. Additional information centres might be present to help the ministries make decisions, nonetheless.

The US Food and Drug Administration regulates any GMMs that get used in consumer products, such as GMMs in food or cosmetics. The US Department of Agriculture regulates any genetic modification of plants. However, any GMMs that are to be released into the environment are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Manufacturers wishing to make their products available in Canada are required to submit paperwork (including manufacturing and quality control methodologies, pre-clinical and clinical tests, side effects and limitation), as well multiple samples in the case of biologics, to Health Canada. Health Canada will then evaluate the product according to the regulations set out in the Food and Drugs Act, the Food and Drugs Regulations, and the Medical Devices Regulations.
All member countries are obliged to establish ’competent authorities,’ institutions responsible for overseeing the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis.
It is the role of the Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee to assess all data supplied by any applicant (who is intending to release GMMs into the environment) and perform a comprehensive literature review to determine whether or not it will be approved. FSANZ also regulates the use of GMMs in foods for human consumption on an individual case"
NTHU_Taiwan,2017,"CA NZ Collaborate Memo :
This year we, SECA NZ, collaborated with NTHU iGEM in the exchange of international viewpoints and software. NTHU is developing an ingenious system to monitor and adjust the level of contaminants in irrigation drains using copper filters and a Watergates. The filter cleans the water, and a complex set of sensors monitors the output. If the level of contaminants exceeds the capacity of the filter, the water gate will reduce the flow to a manageable level. They are also investigating the water quality in aquaculture. New Zealand’s economy is largely based on agriculture and fishery industries, and so as a team, we participated in a questionnaire to assess our opinions on aquaculture and water quality in the agriculture industry. This provided NTHU with both an international and consumer perspective on the issue.
Our own project focuses on the development of crop plants capable of surviving snap frosts. NTHU contributed to our project by graciously providing software and specifications on how to build a temperature sensor which would allow us to monitor the temperatures of cropping land.

We had been collaborating with iGEM NAU several times. Each time, we focused on sharing experiment schedules and techniques to solve problems in Wet Lab and Dry Lab. On account of their suggestion, we changed our protocols which made a great breakthrough on the performance of enzymes and solved the problem we made in gene transfer. In Dry Lab, we offered our experimental experience in hardware design. We not only gave them a deep look into measurement analysis and practical application, but also gave our suggestion on data collection method, model designing, and hardware modeling. On the other hand, we both exchange our plasmid for further check and study. Thanks to the profession in molecular biology from iGEM NAU and our outstanding talent in the device, we integrated both our advantages and made a significant improvement in both our project.

By means of collaboration hub provided by iGEM HQ, it is convenient to get in touch with OUC-China iGEM team. According to the Collaboration Request, we understood that they were investigating Aquatic organisms’ outbreak caused by water eutrophication and looking for collaboration. As a result, we not only shared our local experiences about eutrophication in Taiwan but also documented several governmental reports, online Data database and academic papers in National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan for them. Similarly, they shared lots of information and toughed us to model out project by Michaelis - Menten equation.

The issue of containing environmental hazards caused by heavy metal pollution is a worldwide problem that must be solved by the power of all mankind. It was our pleasure work with Tianjin igem team to establish their database. We collected and organized a document about many case reports of metal pollution in Taiwan ,and shared a detailed investigation completed by Taiwan Environmental Informational Association(TEIA). It not only contain database within ‘Contaminated Sites Map’ from Environmental Protection Agency and ‘Taiwan Ssurgo Database’ from Taiwan Agriculture Research Institute Council of Agriculture ,but also gave a visualized map to show all information.

JMU_Wuerzburg,2018," InterLab study, as well as a protocol (Appendix: Protocol Vibrigens Interlab.pdf) and a team-prospect.
The cooperation was about conducting an InterLab study which was designed by team Marburg with V. natriegens instead of E. coli.                  The InterLab study contained four steps. Transformation, cell growth, sampling, and assay and should be done in about three days.                  We spent the first day preparing solutions, media and an overnight culture of V. natriegens.                  The second day we prepared the cells for electroporation, transformed them and watched them grow.                  The protocol provided clear instructions and was very easy to understand. (Appendix: JMU_Wuerzburg.xlsx) But unfortunately, because of our electroporator, the cell-transformation failed.                  Luckily team Marburg was very supportive and sent us ready-transformed colonies of V. natriegens, so we could finish the InterLab study successfully.
After this little complication the rest of the laboratory work went very well.                  We made an overnight culture of ready-transformed colonies and measured absorption and                  fluorescence of the transformed cells (Appendix: Interlabstudy Marbug Plate Reader.xlsx), following the protocol.                  After sending our data over to team Marburg our collaboration was completed successfully.                  During the whole InterLab study communication via Facebook and E-Mail was always very pleasant and purposeful.                  Team Marburg used to ask about our accomplishments in the lab and replied quickly when there were any problems at any time.                  All in all, carrying out the growth curve experiment with iGEM team Marburg and                  being able to work with V. natriegens for the first time was both intriguing and exciting for us.

Questionnaires
Questionnaires of different sorts are a part of many iGEM teams projects, ourselves included. We created two questionnaires, the first one on the integration of modeling and wetlab efforts in iGEM and the second one on finding collaboration partners. Having ourselves approached the iGEM community for this purpose, we recognise the difficulties teams sometimes face in getting answers to their surveys. To do our part in solving this problem we wanted to answer and forward as many iGEM questionnaires as possible as well as we could. We answered and/or forwarded the following teams questionnaires:

We would like to thank our collaborators for their help with various elements of our project.
Manchester iGEM provided us with a version of their model that could be modified and applied to our project. While we decided to use our in-house developed model, we have learnt valuable lessons from analysing their models and discovering how they could be adapted to our needs.
Sheffield iGEM and Cardiff iGEM participated in our efforts to educate and inform sixth formers from around the country in our open day, and invited us to travel to their universities to present our project. This provided us insight into how our presentations could be simplified and gave us valuable practice in presentation skills.
We contributed towards SVCE Chennai's troubleshooting of lab techniques for their project, and also for helping the entirety of the iGEM community.
Valencia iGEM aided us with modelling aspects of our gRNA system in exchange for help developing their molecular models. Through this, we achieved a greater understanding of the requirements for our system to activate gene expression.
Finally we would like to thank everyone who participated in the UK iGEM meetup for listening to our presentation and giving feedback on which elements of our poster and presentation could be improved and made more clear. We would like to give thanks specifically to Westminster iGEM for organising the event, and guest speakers, and providing the support and oversight that made it so successful.

Helping TUST prepare for their first year of competition.
To begin with, we offered them some constructive suggestions, and communicated with their team adviser. In 24/3/2017, we were invited to TUST to carried out a recruiting propaganda for them, and helped them form a team.
Giving TUST Constructing and experimental advice
In 2017.08.01, TUST and Tianjin held a meeting together, during which TUST gave an account of their recent progress, we suggested them to add some new synthetic routes and elements in their project, and probably a new strain instead of simply Xylinus for fibrin.

What We Did For Them
TUST came to us again with their modeling problem, we gladly suggested them to share the Fluorescence method and modeling method with us. Since it's their first year competition, we offered them to design Fluorescence experience and modeling together.

What we did：
To verify whether the system built by China Ocean University was still available in other species of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In that case, we used our laboratory-specific Saccharomyces cerevisiae with synthetic chromosome 10 to test its value of fluorescence intensity.
Protocol for fluorescence detection：
Yeast with plasmid was incubated overnight in YPD + G418 medium
Transfer the yeast suspension to the new YPD + G418 and adjusted the OD to 0.1
After incubation for 20 hours, the fluorescence was measured

Additionally, we collaborated with the UCLA iGEM Team for an interview in our At What Cost? storyline. Interested in learning more about how the Do-It-Yourself biology movement was affecting the ambitions of young synthetic biologists and bioengineers, we reached out to the UCLA team to learn more about their thoughts on this movement. We were happy to see our friends at the UCLA iGEM team once again, and we are grateful for them for giving their time for our interview and questions. Lastly, we collaborated with the Virginia iGEM Team by contributing our answers and views to their Biocontainment survey.

HUST-China, WHU-China and HZAU-China, three universities located in Wuhan region have been keeping close communications and collaborations these years. This summer, we continue the tradition, we three iGEM teams held a seminar in 29st Jul,    during which we reached the consensus to establish Wuhan iGEM Committee in the future and held conferences and Science Fair at regular intervals to spread the idea of synthesis biology. Moreover we discussed about our project and exchanged some valuable suggestions. Here are the three main collaborations we made this summer.
Construction of CI-PSB1C3
We helped WHU team constructing a standardized plasmid C1-pSB1C3. Owing to the limit of time and the cost of fragment’s synthesis, WHU decided to generate a short C1 fragment through anneal of single-stranded DNA then insert it into the pSB1C3 between the restriction sites of XbaI and PstI. But they met difficulties and failed after several attempts.
After discussions and new experiment design, we helped them finish the construction through the following protocol:    1. Mix up 2.5μL primer F and R
2. Put the mixture in PCR Amplifier :
DNA denateration for 5 minutes
Annealing for 30 seconds
3. Ligation with pSB1C3(XbaI and PstI digested) for 1h
4. Transformation to E.coli

Texas Tech Collaboration
The gellan gum plates that Texas Tech made in lab by following the protocol created by Jenna McGuffey and Erum Dhanji.
To fulfill the gold medal requirement, the UT Austin team mentored the first year Texas Tech team. The Texas Tech Collaboration page can be found here.
In the collaborative spirit of iGEM, the UT Austin iGEM team reached out to several other teams. Through this outreach, we began communicating with the Texas Tech team. As a new iGEM team participating in the competition for the first time, Texas Tech had several questions about the competition that we attempted to answer during the summer and fall.
Team member Zach Martinez of UT Austin and Marilyn Mathew of Texas Tech taking a photo at UT Austin after receiving the UT Austin team's fluorescent bacteria.
During this time, members of the Texas Tech team has visited Austin three times. An initial meeting took place between two team representatives to discuss the teams’ projects during the summer. Brandon Palomo of Texas Tech agreed to attempt to replicate Jenna McGuffey’s and Erum Dhanji's results with gellan gum plates. At this same meeting, Katelyn Corley of UT Austin helped to answer many of Tech’s questions regarding language in the iGEM rules and classification for iGEM medals. Corley and Palomo exchanged contact information so the teams could continue to collaborate electronically.  In the second meeting, Marilyn Mathew of Texas Tech, originally from Austin, visited our undergraduate research lab to pick up fluorescent bacteria that Texas Tech wished to use for a public workshop relating to community awareness of synthetic biology.  These bacteria were originally created by members of the UT Austin iGEM 2015 team and have been in continual use by the UT Austin iGEM teams since then.  Members of each team met for a third time at the Texas iGEM meetup at UT Austin in September.  This meetup occurred as part of the University of Texas at Austin Undergraduate Research Symposium. During the third meetup, we provided Texas Tech with the Sphingomonas paucimobilis bacteria required to make gellan gum plates and answered additional questions about the competition, deadlines, trip details, and"

Further to this, we carried out a joint survey with them. Participants from both of our respective countries filled this out, allowing us to find the public's preferred method of therapeutic delivery and opinion on probiotic use. This cross-cultural survey gave us an idea of how the attitudes to probiotics can vary, and the issues we might face if we were to further develop our project and create a treatment that would be used worldwide.
Cardiff
We wanted to analyse our sfGFP-tagged chelators using Fluorescence Lifetime IMaging (FLIM).
Lacking access to a fluorescence lifetime microscope ourselves we contacted Cardiff iGEM who had access to a FLIM machine in Cardiff's bioimaging unit . They very kindly agreed to run a few samples for us taking up over five hours of microscope time.
We sent Cardiff iGEM our parts Csp1-sfGFP, MymT-sfGFP (both in pBAD) and pCopA CueR sfGFP (as a control) in live MG1655 E. coli in agar tubes. Cardiff grew them overnight in 5ml of LB with 5uM copper with and without 2mM arabinose.
The imaging unit spread each strain on slides and measured the fluorescence lifetime of three areas on each slide. For full analysis of the results see our results page .
From this preliminary data we believe that measuring fluorescence lifetime of a His tagged GFP can be used as a reliable method for measuring copper concentration in vivo and that MymT displays copper chelation activity in E. coli. If we could perform additional experiment we would measure the fluorescence lifetime with different overnight copper concentrations to try to generate a standard curve for quantitative analysis.
Our most sincere gratitude to all those at Cardiff iGEM in particular Rob Newman for setting up the collaboration, Dr. Geraint Parry for setting up the experiment and Dr. Anthony Hayes at the bioimaging unit measuring the our parts using the FLIM microscope.
UNBC
We discovered that UMBC were investigating a similar project idea towards the end of our project and decided to Skype them to share our experiences of performing copper assays in particular the difficulties we had in optimising our BCS absorbance assay and the choice of reducing agent.

Collaboration with team SHSBNU_China
August 11th, 2018, our team’s modeling group studied the principle and basic techniques with team SHSBNU_China. We met online and communicated with each other on WeChat and voice calls. Both of our teams see this opportunity as meaningful, because we not only learned a lot about modeling and its significance, but we also gained valuable friendship with peers that have the same interest.

Collaboration with team BNU_China (and RDFZ_China)
During the experiment period from the start of July till October, we shared the same laboratory with BNU_China and partly with RDFZ_China. Members from BNU are mostly undergraduates who have more experience and knowledge than us, and they taught and helped us a lot. Thanks to their patience and enthusiasm, we were able to adapt to the days in the lab quickly. After some times, we were able to help them with some basic operations that could save time and resources. VHb is used to improve the growth ability of the engineering bacteria in our project, and when we discussed it in the meeting room near the lab, it turned out that this information could be helpful to their (BNU) project, too. There is much space to improve. We were really glad that our ideas could be able to collide and work out something beneficial for both of our teams. In July, together with BNU_China, we finished our interlab experiment using the microplate reader offered by Peking. After that we discussed our data together, seeking a better way to modify the inaccurate part in our experiment, leading both our teams to a better state.

Hamburg,2017,"!
Delft & Aalto Helsinki
Hence our first collaboration, with iGEM Delft would have started way to late in the current competition. We developed further ideas as how to combine projects most of which did not work out, this specific example however is something that we want to share because it would have been amazing and did fail due to one reason alone: The lack of time.
So how did it start? Delft informed us, that they were working on tardigrade proteins in a side project, which can help folding and unfolding proteins during and after states of cryptobiosis. Which essentially means damage through repeated freezing and thawing, clumping and the like are prevented by the proteins.
Aalto Helsinki, who worked on antimicrobial peptides as well informed us earlier, that they didn’t have access to security level 2 labs to test their peptide on real causative agents, so we offered them to test their peptides on some clinical strains that we could work with in our security level 2 lab. Aalto Helsinki told us that they would have problems to send us their peptides due to activity loss and too little time.
Which led to our conclusion to bring both teams together which was the start of a wild ride. After proposing our idea to Delft, they told us that one of their team members would travel to Helsinki in the next couple of weeks in October, which would allow the transportation of the tardigrade proteins to Helsinki. So that Aalto Helsinki could freeze their peptides send them to us so that we could test them on strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
In the end it did not work out, as mentioned above due to a lack of time, but we are still positive that the attempt was totally worth it and want to encourage future iGEM teams to think big, even if it might not work out in the end.
Heidelberg
Since the beginning of our project we experienced difficulties performing gene amplifications. After tedious trial and error using different gradient-PCRs, experimenting with GC-enhancer solutions and DMSO concentrations we figured out a way to amplify eleven out of our twelve genes and gene fragments. The only one that did not function despite our efforts was the AraC family transcriptional regulator. Luckily the iGEM Team Heidelberg offered a PCR First Aid – Service this year which we gratefully accepted. After a skype call in which we described our problem and attempts at solving it in detail they gave us valuable tips. Their ideas were a raise of the annealing temperature to 72 °C, adding 0."

Mentor on Software Building for High-School Team SKLBC-China and SKLBC-DGSYZX
During the summer, a meetup was held in Sun Yat-sen University. There were wet-lab teams (SCUT-China, SCUT and SYSU-China), a software team (SYSU-Software) as well as high-school teams (SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX).
In the meetup we talked about the relationships between software teams and wet-lab teams. Zhengyang Wen and Shengkun Dai, team members of us, gave advice on project design to  members of high-school teams SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX. Wen and Dai taught them how to discover the needs of wet-lab teams, and gave them advice on how to design software that meets the needs of wet-lab teams. Also, we gave                      them instructions on scheduling the project.

In spring, we held a garden party in the campus with SYSU_CHINA. This activity aimed at introducing synthetic biology to the public, and engaging the public in the practices of iGEM. In the garden party, we made use of various kinds of activities and games to introduce the basic ideas of Synbio and iGEM. SYSU_CHINA introduced how experimental iGEMers did great jobs in a living cells, while we talked about how software can help explore the extraordinary world of life made up of DNA.

BOKU-Vienna,2017," acts synergistically with ugi. emrR is a gene repressor for a number of different multidrug resistance pumps. The exact mechanism is unknown, but overexpression of emrR leads to a repression of those efflux pumps and therefore may lead to an increase of mutagenic pathway intermediates in the cell, increasing mutagenesis.
#1, #2 and #3 raise mutagenesis rates high enough, for E. coli to spontaneously evolve antibiotic resistances. If plated on several different antibiotics, under induction of the plasmids with arabinose, a portion of the cell population is supposed to survive with new resistances. This is what Heidelberg wants us to verify. Click here to read the protocol.

University Team
Meeting with SYSU-Software & SYSU-China (2017)
We went to the Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) to meet with the two teams there: SYSU-China and SYSU-Software. At the beginning of the establishment of their teams, we exchanged experience in recruiting, teaming, projecting, and training. We also learned that the SYSU provided a comprehensive set of training courses to improve the experimental skills and abilities of team members It inspired us that we seek help from our university for providing such kinds of training for our team. The university offered a seris of useful safety courses and trainings for us as we mentioned in the safety section
Further Cooperation with SYSU-Software
Since the modeling of SYSU-Software strongly interested us, our team had established a long-term cooperation with SYSU-Software, made many face-to-face communications, and discussed in depth of the development trends of synthetic biology and the potential application fields. In addition, SYSU-Software was invited to our college to deliver a presentation and demonstration of the software they developed. We have leart a lot from their project and they also gave us many constructive suggestions on develoing our computer modeling.
Meeting with Peking & SCUT (2017)
Under the leadership of Haoqian Zhang, our three schools got the opportunity to meet and exchange. Yihao Zhang, the captain of PKU iGEM, showed us the growth and achievements of Peking from its establishment to the present. Chen nan, the captain of the SCUT iGEM also showed the process from prototype to formation. During the meeting, we have formed a clearer concept about iGEM and have a better understanding of the game.
Help NPU-China complete modeling (2017)
Weixu Wang, who is in charge of computer modeling in our team, helped NPU-China complete their model - Metabolic Flow Modeling in 2017.
Meeting with SUSTech_Shenzhen(2018)
Members of SUSTech_Shenzhen were invited to come to Guangzhou to discuss with us. We exchanged opinions on  each project. During the discussion, the team of the SUSTech raised potential problems that our project may encounter in the future, as well as areas that need to be improved, such as how to remove the resistance of the plasmid after genetic transformation.

Collaboration
A silver requirement for the iGEM competition 2018 is to cooperate with other teams from around the world. During our journey in our biological adventure, we have met other teams from different parts of Europe, to seek their knowledge and not least, their friendship. We have chosen to make a timeline to show how we collaborated throughout our project time and to document our increasing knowledge and friendships along our way to the Giant Jamboree!
13th-15th of April 2018BioBrick Tutorial in Copenhagen, Denmark
Team(s) in the collaboration:
DTU-Denmark (our hosts), UCopenhagen (University of Cophenhagen, Denmark), Uppsala (Sweden), Linkoping Sweden (Sweden), Stockholm (Sweden), Lund (Sweden), Chalmers-Gothenburg (Sweden)
In April, we were invited by the Technical University of Denmark to learn more about BioBricks. During this mini conference, we learned more about how to find and use Biobricks for our project. We found out more about submission vectors and different types of assemblies. We also had a possibility to train how to pitch a project and heard a lot of useful tips from former iGEM participants. We met people from other Scandinavian teams and we shared our project ideas and challenges with them. Overall, we had an amazing time and we would like to thank again DTU Biobuilders for organizing such a meaningful tutorial.
25th-27th of May 2018UiO team and the Tuebingen team collaboration in Oslo, Norway

Tuebingen (Germany)
In May, we hosted a collaboration event for a German team from Tübingen. This collaboration was very special to us, not only because 2 of our team members are German, but also one of them is a current student there. The Tübingen team was happy to join us in Oslo to broaden each other’s horizons in synthetic biology. Since both projects were at the very beginnings, we only prepared a trial presentation of our current and planned work. We also discussed some of our poster suggestions and we got feedback from professors and students from the University of Oslo for both the presentation and the poster. After a helpful feedback"
Stockholm,2016," all of which are commonly found in wound infections [1] [2] .
The set up for the bactericide tests was fairly simple - different amounts of cell lysates were added to bacterial cultures and analysed at various time points to detect changes in bacterial density.
Depicting a possible bacteriolytic action of Pyocin S on P. aeruginosa after addition of soluble fractions from cell lysates to bacterial cultures
The success of those experiment varied - with some of the proteins we were able to identify what might be a bactericidal effect but a higher level of expression and purification steps would be needed to achieve more significant results. This is the path SDU followed in their own project, where they were able to demonstrate considerable bacteriolytic effect with their purified proteins.
Time Well Spent
Our collaboration proved beneficial for both teams - it allowed SDU to see how their proteins performed with different strains and species of bacteria in Stockholm’s labs and our team on the other hand had the opportunity to optimize our setup testing bacteriolytic and bacteriostatic activities. And most importantly it gave us all the opportunity to share the frustrations, joy and ‘aha’ moments that come with iGEM projects.

William&Mary
Scottish meetup
William and Mary
This year, we were mentored by the William & Mary team, as St Andrews and William & Mary are sister schools.  There’s already a joint degree between the two universities in the liberal arts, and so it was a natural decision to deepen the relationship between the Schools of Biology.  Over the course of the summer, the team from William & Mary advised us on the tricky nature of genome editing, and how it was easier and more reliable to alter bacterial function via plasmids as an alternative.  Moreover, we discussed the nature of using fluorescence as a marker of cell viability as opposed to relying on the OD600 measurement.  Their captain, Ethan Jones, gave us excellent protocols, advice, and pointers on lab techniques that have worked for William & Mary in the past, including methods for colony PCR, miniprep procotols, and general tips on plasmid cloning.  He helped us find the most reliable way to perform part characterization experiments (suggesting we use ribosome binding sites or promoters as a starting point for the exploration).  Additionally, he walked us through the requirements for part improvement.
One of our team members, Morganne, was able to visit William and Mary and discuss more about our project in person, as well as attending their community outreach programme, during which they surveyed citizens of Williamsburg about local opinions on the ethics and implications of genome editing for medicinal purposes.
We’d like to say thank you so much to them for all their help and support, without which our project would not have run as smoothly!

ALL INDIA iGEM MEET, PUNE
The All India iGEM Meet was held at IISER, Pune on the 15th and 16th of July,2017. Various iGEM teams from across the country participated in this Meet. The main agenda of this gathering was to allow teams to share their projects, for other teams to put forth suggestions on how to better the team’s project and thus, to basically encourage exchange of ideas between the different teams.
Eminent speakers from various fields of Science were also invited to speak to us. We were allowed to glimpse into some of their astounding work and encouraged to raise questions. IISER Pune was an excellent host in making sure our stay was a memorable one.
This year, two members of our team represented the team’s idea at the All India iGEM Meet in front of an audience of the other Indian iGEM teams. After the presentation, lots of valuable suggestions and feedback was given by the members of the different teams.
We have taken these ideas into consideration and tried to customize our project accordingly.      Being our first iGEM venture, this Meet helped us not just in"

In our videos we demonstrate and explain in detail how to perform these procedures step by step in the real lab setting. Though our videos are initially made in Russian, they have English subtitles so that any person other than speaking Russian could use them as a tutorial. The videos are available at iGEM Tuebingen 2017 YouTube channel and we hope that they would contribute greatly to popularizing iGEM and synthetic biology."

Imperial College London
We assisted by providing Imperial iGEM with growth data from Chlamydomonas, for their computer model A.L.I.C.E. This computer model is aimed at producing a platform with the growth conditions for various different species, and ultimately for identifying possible co-cultures. Find out more here
We hope that the data we provide is especially useful for Imperial iGEM, as chlamydomonas takes significantly longer to grow that bacterial species.

The Linköping University Sweden Team
The Linköping University Sweden team were also working on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with the aim to transform the nuclear genome to introduce CRISPR/cas9 technology to disrupt the metabolism pathway and make the cells more efficient for biofuels. Due to the similarity in project goals we collaborated throughout the summer.
The nature of this collaboration has taken many formats: e-mails, skype meetings and weekly reports about the week experiments. Staying up-dated in this manner has allowed for the exchange  of questions of dealing with the organism, protocol sharing and advice on different strategies. Sharing knowledge in this way, both teams managed to get a “feel for the organism” over the summer.

Collaboration: imagining the future together
In the world of iGEM, teams from different universities usually work on distinct projects tackling separate issues. Sometimes, however, the combination of two projects can give rise to novel solutions that could not be achieved by either project alone. As it turns out, the iGEM projects of team Amsterdam and team TU Delft give rise to such combination. In this essay we wrote together, we explore how our projects could be combined and describe a potential application of combining Amsterdam’s synthetic consortium with Delft’s nanowires and 3D-biofilm printer.

iGEM Amsterdam & Synenergene
Delft
The TU Delft iGEM team designed constructs that give bacteria the ability to form nanowires between each other, creating an extracellular matrix which forms a structure, and form a biofilm. In the project of Amsterdam, the E.coli and cyanobacteria will form the biofilms. The E.coli bacteria are producing the nanowires. The cyanobacteria will be trapped by these nanowires in such a way that specific structures of both E.coli and cyanobacteria are formed. These specific structures can increase the production rate as the  ratio of cyanobacteria to E.coli can be engineered to ideally match the steady state conversion rates, while at the same time reducing diffusion limitations between both partners.

Tianjin for Qsinghua-A
This year, we helped Tsinghua-A team in their wet-lab experiment. They want to mutate a single base in their DNA so that it will not be cut by a certain type of restriction enzyme. So we taught them how to do overlap PCR. Because we two team were not in the same city, it was hard for us to do experiment for them directly. So we taught them the principle of design and the protocol of experiment.
Primer design of overlap PCR
1.   The overlap region should be near 20bp
2.   Each primer need another ~20bp for annealing (each primer is ~40bp in total)
3.   The mutant point should be in the middle of the overlap region
Protocol of overlap PCR
1.   First PCR:
One reaction system (50ul) contains 2ul 10uM forward primer and 2ul 10uM overlap reverse primer; the other reaction system contains 2ul*10uM reverse primer and 2ul*10uM overlap forward primer.
2.   Run gel electrophoresis to test the PCR product.
3.   Gel recovery.
4.   Second PCR:
In the reaction system (50ul), there are 2ul of each product (L and R part of the target gene) from the previous step, and 2ul 10uM forward and reverse primer respectively.
5.   Gel electrophoresis and recovery
6.   Sequencing the product to test it.
Results:
Figure 1. From left to right, 1 is marker; 2 is L part of overlap; 3 is R part of overlap; 4 is another L part of overlap.

Indeed all the teams’ projects have relevance to biomanufacturing and to creating  biologically synthesized useful substances at a commercial scale. Thus, gathering perspectives from people involved in these fields will enable us to better understand our subject as it is complex and controversial. To do so, they created a document where the 5 teams could add their questions, complete others issues and add their opinion. From all these questions, they created a Global Perspective Outreach survey that we shared on our Facebook page. Finally, we were sent the collected data which we used for our Human Practices.

We talked together about our projects and realized they had something in common: they both include an optogenetic system. After that we kept being in touch through e-mails and skype sessions.  As our project went on, we had a hard time finding a way to emit the specific wave length we needed. Therefore, we asked Düsselforf-Köhln team for help and asked them how they managed to do it.

The team was interested in showing our project to other iGEM teams, in order to know if the project is really useful, and to discuss the pros and cons of this. For this, we decided to contact teams whose projects were similar to ours. That is, teams that are developing new methods to detect molecules in water samples. The collaboration proposal with which we approached the teams was:
""Hold online meetings with the objective of knowing the projects of both groups and discuss the pros and cons of both projects. In this way, we can propose solutions to the problems of the other team, thus providing a new point of view to the problems and possible solutions. As a final goal, the possibility of combining both projects to reduce the cons and increase the pros could be discussed"".
At the end of September, all the teams had already uploaded their abstract, so we dedicated ourselves to read the abstract of all the teams participating in the ""environment"" track. This is how we found 9 teams with whom we were interested in collaborating due to the similarity of our projects. We contacted everyone with our collaboration proposal, from which we obtained some answers. However, the team that was most enthusiastic about our proposal was the Peshawar team from Pakistan ( their wiki! )( Page of collaboration of the team ).
Our first contact was with Shaheer, who was very willing to hold a meeting by videoconference. Despite the difficulties we had to meet, due to the different time zones (Chile and Pakistan are 8 hours apart) we managed to arrange our first meeting, in which Shaheer Sabz Ali and Muhammad Dawood participated. In this first meeting we got to know each other, talk about our respective human practices and about our respective iGEM experiences. We also discussed our project, we showed our iGEM presentation prototype so they could give us feedback, and they did the same with their project. Both teams were interested in each other's project, so we agreed to hold future meetings, this time with the objective of specifically discussing how to help improve the other's project. For this, we made a document describing the pros and cons of our project.
At the next meeting, the Peshawar team gave us a document describing solutions to the problems our project"

We created a magazine called iGEM LATAM with the collaboration of the Latin american teams: TecCEM, TecMonterrey_GDL, iGEM Ecuador, iGEM Tec Chihuahua 2018, iGEM Tec-Monterrey, USP-EEL-Brazil and ColegioFDR_Peru. Inside the magazine there is information about the teams, the projects that were developed by them during the year and the difficulties that arose as well as tourist information and many other interesting things about the participating countries. This was the second edition of iGEM LATAM, since our first one was published last year in our wiki. From our first edition, we learned many things and we also found some things that could be improved. During a meeting with Karina and Regina from the ColegioFDR_Peru team, in which we exchanged information about our projects to seek for a possible collaboration, the subject of our magazine came up and we asked them if their team would be interested in participating to which they agreed to. They also let us know that they wanted to write and publish a magazine called “Journal of FDR Science”. When they told us about this idea, we were very excited and gave them tips and advice on how to design the magazine for it to be more aesthetically pleasing (keeping in mind what the final reader of the magazine would like to see), considering if the final language of the magazine should be english or spanish and if it was going to be a digital version or a printed one. We also made corrections of the drafts they shared with us that provided information about their project, the health effects resulting from mercury contamination and lab safety.
Additionally we collaborated with the Hong_Kong-CUHK team because we realized that they were working with an aptamer and lyophilization in their project called “RAPID”. We exchanged information about our projects and the Hong"

During the project we helped many other teams by answering their questionnaires and interview requests. We worked closely together  with the SDU iGEM team from the University of Southern Denmark with regard to technical issues, give feedback on each others poster and presentation. In order to be able to organize this we arranged the Scandinavian iGEM pre-conference, where all teams from the Scandinavian countries were invited.
Scandinavian iGEM pre-conference
The first Scandinavian iGEM pre-conference was held the 9th October here at DTU.  The purpose of this conference was to present the status of our work to each other, have a practice session for the presentations and show a first draft of the poster to each other. Based on this we had a discussion session, where we talked about our experiences, our difficulties and challenges with the project, but we also discussed what is needed to obtain good results.
Unfortunately the Swedish teams resigned before the conference, so only the Danish teams were participating.  We had a constructive day that ended in a dinner and socializing before we went home with new energy and inspiration for our projects.
Both teams would like to thank the Department of Systems Biology at DTU for sponsoring food and providing facilities for our conference.

LiU iGEM, Sweden
At the beginning of the year the University of Linkoping team, from Sweden, got in contact with us looking for help with a local 'show and tell' they were a part of. This show and tell was designed to showcase the broad applications of the iGEM competition.
We were able to provide a detailed outline of our project to help showcase the iGEM brand. Importantly for us this provided an international connection outside our standard area of Australasia, connecting us (however briefly) with the other side of the world.
These connections are what we were looking to form with our collaborations this year in the hope that future Auckland teams can expand on our work.
Fig3. shows the LiU iGEM team’s stand. They reported a great deal of interest in their project and have inspired us greatly in terms of how we might want to engage with our community in the future. Inspiring more students into science is a cornerstone of our project this year and the LiU iGEM team’’s stand demonstrates a great way to achieve this.
USYD iGEM, Australia
The 2017 University of Sydney iGEM team has been a major partner, supporting our project from very early on.  After an initial email conversation with Nick, the PI for USYD, Peter of SECA NZ and Emaleen of USYD had a really useful skype conversation, discussing both team’s projects and the setup of USYD. As a new team it was very valuable to hear about the elements of team organisation that were the same and different between our teams and future challenges we may face. Nick and Emaleen both gave helpful information on their system of sitting exams at the same time as the Giant Jamboree. While we ended up organising to sit these exams in Boston knowing the USYD team tends to defer exams until after the Jamboree gave us the opportunity to demonstrate the importance of the competition around the globe.
Fig4. shows the first email we received regarding the iGEM Australasia meetup. We’re on the opposite side of the globe to many teams so it was very humbling to be asked to attend this meetup. We look forward to seeing these meetups continue.
Max of SECA NZ offered some guidance and code to the USYD team around the design of their wiki. As Max’s background is in computer science he was able to support the USYD team in this way.

NTU_SINGAPORE,2017," CRISPRi.
Not only that: the GFP gene in this case is on a p15A origin plasmid. Literature suggests that there should be 15-20 copies of this plasmid per cell – and hence 15-20 copies of GFP promoters for the dCas9 to bind to and interfere. On the other hand, there is only one genome bound GFP gene in our endogenous reporter E. coli strain for multiple dCas9 to bind to.
Thus, the binding affinity of our truncated dCas9 variants are more strictly interrogated by this plasmid reporter system, especially when dCas9 expression is restricted.
Based on these conclusions, we would expect to observe similar results with endogenous gene CRISPRi if we are to target a less effective site, for example the -35 of the promoter. In addition, we may also replicate the very low dCas9 level expression to achieve strict interrogation in endogenous CRISPRi.
While plasmid reporter used here is an imperfect model of therapeutic CRISPRi, we have shown that it is a better method to interrogate our truncated dCas9 binding affinity – especially with regards to mammalian endogenous gene activation. Such a system may serve as a rapid intermediate to testing any future truncated dCas9, complementing other methods such as our mammalian exogenous gene activation and the EMSA assay established by Macquarie iGEM team.
We would like to thank NUS iGEM team for providing a characterized CRISPRi dual plasmid system. Do check their wiki page also here ."

NeuronArch:
the novel connecting and protecting biofilm based system for prostheses
Abtract
In the future, a long due consideration and an easier access to healthcare will be given to people with disabilities. Presently, some prostheses allow amputees to perform simple actions but without a direct connection between the nerves and the prosthesis. Furthermore, a major health risk is the development of pathogenic communities of microorganisms in structures called biofilms. Strong treatments with antibiotics, or even surgical reinterventions are then required. They represent a heavy burden for both the patient and the healthcare system. We imagined NeuronArch as a novel application that subverts potential pathogenic biofilms using an engineered one. This interface produces substances called neurotrophins (NGF), for directed and controlled growth of nerves. Using a conductive membrane, it will also allow passing of information and enhancement of the electrical properties. Altogether, these improvements would enable patients to regain natural perceptions and prevent the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms by blocking quorum sensing.

We initiated a collaborative effort with Team Heidelberg, who designed a software for generating new aptamers.  At that point in time, we thought our controls were working better than they were and that we would be able to use the aptamers they designed in our system.  When we were hesitant to commit due to the time it would take to clone plasmids to work with a new aptamer-trigger combination, Heidelberg suggested a modified switch design where the trigger could be the same as what was previously used, so no cloning would be required.  We started moving forward with this design….and then realized that our negative controls had produced the same results as our positive control for the last two experiments.  Set-back about a month, at the end of August, we concluded we could not reasonably plan on testing Heidelberg’s aptamers.  We additionally realized that the aptamers their software was designing likely too short to work in the sort of switch we had designed.  We scrambled to design new ways of detecting proteins and ordered several for synthesis, including Heidelberg’s idea with a longer aptamer.  Then, just days before the wiki freeze, we produced some very promising results.  We remain optimistic we will be able to test one of Heidelberg’s aptamers or the switches they inspired before the iGEM.  Stay tuned for the results to be presented in Boston!
Heidelberg Inspired Sequence We Ordered
We also skyped with rookie team, Nait_Edmonton, and helped them navigate iGEM policies and advised them on how to recruitment and team logistics.  As we have a big team, that is entirely student led and independent of another PI, we have had to figure out to divide work amongst our volunteer team members.  We advised them to give people very specific tasks to maintain accountability.  We also answered questions about the Jamboree and got them excited to go!
Additionally, we sent our laboratory protocols to the  University of Michigan Software Team who designed a protocol database for their project.  SInce their project did not involve any wetlab work,"
Manchester,2017," GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labelling your final products in a predescribed manner. Environmental release of GMOs is also given serious attention although the procedures are not as tight, just as in the case of contained GMO use. Usually, the target use also dictates which Ministry will be responsible for the evaluation and approval of the planned GMO use. These could include Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Food, Fisheries, Forestry, Environment and many more.
In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a payment of a examination fee that costs 4000 dollars. In the USA, GMO plants are considered equivalent to non-GMO plants and do not require much further approval; only if the plant express a protein that is significantly different from any protein originally expressed, will a respective institution be required to approve of such use. In Chile, on the other hand, it is forbidden to commercialise GMOs as only seed exportation is allowed.
*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*
Under FDA regulations, most plant GMOs are considered equivalent to non-GMOs and do not require much further approval. However, if the modified plant expresses a protein that is significantly different from any protein it originally expressed, then the business must get approval from the FDA.
To receive EPA approval for GMOs with the Bt toxin, the business must conduct a food-safety analysis and verify that the toxin will be safe for the environment. GMOs without this toxin can be freely used.
If it involves Health Products it must go through:
• Review and evaluation. (ie. pre-clinical trials in vitro, labelling of the product, etc).
• Compliance and Enforcement Activities which include fulfilling areas in Education, Consultation, and Information; Compliance Monitoring; Compliance Verifications and Investigation; and Enforcement.
• Monitoring and Tracking involves the process of continual monitoring after a product has been released to the market. This allows the public to interact with the product and provide valuable feedback.
If it involves Food Products it requires:
• Pre-market assessment is required under the Food and Drug regulations and is a science-based safety and nutritional assessment where the food product must fulfill a criteria.
• Letter of no Objection must be sent to the product developer and outlines that the product is able to be sold in Canada for a specific mentioned reason as well as include the limitations on the product as provided by Health Canada.
• Labelling of Foods Derived from Biotechnology is required to all foods whether created through genetic engineering or not. It is absolutely required if the food has any health or safety issues such as allergens.

iGEM Team of
CCU_Taiwan
We have had a meaningful collaboration with CCU_Taiwan iGEM team in interlab study. When CCU_Taiwan worked on interlab, they were not able to transform the plasmids for Interlab from iGEM kits into thier competent cells E. coli DH5α. This caused their interlab study to be stuck right at the beginning. (For more detail about the problem CCU_Taiwan iGEM faced, click here .)
They started to ask for help from other iGEM teams and we decided to give them a hand. We had several online meetings to help them troubleshoot their interlab study. We even read their labnotes and discussed together. However, due to the proximity of the deadline for interlab data submission, we think that it would be a good idea to make a backup plan for them. Therefore, we gave them E. coli into which we had successfully transformed with plasmids for interlab. We have also gotten  through our interlab study in advance to make sure that we have the right concepts and methods to help them out.
With our help and with their perseverance, CCU_Taiwan eventually finished their interlab study and their result was accepted by the iGEM Headquarters on August 24.
iGEM Team of
TAS Taipei
As we have always done, NYMU iGEM cooperated with TAS iGEM team in various aspects this year. We have closely cooperated in conducting interlab study. Some TAS members attended our weekly meetings, joined our discussion on our projects, gave advice on our deliverables, and troubleshoot our experiment failures. On the approach of DNA submission deadline, they also help us by simultaneously cloning and checking our mEGFP (BBa_K2751011) and ALB-mCherry (BBa_K2751012) into a pSB1C3 backbone. (For more details please look into their collaboration page .)

Team KU Leuven (Belgium)-Worldwide Collaboration Project
We were honorably invited by KU Leuven to participate in a worldwide iGEM translation project, which is comprised of several teams worldwide to reach the consensus of making the spread of synthetic biology knowledge without the language barrier. We were responsible for Traditional Chinese translation in this project, and our team project was translated into different languages, including Russian, German, French, etc.
Team Tokyo Tech (Japan) and Team KAIT Japan-Project Inspirement
This August, we held a modeled presentation with both Tokyo Tech and KAIT Japan, and they gave us some constructive suggestions in our presentation. We also paid a visit to KAIT Japan’s lab so that we can have a deeper understanding of each other’s project. Most important of all, in 2009, Team Tokyo Tech made Melanin possible to express in Escherichia coli. As a result, they gave us lots of useful experiment advice of how to produce Melanin in Escherichia. coli, which inspired us the idea to express black pigment in our microalgae.
Team Peshawar (Pakistan)-Experimental Help
This September, we submitted the NrtA part to Team Peshawar for examination of protein electrophoresis. Their results remind us of modifying our design by taking signal peptide under consideration, so the capability of NrtA-transformant may be enhanced significantly.
Team Franconia-Worldwide Collaboration Project
We assisted Team Franconia to translate their biological themed cards into Traditional Chinese, and we all think this card game is significantly meaningful after translated into types of different languages. We hope that this game could raise people’s awareness of pathogens and biosafety issues.

Kobe
Team kobe was founded last year and is a team of Kobe University who participated in this year's iGEM for the first time. Team Kobe has helped each other since we met iGEM Japan Kansai Forum. In order to hear the opinions of many people against their projects, we participated in a super-dissimilar field meeting. Hyper-Interdisciplinary Conference was a conference where people from various fields such as biology, engineering, economics, etc. gathered. So I thought that it might be able to receive advice from various directions. We invited team Kobe to join us. So we contacted the organizers and made it possible for team kobe to participate. At Hyper-Interdisciplinary Conference, we watched each other's poster sessions and gave some advices.
Even crowdfunding helped each other. By diffusing information on cloud funding by SNS and disseminating it to each other, many people got to know the activities.And the financing became smoother. Team kobe has earned funds with Crowd Funding before us, and has been collecting support above the target amount and making it succeed. When we started cloud funding, we referred to the team Kobe's cloud funding. We felt that this has led to support. Kobe Collaborations
