Meetups
Online conference about heavy ion pollution
We had an online conference about potential collaboration about China’s current situation of water pollution. There are 8 teams participated in the conference: TJU , UCAS, XMU, SCUT-A ,                             SCUT-B, FAFU , JLU , and us SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. We first introduced our project to each other including lab experiment, Human Practice, current progress and problems as well as willingness                             to cooperate. Then we shared the information we had obtained lately, including some conclusion we had drawn after interviewing, investigating and reading literature.
Online conference held by XMU
This conference is mainly held for communication. We participated in that using Skype with UCAS, XMU, NCKU and SCUT-A.
We learned that SCUT-A was dealing with a color analysis application which is similar to what we have achieved in our app. We shared the theory of our app with them and offered them suggestion on developing such app. NCKU mentioned CGU who was doing some                             image processing work and suggested us that CGU may provide us some advice on developing app. We then had an online conference with CGU which we will write about later.
What’s more, NCKU gave us advice on bacterium conservation. When we mentioned we use paper to hold bacteria, they suggested us that we could apply the technique of lyophilized. It was helpful and we took it into consideration when                             we discussed the possible methods to conserve the bacteria.
1st Collaborative Innovation Online-conference for iGEM
Community open day held by Tongji University
This year, we went to fablab in Tongji University and participated in the open day hosted by Tongji University. We brought our project to the activity and shared it with other schools and residents who came by that day. The community                             open day attracted many people stop to listen. Meanwhile, it was also broadcast live online.

In the end of August, we attended the Fifth Conference of China iGEMer Community held by ShanghaiTech. We were inspired by the wonderful lectures delivered by professors and scholars. The presentation session gave us an opportunity to express ourselves before Giant Jamboree as well as learning from other teams in China. During the poster session, we had face-to-face conversations with other iGEMers, some of whom offered suggestions on promotion.  After the conference, we began to work on developing new and thoughtful ways of Human Practices, establishing a more systematic model, and making modifications on designing of our poster and wiki. We were lucky to communicate with iGEM HQ, Meagan Lizarazo, and took photos with her.
NJU-China
They shared A549 cells, which could verify the demo of our system. In return, we offered suggestions on their project and helped them carry out the cell viability experiment. It was proven that their manipulation did no harm to cells, which set up a good start of their project. Their acknowledgement can be found on their wiki page ( https://2018.igem.org/Team:NJU-China/Collaborations ).
OUC-China
We distributed brochures named SPACESHIP E.coli made by team OUC-China, hoping to increase publicity of synthetic biology. The brochure is a comic book and fun to look through and discuss with other readers. It really worked in intriguing students’ enthusiasm for synthetic biology. (see more on Education Page )"

Measurement: Newcastle
The thermal conductivity of growth media.
Newcastle's 2016 iGEM project looks at the creation of biological electronic components, and as part of their modelling they needed to know the thermal conductivity of different growth media. With a strong team of physicists on board the Exeter team, they came to us for help. With support from our biophysicist supervisor Ryan Edginton , we built an experimental setup (Fig. 1a) that made use of the transient hot wire method (Healy et al 1976).
A 0.65m insulated copper wire (cross-sectional area, 0.05m2) was passed through the centre of a 50mL falcon tube containing the liquid medium to be measured, suspended in a water bath (Fig. 1b). Three thermocouples (Pico Technology TC-08) were attached, one to the wire in contact with the insulation using blue tack, one suspended in the liquid medium 5mm from the wire, and one in the water bath. Power was supplied to the wire at 5A, 1.8V for 600s, generating a small temperature increase of approximately 2°C above room temperature (23 ± 1°C) to avoid convection effects. Our experimental setup was calibrated to the thermal conductivity of water at 20°C, 598.4 $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$. Measurements of two growth media, liquid broth (LB) and M9 were repeated at least in quintuple.
Figure 1a - experimental setup of the transient hot wire method.
Figure 1b - arrangement of thermocouples within the falcon tube measuring thermal conductivity using the transient hot-wire method.
Figure 2 - representative plots of temperature against natural log of time for water, liquid broth and M9 media. A fit was applied from the point where the relationship becomes linear to extract the thermal conductivities.
Nagasaka and Nagashima noted that wire insulation has negligible impact on the measurement of the      thermal conductivity of saline solutions (Nagasaka and Nagashima 1981) and thus can be described by the equation:      $$ \lambda = \frac{Q"
TJU,2015,"u. Subsequently, NH3 is able to neutralize H+ inside the cell resulted in pH ascending. 2. When intracellular pH goes up, the alkali-resisting genes NhaA and NhaB can generate Na+/H+ pump which transfers Na+ to the outside in exchange for H+ from the outside. Thus, H+ is able to neutralize OH- inside the cell leading to pH drop. Next, we will demonstrate our construction via taking the pH regulation module as an example.
Figure 6. The gene circuit about glsA acid regulation gene
We establish the following equations based on the gene circle above:
As a step forward, we established the following ordinary differential equations on the basis of Law of Conservation of Mass and Michaelis-Menten equation:
Supposing that the original pH in the external environment is 4, we can get the picture of intracellular H+ concentration change (as shown in picture 1).
Figure 7. The environmental H+ concentration variation tendency.
the figure indicates that the intracellular acid concentration tends to be stable, which clarifies that the acid controller can make microorganism more tolerant in the low pH conditions. Besides, the principles and equations used in alkali controller modeling is similar to those used in acid controller.

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015," a member of the Our Lady Of the Snows Catholic Academy iGem team. We are a small high school based based out of Canmore, Alberta, Canada. We are contacting you because we have chosen to tackle build ups of keratin in wastewater treatment, and well as the poultry industry as this year’s project, and your team’s 2013 project involved Keratinases too. When talking about wastewater treatment, these build ups of hair can lead to clogs causing flooding and the breakage of water pumps and pipes, something very costly to repair. The only current way to deal with this issue is to have a worker manually remove the blockage, which is slow, unpleasant for the worker and inefficient.   Upon further research our team discovered that the reason hair is such a huge issue for waste treatment facilities is because of the protein keratin, which as you probably know is a very hard protein to break down due the tightly wrapped helixes and hydrogen bonds. Once we discovered this pressing issue we looked into keratin more and realized it is also a component of the basic construct of feathers and they to build up and are hard to break down. With more searching on the iGEM parts registry we discovered your project, as well as one other project, both of whom attempted to solve the keratin issue. With this research and the exploration of previous iGEM projects, we decided to create a construct that would express a Keratinase enzyme to break down the keratin in the hair and feathers, thus solving the issue.   Because iGEm requires collaboration between teams, we decided to try contact you due to your decision to tackle this project in 2013. As we understand it, you reached the planning stages of the project and then dropped it? As much of our project is based on building on, and optimizing previous constructs, we are looking for some more in-depth information concerning the cleaving process, and some issues you would've tackled there, and how you would've dealt with them. We know that Keratinases are difficult to express in E. Coli, due to the double membrane, and because when expressed, the export tag does not always get cleaved properly, so if you could give us any insight upon this, that would be appreciated. We would also like to get some of your current opinions on the issues, if you have any advice for us that could make us more successful at the competition and if you had devised a way in which you would have deployed your construct outside of the lab, if you had completed the project. We also were wondering what your plans were for implementation of the bi"
Macquarie_Australia,2018," has bound the target sequence of DNA from its slower migration through the gel (see Figure 2,3).
Protein Purification
The plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli and expressed under auto-induction conditions. These cells were then harvested, lysed and purified using a Ni-NTA resin with standard His-tag purification protocols. Eluates were then run on an SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 1). The darkest bands observed above 100 kDa correspond to the expected dCas9 sizes which suggests the expression and purification was successful.
Figure 1. SDS-PAGE gel of the His-tagged dCas9 constructs. The darkest bands observed above 100 kDa are the expected sizes of the dCas9 proteins.  Lane 1 contains a 250kDa ladder. Lane 2 contains 3ple lysate. Lane 3 contains 3ple fraction 1. Lane 4 contains 3ple fraction 2. Lane 5 contains 3ple4QHP lysate. Lane 6 contains 3ple4QHP fraction 1. Lane 7 contains 3ple4QHP fraction 2. Lane 8 contains a 250kDa ladder. Lane 9 contains Rec2_HNH lysate. Lane 10 contains Rec2_HNH fraction 1. Lane 11 contains Rec2_HNH fraction 2. Lane 12 contains Rec2_HNH4qhp lysate. Lane 13 contains Rec2_HNH4QHP fraction 1.
In vitro CRISPR assay + EMSA
To test these dCas9 constructs we again included an electrophoretic migration shift assay as last year. As the dCas9 constructs were designed to not have nuclease activity, while retaining the ability to bind to the gRNA and target DNA, we set up variations of the in vitro CRISPR assay to track the progression of the target DNA, gRNA, cleavage products, and protein migration on a DNA retardation gel (6% acrylamide in TBE, ThermoFisher Scientific).
The four purified samples were subjected to three treatments (Figure 2, 3):
Pre-incubated: gRNA + enzymes (incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes in all samples)
Incubated: gRNA + enzyme + PCR product (further incubated for 1 hour at 37°C)
Deactivated: gRNA + enzyme + PCR product (further incubated for 1 hour at 37°C) and a deactivation step of 20 minutes"

Fully taking the chance of four-school communication meeting and CCIC Summit Meeting, team SYSU-CHINA and we had deeper communication than other teams. Debugging for each other, we found out problems of the presentation and figured out the solutions together. While making the judging form website, we also shared experience. Thanks to the help from the team leader of team SYSU-CHINA, we successfully finished our judging form.
Collaboration with team BGIC_China
Team BGIC_China is one of the high school iGEM team in Shenzhen. Their project of this year required them to condense and desiccate their biological samples on filter papers, which they lacked in laboratory. Thus, we helped team BGIC_China by lending out our lyophilizer to them. They came to our laboratory to operate the last step of their experiments before lyophilizing and used our lyophilizer to condense and desiccate their biological samples, finally finishing their project.
The Next day we did a questionnaire on what they think about our project and some other questions. Including what they think about GMO, how well do they know about energies.  The details of the result will be shown in the engagement part. We also spent some time to design a fun booklet that holds simple knowledge of synthetic biology and other science knowledge to handout to them. Since most of them stopped their education at primary school, we want to teach them some simple and interesting science knowledge in this way and encourage the children to get more education.
At night we called the whole village together and had a public presentation on science. The knowledge we taught are useful so they listened very carefully. We told the children why they look like their parents. Most of the people in the village first heard about DNA. And they don’t believe giving birth to a boy is entirely depend on the father before we told them. And to make the knowledge simpler, we even draw a lot of cartoon figures before we went to the village to help them understand.
From the experience to the countryside we finally knew about the actual difficulties they are facing in their daily life， and that is exactly what we should try to solve for them.

UCL,2016," the UCL iGEM 2016 entrepreneurial ideas was made by iGEM team members for iGEM teams. Our software platform would not be optimised for use unless we obtained user feedback from iGEM teams. Hence, we collaborated with over 69 iGEM teams, to gather feedback to shape our alpha version for use in their projects.
High school teams
We also helped the CLSB-UK iGEM team characterise one of their parts as they did not have a spectrophotometer at their high school. We measured the optical density of a culture of Synechocystis over the course of 5 days. CLSB-UK needed the optical density readings to check that their method of using a colorimeter with a particular filter was working. We obtained the started culture with the growth medium and obtained the data by incubating the culture at 25C with light with mixing. The Synechocystis we obtained data from was non-transformed with no foreign genes.

Collaboration with Dundee iGEM team
Following our talks with Aubrey de Grey and Filipe , we really wanted to conduct experiments that show that our lycopene probiotic can survive in the gut and acidic conditions of the stomach. We were very lucky to have met with Dundee GEM team at the UK GEM meet up where they told us about a stomach simulating device that they own. The bacteria in a sealed container and reconstructing the conditions found in the stomach. A manual pulley system replicates the churning of the stomach with an acidic environment.
We sent out a slab of bacteria that contained our lycopene biobrick within it, to test whether our bacteria could survive in the stomach, in order to provide proof that our probiotic idea would be functional in the human body. Dundee then measured the growth of our bacteria by taking optical density measurements every 15 minutes for an hour since adding it to their device. The results were extremely promising; our genetically modified bacteria grew successfully in their device. The full discussion and our results can be seen on the demonstrate page.

It takes many recourses to accomplish extensive projects and collaborating with other teams is an important part of iGEM. In this project, our team has collaborated with several other iGEM teams in the aim to reach further. Presented below are the highlights of our collaborations, namely The Wiki Wizard, The BioBrick Workshop, No Money, No Project and What is Fracking? 
 
The Wiki Wizard
Creating and editing wiki pages, uploading files with the correct name can be a tedious task. Therefore we are making the Wiki Wizard, which helps with the naming of pages and files, making sure that they have the correct namespace etc. Also it has a WYSIWYG editor for content and syntax highlighted editors for html, javascript and css files.
It can be found on GitHub .
 
 
The BioBrick Workshop
The DTU iGEM team of 2015 hosted and prepared the content of the BioBrick Workshop from the 24th to the 26th of April, 2015. SDU , UNIK Copenhagen, and DTU collaborated to represent every iGEM team within Denmark. teams also participated. The BioBrick Workshop was an initiative to educate iGEM team members with the basic lab competences required to perform a synthetic biology project as ambitious as iGEM. It also provided an opportunity to introduce fellow iGEMers to general lab safety and cloning techniques while strengthening the social dynamics within the teams.
Highlights of the program included a general assembly tutorial for the creation of a new BioBricks independent of organism and project. In the tutorial, the teams practiced designing primers for Uracil Specific Excision Repair (USER) cloning and they integrated a green fluorescent protein expression cassette into a target location on the chromosomal DNA of E. coli. In order to teach everyone a variety of techniques, the iGEM teams were mixed and half of the groups used the USER-cloning technique while the other half used traditional restriction enzyme cloning techniques. As"

Cambridge JIC-team, England
The Cambridge JIC-team were generating a chloroplast transformation toolkit and were interested in expressing a CRISPR/Cas9-system in chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The purpose of the project was to achieve homoplasmy quicker, in a matter of days rather than months since no selective plating would be required.
The collaboration between LiU iGEM and Cambridge JIC-team has been an ongoing process in the form of e-mail contact, skype meetings and weekly reports about the week that was. The exchange has included discussions, questions about the model organism, Gibson assembly and other approaches, different protocols and other things that felt unclear.
USP/UNIFESP, Brazil
The Brazil team USP/UNIFESP also work with C. reinhardtii and wanted to try CRISPR/Cas9 with RNPs but encountered some difficulties when it turned out that another team worked on a similar project. The team needed a new approach which we helped them with. This was done by exchanging protocols and regular updates from both teams.

TU_Darmstadt,2016," is a 3D printer and we also use a syringe pump it was natural to work together. Munich sent us their system and we printed the additional parts on our own. This is exactly how they imagine their system. We tested it and gave them feedback on their design and possible challenges, so they can improve their design. For us it was useful to test the multi purpose of our robot and how easy it is to add new parts and features. Also the syringe pump design is different and we had a good chance to evaluate our design and compare it to the one of Munich. We derived useful information within this collaboration and are interested in working closer together in the technical part of the iGEM project. Especially if Munich decides to go on focusing on the do-it-yourself sector, Darmstadt is the right team to talk to! We like to thank the iGEM team of Munich for this opportunity and wish them success with their project. Keep on working!
Collaboration with iGEM Düsseldorf
When we heard about iGEM team Düsseldorf’s collaboration idea, we knew right away that we wanted to be a part of it. As we have mentioned and experienced in our human practices approach as well, the synthetic biology’s reputation in many parts of the german society is not too good. By participating in this project, we wanted to try to change this together with the other german iGEM Teams. The postcards were supposed to have a nice and appealing picture in the front, which moreover fits the respective team’s project. On the back of the postcards, a short text should inform the reader about one small part among the field of synthetic biology.
First of all, we had a lot of fun designing our postcards and doing the photoshoot for it. On our postcard, we wrote about the opportunity of producing medications in a cheaper and more sustainable manner.
A great part of this collaboration was receiving the other teams’ postcards. It was the highlight of our day each time!  After we received all the different postcards, we allocated them all over Darmstadt and our university. We gave them to people or just left them on the tables of our students’ café so that students could look at them while having a cup of coffee. By doing so, the public is informed about the possibilities of synthetic biology in a nice and subtle way.
So thanks to all the iGEM teams that participated in this great project! And of course a huge thanks to the iGEM Team of Düsseldorf ! You have done a great job in creating and initiating this project.

Exeter,2016,"Blocks”. During the Westminster UK iGEM meetup Edinburgh talked about the issue of mutated DNA going relatively undetected. Their method at the time involved adding up the value of each base and storing this as a “Checksum” at the end of the BabbleBlock. Edinburgh’s team highlighted in their presentation that they knew this would lead to a large amount of false positives as many different combinations of information could add to the same Checksum. My research looks in to the method of the Checksum and attempts to create a new method that has a smaller chance of false positives.
Storing information on DNA offers many advantages over current methods, however mutations     need to be carefully monitored to ensure incorrect data is not read as a false positive.     Currently for information stored on a BabbleBrick a ‘CheckSum’ is calculated by taking the     sum of the values on each base of DNA. If the checksum of a BabbleBlock has changed between     the time of writing and reading, the data is considered to be corrupt.
$C = \sum^{bp}_{n=1} bp_n$
$C$: Frequency of checksum
$n$: The integer address of base pair
$bp$: Amount of base pairs (5 times the number of BabbleBricks)
$bp_n$: The value of the $n^{th}$ base pair
Fig. 1. The frequency of all checksums in a babbleBlock system containing two BabbleBricks.
Fig. 2. The frequency of all checksums in a babbleBlock system containing three BabbleBricks.
Currently a checksum utilizes only a small percentage of the values that can be stored.     A BabbleBrick contains 5 base 4 digits meaning that 4$^{\text{5}B}$ unique bits of     information share one of 15$B$ checksums where $B$ is the amount of BabbleBricks in one     BabbleBlock. This data has been plotted for BabbleBlocks containing 2 and 3 BabbleBricks     in Fig.1 and Fig.2 respectively. Assuming that between the time of writing and reading     any number of mutations can occur, the maximum probability of a mutation event resulting     in the same checksum can be calculated by comparing the frequency of one checksum to the     total frequency of unique bits of information.
$P_C = \big(\frac{C_{max}}{F}) \approx \big(\frac{1.2 \times 10^5}{4^{10}}) = 11$% in a 2 BabbleBrick system

We also liked the possibility to, at least to a certain extent, work without internet           connection, as it meant we could make some changes almost everywhere, for example the subway. However, a current problem is the need of an initial connection so the local server can be set up and that, sometime after the server is set up, it           seems to expire. We would like to see IDE running 100% locally without needing a starting internet connection other that, say, the very first time is used.""
•  University of Sydney
""Since none of our team had experience with python, we had some difficulty setting up the IDE but once we understood how python worked it was a bit easier. Maybe you could use something simpler than python in the future?
""One way you could make the set-up and use of IDE easier is to include more screenshots in your explanation for setting it up on github.
""You've designed the IDE tool very well overall! Although our team had some difficulty with python, the way it was designed through python was very clever.
""For our team, I think the most useful thing would be to make the tool easier to use for people who have no experience with coding, particularly by providing more detail in your instructions and explanations.""
•  University of Warwick
""Your tool was able to accurately display what the site would look like (including our bugs on the page). This was helpful in identifying errors and making changes without having to constantly upload the site to test it on the iGEM wiki.""
Warwick also pointed out a number of issues they found with IDE and with the instructions for how to use it, which allowed us to rectify these issues to make IDE easier to use for future teams. For example, they discovered an issue with running the build script on Windows, which we were then able to correct.
•  CCA San Diego
""Although we did not use the IDE for the bulk of our wiki development, CCA iGEM tested the IDE, and found it very convenient to use when uploading content for certain pages of our wiki because it is much faster than the default iGEM wiki environment. In addition to providing us with the IDE, Bristol iGEM recommended a software tool, Bootstrap, which was also useful for us.""

Wet Lab Collaboration with the iGEM Team TU Darmstadt 2016
The iGEM team of TU Darmstadt developed a biosafety system that makes bacteria strains survive only at laboratory conditions. The idea is that they require a specific unnatural amino acid in the medium. In case the cells leave this environment, the bacterial genome is degraded by the DNase Colicin E2, leading to cell death and destruction of the genetic information. This system might impede accidental or deliberate release of GMOs and therefore tackles the problems of corporate espionage and ecological consequences of GMOs.
The DNase Colicin E2 consists of 3 domains: a cell export domain, a cell import domain and a DNase domain. The team of TU Darmstadt developed a minimalized version of this protein, containing only the DNase domain. This protein (mColWT), as well as a mutated version (mColmut; C266A), was put behind a T7 Promoter on the plasmid pSB1A3. After transformation of both constructs into E. coli TOP10 and BL21, Team Darmstadt observed a significantly lower colony count for mColWT than for mColmut on LB Agar supplemented with Ampicillin. In order to check if this apparent toxic effect of mColWT is also oberservable in other strains, we tested mColWT and mColmut via transformation in Shimwellia blattae (a strain we are using in our project) at our lab in Göttingen. Empty pSB1A3 was also transformed into S. blattae, in order to check if the plasmid is compatible with the strain.
All transformations were successful, but no significant difference in the colony count between mColWT (960 and 776 colonies; upper plates in figure 1) and mColmut (628 and 984 colonies; lower plates in figure 1) could be observed (Fig. 1).

Cardiff_Wales,2017," in using a plant expression system for their experiments. Following this tweet WashU iGEM got in touch with us, showing interest in expressing their protein of interest in plants.
Their project aimed to develop a strategy to reduce UV damage in photosynthetic organisms, but were unable to express the system in plants due to lack of specialist resources. We set up a skype meeting to talk about the collaboration in which we suggested the experiments that we could conduct that would successfully test their hypothesis. These experiments involved using a phenotypic assasy to assess the effect of UV damage on tobacco leaves that had been inflitrated with a clone expressing their protein of interest.
Unfortunately WashU were unable to generate their clones in the Phytobrick standard so we were unable to take this collaboration foward."

Rosetta beginner's guide
Together with iGEM team Technion Israel we have written a beginner's guide to Rosetta meant to help new iGEM teams in their protein design. This guide contains information on how to install and use Rosetta and other useful software for protein design, such as PyMol and Chimera. The guide also contains information on what protocols to use and how to use them, databases to find all the necessary files such as a protein database and chemical compound files, and the use of external sources. Besides all this useful information, the guide contains information on how to process your results and some helpful tips and tricks in general. The guide can be found here .
Secret Message
The iGEM team Groningen contacted us whether we would like to decode a secret message from their bacterial spores. This message is protected by computational encryption, while the secret key can only be accessed from the spores with the right growing conditions. Groningen sent us the spores and after some PCR programs, overnight culturing, and sequencing, we decrypted their message using their software . The message said: “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.”
Interview
On the 4th of August, iGEM EPFL interviewed our team for their iGEM news website. This website is created to bring iGEM teams from all over the world closer together with interviews, teams of the week and photos of the week.

Collaborations
Vilnius
After the Hackathon in Vilnius we decided to work on a collaboration with them, where we did some modeling for them. A molecular dynamics model was setup for the Vilnius 2018 iGEM team to study a part of their system. The system in question consists of a fusion transmembrane protein (OmpA+anti-GFP) in a pure DOPC bilayer in the presence of GFP. The fusion transmembrane protein should bind GFP and should display it on the outer side of the membrane.
To start, the structure of OmpA had to be reconstructed as parts of it are missing in the crystal structure. This was achieved using the “modeller” software, a python module for homology modeling. The same structure was used as the reference structure and so the filled in structure only serves to complete the molecule.
Next, the fusion protein was constructed. The sequences of OmpA and anti-GFP were joined exactly where they will be fused according to the DNA sequence designed by the Vilnius team, using PyMOL.
Then the fusion protein was coarse grained by the martinize script, producing a well calibrated coarse grained bead mapping for the fusion protein in the MARTINI 2 forcefield. The fusion protein was then inserted in a DOPC bilayer constructed by the insane.py script. GFP was also coarse grained using martinize and inserted in the system containing the fusion protein"

Aachen,2017,"asmids into our different mutants to further improve our salt uptake. Since we did not work with plasmids or golden gate assembly it was not possible for us to assemble this plasmids in such a short amount of time without the help of our collaboration partners. This plasmids proved to work pretty well with our mutations, thus contributing essentially to our whole project. Therefore, we thank our fellow iGEM partners!
The plate contains several yeast colonies. A colony was randomly picked and analyzed through a microscope. No visible contamination was observable.
The ladder can be on column #1. The 2 PCR products (found in columns 2, 3) show a strong band situated at around 2000 bp. Using the software Geneious®, we digitally constructed the dPEX7 knock out cassette, determining that its length should be around 2100 bp.
Once we finished this collaboration, our team realized its importance and the positive effect it had on our partner iGEM team's project. Keeping in contact with our friends in Cologne/Düsseldorf,      we learned that the knockout we accomplished was a key transformation in their project. Getting rid of PEX5 and PEX7 genes would get rid of the own cellular protein import system of the peroxisomes.      This important step would then allow our partners to integrate their own protein translocation system and therefore control the synthetic pathway that happens in the intercellular compartments.      Through our experience and knowledge, we helped them overcome this obstacle which, as they explained, wouldn't have been possible by themselves.
SynBioDay
We were invited to the SynbioDay which was organised by our lab collaboration partner Team Cologne Düsseldorf.
The conference took place in the university’s very own palace, which is now a conference centre in Düsseldorf’s city centre. Lucky for us, Düsseldorf is just about 1.5 hours by train, so we did not have to get up too early in the morning.
After a short breakfast Professor Matias Zurbriggen gave all the attending guests a short introduction to synthetic biology and how it mimics some of the same principles as an engineering design process, while still having some differences.
Dr. Marc-Denis Weitze talked about the challenges of communicating between the science community and the general population. He explained how their academy investigates the public’s perception of an upcoming controversial topic like artificial photosynthesis and tries to initiate a dialogue between scientists and the public.
Professor Röbbe Wünschiers held a guest lecture about his field of work and the future of biotechnology which in his opinion lies in in silico simulations.

Dundee,2016," enabled us to improve.  The questions in London were tougher but our answers held up to scrutiny and we considered the presentation a success.
We also presented our poster for the first time in London, with many teams commenting that they enjoyed our infographic style as it differed from all the other teams.  Feedback included that it was easy to read and follow; there should be more lab work and results present and that the layout should follow the presentation so they link seamlessly together.
Edinburgh Debate
We teamed up with the undergraduate team from Edinburgh to organise a debate regarding GMOs to help us better understand perceptions from non-scientists and what they main points are for arguing for and against the use of GMOs.  We enrolled the University of Dundee and Edinburgh debating unions to present and chair the debate, which was a massive success and contributed to our understanding of public opposition to GMOs.
The debate leaned heavily towards GM crops, as it does in Scotland, and focused on the profit that could be made by large companies such as Monsanto who develop GM seeds that outperform their natural siblings.  There is a fear that these companies would hold their seeds ransom for an extremely high price, with farmers obliged to pay due to their undoubted benefits.  This was countered with the notion that whilst companies such as Monsanto make a profit, it is not comparable to the saving of millions of lives due to these improved agrichemicals producing better yields, and in harsher environments.
Mentoring
The Dundee High School Team was the first from Dundee and first from Scotland.  They entered the lab with little experience and very basic knowledge of the correct procedures and protocols that they would require to complete their lab work.
We mentored them throughout their first month in the lab to develop their skills, grow their confidence and spent most of our days with them, either in the wet or dry lab, assisting in any way we could. Kieron, Chris, Holly and Rachel taught them how to pipette as well as carry out minipreps, restriction digests, ligations and transformations and showed them how to make and run agarose gels. We also made sure they were aware of the correct safety procedures and when to wear appropriate PPE. Fatima helped them to get to grips with mathematical modelling and Ummi helped them to design their poster and presentation.

BUCT-China,2018,"id into E. coli top10 strain and observed its growth (the AMP resistance gene was carried on the vector plasmid to confer selectivity). The expected result is 1, 3, 4 groups of long bacteria, and 2 groups are not long bacteria. However, we conducted a number of tests and all ended in failure.
So, we contacted the cooperation team TEAM UESTC-CHINA to discuss the reasons for the failure and the solution. Finally, TEAM UESTC-CHINA proposed changing the enzyme ligation conditions, changing the enzyme ligation conditions to a 4 degree reaction for 22 hours (overnight reaction) for enzyme ligation, and proceeded to verify the work.
                       TEAM UESTC-China verified the results of the enzyme connection
In the end, we used the solution provided by TEAM UESTC-CHINA, and the experiment was carried out. The experimental results are very good. After that, we were able to carry out the subsequent operations.

Overview
At the beginning of iGEM, we created a flyer showcasing the strengths of our team and the various ways we could help other teams. As a result of this, we were contacted by three teams: Edinburgh overgraduate team, Exeter, and Evry Paris-Saclay.
For the Edinburgh team, we used our modelling knowledge to help fix their model. We aided the Exeter team by repeating one of their experiments, and they gathered single-cell fluorescence data for our deGFP construct using their FACS machine. Finally, Paris designed a novel psicose-regulated promoter to be used in a biosensor. We then incorporated their promoter into our framework so that many different variants of a psicose biosensor could be designed, made and tested.
Edinburgh OG
We were initially contacted by Anton Puzorjov from the Edinburgh Overgraduate team after meeting them at the Northern UK iGEM meet-up. As our team contained members who have been trained in modelling for synthetic biology, they were wondering if we could help them with their model as they were struggling to convert their deterministic model into a stochastic one.
We organised a Skype call to discuss how far they had gotten and to explain the theory behind stochastic modelling. After a long talk, we understood the issues and Anton had shown us the software they were using to model with (StochPy). We were then given their code and went off to work out the issues.
We corrected their code by fixing the reaction for infection of bacteria by phage, and converting the rate law for infection of bacteria by ph"
Aachen,2018," contact, we were reassured that a malfunction of melatonin production is a worldwide important topic      in medical research, therefore a simplification of the measuring method could have a great impact.
Furthermore, this contact gave both of our teams the opportunity to present our projects to a bigger audience from the other side of the word.

The iGEM team of the Heinrich Heine Universität Düsseldorf initiated a project,      where all participating iGEM teams can create a postcard, dedicated to their project or generally to synthetic biology.      So we created our own postcard and received many beautiful and interesting cards from other teams.      In this way we were able to keep their research topics in mind.

AQA_Unesp (Brazil), Valencia_UPV (Spain) and SECA_NZ (New Zealand)
We joined our local towns city festival in the end of summer. Before this festival we considered other countries projects and wanted to find some interesting projects to share at the festival. We found three projects that seemed extra interesting and we wrote to the teams and asked if they were interested in a collaboration. We wanted to show the public the diversity of what syntetic biology can be used for. The projects who caught our attention was Valencia UPVs project chatter plant, AQA Unseps project Insubiota and SECA NZs project with frost-resistance in fruit. We wrote the teams and were very happy when all three teams were interested in collaborating with us.
The teams wrote us simplified summaries of their project descriptions and we hung these up at the city festival. A lot of people read about the projects and were surprised that these kinds of things could be done, they thought it sounded surreal. We had read the project descriptions and other information on the team’s wiki and were there to answer the questions that were raised.
We are very thankful for this collaboration and it gave us an opportunity to mediate the importance of syntetic biology and the platform for young individuals to get a chance to try and implement their ideas. We chose these projects because we thought their projects really could contribute to a better world and that this fact would make it easier for the public to see the importance of iGEM.
Harvard (USA)
A collaboration with Harvard iGEM 2017 was initiated during this summer. We helped them design questions around biomanufacturing. Three other teams were also a part of this collaboration. These teams were AQA_Unesp, Aalto-Helsinki and Hamburg. The survey was aimed at people within the general population, academics, industry, pharmaceutical regulation, politics etc. and included question like;
What comes to mind when somebody say biomanufacturing? Do you know what it is?
How acceptable to you is using biomanufacturing to produce cosmetics?
What are the main ways that you see academic research relating to biomanufacturing as different from industrial research related to biomanufacturing?
What do you think you or the government"

Optogenetic tool has broad prospects on synthetic biology, and the CcaS-CcaR system, which is                     developed from cyanobacteria has made obvious achievements, thus more and more teams are                     willing to                     use this system in their own projects. In the past two years, we have spent a great deal of time                     using it in our projects and accumulated a lot of experience (see more information in our previous                     wikis). This year, we collaborated with WHU-China and SDU-CHINA who use this system in their projects and                     sharing the experience how we regulated the expression of CcaS and CcaR protein to control this                     optogenetic tool and what we achieved.
Experience sharing with Worldshaper-Wuhan
We cooperated with the high school team, Worldshaper-Wuhan. We shared some information about our                     project and had several discussions then determined to have an experiment about the lncRNA IL7-AS in multiple cell lines.                     LncRNA IL7-AS is a newly discovered lncRNA, which might be a potential diagnostic biomarker and                     therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma. Through this experiment, firstly, we want to know if                     the IL7-AS has tissue specificity to distinguish between cancer cells and healthy cells or not.                     Secondly, we want to explore its applicability for which this biomarker can be widely utilized to                     detect tumours. The Worldshaper-Wuhan team successfully demonstrated that IL7-AS has specificity and                     universality. There were significant expression differences among 293T (the healthy cell), 769-P                     (the adenocarcinoma cell) and 786-O (the adenocarcinoma cell) cell lines. The expression in 769-P                     and 786-O were higher than that of 293T, showing specificity and universality of IL7-AS. Through our                     team's suggestions and Worldshaper-Wuhan's experiment, their project improved and we also got a new                     biomarker                     and therapeutic target for future projects.

Duesseldorf,2018," with iGEM TU Delft who introduced our postcard project on their Eurasian meetup in Shenzhen, China. A lot of iGEM teams brought their postcards to the meet up.
The first postcards arrived on July 18 from iGEM Taipei, Taiwan. From then on, every day we eagerly waited for the mail to arrive and were often rewarded with packages containing new, beautiful postcards from all over the world.  One time we had to go all the way to the custom service since one team forgot to declare their content. Another time we received an empty package without any postcards! Unfortunately the postcards had fallen out during shipment or delivery. But luckily (!!!) the team had some postcards left which they were able to send to us - and finally they arrived.
After we had received postcards from (almost) every team, we started sorting them, glueing addresses on them and putting them into packages. Each participating team received one stack of postcards from other teams and another stack of various postcards with the addresses of the other teams.
Afterwards each team’s postcards were exchanged with other iGEM-teams so that every team  received postcards from all over the world. The postcards were then shared with people in the neighborhood, during public events etc.

Kobe,2017,"2017, are the first iGEM team from Kobe University. During this summer, we were sometimes at a loss faced with many problems in experiments. However, every time we were, Team Gifu kindly helped us by offering troubleshooting tips for primer design, transformation...etc.
Team Kobe also helped them. As we were already successful in raising funds using crowdfunding at an early stage, we offered tips for successful crowdfunding to them.
On September 9th, we invited Ryo of Team Gifu to Kobe University. We talked over biosafety while looking at the ""iGEM Safety illustration by Alejandra De La Fuente Menathe"". We also discussed the possible biohazard risk that our chassis might cause and important safety rules we should follow in the lab.
At the end of the day, ""pamphlet of tea-making""(by iGEM Team Kobe) was sent to Team Gifu as a token of our friendship. They are going to spread our work!
In October, we also got ""pamphlet of Japanese Sake""(by iGEM Team Gifu). We are going to spread our work too!

Team Kyoto
Team Kyoto was the first iGEM team we contacted. When we decided to establish iGEM team in Kobe University in 2015, They kindly supported our startup by inviting us to Kyoto University and telling some basic knowledge and tips for iGEM competition.
This year, they also helped us by providing us with KELN(Kyoto-team Electronic Lab Note), which helps to write a lab note by converting documents into HTML codes. In fact, we didn’t apply this tool to our lab note directly. However, it gave us an insight to automate conversion of our documents and tables into HTML, and it actually saved time to create our wiki.
As a token of appreciation, we summarized what we had realized while using KELN and sent it as a “Feedback on KELN”. We would be glad if this comment helps to improve KELN more so that it will be more useful for many iGEM teams.
Team Nagahama

During the intermission, we and Nagahama talked freely, and shared activities with each other. Then, Nagahama told us that they were going to make a poster session in Hyper Interdisciplinary Conference , and suggested us that we also participate in this conference. Thankfully, they arranged so that we could make a poster session in the conference.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic"

Istanbul_Tech
This year, Istanbul Tech iGEM proposed a project with the purpose of creating a detection system for illegal methamphetamine-based drugs.  This system is constructed by an anti-METH single chain variable fragment (scFv) attached with fluorescent proteins. They expected to observe the FRET effect induced by the conformational changes in the scFv associated with binding of meth.  In order to do this, they proposed building a DIY spectrophotometer in which a light input shines through a whole-cell biosensor, is detected by a color sensor, is processed by a computer, and emits a different wavelength output induced by ligand binding (FRET).
Because our team had some drylab experience, we were able to help develop this idea. We showed that a cell phone camera could be used instead of a high-quality color sensor to detect color changes.  We also advised the team on arduino programming and the use of photoelectric multipliers.
More on Istanbul Tech’s project can be found on their wiki their wiki .

TU_Delft,2015," team of Groningen print their bacteria. The team of Groningen wanted to create a stable biofilm containing their biofilm-forming bacteria, by using our 3D-printer to improve the biofilm.
Two experiments were therefore designed. The first experiment was printing with the bacteria in alginate in a certain structure. By adding calcium chloride to the alginate, a gel forms with the bacteria encased. By using a plate filled with LB agar, the bacteria would be able to survive and create a biofilm. The team members of Groningen printed with their own bacteria, B.subtilis, in a form of their own choosing. The Groningen team prepared beforehand their own bioink (Sodium alginate+bacteria), calcium chloride and LB agar plates.
.
To make the solution they pasteurized 100 mL of 1%(w/v) sodium alginate with appropriate antibiotic, and autoclaved 100 mL of 0,1M calcium chloride to acquire sterile solutions. The LB agar plates were made using standard protocols. They had grown their bacteria overnight in 5 mL LB with appropriate antibiotic. The overnight culture was then spun down, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was then resuspended in 100µL LB and mixed with 500µL sterile sodium alginate to make the bioink, and transferred into a 1mL syringe  Before printing on the LB agar, 500µL calcium chloride was added to enable formation of the hydrogel.
The Groningen team then proceeded with printing with their self-made bioink. They were able to print on two agar plates, in the form of a house and a flower. They noted that the controls of the printer,  weren’t very user friendly, but after a while they got the hang of it. In the end they agreed that the Biolinker was functioning as a 3D printer. .
The second experiment, was measuring the  selectivity of alginate. The membrane should only let sodium ions (Na+) ions pass through to be a selective bio-membrane. Since the previous experiment proved that the 3D-printer was able to print the bacteria in the gel, the next aim was to prove that the printing of a biofilm made of alginate would be selective. The Groningen drew a square on carrier material, on which they printed the alginate in “full color”. The alginate filter was then placed in a self-made voltmeter system, where the filter would separate the fresh from salt water. This separation of salt and fresh was not acquired. This was due to the salt water"
NPU-China,2018," heat-inducible RNA-based     thermosensors onto the pSB1C3 vector, and installed the Anderson promoter J23104 upstream, superfolder GFP (sfGFP)     downstream. The melting temperature of the thermosensors can be determined by measuring the expression level of     sfGPF at different temperatures. They have measured the fluorescence expression intensity of five heat-inducible     RNA-based therosensors (RT1-4, RT1-33, K2541003, K2541004, K2541010). However, the measurement results may vary     under different laboratory and experimental conditions. To ensure the accuracy of their results, we assisted them     in measuring the changes in fluorescence expression intensity of these 5 thermosensors.
Experiment results:
Figure 4. Fluorescence expression intensity of RT1-4,RT1-33,K2541003, K2541004, K2541010
As is illustrated in the above diagram, K2541003, K2541004 and K2541010 are the three groups of fluorescence     expression intensity that increase as the temperature accrues, indicating that these three thermosensors are in the     'on' state at higher temperatures and proving they are indeed Heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensors. The     fluorescence expression density of RT 1-4 and RT 1-33 does not increase with temperature, manifesting that this     sequence is thermosensor, consistent with the previous measurements of Jilin_China.     Protocol:
1. 100 μL of glycerol bacteria (plasmid containing different thermosensors) was cultured for 4-5 hours and Abs was     measured after dilution, guaranteeing the initial Abs was 0.02 and the volume was made up to 8 mL;
2. 100 μL was added to a black 96-well plate, conducting 3 parallel experiments at different temperatures,     measuring Abs and fluorescence used as the data for 0 h;
3. Incubated at 31 ° C, 35 ° C, 39 ° C respectively;
4. Measured Abs and fluorescence after incubation of 4h, 6h, 8h.

Team Chalmers Gothenburg
As a new iGEM team we were searching for other iGEM teams to discuss our ideas and hear their experience. We contacted several teams that worked on projects related to our concept during previous years. We were really excited that all of these teams answer to our e-mails. Eventually, our biggest collaboration  has been with team Chalmers Gothenburg from Sweden.
Like us, team Chalmers Gothenburg is working with yeast mating pheromone pathway. Their project Study in Scarlet is focusing on detection of contamination using yeasts. See their wiki for more information.
We had several Skype meetings and exchanged many friendly and helpful e-mails. Team Chalmers Gothenburg showed deep interest in our simulator CeCe. Therefore, we decided to create a simulation of their contamination detection. See our Software wiki page or Chalmers Simulation wiki page to see this amazing simulation.
Members of Chalmers team also offered us to participate in their Multinational GMO survey. Together we collected 94 survey from general public (50 Czech and 44 Swedish) and 82 from biologist (63 Czech and 19 Swedish). See our Human Practice page and Chalmers Human Practise page for more information. We want to thank to team Chalmers Gothenburg for statistical evaluation of collected data and for providing us the results.

WITH SZU-iGEM
After to last year’s collaboration, this year we had an even stronger collaborating relationship with SZU-iGEM team. At early stage of our project, we encountered some problems in the transformation of B.subtilis strain. SZU-iGEM had previous experience working with Bacillus species , so they set up a meeting to help us with the transformation as well as technical trouble shooting. We did manage to successfully transform our B.subtilis 168 based on their suggestions. In the later stage of protein purification step, SZU also lent a vacuum pump to us to be used in affinity chromatography.
In return, we helped them by sharing our iGEM interlab kits as they ran out some of the key materials in their experiment. By providing silica Beads and Fluorescein Sodium Salt, they were able to finish their Interlab project on time. Additionally, we helped them promoting their Mini Program by sharing the process of our team project on the program and giving them detailed feedback after using it.

WITH Jiangnan_China
This year we formed a collaborating relationship with Jiangnan_China, it is whose first year participating in iGEM competition. We helped them with Wiki construction and technical supports, so that their Wiki is compatible with the required format. Furthermore, we also provided them with a supernova kill switch in a light-controlled gene system, which was an essential part to our last year’s iGEM project. In return, they suggested on a method, Ubbelohde viscometer, which we used to test the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid.

Heifei University of Technology iGEM
Testing of Heifei iGEM’s Software
Our collaboration with Heifei University began in early summer, when they reached out to several iGEM teams asking what software iGEM teams were using in their projects. The Heifei iGEM Team is made of software specialists, who are not very familiar with how synthetic biologist’s research and design genetic constructs. The software they are designing is aimed at helping synthetic biologists. With our team members having biology backgrounds and experience in designing genetic constructs, we decided to test Heifei iGEM’s software and give them our feedback. This helped Heifei to assess how user friendly their software was, and what its usefulness is for synthetic biologists.
We tested their software in October by using it to look up information on parts we were using in our project. The information on genetic parts, and the recommendations the software provided helped us to come up with a design for a kill switch. The ability of their software to narrow down and refine searches was immensely helpful in deciding on a genetic part to use; when there are hundreds to choose from, often scattered in different databases, a tool that can narrow the options down would save time and effort.
We found Heifei iGEM’s software to be very useful, it was significantly easier to have all the genetic parts in one single place; one where we could look at information about one specific part, see relationships between 2 different parts, and receive recommendations for other parts we could use. Using the software to design genetic constructs and research genetic parts would save time and effort. It is faster and easier than having to sift through several different databases to find genetic parts. Furthermore, the software provided not just a DNA sequence, but recommended similar parts, provided a description of the part, and showed us papers with more information on the genetic part.
Wiki, Poster, and Presentation Collaboration
To help overcome the language barrier that many non-native English speaking iGEM teams face, our team offered to help Heifei’s iGEM team with writing and editing their"
Cornell,2018," retain it. However, they found issues with the quality of the kit. The magnets placed on the back were not large or strong enough, so the plasmid pieces fell off the board often. Also, the color scheme was a bit confusing. The restriction sites were different colors in order to indicate that they were different, but students seemed to think that only all the colors had to match -- the pink gene belonged with the pink restriction site.
In order to address these issues, more magnets could be placed on the back of each piece. As for the colors, better instructions could be written regarding the coloration or different shades of each color could be used to represent the different sites.
Florida State University also gave us many suggestions for improvements of the kit. The admired the aesthetics and bright colors of the different parts of the plasmid, and found that its maneuverability made it effective in teaching young scientists the value of synthetic biology, and surprisingly, in communicating certain concepts to experienced experts in fields of life sciences. We saw the usefulness of our plasmid kit not just as a flexible educational tool, but also as a icebreaker for communication many different groups of people. They had constructive feedback on how we needed to clarify the instructions manual that accompanied the kit, as it was not clear at first how the magnets should be oriented and the plasmid kit assembled at first glance. We were overjoyed when we heard that FSU iGEM ran with our kit, building on it with their own innovative educational ideas.
We plan to use the feedback we’ve collected from our friends at Rice University iGEM and Florida State University iGEM to improve and expand our plasmid kit for the future. We’ve already begun to incorporate some of the feedback we’ve gotten from other teams such as including stronger magnets and clearer instructions. When we began this project, the goal wasn’t to build a tool and use it for a year; rather, we plan to perfect the model to maximize learning outcomes. Our collaborations with Rice and Florida State allowed us to expand the scope of our outreach and public engagement. As scientists, the burden falls on us to not only make great innovations now, but also enable a future where great innovations can continue to happen. We believe education is key, and that our plasmid kit is a powerful tool in helping us to accomplish that mission. Here is the drawing for the plasmid kit’s final assembly, so that anyone can access and use it to make their very own kits!

University of Florida
Our primary collaboration was with the University of Florida iGEM team. UF first contacted our team to invite us to a Florida iGEM social they hosted in July. The event was held at the molecular biology building of UF where we presented our projects to each other and further discussed plans for a meaningful collaboration. The event ended with a social gathering of both teams at Lake Wauburg, consisting of team building activities and a picnic lunch. Our team then invited UF's team to a workshop we hosted in September. The workshop was held at the FSU College of Medicine, where we collectively built the design specifications for their system and provided constructive feedback on various facets of our projects. We also mentored UF through the development of their wiki.

Cornell's iGEM team initially contacted us to discuss whether our project of activating bacteria with sound could provide insight to their frequency based biological band-pass filter. The discussions continued throughout the summer as our projects developed, consisting of research literature and experimental methods analysis as well as feedback on our overall projects. Cornell eventually sent us an educational plasmid kit they were using to introduce young students to the field of synthetic biology. We provided feedback on our experience using the educational kit for Cornell to further develop their educational kit.

After the meetup, we kept close contacts with other teams and shared project updates or experience throughout the preparation for iGEM. The collegiate teams provided valuable resources for our projects and practical advice on the development of WEiGEM2.0.
CONFERENCE OF CHINA iGEMER'S COMMITTEE
The CCiC was held in Peking University from August 14th to 15th, hosted by School of Life Science in Peking University. It was wonderful opportunity for iGEMers in China to gather together and strengthen the bonds among Chinese iGEM community. The participants include 30 undergraduate teams and 2 high school teams. As one of the three high school participating teams in CCiC, it was an great chance for SKLBC_CHINA to practice for public presentation before the Giant Jamboree and learn more about synthetic biology through other teams' projects. In spite of the presentation, various lectures from ex-iGEMers gave us insprirations on the possible developments of synthetic biology in the future.
Collaborations With Other Teams
This is our second year participating the iGEM competition, although we have acquired the Best Software in High School track last year, there are still a lot things that we haven’t done pretty well. Luckily, this year, we found help from TJU iGEM 2015. They initiate a Handbook program for assistance where other team can get access to the overall necessary information about the competition through such book. Particularly, several pieces of excellent work done by other teams are included in the Handbook, hence we are able to learn from the best projects and make ourselves better this year. Besides, we can get more acquainted with the knowledge of synthetic biology like how to obtain the target genes or how to extract plasmid. This helps us balance our shortcomings and advantages, and we hope that we can get a preferable result this year.
At the beginning of August, we were invited by SCUT_CHINA to visit their laboratory and completed several experiments in their lab with their assistence, advancing our understanding of wet team's works and laboratory protocols.
In order to fulfill the demand of users of WEiGEM2.0, we further developed the syncing function of marked biobricks between PC and mobile phone by scanning QR codes along with SKLBC_GDSYZX .

5.OUC-China & BNU-China
How to promote synthetic biology knowledge for the public has always been an important proposition of human practice of the iGEM team. Popular science comics is undoubtedly a very popular carrier to promote synthetic biology. The science comics created by OUC-China are vivid and interesting. Our team just needs an attractive carrier to carry out the next promotion and publicize synthetic biology. So our two teams have cooperated here, OUC-China has provided us with a full set of popular science comics, and we are responsible for promoting comics, we have done the following work:
(1)Use popular science comics to popularize the propaganda;
(2)Use science comics to attract everyone's attention when holding outfields;
(3) Promote comics on the official Weibo of Beijing Normal University.
In the end, OUC-China's popular science comics were well received by everyone, and the official Weibo was read by more than 20,000 people. We believe that this approach greatly enhances the public's awareness of synthetic biology. Their corresponding page can be accessed here"" Team:OUC-China/Collaborations

iGEM Chalmers Gothenburg
We helped the Chalmers Gothenburg team with their initial steps of model building. The description below illustrates the model that was built by the Manchester iGEM team, which got the Chalmers team started. Any edits and changes beyond this were solely the work of the Chalmers Gothenburg team, such as finding of parameters for the equations. We also discussed our method of obtaining accurate descriptions of plausible parameter values for ensemble modelling, but this aspect was not incorporated in the final model, due to time constraints.
The final model used by Chalmers Gothenburg can be seen here
The model consists of two organisms in co-culture, each dependant on one another for an essential substrate, i.e. without one the other would be unable to survive. The model predicts the growth of the two organisms as well as the concentration acetate which is the main product of the system.
The system was modelled using the following differential equations:
Substrate-limited specific cell growth (Monod equation) : $$r_g =  x_v \mu_{max} \frac{S}{K_s + S}$$
Cell death. First order with respect to viable cell concentration: $$r_d = k_d x_v$$
Product formation (Luedeking–Piret equation). Product produced  in cell growth and in cell maintenance: $$r_p = \alpha r_g +\beta x_v $$  $$x_v = \int r_x dt \qquad , \text{ where } r_x = r_g - r_v$$
The substrate uptake:  $$r_s = r_{s_x} + r_{s_p} + r_{s_m}$$  that is, the sum of rate of substrate utilisation in cell synthesis, maintenance and product formation
A MATLAB script was produced to solve the system of equations.

Future iGEM Team of the ""Westfälische Hochschule""
Quite at the start of our project, we were contacted by a group of students and their professor from the college from Recklinghausen. They are considering to participate in iGEM 2016 and had a lot of questions on how to build up an iGEM Team and manage an iGEM project. We were glad to welcome them in Aachen and answer all of their questions regarding BioBricks, judging and project organization. We hope that they will become part of iGEM next year and wish them all the best!
The students from Recklinghausen were accompanied by a supporting and potential future instructor Dr. Frank Eiden. Later that year Dr. Eiden was attending the same SynBio Symposium as our team. We took the chance to get some feedback on our project and won him over for an interview on Community Labs . We also met him at the Maker Faire and had an interessting discussion about synthetic biology and our prototype.

2.1 Guiding XJTU-China
XJTU-China is participating in iGEM for the first time this year. As the first team to participate in iGEM in     Shaanxi Province, we were invited to Xi'an Jiaotong University to accord them with guidance and experience sharing.
As follows what we have shared during the exchange are listed:
label Our understanding and analysis of iGEM.
label 2016 and 2017 projects of our team and the competition planning for 2018.
label Entry experience and precautions.
label Team operation mode.
The participation of iGEM for two years has rendered it clear for us to understand what iGEM is about and what iGEM     entails us to do. By sharing our comprehension of iGEM, we believe that XJTU-China will be able to suit the     competition much faster. We gave them a reference for this year's competition by sharing our previous two-year     entries and this year's plan. We summed up the lessons learned from the past two years’ preparations and some easy     mistakes for them, hoping that they will take fewer detours. Funding has always been a headache for most teams     participating in iGEM. We shared with them how our team works to save as much money as possible and get more     funding.
In the later discussion, we:
label Answered their questions about participation and registration.
label Talked over the idea of their project in the preliminary stage and put forward     our suggestions.
label Gave advice on scheduling and personnel management.
XJTU-China also made some suggestions for our project and planning this year.
Afterwards, our two teams also invited NWU-China to co-establish a WeChat group hence more close exchanges and     cooperation in the future.

Collaborations Overview
We are a new iGEM team, located on the other side of the world. Hence, our goals for collaboration are different to that of many teams.
We want to become a part of this international community and so have spent our time this year building our networks. We have collaborated with Australian iGEM teams in an attempt to strengthen the network of teams in Oceania.
Kiwi’s have a view that we can solve problems with a bit of number 8 wire. This serves as a cultural metaphor that we work with the tools we have access to.
We hope that future Kiwi teams can build on the relationships we have made and put New Zealand on the map as a center of innovation in the world of student lead synthetic biology.
Fig1. shows some Number 8 wire, a New Zealand lexical reference. It serves as a metaphor for the way we at SECA NZ have aimed to form meaningful connections with iGEM teams around the world.
NTHU iGEM, Taiwan
This year we, SECA NZ, collaborated with the NTHU iGEM team in the exchange of international viewpoints and software. NTHU is developing an ingenious system to monitor and adjust the level of contaminants in irrigation drains using copper filters and watergates. The filter cleans the water, and a complex set of sensors monitors the output. If the level of contaminants exceeds the capacity of the filter, the water gate will reduce the flow to a manageable level. They are also investigating the water quality in aquaculture.
New Zealand’s economy is largely based on                 agriculture and fishery industries, and so as a team we participated in a questionnaire to assess our opinions on aquaculture and water quality in the agriculture industry.
Fig2. shows some of our collaboration with NTHU Taiwan.
This provided NTHU with both an international and consumer perspective on the issue.  Our own project focuses on the development of crop plants capable of surviving snap frosts. NTHU contributed to our project by graciously providing software and specifications on how to build a temperature sensor which would allow us to monitor the temperatures of cropping land.

As for human practice, we believe it is important to discuss the strategic field of their social studies. We explained about how to specify the social study within iGEM project that deals in various sectors. Because of their team’s project runs in the energy track and energy, especially renewable energy, itself is a heated issue in Indonesia, we believe it’s necessary for them to specify which area of topics that brings their project into a highlight as Indonesia itself is very heterogenous in structure of society and very dynamic in term of political and economical condition.
Mentoring New iGEM Team: Fundraising and How to Integrate It in HP Works [Left: Supriadi (HP UI iGEM 2016), Right: Faustina Prima Martha (HP iGEM IGN Bioscience 2017)]
Furthermore, we did not only giving mentorship to a new team but also to a future synthetic biology community! One of iGEM IGN team member, Evan from ITS, stated that he comes from university which has no study club that focus in synthetic biology, thus he’s interested in our synthetic biology community, Universitas Indonesia Synthetic Biology Club (www.uisynbio.com). Our synthetic biology community has consistently spread awareness and has educated through synthetic biology class not only for students in our campus, but also other campus to learn and discuss about topics related to synthetic biology. Our iGEM teams for the past four years are born within this community, so it’s very exciting for us to also explain how our community started and run independently by students. Luckily, one of our iGEM team member, Aulia (Human Practice member), was once a treasurer for a second year UI Synbio Club founded, so we believe her hands-on experiences in dealing with funding and managing synthetic biology community would help Evan and his friends to start their own synthetic biology community in their campus.

XMU-China,2016," the best practices in their own experiments providing information on appropriate pH, temperature, and inoculation ratios among other data. To help them check the data from their software, the XMU team used xxxx and accompanied software to measure bacterial quantity and OD600. We designed our co-culture plan to inspect the impact of pH and salinity. The goal of the collaboration is to get the microbial growth curve in different salinity and different pH. We sent our data back to Imperial to analysis.
BGU_ISRAEL
The XMU-China also collaborated with BGU_ISRAEL to provide them the background of current solutions for plastic waste in China. They aimed to provide a more eco-friendly way to degrade PET in the aspect of synthetic biology. And to show the advantages of the new method, they want to see the traditional solutions to the plastic. So we would tell them some information about how we deal with plastic, to help them go further in their project. Also, we investigate public’s attitude towards the issue.
Questionnaire
We tried to connect with more teams, and we found it an efficient way to understand a project by questionnaire. So we spread many questionnaires from other teams like LMU-TUM_Munich , Paris_Saclay , Virginia and Evry . iGEM Peshawar spread our survey which was found in the Newsletter by them. They used their contacts and social media platforms to reach out to more people. Their effort helped us to collect the foreign response. As return for our helpful work, Paris_Saclay, Virginia and Evry gave their badges:
We also appreciate it that Cornell_NY gave us great assistance in giving away our questionnaire.
Lanzhou
We helped them test their system providing them with TEM image of the bacteria. If their system works, there will be an apparent metal ion peak and protein peak in TEM image, which means their project can really deal with the mercury ion in the media. Otherwise, the system needs to be improved. As return, Lanzhou helped us to construct a BioBrick, BBa_K1960450 . Somehow we failed to finish this part. During the communication between us, Lanzhou was so warm-hearted to offer assistance to us. The BioBrick from them helped us a lot.
Translation
We collaborated with others not only in project but also in human practice. To assist other teams with their human practice, we played out our Chinese-speaking advantages to provide dome translation. We helped METU HS Ankara translate iGEM experiment protocols into Chinese. Besides, we contributed the spread of surveys of Exeter , Pasteur_Paris and"
TJU,2015,"FC‘s anode was added with Cu2+ from the very begging (0 min), and their voltage (with BL21-K1755301) was also documented.
Figure 5. The voltage of MFC with K1755301 (Room temp 25 ℃)
The results above show a significant difference of the voltage output at around 120 min. After 240 min, the voltage output became closer. So, the Cu2+ sensing part proves to be functional.
We can see that the E.coli, modified by the part they constructed can sense the concentration of Cu ions in different labs normally.  The data shows typically consistent.This also indicates the biological component of LZU-China’s “Micro saHolmes” measurement system has nice accessibility and portability.(Table-1)

Postcards
We joined many iGEM teams around the globe, led by the Cologne-Duesseldorf team, to create postcards that highlight synthetic biology and then distribute the postcards in our respective communities. Here is the front and back of our postcard:
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki
Experiment / Modelling / Survey
We conducted experiments to data feed their quorum sensing model. OD measurements over 9 and 12 hrs, 10 min intervals,               of colonies carrying our quorum sensing plasmid. We also received answers for our surveys concerning bacteria               mediated cancer therapies, from both patients and field specialists.
Stony Brook University
Survey
While new treatments can be very powerful, the ability of treatments to impact patients heavily relies on the willingness of patients to embrace them. To assess how well patients will receive the treatments developed by Columbia iGEM and Stony Brook iGEM, the two teams have joined forces to create a survey that targets patient reception of bacteria-mediated treatment and antimicrobial peptides. Columbia iGEM created the backbone of the survey and Stony Brook iGEM revised it and added their own section. Stony Brook iGEM collected most of the survey participant data. We aimed for a stratified random sample of participants, specifically targeting the younger generation as well as middle-aged and older people. The statistical analysis of the results of this survey will provide insight upon patient reception of the treatments developed by the two teams.

Collaboration
In our collaboration with Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (FAFU), we helped them develop a mathematical model of the PSB-assisted phytoextraction process to verify the validity of the new technology in real life application. Their corresponding page can be accessed here . We also produced the structural images of some key proteins for them. The corresponding page of FAFU can be accessed here .
Because of the polarity of microtubule, the two kinds of monomer we display on the yeast may lead to different experiment results, so we decided to display the both monomers onto the yeast, one of which was helped by our collaborators. Besides, we need to see the effect of mGFP on our tubulins, FAFU also take part in the work.
BNU:Modeling
Overview
Heavy metal pollution of the soil is plaguing vast areas of lands across the world. In a process called phytoextraction, hyperaccumulator plants can extract the heavy metals in the soil and gradually make the soil return to its natural conditions. An existing method to accelerate this process is to apply phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) to the soil around the plant. These kinds of bacteria can produce organic acid and release heavy metals from their insoluble states in order for hyperaccumulator plants to better absorb them. However, the growth process of these plants are typically inhibited by high concentrations of heavy metals, which results in low biomass, decelerating the phytoextraction process.
The FAFU team aims to engineer bacillus megaterium, a type of PSB, to produce heavy-metal-binding proteins to counter the downside of its phosphate-solubilizing effect by lowering the concentration of free heavy metal ions in the soil. This modification can promote the accumulation of hyperaccumulator plants’ biomass, which, as mentioned above, will accelerate the phytoextration process.
Different from lab conditions, this process is far more complicated in real-life application in the soil. To help our FAFU collaborators examine the feasibility of their design, we developed a mathematical model to describe and simulate this process.
Model Formulation
Our main focus is to examine whether the designed system can effectively lower the concentration"

Introduction
The ability to collaborate is essential in a scientific field such cross-sectional as synthetic biology. Our team has collaborated with other iGEM teams in numerous ways as described below.
Helping a new team get on track
We sent our own interlab strain to the Lund iGEM team to help them complete their interlab study,as they experienced some issues with transforming cells with the interlab devices themselves. In doing so, we made sure to abide by all the regional regulations on transporting GMO between borders.
A global problem needs global outreach
In order for a Northern European team like us to do a project that focuses on a tropical disease like snake envenomings, it is not sufficient to merely get inputs from experts within our own region. In our efforts to reach out and engage with health professionals from around the world, we got a lot of  help by Amazonas Brazil and the AshesiGhana teams. They have all helped us to get into contact with professors and doctors from their region with experience in researching and treating snake envenomings. This has led us to get feedback on our project from all major areas of the world that are affected by snake envenomings.
Ethics
We have participated in an ethic discussion hosted by team Uppsala, with attendance from other iGEM teams from Bielefeld-CeBiTec, Grenoble-Alpes, Wageningen UR, and Technion-Israel. We discussed the responsibility that scientists have to present their results in a proper way, while at the same time maintaining the interest of the public.
The Danish iGEM teams
The Danish iGEM teams in general have done a lot to help each other’s projects. In addition to hosting events for each other, as stated below, we have helped each other out with general feedback and advice throughout the project period.
Events
As part of our efforts to collaborate with other iGEM teams, we have attended and hosted a range of different events throughout the year.
5th annual BioBrick tutorial
This year, the DTU Biobuilders hosted the 5th BioBrick tutorial from the 10th-12th of March. SDU-Denmark, UCopenhagen, Chalmers-Gothenburg, and UiOslo_Norway participated in the tutorial.  The BioBrick Workshop is an initiative to educate iGEM team members with the basic lab competences required to perform a synthetic biology project as ambitious as iGEM. It also provided an opportunity to introduce"

Aachen,2017," These challenges range from the design stage to the finished product and its      application by customers. Professor Sloten emphasised that personalised medicine might be expensive but can improve the lives of all of us in the future.
After a short break, we were ready to have our talks, starting with Team Leuven and their idea to use pulsating cells as biosensors for drug monitoring.
Next was Team Munich with their novel way of using CRISPR Cas13a as a biosensor to diagnose a range of infectious diseases.
Team Paris IONIS presented us their very hands-on (and also very French) approach to protect vineyards from extreme weather conditions caused by global warming. In addition, they assured      us that their project is also adaptable to other crops and vegetables.
The team from Amsterdam had an interesting talk about their modification of cyanobacteria to have an improved day and night cycle and engineering it to be able to produce fumarate,      an important bulk chemical. Their “super cyanobacterium” will be able to use CO2 as its sole carbon source to reduce and even reverse the oil industries impact on the environment.
Last but not least, we listened to the very inspiring presentation of iGEM Leuven`s PI Johan Swinnen, who explained what it means to be a scientist from his personal live as a      cancer researcher. On his long journey to Santiago de Compostela he raised awareness and funds for victims of cancer.
After a plentiful dinner and short poster session with valuable feedback about our talks and posters from the other attending teams we were ready to go back home.

Therefore, during the summit of domestic igem teams held by Beijing University, we seized the opportunity to publicize our iShare platform  and surveyed the its popularity among iGEM teams. Our goal was to gain their support and information as much as possible. Excitingly, this platform was supported by most present teams and we exactly got much information and advice, which give us much confidence and encouragement to further construct ishare!

1. Technical collaboration with Team IONIS-Paris
We met up with Nicolas, a member of Team IONIS-Paris at TokyoTech in July. In the meetup, he gave us a presentation about the project. In the presentation, it turned out that they need a temperture-selective promoter which we used last year, so we decided to offer them a Biobrick part (BBa_K1949001: Pcold-gfp).
Instead of offering a BioBrick part, they, Team IONIS-Paris gave us advice about modelling. In particular, we wanted to know folding speeds of proteins that appear in our project. The modelling section in Team IONIS-Paris is familiar with PHYRE2 (Protein Fold Recognition Server), and they calculated all the folding speeds on it and gave us the results. The consultation was really helpful for us to predict the production rate of target protein and drew on the advice when we set parameters in our model.

2. Mentoring Team ASIJ Tokyo
Our team mentored Team ASIJ Tokyo when we met up on September 23rd. Team ASIJ Tokyo is a very young team and it's the second time to participate in iGEM competition. Most of the team members are not familiar with scientific research and iGEM culture, so we gave them advice about the modeling of the data and the improvement of their qualitative analysis, as well as guidance for how to best represent their project motivations and research.

Aalto-Helsinki
Erwinions had the opportunity to do a great and productive collaboration with the Aalto Helsinki Team. Our first start with them was when one of our team members, Alejandra Ogaz Ramos, was in Helsinki, Finland, and so the collaboration was in person. Since she was there, she had a conference with the team to discuss the ways both teams could have helped each other on their projects. During the conference, our team discovered that European Union legislation would not help us with our project because mostly in all EU the transgenic food is prohibited.
Nevertheless, our team member went to the Aalto University on the 26 of July of the present year to help the other team members with a sample collection of sweat for their project.  The Helsinki´s team wanted to extract different types of sweat so they could run exams on them and determine the characteristics of the human sweat and if the place and climate influenced on the sweat production.
As a matter of fact, our member spent a whole afternoon with the team in a sauna in order to obtain samples of the “Mexican sweat” for their lab project. She can tell that it was quite a Finnish experience and that the other team members were very nice. The greatest discovery was that our team member didn’t sweat that much, or at least as the Aalto team would have imagined, definitely because the temperature climate of the Finnish sauna is likely like the normal summer weather in Chihuahua.  So, because of that our member, spent like 3 hours on the sauna and finally could get some little drops of “Mexican sweat”.
The collaboration concluded with an investigation our members did about legal issues on patents for the usage of the antimicrobial peptide dermcidin for skin care, this because the Aalto Helsinki team doesn’t have members specialized on legal aspects, and that was the reason why our Human Practices members helped them. After the meeting with our member in Finland, Aalto team send us patents and"

In iGEM it is all about collaborating! Throughout the summer we have been in contact with multiple iGEM teams from all over the world to improve our projects, benefit from one another's ideas and also because working together is always more fun.
UCL iGEM Bootcamp Mini Jamboree
In collaboration with the London Biohackspace and Birkbeck College, we hosted an intensive, gruelling bootcamp that enlightened the attendees about various biobrick assembly protocols, biohacking, automation, and softwares associated with synthetic biology. The bootcamp culminated in a fascinating mini Jamboree, which featured all our iGEM projects, wiki and modeling tutorials, and even a DIY Spectrophotometer made in 1 week!
London iGEM Meet-up
iGEM teams around London met up on 31st of July at Birkbeck and presented the current progress of their research projects to each other, followed by a poster session and time for socialising. The teams involved were: UCL, Birkbeck, London Biohackspace, Westminster and Kent.
2014 Aalto-Helsinki Team: Blue-Light-Response Element
In order to use our constructs as personalised treatment devices, we collaborated with the Aalto-Helsinki team to use the blue-light-response element they created in 2014. The idea is to have a handheld/mobile device that can emit blue light and induce expression of out constructs when needed.
UCL iGEM 2015 Collaboration survey
This year UCL iGEM team has prepared an ambitious survey to to get the public's perception on synthetic biology, genetic engineering and probiotics. As survey was translated into 5 different languages including Spanish, French, Portuguese and German we have collaborated with iGEM"
BroadRun-NorthernVA,2015," offered them to use the electroporator at BUGSS lab, a piece of equipment not available at Rockridge. We spent over an hour and a half at this iGEM team meetup at Rockridge. Having worked extensively with fruit flies, Marissa gave them advice on how to best care for and test the fruit flies they were using for their project. The latter part of our conversation was geared towards planning for the trip to Boston to attend the Jamboree. Given both teams limited resources, and in the spirit of iGEM, we planned on sharing a single large beach rental property further away from the Convention Center so as to keep our costs low and also to use it as an opportunity to support each other. However, this did not transpire as the Rockridge team’s Jamboree attendee count was uncertain with their fundraising efforts continuing."

International synthetic biology symposium
We hosted an international symposium with home speakers, invited keynote speakers from both academia and industry as                 well as four neighbouring iGEM teams. A debate about the risks, the regulation                 and the ethics connected to synthetic biology, free food and more were part of                 the symposium. Go to our symposium page to find out what we did exactly.
The Toulouse model
During the meetup with the iGEM team of Toulouse where we exchanged experience, we decided on a mutual             cooperation concerning the modeling of our circuits. The Toulouse team made a             Flux Balance Analysis for us to see the effect of the system on the total metabolism of the cell. You can find the model of Toulouse and our interpretation of the results in our modeling section . We also made a model for the Toulouse team. Here, we calculated the diffusion of both produced molecules formic and butyric acid to learn more about the effect on the Varroa destructor in the direct environment of the hive. After simulating their set up, we were able to suggest an improvement to the design of their trap. It currently includes a small tube which impedes the diffusion of the two molecules into the hive. Removing or shortening the tube could improve their design. You can find our model on the Toulouse wiki .
York water samples
We sent water samples from the Dijle river and the water we collected from a                 normal tap inside our building for a comparison study to the York iGEM team. According to their requirements, we filtered both the samples using a                 0.22 μm filter, measured the pH and then mailed the 10 Falcon-tubes with the samples                  to York. We hope the samples served the York team well.
The Aix-Marseille survey
We gathered information with iGEM Aix-Marseille 's on  chewing gum consumption, production and removal in Belgium.                      In return we earned the participation badge shown above.
The French iGEM meetup
We took part in the French iGEM meetup organized by the Bordeaux iGEM team. There we got to know the French iGEM teams. We presented our project in the Cap Sciences convention centre. Afterwards everyone shared lab experience and the group talked about problems we                 have had in the lab and discussed possible solutions."

Collaborations
We collaborated with Judd, Carroll High School, University of Westminster and EPFL. We helped them with a mixture of modeling, and wiki development and they have helped us massively in return - giving us advice, testing our hardware and software, reviewing our guide for high school teams and letting us use their facilities.
Judd School
Judd-UK is the only other UK high school team. Luckily, they’re only a short train journey away.
Their collaborations page mentions us too!
What we did for them
We met near the start of the iGEM cycle and discussed both wiki development and modeling, giving them lots of advice and actionable tips - these are available for all high schools in our high school guide . We helped them derive their differential equations and explained some reaction kinetics.
We later advised them on modeling. We suggested ways of modeling their inducible promoter and advised them on solving differential equations, both analytically and numerically. We also helped them find constants for transcription and translation as they are also using a cell free extract. We checked the matlab code for their final model. Their results validated their model. Take a look at their modeling page for details
At the UK iGEM meetup we gave them ideas about what to do for human practices.
What they did for us
They tested our synthetic biology bot giving us useful feedback including suggesting the team lookup feature, the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), which we implemented. They also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step which we tried to implement but found it"
Nanjing-China,2018," the picture of a cartoon flask. Later, we also downloaded their app, ColorQ, to know more about their thoughts and contributed to the improvement of the app. Both of us had such a whale of a time making labs more appealing to the public.
5.Communication with two iGEM teams
We never missed a chance to communicate. Early  in July, we were contacted by team AHUT requiring the borrow of No.5 plasmid in  the Interlab Kit. We also had a conversation over the protocol and the skills  which contributed to the fulfill of our work. In the summer vacation, we  invited two members of iGEM USTC to our campus and shared with them how our project was marching, so did they with us. All of us had a wonderful and instructive experience during these communications.

Our team was very interested in working with SDU-produced spider silk that would allow us to use classical genetic engineering methods to produce fusion proteins instead of relying on enzymatic conjugation. We on the other hand had a reliant setup for studying BSL-II organisms in our labs and would be able to help characterize SDU’s bactericides on a variety of organisms they wanted to target in their project. And lastly, if our teams actually ended up with finished products we were of course thinking of testing each other's wound dressings.
A More Down-To-Earth Approach
Unfortunately, lab projects do not always proceed as planned and we were forced to focus on putting one of our collaboration ideas into practise - iGEM Stockholm characterizing and testing SDU’s six bactericides: Laterosporulin, Thuricin S, Lacticin Q, Laterosporulin-Thuricin S hybrid, Lacticin Z - Lacticin Q hybrid and Pyocin S
We tested their activity on three different bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae,  all of which are commonly found in wound infections [1] [2] .
The set up for the bactericide tests was fairly simple - different amounts"

We performed a colony PCR and it seemed that we had amplification product,                 YAY.                 So, we happily did the minipreps praying for a good result in the verifying digestion.                 However, when running the gel nothing appeared in it, not even a small band. So that means we had                 nothing                 there and we had to repeat the cloning again.                 This happened at least four times.""

We’re glad to collaborate with team SMS_Shenzhen in both human practice and part characterization this year.
As our team started out to work on our WeChat official platform for human practice promotion, we looked for guidance on how to maintain the site and write interesting articles. Fortunately, we got in contact with team SMS_Shenzhen from Shenzhen High School, and they mentored us on tips to construct attractive social media. We benefited a lot from their advice and help. We also gave team SMS_Shenzhen tips on how to document parts and construct the part wikis and helped them with their part characterizations.

ShanghaitechChina,2016," test their idea,various cancer cell lines were required for the further explorations. However, when they turned to work on the cancer cells, they realized that later cell generations (normally after the fifth generation) could be applied better in the test, but not commercialized cancer cell clones. Additionally, due to the high expense of the cell clone as well as the long time period of the cell culture, it seemed impossible for the team to conducted their further experiments in cancer cells within the time frame necessary. Thankfully, our team just had the hela cell clone (the ninth generation) in stock which was originally prepared for our previous idea for the iGEM competition. Also, benefiting from some of the group members’ professional skills in cell culture, the cell clone demonstrated good viability. In response to the emergency request from the iGEM at JSNU, we very soon prepared the cell samples according to their needs, and sent the materials immediately.
They repeated their experiment among several varieties of cancer cell lines including Hela to see if their project can be realized on these cancer cells. However, The Hela cell seemed to be a little overexpressive of KLF4 that did not fit the situation well. Last but not least, the Hela cell became an indivisible part in their project and gave them new thinking.
Meanwhile, the wiki-design team at JSNU provided us assistance in creating avatars, where they drew a serious of cartoon bacteria characters based on the real photos of our team members. These avatars are plan to be used and will be showed at the Team Session on our wiki page later.

Process
The idea was put forward in 2015 iGEM Asian Conference in NCTU (Hsinchu, Taiwan) at the end of July. The initial team consists of BIT, BIT-China, CGU-Taiwan and CUHK. We found that we can conduct a global survey which can achieve that all of teams can share the data about their own project from different areas. The idea attracted Stockholm’s attention and they brought the teams from Europe and America in at the beginning of August. During August, all the teams made efforts to collect the questionnaires from public and we processed data at the beginning of September. Ultimately, each team can gain the different data from other 10 regions and it’s useful for every project to improve their world-wide adaptability.

Offering equipment and experimental help to BNU-China
In Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance Establishing Conference, we UCAS-China team communicated with many teams. Knowing many teams were bothered by the limitations in equipment using, we expressed our willingness of offering help as possible as we can. Since we had usage permission in using two well-equipped laboratories in Institute of Biophysics, CAS and Institute of Microbiology, CAS, when iGEMers from BNU-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Enzyme-labeled Instrument and Flow Cytometer to monitor the fluorescence emissions of their engineered bacteria, we agreed without hesitation.
Before conducting the experiment, we offered advice on the design of their protocol. We helped to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity of samples in different concentrations simultaneously to evaluate the function of their bacteria. After, we engaged in the analysis of the result. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability. We also mentored them when they came to use the Enzyme-labeled Instrument in Institute of Microbiology, CAS. In addition, we helped prepare the samples for flow cytometry, enabling them to get more precise data. See their result!"

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gomp"
NTNU_Trondheim,2017,"). The plates were grown overnight. The resulting plates are shown                 in the picture below, and all results are also shown at Team UiOslo Norway's wiki at the results page .
Plates from the UiOslo iGEM teams characterization of our biobrick.
There were significant differences between the number of colonies formed in plates with cells and medium                 that were preincubated with 20 mM arabinose and plates with cells and medium that were preincubated with                 20 mM glucose.                 All plates containing Arabinose (MP6 inducer) had a higher number of colonies than the plates containing                 Glucose (MP6 repressor).
MP6 induces mutations in the control plasmid pLA230, which originally contains a non-functional                 Ampicillin resistance gene due to one point mutation. If the point mutation is reversed, this leads                 to the cells gaining Ampicillin resistance. When grown on agra plates with Ampicillin, only cells that                 got this point mutation reversed will be able to grow. The number of colonies on the plates, is therefore                 an indirect measure of the mutation activity of MP6.
The results from the UiOslo iGEM team therefore confirmed that the biobrick works as expectated:                 it has a high mutational activity if induced by arabinose, and a lower mutatinal activity if repressed                 by glucose. Their results also confirmed that our biobrick can be used in E. coli Top10, which is a                 different strain than we used. The numbers of colonies in the UiOslo teams experiments were of a higher                 range than in our experiment, making it more difficult to count. This might be due to small procedural                 differences, or it may indicate that the protocol for the test needs to be adjusted when using a different                 strain than E. coli DH5α.
Thank you!
We want to thank team UiOslo for the collaboration and a wonderful time at the ""Mini Jamboree"".                 We are looking forward to meet again at the Giant Jamboree in Boston!

Fostering relationships within their synthetic biology community is  a crucial component to the iGEM journey. By collaborating with other teams, we were able to aid our peers across the world while getting to know them a little better. Team VesiCure collaborated with iGEM teams by answering surveys, exchanging protocols, planning experiments and participating in an international effort to spread awareness and make synthetic biology more popular.
Oxford University collaboration
The University of Oxford iGEM team also spent the summer working with outer membrane vesicles and constructing fusion proteins. By Skyping with their team, we had the opportunity to discuss different OMV purification protocols and exchange ideas about mathematical modeling translocation pathways, protein size considerations for export and periplasmic targeting.
UIUC Collaboration
In our project we have used signal sequences to direct a large protein (saCas9) to the bacterial periplasm. We have used Gibson assembly multiple times to switch between different signal sequences. UIUC is working on developing a cheaper, but equally effective, Gibson assembly method. We collaborated with UIUC and prepared a cloning experiment swapping signal sequences to test their new protocol.
Postcard campaign
Our team also participated in an international effort to make synthetic biology more popular by exchanging postcards with different teams. We received hundreds of postcards from the US and Europe, which we shared with the Synthetic biology club at Northwestern (GeneMods) and used to decorate our lab space. Our very own postcard can be seen below. Thanks Cologne Duesseldorf for this great initiative!"
