United Kingdom: Manchester and Oxford Teams
We have collaborated with the Manchester Team on creating a document about GMOs legislation in different countries. In this document we covered things like the laws regarding the work with GMOs, commercialization, governmental institutions responsible for biosafety and the legal requirements use GMOs in your business. The teams Virginia (EUA) , Macquarie (Australia) , Botchan_Lab_Tokyo (Japan) , UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB (Chile) , ITB_Indonesia (Indonesia) , KUAS_Korea (South Korea) , IIT_Delhi (India) and UAlberta (Canada) were also partners in this collaboration.
In this collaboration, we aimed at creating a document that would illustrate that very depth and diversity of law. For this reason, the first issue we discussed is law-related politics, the second its bureaucracy, third law’s impact on business, fourth on science and finally on consumer behaviour.
This collaboration was very useful for us to understand the laws in our country as the research we undertook made us realize the complexity of Brazilian legislations regarding GMOs used for therapeutical reasons and the importance of the work we have been doing. Our project is to develop a new treatment for type 1 diabetes using a genetically engineered probiotic bacteria, which means that to this project became a real product someday, it would have to go under several safety assessments and approved to be used in humans.
Over this year, as we worked in our project, we were always worried about the legal requirements for a GMO like ours become a real product and how biosafety laws affect and guide the development of new GMOs. This document was very useful to us to research and understand the laws of our country, and also other countries, the steps that we would have to take"

Istanbul_Tech,2016," are graduated from university or are university students.
Also, both of participants are studying on engineering; especially Swedish ones. (Probably, Turkey is facing GMO foods much more than Sweden. So, it leads to having more people who are studying in different areas heard GMO at least once.)
Almost all the participants from Turkey and Sweden know what GMO stands for, Turkish population get to know this abbreviation from TV news mostly.
Interestingly, Swedish participants have a positive opinion about GMO, while Turkish participants have negative opinion on GMO. Actually it may be related with the education level in Turkey and also advertisements about GMO. Most of the Turkish people do not know that insulin also includes GMO idea while it is really useful for example. And this lack of knowledge that GMO’s help us in the field of medicine is stem from education problems in Turkey. They mostly know the GMO in foods and they think GMO products leads to cancer so they think GMO is a really bad thing which makes most of the people cancer.
Swedish participants mostly use education as a source of information on GMO, while Turkish participants are using scientific publications. So, it may be related with the education system differences between these two countries.  Turkish education system is not that good as Swedish one, so people must search for scientific publication to get to know more about GMO in Turkey.
Also, most Swedish participants think that these information sources on GMO are sufficient, while Turkish participants think similar but not that much as Swedish participants. It may be related with the question above. Swedish people are educated already about GMO but Turks are not so they do not think the information that they gained from scientific publications are as sufficient as Swedish people.
Economy of Turkey depends on agriculture substantially so interference of agricultural field engage attention of citizens. According to Turkish participants, GMO is quite similar as hormone-injected food and it causes unnatural diseases that are based on chemicals. Thus, Turkish participants might think that Fruit juice may have lots of GMO products. Also almost all Turkish ones prefer to label GMO product because of that reason. GMO production is not included in the Turkish education system. Maybe this issue should be given more space in textbooks.

UCAS,2017," defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and"

Bristol BSim Modeling
Having met some members of the Bristol team at Newcastle's iGEM workshop earlier in the summer, we became interested in each other's project, and especially in Bristol's BSim Modeling software. From that point onwards, we decided to set up a collaboration between the two teams. We can conclude that it was a successful, win-win collaboration in every aspect.
BCCS-Bristol and in particular Neeraj Oak and Tom Todd, were in very close collaboration with our Modelling & Medals Criteria Champion Elena Pallari, for the establishment of a fruitful co-operation. This multidisciplinary collaboration between team members of both teams emphasises the spirit of iGEM 2010. The model did work with some amazing video simulations of our genetic circuit based on the mathematical equations using the BSim software.

Groningen,2016," genomic sequence of B. subtilis and E.     coli to potentially increase the     stability. It is followed by the sequence of the TetR system: a     quad-part inverter based on tetracycline that inverts the signal     since both riboswitches stop gene expression upon binding their     respective metabolite. The TetR QPI inverter reverses this process     and cause protein expression when the riboswitches have bound the     ligand of interest. This is the desired outcome in the overarching     project: a V. destructor sensing bacteria would ideally start with     the production of a toxin in presence of the mite. Instead of a     toxin, mRFP is used as a reporter gene.
iGEM Wageningen 2016 sent us these two BioBricks ( BBa_K1913011 and BBa_K1913012 )  they constructed, one to detect guanine and one     for vitamin B12. We helped them to show that the RFP expression is     controlled by the concentration of either vitamin B12 or guanine.     We could show an increasing RFP signal with increasing      concentration of vitamin B12 and guanine using a photometric     measurement with the plate reader (see protocol below). We also took     pictures of the cells at the microscope with and without vitamin     B12 or guanine.
Figure 3. BioBricks from Wageningen safely arrived      in Groningen and happily grow on our agar plates.

Provide 175 μl LB and  25 μl of the     appropriate concentration of guanine or vitamin B12. Dilute cells     to an OD600 of 0.5 with LB and add 50 μl of this dilutions to each     well. To measure the fluorescence the excitation and emission of     mRFP was set on 584 nm and 607 nm, respectively, with a bandwidth     of 5 nm. The absorbance was measured at 600 nm. Measurements were     taken every 20 min at 37°C with the plate reader (Varioskan LUX     Reader, Thermo Fischer). The results can be seen in Figure 5 and     6.

Determining HMF stress responses for iGEM Bordeaux
iGEM team Bordeaux saw an opportunity to collaborate with us when they found out through our social media coverage that our project involved the           detection of bacterial           cell stress.           iGEM Bordeauxs project is about producing a bacterial strain that transforms hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)           to furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). iGEM Bordeaux uses HMF in their project as an intermediate               to create FDCA HMF is a byproduct of the degradation of cellulose or other polysaccharides and is known to be toxic to bacteria. FCDA is a platform molecule that can be polymerized in plastics or biofuels.           Because HMF is a known toxin, iGEM Bordeaux suggested it would be interesting for us to test this on our bacterial stress detection system, and we wholeheartedly agreed.
Following a skype session to discuss the details of our collaboration, Bordeaux send us 2mL of solution containing 5 g/L HMF. This allowed us to test the compound at various concentrations on four of our stress detection strains: DnaK is involved in               the process of chromosomal DNA replication[1][2]. Read more about pDnaK on its iGEM registry page pDnaK, RpoE               has been shown to seemingly be involved in the exocytoplasmic stress response. Read more about pRpoE on its iGEM registry page pRpoE, pSoxS has been found to be involved in the superoxide pathway and responds to DNA damage. Read more about pSoxS on its iGEM registry page pSoxS and CspA is involved in cold-shock stress pathways. Furthermore, it is known that the transcription of the CspA-promoter can be               abolished almost               completely by the use of rifampicin or nalidixic acid[3].

1.Nanjing-China
This year we are cooperating with team SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. We come up with an idea of combining the two projects to achieve a win-win goal, which is to desalinate sea water with a high concentration of heavy metal. They are engineering with blue algea which can desalinate sea water while we work with engineered B. subtilis which can adsorb lead, gold and uranyl selectively. We also sent them our cell adhesion materials in case they need to separate blue algea from sea water. They have been trying to utilize the material to optimize their project.
Fig 1. Cell adhesion materials. 1. First generation plastic pellet 2. Second generation plastic pellet 3. Cyclic fiberfill 4. Chain-like fiberfill
Firstly, as is known, different organisms live under diverse conditions. Therefore the first problem that we meet with is related to the living conditions of our chassis. Can our engineered B. subtilis survive in sea water? Can their blue algea survive in aquatic environment with high solution of heavy metal? Only if we solve the two obstacles can we cooperate with each other smoothly. So we decided to do some tests to confirm whether they can survive simultaneously in sea water with heavy metal. We planned to select microorganisms that meet the collaboration requirement. Unfortunately, the microorganisms used in our project were both chosen. It could be unpredictable if we had tried to modify them. Thus we had to change our plan.
After many rounds of discussion, we found that places such as estuaries could provide the two organisms with required environment. So we finally decided to desalinate polluted sea water step by step. Sea water with high concentration of heavy metal go through our purification device first so that heavy metal contaminants can be adsorbed. Next, blue algea functions to desalinate the sea water. The advantage of our idea is that we only need to make sure that our engineered B. subtilis can survive in sea water while the low efficiency problem is also inevitable.
We have been collaborating with each other since early July and the collaboration is still going on. We sincerely hope that our win-win goal can be achieved some day. Because we have found that almost all desalination technologies encounter the problem of sediments which contained a variety of heavy metal such as lead. The combination of our two teams not only identified the significance of"

Collaboration always plays an important role in iGEM. As a new iGEM team, we focused mainly on our experiment. While the rules of iGEM was so complicated that we felt quite difficult to put our hand on the project. Luckily, when we met obstacles and setbacks and we had been seeking advice from 3 teams.
We invited NUDT-China that has participated in iGEM many times to our school for discussion. We held a meeting to exchange our experiences. During the meeting, NUDT-China introduced the iGEM process, and shared their experience in team building in detail with us. At the same time, they gave comments on our project, and put forward a lot of good ideas.  We keep in contact with Fudan-China which has participated in iGEM since 2013. Meanwhile, we visited their lab and studio. From the visit, we learned the importance of clinical regulation. The TMMU-China introduced to us some details about the iGEM and we visited their lab in this summer. The technique problems were solved by their advice and experience.
On the other hand, we joined CCIC for the first time. CCIC(Conference of China iGEMer Community)，as one of the best communication platforms for iGEMers in China, has gone through its fifth birthday. During the meeting, we listened to a few lectures given by masters in synthetic biology. The different views of the masters on synthetic biology inspired us to look into the problem we met in our research in another way.

How They Helped Us?
UI_Indonesia helped us greatly in our human practice, for both the outreach and the feedback garnering of our social study.  As a part of our study about public’s opinion regarding gene therapy, they helped us to translate our research questionnaire into Bahasa and spread to the society in Indonesia.
This was of great help as there were a great number of respondents from different educational backgrounds, age groups, gender to provide us with an extensive demographic profile, avoiding potential selection bias.  As Singapore and Indonesia are two countries in different phases of development, in terms of the social and religious environment, size of population, rules and regulations etc, with data from Indonesia, we were able to compare how the public opinion might differ for two different countries. 
Figure 5. Sample of data UI_Indonesia collected for us
Our main reason to extend our human practice to other countries is that we hope that ultimately gene therapy can be applied evenly to everyone in the world. Therefore, it is important to understand the public views of different countries with different socio-economic conditions. It is a good chance for us to utilize this collaborating opportunity with UI_Indonesia to conduct an international study regarding gene editing. We are also thankful that UI_Indonesia helped us to analyze the survey question for the study in Indonesia. From UI_Indonesia analysis, we found that most of Indonesians support gene therapy editing for treatment. However, most of the respondents also have many concerns about cost, safety, and ethics. We deeply appreciate their help in sampling and  survey analysis  and their results are valuable inputs to our  human practice .
Figure 6. Outreach by UI_Indonesia
Apart from helping us in our survey study, UI_Indonesia also planned an outreach event for us. We believe that it is important for the public to know more and be aware of this gene-editing therapy. Moreover, since gene editing is not a common issue, there is a lack of knowledge about this in Indonesia. Therefore, as a part of our outreach, UI_Indonesia helped us to educate students from the University of Indonesia so that they could be better prepared for gene editing technologies in the future.
We are pleased that we were able to share about our project to students in Indonesia through the help from UI_Indonesia . We prepared the material that we would like to be delivered in this outreach. The discussion was held in"

The Lethbridge High School iGEM has helped our team immensely with design and coding of the Collegiate wiki. Constructive feedback was given during meetings, to which coding help was given by a member of the High School team. The Lethbridge collegiate iGEM team also assisted the Lethbridge High School team with their hosting of a wet-lab workshop designed to teach basic wet lab protocols to High School iGEM teams all across Alberta. Five high school iGEM teams (Consort, Our Lady of the Snows, Ted Harrison, Central Memorial High School, Lethbridge) were in attendance for the two day event.  Protocols of ligations, making competent cells, transformations, minipreps, and gel electrophoresis were taught to name a few.
In addition to our collaboration with the U of L High School team, we organized and hosted an Alberta-wide workshop designed to provide iGEM teams with experience presenting and give feedback on project ideas and techniques. The collegiate team from NAIT participated and offered assistance and feedback during the two day event. Experts from across North America were present, and the experience was beneficial for all parties involved. In concert with our High School collaboration, we forged an important link between our team and the Government of Canada agency for Agriculture and Agri-Food. As our project deals directly with crop protection, we have been fortunate to gain access to a pest species of Fusarium on which to test our constructs. As part of this collaboration we have had an opportunity to engage a wide network of faculty and support staff at the Lethbridge Research Centre and receive feedback and suggestions from individuals with decades of relevant experience.
In addition to these collaborations, our team has participated in several surveys that were conducted by other iGEM teams from around the world. In total, we participated in five surveys that were created by the following teams: Paris-Saclay, Nankai, NEFU China, BNU China, and Korea U Seoul. The BNU China survey related most closely to our own project in that questions were posed about agricultural disasters, pesticides, and our government’s policies on biosafety and farmer’s rights to use pesticides.

Abstract
Beside the research in the own project's field it is important to collaborate with other iGEM teams in order to share knowledge and face challenges together. In this way, ideally both teams can profit from the work and experiences from one another and push their individual projects even further. In concrete terms, we sought to support various teams in their advances, for example by designing measurement systems for them or by submitting to them experimental data they required. In the following we list our efforts towards this.
iGEM-Team York_UK
The iGEM-team York did, similar to our project, research into microbial fuel cells and so we got in touch and talked about our proceedings. We came to know that York had problems cloning the mtrCAB cluster and invested a lot of time to solve these problems. Time was certainly running at that point and we decided to help York. We already designed our MFC and tested different constructions in order to determine which one would be the most suitable. With all the experience we collected with MFC-construction, we were able to construct a MFC specially adapted to the requirements of team York. To ease up the usage of this cell, we wrote a detailed instruction on how to operate the MFC. Additionally we put nafion membranes, gaskets, carbon electrodes and injectors into a package and sent it to"

With SZU-China
There is a long tradition of helping each other between SZU-China iGEM team and us. Participating the iGEM competition is a challenging experience for college students like us, such as multitasking with course studies, other research works in the laboratory, handling administrative works, preparing for unsuspected events etc. It is quite comforting to have a reliable ally battling by your side through the toughest days.
There was quality issues with our Interlab study kit. Our sister university, the Shenzhen University solved our problem with lending us their Interlab study kit. In September, when we were all busy with our parts construction work, they found that their pSB1C3 backbone provided by the iGEM kit was not working. As a result, their target gene could not be expressed successfully. After exhausted all the possibilities, including changing their antibiotics, LB agar plate, and all kinds of genes inserted, they came to us for help.
We provided them with the original backbone and pSB1C3 with one of our chromoprotein BioBrick, which had been constructed with red pigment coding sequence eforRed. It is our favorite design in our BioBricks submissions because it could express strong crimson color. The loss of crimson color in colonies after subcloning indicated successful gene insertion. We provided these to our colleagues, which played a great role in their following experiments.
With TCU_Taiwan
This year TCU_Taiwan came up with a great idea to use chromoprotein as a reporter to detecting diabetes. As a diagnostic tool, the bacterial indicators were expected to synthesize pigment as fast as possible when detecting glucose level in blood samples or urine samples.
Our team was also building our chromoprotein BioBricks. We shared our experiences with them them on the long expression time of chromoprotein. We also provided them with alternative suggestions , such as R-GECO which could respond instantaneously. We really hoped our advice could help them to improve their design and results.

(C) 0.1% of arabinose was added to induce the expression of toxin, no strain grew.
(D) 0.1mM of IPTG and 0.1% of arabinose was added to induce the expression of toxin and anti-toxin, strain grew normally.
The results show that, arabinose can greatly suppress the growth of this strain, while IPTG shows slight suppression effects towards this strain. On the contrary, add both two inducers to the system shows no significant effect compare to wild type, indicated the expression of anti-toxin can relieve the suppression of toxin in this system.
From these experiments, we help Jilin_China to confirm their TA system can work. For further information, here is the link to their wiki .
Jilin_China for BIT-China:
Jilin_China helped us build a part, which we can test the expression of membrane protein by detect blue color(bcp).
In this process, we are concerned about whether our sweet receptor can be successfully expressed and located on the cell membrane , the strategy is to fused BCP（Blue cytochrome protein）to the N-terminal of T1R2，so that we can observe the protein T1R2 on the membrane by fluorescence confocal microscopy. The member of Jilin_China synthesize the expression cassette of PGal1 + T1R2 + BCP + CYC1t gene for us.

Our team aided the University of Sydney’s team by responding en mass to a survey they wrote to collect data on consumption of fresh produce and produce purchasing habits. We hope our answers will help them determine geographical trends in fresh produce consumption so they may better optimize their product for general use. You can help too by taking their survey .
Team Michigan Software
Our team submitted over 20 protocols to the University of Michigan Software Team’s ProtoCat database. The protocols provided are the culmination of lab experiences from the University of Michigan's team. By contributing to the database we hope to aid future iGEM teams who are in need of through instructions to aid in their experimentation.
Diagnostics Track Teams
Our Bench-to-Bedside Guide was shared with all of the teams in the diagnostics track that provided contact information. We expect that this guide will be a valuable resource to current and future iGEM teams and that, as a result of our diligent research, others will be able to deliver life saving technology into the hands of those who need it."

iGEM Community
We were delighted to co-host and participate in the iGEM Northern U.K. meet-up. There we got to present our project in its early stages to Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, and Newcastle. This fostered further discussions and of course gave us the opportunity to learn about some of the incredible projects that were happening nearby. As a result of the meet-up, we stayed in touch with the Nottingham and Glasgow teams in particular, and further collaborations are noted below.
Nottingham
We worked with Nottingham at various stages of our project. We stayed in contact using social media and Skype, and we got the chance to speak to them as we were going through formative changes in each of our projects. Furthermore, we also participated in helping them further test their cell rehydration system and give them more data on how well their product worked after being shipped.
Glasgow
Glasgow were very helpful to our team, as we lacked engineers but took it upon ourselves to develop a microfluidic device anyway. Glasgow also developed a fluidic device, and they were very helpful to our team, providing feedback on the design and build of our device during its early stages. Furthermore, they also met with Helena and Joe to improve the function of our 3D printed syringe pumps and helped us design software so the syringe pumps could function.
Technion Israel
Technion Israel got in touch with our team as a result of our collaboration request posted on the iGEM collaboration hub. While it was ultimately not efficient for us to collaborate in the wet lab, we were able to work together very significantly in the dry lab. Technion thought we could aide them in developing a model for their “kill-switch” construct, which utilised Cre/Lox, and we were very happy to try and apply our model to a new circumstance. In the end, our model was able to tell them what concentration of Cre would be required to activate nearly all kill-switches, which was influential in the design and conceptualisation of their project downstream. In addition, it further demonstrated the utility and accuracy of our model in another context. Check out a ""snapshot"" of our results below and read our modelling"
Edinburgh_OG,2018,"oyong (2017) was ultimately unsuccessful.
To our joy, we were happy to discover that the Iowa team may have just the answer to our prayers! As can be seen in Figure 2, the 3HP biosensor they have developed may be applicable in the direct detection of the propionyl-CoA synthesized via the SBM pathway. Motivated by a 2016 paper by Rogers & Church, we surmised that a 3HP biosensor that relies on the conversion of 3HP via pcs and prpC into a quantifiable fluorescence readout may be modified to directly quantify the biogenesis of propionyl-CoA, one of the intermediate compounds in this pathway!
 
Figure 2. The designated pathway through which our team expects to detect the production of propionyl-CoA from our sbm+ (woke AF) E. coli.  This is taken from one of the potential pathways that a 3HP biosensor can be developed: by converting 3HP to 2-methylcitrate, fluorescence output can be quantified. Given this possibility, a modified biosensor (comprising prpC) may be used to detect the production of propionyl-CoA directly through a similar means of fluorescence readout.
We shipped the Sbm operon to the Iowa Team who kindly help us to try if their device can sense the presence of the precursor. However, when they tested with the supernatant there was no signal detected. We hypothesised that the precursor should be inside the cell and therefore the next step would check the lysis cell material. However, due to time constrictions, this last step was not finalised.

Washington iGEM
Collaboration
Our collaborations this year were quite diverse, from engaging with our satellite campus to connecting with a team from Japan to being active locally in helping to found the first completely high school based iGEM team in Washington State!
iTesla-SoundBio
Previous Next
In the past, our team received numerous emails from high school students interested in joining our team.  However, this rarely worked out, due to liability at our university, logistical issues, and our team’s limited space and resources.  As our team has grown in the last few years, it became even harder to take on high school students, and as the only team in Washington State, we began looking for other ways for high school students to participate in iGEM.
Thus, last year, we set out a plan to start a high school team in partnership with multiple schools in our area.  We worked with high school students Roya Amini-Naieni (Bellevue International School) and Anna Vasyura (Tesla STEM HS) to recruit members from five East Side high schools.
That’s when SoundBio stepped in. SoundBio Lab is a DIY Bio lab near the University of Washington that allows citizen scientists to develop their own personal projects, and also engages with students of all ages through community outreach programs.  Despite a long commute, the high school team migrated their work to the SoundBio lab space and SoundBio researchers stepped up to participate as instructors.
Members from Team Washington provided training materials for lab safety based on safety certification programs from the University of Washington Environmental Health and Safety Department.  We helped plan initial meetings at Tesla High School, Microsoft Headquarters, and SoundBio Lab, developing a plan with the iTesla-SoundBio leadership team and brainstorming project ideas.  Members of our team led lab training at the SoundBio lab at the start of the season, and gave guidance in brainstorming sessions and project selection.  Throughout the season, we have been available for advice and troubleshooting.  Finally, we have coached the team as they prepare their wiki , presentation, and poster for the Jamboree.
This collaboration has given us an appreciation for the vast amount of work that goes into starting a new team, and we are very proud of the high school students who took on this challenge.  We are excited to have a new partnership with the SoundBio lab as well, and are looking forward to seeing this team grow and develop in the coming years.

Throughout the last couple of months, we realized that iGEM is much more than a                         competition. During the iGEM season, we had the opportunity to meet people from all around the                         world and work together to overcome the obstacles that surged during the development of our                         projects. But we did not want our relationship with the other teams to be based only on serious                         technicalities, which is why we organized and participated in several activities to share all                         the iGEM love!
Latin American MeetUp
While working on a project it is essential to receive feedback from experts and teams working in                         the same area to improve your work. Thus, we reached out to all Latin American teams for them                         to assist our Meetup, held on July 13th of the present year. We got the participation of 8                         teams, these being teams from Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Tec-Chihuahua, Tec Monterrey and                         TecMonterrey_GDL. Throughout the event, the members and representatives of each team had the                         opportunity to present their project. These presentations were divided, some of them were                         online and the other ones were face to face. The experts asked a series of questions making the                         students aware of possible mistakes.
After the presentations, we had the opportunity to meet the other teams and interact with them.                         With this activity, we had the chance to participate and encourage collaborations between the                         teams.
Thanks to this event, we were able to analyze the obstacles of our project and found other                         alternatives and implement them. There’s no doubt that the feedback provided by the                         specialists was crucial for the proper development of the projects, and beyond the                         scientific issues, we were able to"

Collaborations
Collaboration – whether interpersonal, intercommunal or international – is an essential condition for human development in any field, where synthetic biology is not an exception, particularly as modern information technologies has made it so easy. And it goes without saying that collaboration within the iGEM competition enhances each team’s experience and contributes greatly to its success.
KU Leuven
KU Leuven team has kindly invited us to participate in their activities aimed at creating a base of project descriptions translated into different languages. The working iGEM language is English and fortunately each team seems to be at home with it. But synthetic biology goes far beyond the iGEM limits and in this context we find the idea of KU Leuven a very promising one. The team has created a Google Drive account where each team invited to participate in this collaboration could add its project description in English and have it translated by other teams into their native languages and do the same for other teams. According to KU Leuven’s idea, finally it would be a kind of library of project descriptions available in different languages for those who are interested in synthetic biology but cannot read English. We have translated all the projects proposed for translation into our native language, which is Russian, and hope that this way we have contributed to dissemination of knowledge on synthetic biology around the globe. We also hope that this KU Leuven’s initiative is just a first step on a long road and finally a valuable source of information will be built up with the help of other teams, where not only project descriptions but also other more detailed information on iGEM projects will be available in all the languages of the world. And we will always be glad to participate.
iGEM Tuebingen
When looking through collaboration requests from other teams we came across the idea proposed by iGEM Tuebingen that we found quite interesting as it was close to what we intended to do ourselves. Their idea was to create short tutorial videos that would promote synthetic biology and iGEM and would be available to anyone interested on YouTube. We have made a series of tutorial videos explaining how to use some basic lab methods, namely: PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis"

Collaboration - Lokalization Study and Part Exchange with CU Boulder 2017
This year the iGEM team CU Boulder works with artificial compartments which consist of shell proteins containing a photoswitch amino acid. These compartments are supposed to break up into separate shell proteins releasing the protein captured inside the compartment. This could potentially act as next-generation drug delivery systems, biosensors, or as a solution to sequester diffuse and harmful environmental toxins. The iGEM team CU Boulder 2016 submitted the BioBrick containing the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS) for the photoswitch amino acid. This year’s team helped us to realize our photoswitching project by sending us their aaRS and a small amount of the amino acid AzeF. In return, we transformed their parts EutS ( BBa_K2129001 ) and EutC-tagged FusionRed in E.coli DH5α and performed localization studies by fluorescence microscopy with our confocal laser scan microscope.
Figure 2: 3D-Animation of the fluorescence signal of E.coli cells transformed with EutC-tagged FusionRed from CU Boulder. The fluorescence is present in the whole cell.
Figure 3: 3D-Animation of the fluorescence signal of three E.coli cells cotransformed with shell protein EutS and EutC-tagged FusionRed from CU Boulder. The fluorescence is concentrated in the EutS-compartments.
As you can see above the parts work perfectly. The cells only containing FusionRed have a bright fluorescence in the cytoplasm (Figure 2) and the cotransformats show the fluorescence concentrated in the EutS compartments (Figure 3). We send CU Boulder the stacked pictures and combined the stacks to 3D-animations.
We are very happy that they provided their aaRS to us to expand our toolkit and we hope that our results of the localization study are helpful for their further work.
Networking
Beside the collaborations mentioned above, our team got in contact with many people from all over the world throughout the year.  We would like to give a little impression of how we benefited from the iGEM community.

     We have collaborated with several iGEM teams, sharing experiences and problems we have faced during the development of our project. In the following, we described each of our partnerships.
Cooperation with UFSCAR Team
     Bioinformatics and modeling seems to always be challenging for most of us. This year, we wanted to create a supplementary material that summarizes useful tools to analyze data, simulate synthetic circuits and give us prediction power. Click here to learn more about this material.
     On July 3rd, we met with UFSCar-Brasil team to talk about modeling of biological systems, and present a supplementary material we developed as a didactic introduction to these topics. Thiago, the physicist of our team, compiled these topics into a 2 hours talk with hands-on activities. We conducted an informal discussion about Python and the main tools in this programming language for Synthetic Biology, reviewing state-of-art numerical methods for bioinformatics and gene expression simulation through deterministic models. We believe this interaction provided us with constructive feedback to improve our material, while hopefully helping UFSCar-Brasil team with modeling.
Participation in a survey from Team CGU_Taiwan
     iGEM projects often address timely and appealing issues that could potentially raise our quality of life. However, the actual impact of an iGEM project depends on how the public opinion will see your project. For instance, we are all constantly struggling for financial support, which strongly depends on how appealing a solution would be perceived by the general population. Thinking of this topic, The CGU Taiwan team wanted to create (created) a survey to assess the feedback to several iGEM project descriptions from populations of differents countries. This could generate significant information on how to propose better projects in the future.

Collaboration
The emphasis that iGEM places on collaboration allowed us to improve our project and connect with other young scientists. We appreciated the opportunities this provided us and understand that it is a reflection of how the scientific process works in the real world. Over the course of the summer, we collaborated with four different teams: Missouri S&T, WashU/Penn State, The University of Virginia, and the University of Georgia. As this was our first year as an iGEM team, we also received assistance from the WashU/Penn State team, who quickly became our good friends and mentor team.
In July, we attended the Heartland Synthetic Biology Meetup, hosted by Missouri S&T. We helped Missouri S&T and Washington University host a public forum discussion on synthetic biology and host an educational event for children.
Our collaboration with the Virginia iGEM team consisted of us assisting them with a survey about biocontainment. This survey will be used to create a pamphlet for future iGEM teams that provides them with information about biocontainment and help make informed decisions in order to improve their practices. Improved biocontainment also serves the dual purpose of inspiring more trust from the public. The team created a badge that is now proudly displayed at the bottom of this webpage.
Finally, we helped to characterize the expression of an mCherry gene from the University of Georgia iGEM team. They sent us cells that had already been prepared to express the gene and we used our plate reader to take measurements of the fluorescence of their cells. This was all part of a larger multi-team collaboration effort meant to gather measurements from multiple sources in order to standardize their results.
Additionally, the Washington University St. Louis / Penn State iGEM Team  provided us with water samples. We plan to use these samples to test base nitrate levels and to potentially simulate a real-world environment for the testing of our system. They also provided us numerous contacts for potential sponsorship and mentored us throughout the summer. Our teams had similar project backgrounds, and so we were able to discuss our results and exchange ideas.
Want to see more outreach?"
SCUT-China_A,2016," order to offer them certain help, we chose several mosquito-breeding waters areas in guangdong—one of the most mosquito-breeding regions in China—to measure both the outdoor temperature and the water temperature, which were then collected and sent back to FAFU iGEM team.
Meanwhile, we are facing a problem as we conduct effect testing of our oil biodesulfurization, which is that our university is not equipped with the certain device that could accurately detect the sulfur element in oil, such as Micro-Coulomete. For that matter, FAFU team is willing to provide us with technical support. They will help analyze the crude oil sample we send to them which has been treated with our engineered bacteria, with Micro-Coulometer that their school owns, and then send back the analysis results to us.

Team Macquarie Australia
The NTU Singapore iGEM team was pleasantly partnered with Macquarie team for collaboration. The project involved for both our team were quite different, in which Macquaire team dealed with photosynthetic system while our team dealed with CRISPR-based gene editing technology. Thus, we had made several Skype meetings with Macquaire team and more frequently emailed each other to share different concepts of the projects. Finally, both teams had reached consensus in using the CRISPR-based gene editing technique for both of the teams’ works.
Our Skype session with Team Macquarie :)
Compare the gene expression level of Mg2+ Chelatase Operon genes by RT-PCR
With the intention of producing functional Mg-chelatase that eventually give rise to  Mg-protoporphyrin product, Macquaire team had constructed a Mg-Chelatase plasmid ( BBa_K1998000 ) that consist of ChII1, ChID, Gun4, ChII2, CTH1 and ChIH genes, in which their expression are co-regulated under pLac promoter, with ChIH expressed under a second pLac promoter.
Team Macquarie had overexpressed the genes and ran SDS-page gel to check the expression of the genes. However, without antibodies for these proteins, a western blot could not be done to verify the identity and quantity of the protein. Thus, our team had helped them to quantitate each of the gene expression level by RT-PCR.
The results of RT-PCR is shown as below:
Relative Expression of Mg2+ Chelatase gene after IPTG induction
Formula: 2^-(ΔΔCt) is used to calculate the fold change of gene expression after induction, in which
ΔCt(control)1= Ct(uninduced operon genes)- Ct(Ampicillin gene)
ΔCt(test)2 = Ct(Induced operon genes)-Ct(Induced Ampicillin gene)
Finally, use ΔCt(test)2- ΔCt(control)1"

TThe first collaboration talking with XJTLU team began in early July. We shared 1ml fluorescent calibration bead of flow cytometer. After communication online, we then share experience about using of flow cytometer.Wediscussedthe applicationprojectsmadebyvariousteams over the years, then since we havea deeper understanding ofproject of each other, we also shared thoughts about the advantages and disadvantages of sterile and bacterial systems’ application, and whether bacteria can be truly applied to the market or not. What’s more, we raised questions about the construction of biological parts and project approval. We also had a talk about relevant knowledge of microfluidic chip,which gave us inspiration for our device design.It is really delightful to discuss with team XJTLU."
Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018," decided to take our collaboration one step further and a physical version of the Lithuanian “Spaceship E.Coli” comic book. We have hoped that the physical version of the comic would generate even more interest as many people agree that reading a paper version of a comic book is a much more exciting experience!
Therefore, we have prepared a printable version of our translated comic book and even managed to find the sponsors “Kopicentras” who would later print out the books for us and even gave us tips on how to prepare them correctly.
Finally, our Lithuanian physical comic book version of “Spaceship E. Coli” was completed. We have then proceeded to distribute them by giving them out in our educational events, after our various synthetic biology lectures in universities and schools, also in conferences and popular science events.
We truly believe that such comic book is what we have needed in order to grab the attention of young students in schools and universities. In turn, we are extremely happy OUC-China team have initiated the collaboration and the line of communication between China and Lithuania!

This would also give us the ability to efficiently plan (or help planning) any following edition of the European Experience in the future. Though we don’t think that the event has to be in France, if it is, some of the paperwork will already be done.
We would like to thank the iGEM Evry team for this collaboration, which was for us a great opportunity to work with other people. This event was a whole experience on its own, and we are really happy we organized it together!

iGEM IDF Meetup
The iGEM IDF (Île-de-France) was a collaboration between iGEM IONIS, iGEM Pasteur and iGEM Evry. It was originally intended to be hosted in La Paillasse, the lab where the iGEM IONIS team is working, and ended up being in the Pasteur campus.
The iGEM IONIS team was in charge of designing the event’s logo, and its members were helping out teams as staff. We also tried to find some speakers for the conferences but didn’t manage to do so. Fortunately, the two other teams found a lot of interesting speakers, and the conferences turned out to be great! This event was a lot of fun, both to organize and to attend to. It allowed us to see again the people we met at the European Experience, and we could spend more time with them!
For a detailed version of the event, please see here
Working with iGEM UPMC
During the iGEM Competition, we were working in La Paillasse, an open lab in Paris (see « Working at La Paillasse » ). But a big suprise was waiting or us at the beginning of the summer, as the iGEM UPMC team ended up working in the same lab than us! This was the occasion for a lot of fun together, along with tons of advice, regarding biology, protocols, strategy, and even fundraising… We helped each other in the best way possible and it was a very positive thing for us.
The pinnacle of this collaboration was the presentation of both our project in the Jussieu campus: the aim of this was to convince more biology students to attend to the iGEM,as part of one of our teams or even by creating their own teams. We explained them what was"
MIT,2016,"ic device
The device had 2 sets of channels, one for fluid flow (labeled blue in the diagram), and another one for air exchange (labeled red in the diagram). The first model did not have a chamber or specific region for cell culturing. The inlet and outlet were connected by a tube with uniform dimensions. This model, however, had rectangular cell traps along the channel.
Cell culturing protocol
Harvest the cells were using the standard culturing protocol, and then resuspend in media to achieve 2E4cells/cm^2 seeding density.
Sequentially sterilize and wash the channel with 1ml of 70% ethanol and 1xPBS by directly pipetting into the inlet.
Through the same inlet, pipet 1ml of cells solution (1E6 cells/ml).
Incubate the whole device with seeded cells at 37 degrees Celcius.
Figure. Microfluidic device model 2.
a = 3250um; b = 400um; volume of the chamber = ~ 4.4ul. Material: PDMS.
Model 2
Microfluidic device
Since we couldn't detect any cells under 10X light microscope (24 hrs post seeding) in the first model, we proposed several modifications to the device after doing some literature research, including:
Creating a diamond-shape chamber specifically for cell adhesion. The increase in cross-section area along the channel reduces the flow rate of the fluid, making it easier for the cells to stick to the surface of the chamber
Using a syringe pump to continuously replenish media inside the chamber after cell adhesion, preventing the media from drying out inside the chamber - which happened in model 1
Including a 3D-printed frame, fitting the size of a 96-well plate, so that the whole seeding and culturing process can be monitored and captured using a microscope.
Cell culturing protocol
Harvest the cells using the standard culturing protocol, and then resuspend in media to achieve 120E4 cells/ml seeding density.
Clean and wash the chamber with 70% ethanol and 1x PBS.
Use a 5mL syringe to load 1ml of media, 0.5ml of cell solution, and another media column to a 1.59mm diameter tube.
Use a syringe pump to load media and cell solution in the tube to the device.

TecCEM,2018," we had the pleasure of answering a survey they posted in the iGEM                         Teams/Collaborations page called“Survey to Combat Water Pollution”, this information helped                         them to understand what actions are taken around the world to prevent water pollution.
Washington
People may perceive science as a complicated and boring topic, but the Washington iGEM Team                         decided to prove this as a common misconception. To achieve this goal, the team designed a                         synthetic biology booklet meant for kids. This book is easy to understand and states the                         importance of science through interesting experiments and fun explanations. However, in                         order to succeed, our team had the task of fully translating it to Spanish, with the                         objective to reach a much wider audience, including all the Spanish speaking countries.                         This also was done with the intention of giving them some feedback about the booklet.

How would you describe iGEM to a stranger? More than a competition it could be part of a                         culture. How can someone who has never been part of it, can get to know what iGEM is?                         UChile_Biotec decided that it was time to show the world what does it means to belong to                         this community.
Collecting information from teams all over the world, they designed a magazine that                         gathered several aspects of the competition and the projects of the participating teams, as                         well as integrating the participant teams culture. We joined their strongest and more                         attractive collaboration by sharing details and the implications of our project, our own                         experience as iGEM members and describing some interesting, fun elements of the Mexican                         culture regarding science and biotechnology.
Video Labs Like Us Collaboration
Music is a universal language that helps us communicate our feelings. That is why iGEM TEC                         CEM 2018 team decided to bring all the teams together and use music as a way to express all                         the ups and downs lived in every step of the competition, these being stress, despair,                         happiness, motivation, etcetera. We had the participation of 24 iGEM teams from different                         countries. We produced two videos covering two popular songs, one is “Labs like you” and                         the other one is “Moves like iGEM” (inspired on Maroon 5’s Girls Like You and Moves Like                         Jagger respectively). The aim of the music videos is to demonstrate that despite being from                         different teams and countries we all went through the same situations. The teams that participated are:

University of Virginia
Initial Contact: We got in contact with a lot of American teams over our project, but the team at the University of Virginia played a key role in the development of our perchlorate assay, and giving us an idea of what American based water companies test for in supplies.
Cooperation: We sent Virginia our perchlorate assay and COSHH form, and they undertook test on tap water. They even did two! We then received back the results from their local water report, which showed us that perchlorate is currently not a compound that's tested for in water supplies. Alongside this, we received their assay results, helping determine the sensitivity of a perchlorate assay we developed. Here is a pdf of their results!
Follow-Up: The team at the University of Virginia have helped amazingly with the perchlorate assay aspect of our project, confirming its sensitivity, and we'd like to thank them hugely. Best of luck to them, and we look forward to supporting them at the Giant Jamboree. #TeamVirginia
University of Warwick
Initial Contact: The University of Warwick e-mailed us to get in touch over water sample collection. Some of our team met them at the UK meet-up in Oxford in July, to hand over the samples collected from all over Exeter.
Cooperation: As the Warwick team are looking into water pollutants and the removal of them, specifically lead, legionella and oestrogen, they asked us for four water samples from different points around Exeter. Due to the size of Exeter's estuary, and the river Exe running through it, we were happy to help. This impacted on their project as they tested for oestrogen, and then used the sample to isolate bacteria that may have the ability to degrade oestrogen. This led to further understanding of how rare degradation circuits are, and showed an improvement on Tawiwan's 2017 circuit.
Follow-Up: Warwick followed up with how our water samples impacted on their project. We wish Warwick the best of luck in this countdown week, and look forward to supporting them at the Jamboree! #TeamWarwick

The iGEM Team Cologne-Duesseldorf started a campaign to promote synthetic biology in public by using self-designed postcards. The postcards are created individually by each team to illustrate their project briefly. A batch of each team’s postcard is exchanged so that every team can share postcards from all over the world.
The postcards are used to promote iGEM and the idea of international networking by handing them out at public events. Thus each individual postcard arrived somewhere else around the globe as a symbol of the international and public dimension of iGEM.
Laboratory collaboration: Efficacy spectrum
We want to thank iGEM Team Franconia for testing our produced antibiotic clorobiocin on C. glutamicum.  Their tests with our established protocol for agar diffusion assay and different antibiotic concentrations show that clorobiocin works as potent as Ampicillin on C.glutamicum strain 13032. These data provide information on inhibition of corynebacterium growth by aminocoumarins. They saw that  C.glutamicun strain 13032 is more sensitive to clorobiocin than our tested ΔTolC E.coli and the MIC is lower than 2.5 µg clorobiocin (s.c. 1 mg/ml). This is consistent with the fact that aminocoumarins work most efficient in gram-positive bacteria like Streptococci or Acinetobacter."
BNU-China,2016," photosynthesis of the algae, which is fixed in the water, is influenced and limited by lots of factor.
Not only in the laboratory but also the factory, Culturing algae in the stirred-well mixed culturing vessel with fixed volume is a common way. Under the circumstances, we believe that those important parameters, which is related to the growth of the algae, are all isotropy. In another word, by only considering the result which is dependent on time, we can meet the requirements of the experiments, or even the production.
Thus, after weighing up the actual conditions, based on the combination of the existing model of the first order ordinary differential equations, we set up some second order ordinary differential equations to simulate the growth velocity - the algae’s dry weight of the time derivative. Furthermore, the results, which the model has simulated the growth condition of the algae in limited light and nutritive substance, quite tally with the actual situation. In some limiting cases, such as limited light with unlimited nutritive substance or unlimited light with limited nutritive substance, these equations can be simplified into some common first order ordinary differential equations.
Fig.1 The logical relationships among four parameters
Firstly, according to the flow figure below, we explain the logical relationship of the four important parameters of the model.
The growing speed of the alga in the incubator, A, which means the change of dry weight of the alga in unit interval is equal to the increase minus the decrease of the organic substance in the cells. The decrease is mainly based on two ways. One is the natural death and the other is the artificial separation of the useful mature alga.
The carbon dioxide in the water area is converted to saccharides by the photosynthesis of alga and then stored in the cells. This also shows the conclusion that the growth of the population density of the alga will accelerate the speed of the decrease of carbon dioxide. Hence the content of carbon is equal to the inflow minus the part which are converted by photosynthesis.
Similarly, the content of mineral substance in the water area M is also a factor which has its influence on photosynthesis. It will decrease faster when the amount of the alga is increasing as well.
In a certain space, the sum of the carbohydrate, S (exclusive that in the cell), can be considered as the result which the fixed sum of the photosynthesis subtracts the total sum of the increment of the dry weight and the decrement of the dry weight in the culturing medium (death, artificial extraction).
The quantitative relationships among four parameters shows below:
$$\dot{\mathcal{A}}=\alpha_{"
Hangzhou-H14Z,2015,"                                                                                        In the dampness and water environment, corrosion speeds faster. At present engineers mainly adopt anticorrosion coating materials, including organic coating, inorganic coating and coating,

                                                                                                                                                                However, there is rare application of biological coating in practical. According to the principle, it has certain feasibility,
                                                                                                                                                                because the principle of chemical coating is the main component of waterproof material, such as sodium silicate, can quickly and effectively concrete structure layer of calcium hydroxide, aluminium, calcium, calcium silicate,

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015," Also, when we tried it with B. subtilis, the reason we didn't get very far with the 2013 team is because we never got the transformation into B. Subtilis to work after several repeats (but that's possibly because of issues with our protocol/technique, it's not totally clear)- in either case, obviously working with E. coli would be much nicer/easier. 2. Express in E. Coli, part I: You could potentially get around the issue of KerA getting trapped in the periplasm by inserting the Tat and Sec pathways in E. coli (which we are actually using in our project right now in a completely different context). You would remove the endogenous KerA signal peptide and add an alternative signal peptide, which could be recognized and cleaved by one of these two secretion systems (I forget which- one system cleaves the tag and the other one doesn't, sorry definitely another person on our team working on these systems know them better than me). You may also want to look at other signal peptides/systems- though I think Tat/Sec are the most famous and most efficient ones. Advantage: Gets around the issue of the stuff getting stuck in the periplasm. Disadvantage: This could be a little difficult to get to work, as getting recombinant proteins to secrete in E. coli is kind of a flip of a coin- sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. It also wouldn't be very novel, as it's already been done before: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf100803g- maybe you could improve on their efficiency though, not sure if that's good. 3. Express in E. coli, part II: Advantage: You could just not secrete the protein and instead lyse E. coli and purify the KerA later. This means you don't have to think about secretion systems. Disadvantage: The problem with this approach is that misfolding and the formation of big clumps of the protein called inclusion bodies within the acidic environment of the cytoplasm is common with overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli (http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v22/n11/full/nbt1029.html). So with this approach after lysis, you'd have to figure out the conditions for separating out the inclusion bodies and refolding the Keratinase properly. This type of an approach where you lyse then refold is well-documented with something long-known like insulin (I think this"

We make a collaboration with the UNAH iGEM team from Honduras, they are working on a project to fight Dengue, so we decided to help them with their project in the modeling and wetlab parts; for this purpose we designed a working plan to help a part of their team to get started. We also gave them the opportunity to present their project to researchers of the UNAM from physiology, biotechnology, genomic sciences and medicine areas. They came to Mexico and worked 4 weeks in June  in the institutes of chemistry, physiology and  in the faculties of science and medicine.
Modeling area.
The section of our team who was more devoted to board mathematical modeling decided to give a course to our guests on the general ideas for developing a mathematical model, in order to do this, a 5-days system was implemented.
The first day was devoted to general problem solving, presenting some problems of mathematical logic, while trying to maintain a biological related subject in the problems, some of the listeners seemed enthusiastic with this idea and even used some extra time to discuss more problems. The computing part focused on principles of programing and getting to know the commands.
The second day was used to present a general idea on how functions work, in order to avoid confusions while working on derivatives and forming a solid basis for next few days.The computing part focused on first problems and starting to make their own programs.
We began the third day with a demonstration on derivatives and how they express change, which is a powerful weapon on biological systems modeling.The computing part focused on how to program the derivatives and some basic biological problems.
Once the listeners were comfortable with this kind of equations, some general models of this kind were discussed, for this purpose, we asked for systems that they thought that could be analyzed under this perspective.The computing part focused on how to program models using our own as an example, after that we started programing the first drafts of their model.
On the last day, it was decided to present some other branches of mathematics  that are also useful in actual biology, like game theory or graph theory, with useful examples on how they work in different biological systems. We continued programing their model draft and trying different simulations to get the best results.

Collaborations among iGEM teams are one of the essential parts in Human Practices, for we have become companions with other iGEMers because of the reciprocal interactions. This year, we have done some collaborations including experience assistance, mentoring a new team.
TaiwanPP_FTP
Overview
TaiwanPP_FTP is a software collaboration between NYMU-Taipei and NCTU_Formosa. As the teams that both care about agricultural issues, we collaborated with NYMU-Taipei iGEM team to create innovative software that can predict the tendency of pest prospering shortly. The software will able to give detailed information of farm condition and give advice for farmers to prepare earlier before the threat.
We built up a prediction model by using the most popular way called machine learning for a variety insects. Through training a computer with a great amount of data, the computer will be able to analyze the relationship between input conditions and the outcomes. Finally, it can provide an accurate prediction which is the useful information for farm owners.(go to Website )
Figure 1. The screenshot of the website.
The Aim of TaiwanPP_FTP
We hope this tool could be user-friendly. All the information could be accessed through the Internet freely. It is remarkable if users could use the existing data to recreate another great application for the world. The product was a convenient web page that will show the predicted number of pests in the following three days of each observation station in Taiwan. All the source code and data are already on GitHub.(see on GitHub1 and GitHub2 )
The Process of Collaboration
This software is the cooperated product of National Chiao Tung University and National Yang-Ming University. The member of NYMU first developed this idea. The member of NYMU was responsible for developing the software including raw coding for data collection, data processing, prediction voting establishment and web development, while the member of NCTU was acting as a consultant and advisor that refined the code and debugged including stuff"

This is the first time for our team JNFLS_China to participate iGEM competition this year. As a new team, it is necessary and indispensable for us to communicate and collaborate with other teams. Here we will introduce our cooperation project and we appreciate all the teams and people that ever helped us.
1. Communication with Shenzhen_SFLS team
In early August this year, we were invited to Guangdong Shenzhen for meet-up by Shenzhen_SFLS team. So some players of our team went to communicate friendly with them at the auditorium of Shenzhen Foreign Language School. We started with drawing a picture to describe the experience of our performing project , then we introduced ourselves project each other, asked some questions and discussed the possibility of collaboration . In the pictures explanation and discussion process, we understood gradually and learned much from each other in which We had lots of fun!
Besides above, we listened to a report regarding the mechanism, application and advantages of transgenic plant by a PhD who gave us some opinions and suggestions for our project. We visited the library, assembly hall, stadium and a big beautiful campus which are very exciting us. Unfortunately, we have to end our meet-up hastily because of the typhoon coming.
2. Collaboration wth OUC_China team
We contact the OUC_China team from Ocean University of China which is located in the same province with us. We communicate iGEM projects and experiment advantages each other. Since our team members perform experiments in a lab equipped with advanced instruments of Shandong University, we are skilled at fluorescence measurements with the guidance of teacher and graduate students. So we helped OUC_China team to determine some fluorescence data of their one device in this season project https://2016.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Collaborations
3. Collaboration wth FAFU_China team
When we talked with FAFU_China team, they showed a very strong interest at the phenomenon that the fluorescent intensity of the experiment group is stronger than normal group. In order to further explore the reasons, their team designed the proof of experiment for us, and suggested us using flow cytometry to"

This year, Tufts Synthetic Biology collaborated with the MIT iGEM team on their Human Practices project.  Invitrogen has created a tool for screening ligation reactions during the Golden Gate cloning process.  The Invitrogen tool contains the CcdB gene in the pDEST vector as a negative screening tool.  Since the CcdB gene codes for a toxin which inhibits systems in Escherichia coli,  any uncut vector transformed into E. coli would prevent growth of a colony, drastically reducing the amount of colonies on the plates due to transformed, uncut vector.
As the pDEST-CcdB gene sequence is the intellectual property of Invitrogen, the MIT iGEM team created an alternate screening tool, pDEST-mCherry.  mCherry is a fluorescent protein which can be seen with the naked eye.  As a result, any colonies resulting from the uncut vector will be red, and so easily distinguished from successful ligation reactions.  MIT also developed a protocol for other iGEM teams in the future.
Tufts Synthetic BIology tested the protocol with the strain of E. coli in which we have been doing all of our cloning, JM109 from Promega, and successfully produced colonies with clones of our Golden Gate reaction.  The pictures below demonstrate the mixture of red and white colonies, which allowed us to easily and accurately pick out successful ligation reactions from background."

This summer, we collaborated with nine 2018 iGEM teams for a better progress in project of each other. We received help from 2 teams, SCU-China and Jiangnan in equipment and chassis cells. We also help 2 teams, CDHSU-CHINA and CSU_CHINA set up their team and mentor their work. Besides, we developed cooperative relationship with 4 team, BNU-China, NEFU_China, BUCT-China and UESTC-Software to fulfill our project. Moreover, it was the most fantastic thing that we have a spark with NCKU_Tainan of combining our project together and making use of our side product as well as solving their problems of xylose resource.
Cooperate
 NCKU_Tainan
It was the most fantastic thing that we have a spark with NCKU-Tainan of making use of our side product as well as solving their problems of xylose resource. Straw was a bio waste in agriculture while it wasn't easy to decompose. Our work successfully solved this problem with synthetic biology. We degrading straw into useful raw materials, which are glucose, xylose, ferule acid, and lignin. In addition, we aimed to convert glucose into butanol and hydrogen. But it still remains some problems of making use of our side product. Fortunately, the team, NCKU-Tainan contact with us and searching for solutions together. We also find that they met some problem during cost evaluation and carbon footprint when designing the whole CO2 utilization system.
So they came up with the idea of combining our project together and end up building a completely eco-friendly system with negative carbon footprint. Xylose is one of the side product produced of us during straw degradation, it can be extracted and utilized in their system. At the same time, concerning the synthesis of xylose may produce greenhouse gas and chemicals, they would like to obtain xylose produced via biological method. So they can integrate their system at the downstream of our system.

Mile High Meetup #1  University of Colorado Boulder 9/25/2016
We had the pleasure of hosting both the Colorado State University and Denver Biolabs iGEM for a meeting and presentation of our projects, which implied formal presentation on their research done and what they plan to do prior to the Jamboree. Collaborations were discussed between the teams and lead to some constructive criticisms of the projects. One major point was to collaborate on further outreach next time in Denver so that we may present to a wider audience. Through this meetup we were introduced to Denver Biolabs, a community lab, who innovate in many interesting ways to cut costs. One plasmid that a past CU team had created was a gene for an EcoRI enzyme attached to an ELP tag for simple purification along with a visible light flourescent protein and methylase, which we provided to Denver Biolabs to help them produce a vital BioBrick enzyme at minimal cost.

BNU-China,2017," developed a mathematical model to describe and simulate this process.
Model Formulation
Our main focus is to examine whether the designed system can effectively lower the concentration of heavy metal ions in the soil. There are 3 main processes at play here: the phytoextraction process, the organic acid production process, and the binding of heavy metal ions with proteins produced by the engineered PSB. To analyze this system, we built the following system of ordinary differential equations.
\[                 \left\{                 \begin{aligned}                 \frac{\mathrm{d}c_m}{\mathrm{d}t}&=-r_ac_{m,eq}\\                 \frac{\mathrm{d}c_p}{\mathrm{d}t}&=-r_dc_{p,eq}+a_1\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}\\                 \frac{\mathrm{d}c_h}{\mathrm{d}t}&=mr_h\\                 \frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}&=m(1-\frac{m}{K(c_{h,eq})})                 \end{aligned}                 \qquad\qquad                 \begin{aligned}                 c_m(0)&=c_{m0}\\                 c_p(0)&=c_{p0}\\                 c_h(0)&=c_{h0}\\                 m(0)&=m_0                 \end{aligned}                 \right.                 \]
The above equations are for the case where proteins are displayed on the surface of PSB. For the case where the proteins are secreted into the environment, we only need to change the second equation to
\[                 \frac{\mathrm{d}c_p}{\mathrm{d}t}=-r_dc_{p,eq}+a_1'm                 \]
For clarity, a table of variables and a table of parameters are provided at the end of this section for your reference.
We shall now explain in detail the formulation of these equations. First, notice that for the concentrations $c_m$ (heavy metal ions), $c_p$ (protein) and $c_h$ (hydrogen ions), there are the corresponding $c_{m,eq}$, $c_{p,eq}$ and $c_{h,eq}$ in the right side of the equation. The former ones are the imaginary “initial” concentrations, while the latter ones are the concentrations at the equilibrium state. To further expound this idea, we present the three major chemical reactions in the rhiz"

Paris EcoR1-Pstl Insert Plasmid
During the summer of 2018, we approached the 2018 iGEM Paris Envy team with a request to use one of their 2017 composite parts.  We believed that we could use it to incorporate our promoter, regulator and reporter together and incorporate it into a plasmid with a compatible ORI for an E. coli that had already been engineered to produce 3HP.  Essentially we intended to implement our biosensor into a 3HP producing chassis in order to demonstrate that our biobrick could be integrated into a previously existing biotechnologically modified system.  The biobrick was sent expeditiously by the Paris Envy team, and worked exactly as promised.  All of our work is carefully documented and will be an excellent future goal for our project. Check out their 2017 Wiki!
Boas Pucker: Weekly Mentor Meetings
We had the privilege to meet Boas Pucker through the iGEM Mentorship program. Pucker has helped us in a variety of ways via Skype calls. He has helped us stay track on deadlines, troubleshoot lab issues and cheer us on. Currently, he works as a research scientist at the department of plant biology at Bielefield University. He is currently on the Bielefield 2018 iGEM Team.  Check out their Wiki!
Edinburgh
The Edinburgh iGEM team reached out to us about a possible collaboration. Their E. coli strain has the ability to produce propionate. They wanted to know whether or not our biosensor would be able to work inside of their strain, to measure the amount of propionate they are creating. We tested our Bacillus subtilis strain in a propionate gradient to see if it would be able to measure the chemical. We have demonstrated that our 2018 iGEM device is a successful biosensor of propionic acid. Our next steps are to grow up Edinburgh's construct and lyse the bacterium to extract propionate. We will then place our B. subtilis biosensor into the lysed contents and"
Tokyo_Tech,2016," \displaystyle \frac{d[G1P]}{dt} = \frac{V_{max_4} [G6P]}{K_{m_4} + [G6P]} - \frac{V_{max_9} [G1P]}{K_{m_9} + [G1P]} $$
$$ \frac{[UDP - Glc]}{dt} = \frac{V_{max_9}[G1P]}{K_{m_9} + [G1P]} - \frac{V_{max_{10}}[UDP-Glc]}{K_{m_{10}} + [UDP-Glc]} $$
$$ \frac{d[Cell]}{dt} = \frac{V_{max_{10}}[UDP-Glc]}{K_{m_{10}} + [UDP - Glc]} $$
Each equation represents the concentration of each molecule. \( V_{max_n} \) and \( K_{m_n} \) represent the maximum velocity and the Michaelis constant of reaction respectively. In regards of the concentration of G6P and F6P, we had to consider the reversibility of the reaction.
However in this case, since it was considered to only use glucose and not fructose, we can simplify the equations to the following ones .
$$ \frac{d[Glc]}{dt} = - \frac{V_{max_1} [Glc]}{K_{m_1} + [Glc]} $$
$$ \displaystyle \frac{d[G6P]}{dt} = - \frac{V_{max_1}[Glc]}{K_{m_1} + [Glc]} - \frac{V_{max_2}[G6P]}{K_{m_2} + [G6P]} - \frac{V_{f_3} \frac{[G6P]}{K_{s_3}} - V_{s_3} \frac{[F6P]}{K_{P_3}}}{1 + \frac{[G6P]}{K_{s_3}} + \frac{[F6P]}{K_{P_3}}} - \frac{V_{max_4}[G6P]}{K_{m_4} + [G6P]} $$

Concordia,2016," working on simulating cell to cell battles in the iGEM competition. NAWI-Graz’s project, titled “ The Last Colinator ” focuses on using two strains of E. coli, each containing a unique toxin-antitoxin system, for the purposes of creating a battle.
Although we weren’t using toxins and antitoxins in our own battle system, we still aimed to collaborate with NAWI-Graz on two fronts. We wanted to have a discussion about the ethical dilemmas in our projects; after all, both our teams are forcing cells to fight for instructional and entertainment purposes. Additionally, we wanted to find a way to utilize their toxin-antitoxin system in our own project.
Ethics Discussion:
On September 19th, 2016, we had our first meeting with iGEM NAWI-Graz over Skype. We talked about our projects and our experiences (both the good and bad!). We then got on the topic of the ethics of our project. In our research, and in much of the domain of molecular biology, model organisms such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae are manipulated for the purpose of furthering human understanding of the molecular world. These cells, although microscopic, are considered living entities, a part of the tree of life which also includes humans, plants, and much more.
Knowing this, we asked questions related to the rightness or wrongness of our projects. In a macroscopic world, it is seen as deplorable to force living animals to fight for human entertainment, such as dog or cock fights. Yet, in the microscopic world, we humans don’t have any issues with forcing cells to fight one another, or to die in the case of untransformed DH5α E. coli cells on LB+Amp plates. For what reason or reasons do we not care about manipulating our microscopic brethren to die for us? Is it because of size differences? Is it because there are vastly more single-cell organisms than humans? Because single celled organisms do not have nerve cells meaning they can’t feel death? Is the alternative just too problematic that the ends justify the means?
During our Skype call, we asked these questions and more to members of iGEM NAWI-Graz’s team. We touched on the aspects of cell manipulation, cloning, stem cell developments, and all sorts of hot topic ethical issues in science. Much like us, they had asked members of their school’s community how they felt about a project manipulating cells. And much like us, most members of academic institutions did not have issues with our projects,"

During the European meeting in Munich we met 4 members of IGEM Groningen. We got along well and after discussing we invited them to come in Bordeaux. They came for             4 days in our hometown with the objective to collaborate and exchange on our respective knowledges.
They brought us their skills in chemistry under the form of a workshop during which they explained us some specific             points linked to our projects. They had read our protocols and gave us some feedbacks on the feasibility of them.             They had also prepared and documented on some other protocols of HPLC that we next have been using during our             lab work.
In exchange we led a debate about ethic in a context of synthetic biology. They had prepared some ethical questions             to discuss. We also had prepared a presentation about consciousness reflection to apply to our IGEM projects.             Beside the working hours we had time to show them Bordeaux and its surroundings. We took them on a personalized             city tour of Bordeaux. The next day we brought them to the Pyla Dune, a famous touristic attraction since it             is the biggest sand dune of Europe. At the end of the 4 days we had spent and shared a really good time with             them. We are grateful and happy of this collaboration.
We have contacted IGEM Leiden because their project was interesting to link to our subject. Igem Leiden’s project is about creating a platform to detect cell stress in E.Coli via stress response system coupled to colored proteins. In             our project the intermediate called HMF (HydroxyMethylFurfural) between cellulose and our molecule of interest,             FDCA (FuranDiCarboxylicAcid), is known to be toxic for the cells. That is why we asked Leiden Igem team to help             us in screening this toxicity by using their project, allowing them to test their platform on another chemical             to prove its effectiveness.

ASSESSING TOOLS WITH RICE UNIVERSITY AND FLORIDA STATE
WLC MILWAUKEE
Overview
Our team recognizes that the innovation of synthetic biology and science don’t emerge from just one source. Interdisciplinary work and collaborations play a huge part in the advancement of our field. This year, we developed an exciting new biology teaching tool, our Plasmid Learning Kit, to engage and support a new generation of synthetic biology students. In order to utilize different resources and gain insights that cannot simply be done by one team, we formed partnerships with other iGEM teams to produce the best Plasmid Learning Kit possible. By sending our Plasmid Learning Kits to other teams, we hope they were able to utilize them in new and innovative ways during their outreach and education events, and provide us with valuable feedback on how to improve this biology teaching tool.
Additionally, we pride ourselves on our independence and our ability to operate our organization as a high-performing team. We are approaching our seventh year as a team, and we realized that we’ve built up a lot of knowledge that we hoped to share with other iGEM teams. To this end, we helped provide advice to the iGEM team from WLC Milwaukee.
Assessing Tools with Rice University and Florida State
We sent our plasmid kit to two iGEM teams: Rice University and Florida State University. They were given instructions as well as extra parts to the kit. We wanted them to test our kit to see if it was helpful for teaching synthetic biology and to see what improvements we could make.
From Rice University, we heard mixed results. They found that it was helpful when introducing the concept of plasmids. It was a great visual aid as well as a hands-on activity for the children. It reinforced their learning and helped them retain it. However, they found issues with the quality of the kit. The magnets placed on the back were not large or strong enough, so the"

At the end of February, in 2015, we participated in a mentorship weekend with the University of Lethbridge and several other high school teams from Alberta.  We travelled down to the University of Lethbridge in order to improve our laboratory techniques and procedures.  Several of the University of Lethbridge team members worked with all of our team members, teaching us basic lab techniques, and advanced lab techniques.  Our team came away from the weekend much better equipped to use proper methods in our lab.
We also collaborated with the Ted Harrison middle school team during their first year as an iGEM team."

WLSA_Fudan-Shanghai is a new team mentored by us. This team comes from the High School Affiliated to Fudan University, which means we are bond together. In order to help them with their project, we managed to enroll them into our experiment class, and constantly gave them detailed information about experiment. We shared all the parts in the distribution kit with them, for their kit was seized in the custom.

At the first NEGEM (New England iGEM) meetup, we began talking to the Northeastern iGEM team. After watching their presentation, we learned that they were interested in microbial electrolysis cells, wastewater treatment, and energy, and thought that they would be a good match for us. Their project seeks to improve the efficiency of a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) by pairing the commonly used MFC/MEC strain Geobacter sulfurreducens with an engineered E. Coli that assists in exporting protons and removing oxygen from the media (since Geobacter sulfurreducens is an obligate anaerobic bacteria).
For our part of the collaboration, we assisted characterization of the Northeastern team’s novel part, BBa_K2182000, which encodes NADPH Oxidase. NADPH Oxidase, or the Nox protein,  catalyzes the formation of water from NADPH and O2. In their system, the Nox protein maintains an anaerobic environment for the Geobacter sulfurreducens. After receiving their Nox part, we transformed it into BL21 E. Coli, also provided by the Northeastern team. They requested that we then histag purify the protein and perform a coomassie stain to check for the presence of the protein. Unfortunately, their protein did not appear on the coomassie stain. In our communications, we learned that they were also having difficulties histag purifying and visualizing the Nox protein. One reason they gave for this is that the protein was not under a strong promoter, and was being expressed at low levels in the cell.
For us, the Northeastern team further characterized our PETase and sfGFP parts. We gave them our parts BBa_K201004, BBa_K201005, BBa_K201007 and BBa_K201008 (see here for details) in the plasmid backbone pSB1A3. They expressed PETase-sfGFP in BL21, a different E. Coli strain than the one we used. They then"

We are glad to mention those friendly iGEMers we met in this year and show co-operation details on this page.
Collaboration with  FJNU-China
We have used the E.coli (DH5α) and Yeast Cen.PK2-1D to help FJNU-China to test the inhibitory effect of PLA (Poly lactic acid) in common growth circumstances with different concentrations. And we would show the broad-spectrum antibacterial performance results in the below. What’s more, the FJNU-China team have provide tube of water             sample from the Fujian province, China, and then, we would test our detection chasis with this samples.
Our two teams often communicate with each other over the summer, during which we exchanged experience and interesting things through chat tools in daily life and establish a good relationship.
Collaboration with  XMU-China
We offered XMU-China the information of our team, including team introduction, project description, etc, which will be recorde on Newsletter edited by XMU-China. Through this platform, more people could learn about our projects and we have more opportunities to communicate and cooperate with the external world.
Collaboration with  NKU_China
We offeredNKU_China our constructive detecting chasis to test the minimal inhibitory concentration , MIC, in different labs. We can get more information about this detecting chasis tolerance through this testing that the detecting chasis can work at a Tc concentration of 0 to 200 ug/ml. And this collaboration results would help us verified the function of the gene tetA,"

iGEM Team Collaboration
Taipei American School & University of Georgia
A significant component in validating the accuracy and precision of our ElectroPen was understanding the repeatability of results. The TASTaipei and UGA teams were instrumental in proving our ElectroPen works in the real world. Both teams were not only able to successfully electroporate E. coli cells, but also obtained results similar to those from the trials conducted by Lambert's own team. We are very grateful for the collaborations between two iGEM teams without whose time and efforts we could not have proven our Electropen hardware.  Thank you TASTaipei and UGA!

Improvement of Pre-existing iGEM Part
    We attended the 4th CCiC hosted by FAFU in Fuzhou of Fujian province, China. By presenting our project and displaying our poster with other about 50 teams of China, we got many inspirations and also realized a lot of problems in our project. We closely communicated with FAFU-iGEM about transformation in B. megaterium and talked a lot about wastewater treatment with JLU-iGEM. Not only have we established great relationship with many teams such as FAFU-iGEM, JLU-iGEM and LZU-iGEM, we received many precious suggestions from HQs as well.
2017 Communication of iGEMers in Central China(iGEM-cherry)
    We, together with iGEMers from HZAU and NCTU, participated in the communication organized by HUST-iGEM in August in Wuhan, China.

XMU-China,2018," to train the new team members in the early stages of team formation. First of all, we will introduce our team and International Genetic Engineering Machine Competition through presentations, posters, WeChat pushes, etc., and also convey our requests for new recruits. We will then train the interviewees in groups and we will select them during the training process. Our training is mainly to share the learning materials for students and let them learn by themselves.
Our two teams made recommendations on each other for training new members. They suggested us add a literature reading part to the training to teach students how to read literatures and how to extract important information from the literature. Then they shared with us some materials for teaching students to read the literature. Their advice has helped us a lot, and we plan to adopt their suggestions to improve this year's training. At the same time, we also suggest that they increase the opportunities for students to practice, let the students design their own topics, increase their free space, make them more creative and have more new ideas. In addition, we exchanged our training materials on modeling, hardware, software, art and web design with each other.
Finally, we communicated with the daily management of the team. At the beginning of each team, all the students will participate in the design of the project and conduct laboratory training. After the preliminary determination of the subject, the students were divided into different groups, responsible for different labors like experiments, modeling, human practice and so on. We hold group meetings every week, each group reports the progress of the project, and different groups communicate with each other. In addition, we will also hold regular entertainment activities such as picnics, parties, etc. to relax and enhance team friendship. Both of our teams have one thing in common. Most members are in multiple roles, which better strengthens the communication between groups. It shows that iGEM competition is a common combination. There are different groups in this team. Everyone is not working separately, but is always intimately connected.
Through the exchanges with the NAU-iGEM team, Our team has a better construction model, and we have more experience in the follow-up training this year. Thanks to the NAU team for their help.

He gave us some tips about the circumference of self-study and introduced two books on synthetic biology for us. He emphasized that HTML to program WIKI is an essential skill for us to master. In addition, he briefly described his team’s project and other teams. This is very useful for us during the progress of preparing the iGEM project.
He indicated that the biggest problem his team had, is the uneven distribution of task last year. He suggested us that we should prepare the knowledge for the project before carrying out any experiment. He also mentioned that each team member should be more proactive for high efficiently preparing iGEM project. He believed that iGME provides a great communicating platform for students with the common interest to make friends. It is possible to meet your new friends in the Jamboree next year. This lets us deeply understand how to do an iGEM project.
After the presentation, we had happy communication. Someone asked: What were some problems you had? He answered: The biggest problem he had is the resource and not enough time for the experiment. We discussed how to design the part and device, analyze the results of the experiment. We all harvest a lot of new knowledge, which is crucial for us to apply and practice. Bowen introduced a Wechat number for communication to students of iGEM teams. We can communicate with more members of iGEM teams.
Communication
On September 16th I have a meeting with the leader of RDFZ-China. We have a little presentation just to share the basic information about our project. Then I ask some question about Jamboree and got a very useful information. I believe that can give me a better understanding of whole iGEM competition. This may give our team a better result. All in all, great thanks to RDFZ-China which helps us a lot."

TU_Delft,2016," images for them using the TEM.                                  Electron microscopy is an imaging technique that can acquire images with resolutions far above the optical limit due to the small wavelength of electrons (Nellist, 2011) . An electron gun forms an electron beam which is focused and accelerated by magnetic lenses. When the electrons reach the sample,                                  the electrons that are scattered at a high angle are used to image the sample (Figure 1). We hope that Wageningen is happy with the nice pictures!

The focus of our summer has been engineering control over bacterial adhesion. At NEGEM 1.0, we were excited to learn that our friends at Worcester Polytechnic Institute were working on a novel approach to controlling biofilm formation using antifreeze proteins. These proteins were able to disrupt biofilm formation under certain circumstances, and during our exchanges at the NEGEM meetup we became inspired to collaborate. We were interested in the possibility of using antifreeze proteins as a trigger for releasing pilli attachment. The first step in pursuing this potential control “switch” was asking WPI to help us characterize how our modified Pili would behave in the team’s quantitative biofilm formation assay. If they found a significant difference between biofilm formation in our Bactogrip strains and their controls, it might indicate a relationship between Type 1 Pili and the adhesion mechanisms disrupted by their antifreeze proteins. In return, we validated WPI’s biofilm formation assay using unique biofilm forming strains worked on in our host lab. This showed reproducibility of results and that the biofilm formation assay protocol is robust in various experimental conditions. We feel like we have only just begun to scratch the surface of this collaboration’s potential and look forward to a fruitful dialogue with WPI long into the future!

NTU_SINGAPORE,2017," shorter dwell time at the promoter for the VPR transcriptional activator to work effectively. One key weakness with our experiments was that we were unable to directly characterize target DNA binding affinity by our truncated dCas9 variants.
For our collaboration with Macquarie iGEM team, we had a serendipitous meet-up with their advisor in Singapore. Noting their protein purification capabilities, we suggested an EMSA affinity binding assay. EMSA affinity binding assay is a well-documented method to characterize dCas9 binding to target DNA. Native gel PAGE is utilized, whereupon dCas9 binding to target DNA, a mobility shift upwards is observed due to increased size, and hence decreased migration. The intensity of the shifted band would indicate the amount of dCas9 binding to target DNA. We hypothesize that truncated dCas9 would have decreased binding, and hence lower band intensity.
Our dCas9 wild-type and truncated variants were cloned into BPK 65767 (gift from Keith Joung Lab, Addgene) with 6x His tag, using Gibson assembly. The original Cas9 is replaced – this is necessary as we are investigating binding without cutting with dCas9, and all dCas9 proteins were human codon optimized. Macquarie iGEM team utilized commercially synthesized sgRNA that they have previously shown to work with Cas9.
Results
In the EMSA gel experiment, Macquarie utilized the considerably purer commercial WT Cas9 to provide a reference point as to identity of bands. They confirmed that our WT dCas9 and all truncation variants were unable to cleave target DNA, as evidenced by singular uncut ferrochelatase PCR product in lane B9, D5, D8, and D11, compared to the cut products for commercial WT-Cas9 in lane B5.
Mobility shift was apparent for our WT-dCas when comparing the band size of ferrochelatase PCR target between lane 8 and 9, and this was reflected in commercial WT Cas9, albeit fainter due to most undergoing cleavage and dissociating. This shift appears to be due to gRNA binding, as the band is observed in the RNP lane with only dCas9 and gRNA. DNA binding appears to result in a very large RNPF complex that is unable to enter the gel, as evidenced by the bright DNA band in the well of B4. The same shift did not seem to appear with our WT-dCas9, although a high MW smear was observed. This phenomenon seems isolated as the same smear was not observed with the truncated dCas"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018," a workshop, introducing them to the basics of CSS and HTML as a preparation for a successful wiki. A few weeks later, our team member Vanessa gave a more detailed workshop regarding the design of the wiki and creating new pages. Of course, we answered all further questions, exchanged information about both our projects and provided them with help, knowledge and working materials, doing our best to support the first Bielefeld iGEM high school team. Some of the most important things our team learned from mentoring the high school team Rheda Bielefeld were the different requirements which a young high school team has, in contrast to an over-graduate team, and to adjust our way of mentoring to their needs. It was so fascinating to see the pupils working so hard in addition to their school work and we were very happy to facilitate their passion for synthetic biology. We are so delighted you were successful and are very proud you represent Bielefeld in the iGEM competition!
iGEM Team Hamm-Lippstadt
This year, the University of Applied Sciences Hamm-Lippstadt takes part in the iGEM competition for the first time. To support their start and to give them a broad overview over criteria of the competition, we mentored the team. For this purpose, we invited all members to our research facility, discussed the foundations of the iGEM competitions and provided the visitors with protocols for their everyday lab routine. Afterwards, our primary PI Prof. Dr. Jörn Kalinowski joined us for a lab tour and a nice barbecue.
As an important aspect of our mentoring, we are in constant contact with the team, answering questions about the competition and their project.  Furthermore, we helped the team of Hamm-Lippstadt to participate in the InterLab Study.  We provided them with important working materials like Escherichia coli DH5α and 96 well plates. In addition, we offered them to use our laboratory as they had no own lab for genetic technology on site. Moreover, we answered broader and more detailed questions they had during several skype sessions. Further questions were answered during a second visit of the team of Hamm-Lippstadt. We were extremely happy, that they followed our invitation to our dual use panel discussion and we hope that we offered an useful input about dual use concerns of their own research and the importance to spreading dual use research of concern issues .  In addition to having fun teaching a new team the basics of an own iGEM project, it was fascinating to see a completely different team dynamic and research area. It was a pleasure to help them working on their own exciting iGEM project and"
WHU-China,2015," of Science and Technology (HUST) and Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU).During the discussion, we first shared our difficulties in the experiment and the solutions, such as the efficiency of transformation, activity of the enzymes. Then we came up with an idea that we could build a platform, where we communicate the up to date findings of synthesis biology, which can give us some clues of the match. We discussed other practical issues concerns Human practice, digifax and the management of the team. Every team shared their experience and learned from each other, making this seminar so meaningful.

In this year, we, the team Rheda Bielefeld, participated for the first time in the iGEM competition and in the result we were astonished by the scale of this event which takes place every year since 2003.
Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec
Luckily we didn't dive into the competition alone, because the iGEM team Bielefeld-CeBiTec helped us greatly in the project and mentored us from the beginning of the competition. They didn´t only help us in the technical side, which includes HTML, CSS and Java, but they also participated with us in the InterLab Study and guided us through it.
Even when the first results didn't match, we repeated the InterLab Study experiments and successfully completed it.
During the work with the wiki we encountered some gravitating problems and haven't found a possible solution, until one of their members helped us to find the solution and further provided us information to the wiki code.
Also we participated in their Dual Use Research of Concern."
KU_Leuven,2013," Purdue iGEM team started a project to bring a new standard to the datasheets. We gladly participated as we also consider this a serious problem. After filling out their first survey and giving suggestion for the datasheets, we filled in their Doodle and participated in their video conference. Next, we helped them out by filling in their second survey and making some more suggestions for their standardised datasheets.
Eindhoven
The 2013 TU-Eindhoven iGEM team started their ""synthetic facts"" project . With this they want to bring the world of synthetic biology closer to everyone (scientist & non-scientist) in a correct manner. They provide facts that are thoroughly analysed by different teams and given a final statement noting that the fact is either true, false or undecided. We were happy to contribute some of our time to checking a fact and got this nice medal for it!
BeNe(Lux) – UGent & Groningen
In the beginning of July, the idea of organising a debate attracted us. After consulting multiple people (Professors, PhD students,…), we found out that everyone noticed the need for such a debate. Furthermore, they advised us to give the general academic public an introduction on synthetic biology and iGEM. The idea was therefore extended to a symposium followed by a debate. We invited all teams of the BeNe(Lux), from which the team of UGent and Groningen responded positively. After introductory seminars by Prof. J. Robben and Prof. K. Verstrepen, and our own project presentation, we were pleased to welcome the team of Groningen. After a five hour drive they still kept their enthusiasm for the Symposium. After some ‘Belgian’ fries we were ready for the debate. The end of the day was closed with a reception where the people could further debate.

European Meetup at TU Delft
On the 7th and 8th of July, our team participated to the European iGEM Meetup in Delft.  The early presentations opened our mind to a lot of issues mainly about integrated human practices and the possibilities offered by bioinformatics to support the synthetic biology work.  We also had the opportunity to practice the poster session by introducing our project to the other teams. We shared a lot of feedbacks about projects, poster tips, suggestions about experiments, encouragements for the wet lab work and best luck for the clonings.  We truly had the feeling to establish beneficial dialogues with the other teams in order to do our best for the giant competition.
It was also a way to meet our interlocutors for collaborations and to build ephemera collaborations or longer collaborations to challenge other iGEMers for a Volley Ball play.  Indeed, this meetup was also a multicultural and socializing event. Teams coming from all corners of Europe were there. We shared our experience of the 2017 competition: the ""goods"" and the ""bads"" and learned to know each other through diversity.  The meetup ended with a tour in Delft. We discovered a city, between lands and canals and its historical attractions. This moment shared with our iGEM fellows had its own importance making us practice observation, curiosity and sensitivity which are the best allies for young scientists.
As final teaching from our expedition to Delft: gnothi seauton or know thyself. As the team just started lab adventure, this event allows to improve the cohesion and the complicity between three members of our team during a 22 hours bus trip to Netherlands and a 22 hours trip back to Toulouse. What an experience!
3rd Parisian Meetup
On the 21th of July, the Pasteur Team organized an event to meet other French teams. We had the opportunity for the first time to introduce our project in front of a judging panel and to discover other teams’ projects. It was a rewarding experience to have the point of view of other iGEMers and interesting reviews from scientists. At the Parisian Meetup, judges were here to point out problems in our mock-up Jamboree presentations, but it revealed itself useful to improve our general communication. Here are some examples of the feedback we received and the conclusions we made:

Filmed a biosafety video together with other 12 teams
Biosafety is one of the most important knowledge everyone should master before starting their experiments. Unluckily, biosafety education in China is far too lagged behind compared with the exploding need; not only because of the out-dated education material but also due to the language problem accessing such resources overseas.
We’ve taken part in an intercollegiate cooperation project to produce series of Biosafety education materials in Chinese. With the tremendous amount of work of our collaborating partners and our team members, the video collection was finally published online and freely available at our homepage on YouTube and Bilibili, a popular Chinese video-sharing website.
12 teams gathered together to film a biosafety video, every team took different topics, but all based on Yale biosafety manual.
Our theme is about transportation of biological materials.

  We choose ""reagent leak treatment"" as the theme and narrated a story through the form of melodrama. Two students missed the teacher's teaching because they were late in experiment class. They accidentally overturned the test tube containing ether while dropping the ether. Being panic, they opened the doors and windows immediately and asked the teacher for help. After the teacher handled the accident, he educated the students and mentioned what had happened before: solid reagent leakage treatment (take the case of sodium bromide leakage as an example) and the leakage treatment of ultra clean workbench medium.

We collaborated with three different teams in the 2016 iGEM season.        We assisted team Macquarie by making a graphical user interface on MatLab showing how the concentration of various intermediates including ALA (Y-axis) changes over time (X-axis) in chlorophyll.        We created a documentary for team Aix-Marseille focusing on the socio-economic and political issues facing the current platinum sector, including the Marikana strikes.        Team Heidelberg 2015 ran their MAWS software to provide us with a target specific aptamer, in exchange for numerous candidate PDB files for them to test their system on, as well as valuable feedback about how well their aptamer performed in our thylakoid binding experiments.       Furthermore, surveys from iGEM Evry , iGEM Groningen and iGEM UPO-Sevilla were posted on our social media pages, and we also provided content to iGEM XMU-China for their compilation of the iGEM Newsletter.

Collaboration with Aix-Marseille University
South Africa is regarded as having the largest platinum reserves in the world. The Merensky Reef stretching from southern Zimbabwe through to Rustenburg and Pretoria is the centre of platinum mining in South Africa. AMPLATS is the leader in platinum mining in South Africa, producing 40% of the total group platinum group metals. The Aix-Marseille University iGEM team identified problems faced by the mining sector which include limited sources, the use of hazardous chemicals to eliminate impurities, the disregard of safety measures and the lack of methods to recycle platinum next to highways.The solutions they came up with are to concentrate the platinum accumulated from roadside soil by phytoremediation plants and to transform it into nanoparticles. We assisted them by creating a documentary focusing on the socio-economic and political issues facing the current platinum sector, including the Marikana strikes. We also looked at the possible implications of their 2016 project. We"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook )."

We have cooperated with the iGEM teams mentioned above on InterLab study, public investigation and public activities and discussion of experimental problems, etc.
InterLab Collaboration
Our Interlab study was done in collaboration with two other teams (HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS). Before beginning the experiment, we carefully studied and discussed the official protocol provided by iGEM measurement together. Worldshaper-XSHS lends us their 96-well plates when ours are not adequately prepared. Moreover, when our first submission was failed, we together with worldshaper-XSHS and HFLS_ZhejiangUnited to analyze the data and find what the problem is. Thank you for their help given to us. We resubmit our data and was accepted by iGEM measurement committee on August 16. On the other hand, we offered the plate reader for them to do the InterLab study.

Besides the interlab study, we have many collaboration with Worldshaper- XSHS, HFLS-ZhejiangUnited as well as ZJU-China, since all our four teams base at Zhejiang University Zijingang Camps. During the summer, we visit each other quite frequently to discuss the technical problem and public activities. We borrowed the distribution Kit 1 and 2 from Worldshaper- XSHS and lent Kit 3 and 5 to them. Furthermore HFLS-ZhejiangUnited offered us the part eRFP when we failed to transform it twice. Then Worldshaper- XSHS met a great difficulty on transformation as well which blocked them project for more than one week, we discussed the all technical details together and help them find out the problem probably from their E. coli competent cells.
Public Activities Collaboration
According to the result of public survey, we found that the understanding of synthetic biology and genetic-modified related works is clearly"

Equipment Sharing
As this year a 96-well plate is required for parts shipment while the lyophilizer in WHU-China team and HZAU-China team was not working, they ask us for assistance on the lyophilization of samples before shipment. In order to share experimental resources and promote work efficiency, we undertook the job to help them submiting all the samples.
Help from HZAU
We met difficulties when amplifying the reporter BBa_E0040 because of certain unknown factors. Considering the limited time, we turned to HZAU-China iGEM team for help. Finally, with the construction of RBS+GFP-pSB1C3 plasmid generously offered from HZAU, they succeeded inserting the reporter gene GFP with RBS respectively to the downstream of the three ptrp mutants.
Others
Apart from these collaborations, we also tried to make collaborations away from Wuhan region. For example: We had planned to utilize a device NZAU designed as a fluorescence detector to achieve a part of our characterization work and help them test the accuracy of the device. But it was a pity that we did not achieve the cooperation this year, because we didn’t finish this corresponding reporter plasmid in time. And we also offered some reasonable advise to ZJU team on safety problems of their project, provided the ideas of kill switch in our previous project. But finally after deep considerations, for the reason of not suiting their project, they adopted another kill switch.
Conclusion
All in all, we have achieved several successful collaborations this summer. In the future, we aim at expanding the collaboration region and diversifying the cooperation content, such as helping high school teams with their project."

Warwick iGEM
We mini prepped and PCR’d part BBa_K314110 and sent it to the Warwick iGEM team after they had used up their own supply of the part from the iGEM kit plate. We were not using the part ourselves, so it was an ideal match.

iGEM Bordeaux
Team Bordeaux , having used synthetic biology to make curdlan for the purposes of protecting vinyards against Downy Mildew, wished to test how their curdlan would impact the environmental bacterial ecosystem when administered. As we had access to Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Pseudomonas putida, both bacterial species that can be found in the environment, we assisted Team Bordeaux in conducting toxicity assays against said bacteria using curdlan samples which they sent to us.
The work for this collaboration was conducted by our resident lab guru Leon, and his data and report can be found here.
National Chiau Tung University Formosa and National Taiwan University
Team member Lychee went to Taiwan to spend some time helping NCTU_Formosa in the lab by running a colonies PCR and gels, and by assisting with translation/improving the quality of English on their wiki.
He also visited iGEM NTU in their lab and gave them human practices advice based on some of own outreach ideas: school talks etcetera.

Toulouse,2015,"roas are numerous and weaken the new bees, the colony will weaken and will not be able to gather a lot of pollen to make honey.
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that most beekeepers told us they would be interested in a treatment against varroa that is efficient, ecological and respectful of the bees.
Turkey
All the beekeepers who answered our questions were informed about our project and the logic of synthetic biology.  Our participants were Prof. Dr. Ender Yarsan, Mehmet Erdogan, Kaan Keskin, Kursad Ceseroglu, Kursat Zeynel Utlu, Turabi Guney and Yasar Tekin. All of our seven beekeepers experienced the parasite: varroa. However, the beekeepers were mistrustful and thought that our project could be more  dangerous than useful and said that the drugs they use are enough to treat the hives.
We asked the beekeepers about the bee illnesses they knew and here is their answers: lime, nosema, American foulbrood, European  foulbrood, paralysis, septicemia, gravel and environmental illnesses.  Being prepared and having reserves against varroa is an important issue for them, too.
Measures against varroa and their efficiency
The measures the beekeepers took as prevention against  varroas were mostly of a chemical or biological kind, ranging from  drug applications (organic or not), to chemical sprays and treatments.
Still they said that the preventions are not really enough.  They prefer to use treatments such as Apivar, Bayvarol,  Perizin and Checkmite+. However, the drugs used against  varroa are imported  and thus they are very expensive  and difficult to acquire, beekeepers say.  For instance the drug called APIGUARD is €28 and  APILIFE is €40, which is quite expensive and  difficult to reach for a beekeeper. Also the beekeepers complain about the drugs being inefficient.

Pasteur_Paris,2016," biological threats such as epidemics, accidents, and terrorist attacks. We presented our project in front of the members of CIBU and exchanged ideas about our method of detection, our global device, and the intellectual property protection offered at iGEM. It was a great opportunity to obtain advice from specialists in epidemics and entomology specialists, and we have stayed in contact with them ever since for their recommendations and additional information.
City of New Orleans Mosquito & Termite Control Board
City of New Orleans Mosquito & Termite Control Board During the Zika Summit in Paris, we had the opportunity to present our project at the poster sessions. We met Dr. Claudia Riegel, Director of the City of New Orleans Mosquito & Termite Control Board and she engaged in an enthusiastic discussion on our project ideas in detail with us. She described to us the current mosquito issues New Orleans is facing. This was a great way for us to imagine real world applications of our project. (Since then, we have been in contact with her pertaining to a potential future collaboration where we could introduce our device in the field). We are currently processing reciprocal non-disclosure agreements.
Meeting with Dr. Anna-Bella Falloux
We met Dr. Anna-Bella Failloux; entomologist, head of Arboviruses and Insect Vectors (AIV) research unit in the department of virology at Institut Pasteur; to have detailed information on mosquito ecology/habitat (types: aedes, culex) and behavior during feeding sorties (anthropophily, hematophagy).
Meeting with Dr. Jessica Vanhomwegen
Dr. Vanhomwegen is part of the CIBU, as the head of the viral identification Team. She gladly listened to a presentation we made to explain our project, and accepted to help us devise an immunological assay for our device.
La Paillasse
La Paillase is self-described as a “multi-disciplinary network of laboratories providing the technical, legal and ethical framework for collaborative and open source projects, without discrimination based on age, diploma or income. It started as a squat in the Parisian suburbs in 2011 and is it now settled in Paris since 2014”. Our team had the chance to get a guided tour of the premises, and it is indeed a fantastic collaborative space, working like a big house where scientific labs coexist with a sewing workshop, a carpentry workshop, a startup company and study rooms! You can feel that the place is filled with creativity, and its occupants are constantly in contact with each other, sharing common spaces"
Lambert_GA,2018," to new spin columns in minipreps.
ECUST
Lambert iGEM sent a summary of this year’s project to ECUST. The word restriction encouraged the team to formulate a concise and clear description - a crucial factor to consider when writing an abstract. Additionally, by simplifying the project description, we made it more accessible to the general public.
Uppsala
Lambert iGEM recognizes that synthetic biology requires a lot of hard work and can often result in high stress levels. This can cause extremely dedicated members to feel discouraged or “burned out”. Team Uppsala created a survey addressing this issue. The survey allowed iGEM members to recognize and to address their issues with iGEM-related stress.
Exeter
Since both Lambert’s and Exeter’s 2018 iGEM project are based on water quality, the collaboration between both iGEM teams allowed members to investigate the source of the cause of poor water quality. Exeter iGEM asked for specific water quality reports in the United States. Researching this topic allowed Lambert iGEM to reevaluate this issue in the community, focusing in from the worldwide issue of clean water shortage.
Dalhousie
Since both Lambert’s and Dalhousie’s 2018 iGEM project are based on water quality, the collaboration between both iGEM teams allowed members to investigate the source of the cause of poor water quality. Dalhousie iGEM asked for specific water quality reports in the United States. Researching this topic allowed Lambert iGEM to reevaluate this issue in the community, focusing in from the worldwide issue of clean water shortage.
IIT Kanpur
IIT Kanpur’s project emphasizes the lack of clean water around the world, a major focus of Lambert iGEM’s project. This collaboration about water pollution allowed Lambert iGEM to recognize the presence and application of the project within the local community as well as worldwide.
HAFS
Since both Lambert’s and HAFS’s 2018 iGEM project are based on water quality, the collaboration between both iGEM teams allowed members to investigate the source of the cause of poor water quality.
