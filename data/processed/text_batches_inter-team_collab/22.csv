Collaboration with NEU_China
This year our iGEM team have developed cooperative relationship with NEU-China team，we have reached an agreement that to help each other examine the effectiveness of the biobricks.
Our team undertakes a few experiments to test whether the EGFP we received from NEU-China can be successfully express in E. coli.
Firstly, We digested the sequence of EGFP form pEGFPN2 vector with restriction enzyme KpnI and NotI. Secondly, we insert the sequence into pET14b which is commonly used as a prokaryotic expression vector.
vector.
The bands located at 720bp, it is equal with the length  EGFP coding sequence, this  gel graphic indicates that we had successfully cloned EGFP                 Then we transform the recombinant vector into E. coli. We had observed green fluorescence from the transgenic E. coli under a fluorescence microscope.
Collaboration with SJTU software
We have connected with SJTU_software. Their project is a social network service (SNS) platform or iGEMers, it provides service for team-team ommunication and laboratory management in teams. When the service is presented online, iGEMers can seek cooperation and share files through their platform. SJTU_software invited us to help them to test the website and give them some advice. We were offered a beta version of their website. Then we gathered several team members to try out their service and gave some useful advice.We are very pleased to have this cooperation with SJTU_software.

Our Survey
Nowadays, digital espionage is becoming a problem. Its main goal     is to steal information of private parties and use it in an illegal     way. Our project consists of the development of a system to store     encrypted information in bacteria. In addition, the information     will be secured with several biological layers that make it     digitally uncrackable. We would really like to know how society     sees our problem, therefore we made a survey. This survey contains     questions like; “Would you send an important highly-secret letter     to someone you trust by post or email?“, „Would you trust bacteria     to store your highly-secret information?“. More about this survey?     See this link .
This survey was sent to most of the participating iGEM Teams.     The teams who participated are: University of Westminster iGEM     2016, Paris-Saclay iGEM 2016, UPO-Sevilla iGEM 2016, Paris     Bettencourt iGEM 2016, iGEM Pasteur 2016, iGEM Sheffield 2016, iGEM     Leiden 2016 and TU Delft iGEM 2016. In exchange the teams got our     collaboration badge.

Cambridge Team You got us under the microscope
As a part of testing our bistable switch, we had to screen E. coli bacteria to detect fluorescence from GFP and RFP expression. Apart from the methods used in the lab, we also collaborated with the Cambridge iGEM team who designed the OpenScope microscope. (fig1) It is a 3D-printed brightfield and fluorescence imaging microscope that has the potential to be a low-cost tool accessible to anyone interested in microscopy. We therefore sent samples of bacteria expressing these proteins that they could use to test their microscope. As an outcome of this collaboration, we were also able to confirm some of our own results.
Fig 1: The OpenScope microscope designed by the Cambrigde team as seen from the side.
The samples we sent for imaging were: • DH5α –no plasmid, no antibiotic resistance, no fluorescence • DH5α - K1725103, Kanamycin resistance, GFP and RFP fluorescence • DH5α - K1725043 and K1725103, Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, RFP fluorescence • DH5α - K1725063 and K1725103, Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, GFP fluorescence • DH5α - K1725100 and K1725103, Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, GFP fluorescence with a few colonies expressing RFP The results that we received from the Cambridge team confirmed the presence of GFP in our cells agreeing with our results. (fig 2) Their microscope failed to detect RFP, but its expression was also confirmed by using a commercial microscope. It should also be mentioned that the brightness intensity of the fluorescent beads initially used is much greater than this of our fluorescent bacteria that are much smaller in size and dispersed on the plate. This can be seen in the Cambridge wiki page:
Fig 2: a) This image shows the negative control where there is no plasmid in the DH5α cells, and therefore there is no fluorescence. b) The second image shows clustered DH5a cells with K"
Amsterdam,2017," Knocking out the Fumarase proteins leads to a dysfunctional or a ‘broken’ TCA-cycle, since malate cannot be formed anymore from fumarate. This impairs the efficiency of the TCA-cycle and the production of amino acids; since some amino acids are formed from TCA-cycle intermediates (Waegeman et al. , 2011) (Fig 1a). Team Amsterdam faced a similar problem and aimed  to incorporate a glyoxylate shunt into Synechocystis to increase fumarate production. The glyoxylate shunt is composed of two enzymes, which are Malate Synthase and Isocitrate Lyase. They form a shortcut in the TCA-cycle (Fig. 1b).  In this way, the glyoxylate shunt restores some of the flux through part of the TCA-cycle, which should lead to a more efficient TCA-cycle. This is predicted to be beneficial for the cell in terms of fitness, as modelled by iGEM team Amsterdam.  For E.coli, a similar approach could be adopted, since E.coli can express the glyoxylate shunt genes to produce malate from isocitrate via glyoxylate. Thereby, in the process of producing malate, also succinate is formed. Because the cell can produce FADH2 by converting succinate to fumarate, the formed succinate will go to fumarate. In this way we are able to gain fitness and fumarate production, by having the glyoxylate shunt active.
Figure 1. The TCA-cycle with and without glyoxylate shunt. 1a). Fumarate is produced in a growth coupled way as a side product of arginine production. By knocking out fumarase, it cannot be degraded to malate. This way Fumarate accumulates. The TCA-cycle however is ‘broken’.1b). By expressing Malate Synthaese (MS) and Isocytrate Lyase (ICL), we can partly fix the ‘broken’ cycle. Now Isocitrate is made into both glyoxylate from which malate is synthesized and into succinate, which can be converted into fumarate. This way we have a better functioning cycle and more fumarate production thanks to the glyoxylate shunt.
However, when we look at the E. Coli physiology, the glyoxylate shunt genes are already present, but repressed by a repressor encoded by the ic"

We were fortunate to be able to collaborate with the UCSD iGEM team. Hoping to learn more about their project, we contacted them to set up a time to meet. Both teams were able to gain from this experience. Competing at the collegiate level, UCSD’s team provided us with tips and tricks to make our iGEM team as successful as possible. We, in turn, discussed our projects. They advised us on the transfection of our ecDNA and we informed them on the competition and how to improve their project for presenting. This experience was extremely beneficial to both of us and have future dates set up to discuss our respective projects even further.
Columbia
A couple members from the Columbia University's iGEM Team met with our team in order to discuss our projects and share ideas about putting our projects together. The Columbia iGEM Team mentored us by helping write our abstract, edit our writing, and look over our website. One of the Columbia team members is an alum of the TP-CC San Diego Team before going to Columbia University, so he was able to help move our team forward. Our meeting was very informative for all team members and also helped us get a glimpse into an Undergraduate iGEM Team. This was a part of our Human Practices effort to connect with teams from different places across the country.

WashU
We engaged in communication with WashU on the 8th August to discuss a potential collaboration. Their project aims to detect stem rust in wheat, caused by Puccinia graminis, and potentially find a way to create GM wheat resistant to the fungal infection. The team proposed we collaborated with them in two ways.
Firstly, their project uses a poorly characterised bacterial operon that responds to and is activated by the presence of ribulose. Consequently, as not much is known about the sequence, we offered to test the operons control region directly in plants, in case it had some activity. We did this by putting the control region upstream of two reporter genes, Gus and mCherry, with the NosT terminator downstream. We tested their control region both in the presence and absence of ribitol, a hydrogenated version of ribulose. The results can be seen below. In doing this, we had to create a version of their control region that was GoldenGate compatible. This is part BBa_K2810010 .
Figure 1. The results of our wetlab collaboration with the WashU iGEM team. We tested the expression of their ribitol control element in plants, linking it to two reporter genes. These were GUS (top), and mCherry (bottom). We found that there was expression of both reporter genes, independent of induction by ribitol, suggesting leaky expression. However, we suspect that the Ag"

‘We know surveys are not your favourite thing to do, but we have a few reasons why you should take ours!’. We completely agree with this opinion- people don’t like taking surveys... We had that feeling when we were conducting our survey about GMO- it was hard to convince people to write answers longer than one word. That’s why we were not wondering much whether or not to fill team’s LMU-TUM Munich questionnaire. We know how time consuming good survey preparation can be, not to even mention data analysis! So fully understanding what kind of task it is, we filled their survey entitled ‘Enabling Factors in Biotech’ with pleasure.
The survey contained many inspiring questions, which really allowed us to look at our project from a different point of view. Despite the fact that our group didn’t write business plan during  iGEM project, now when we see our promising results, we are starting to think about business founding. The survey focused our attention on very important issues, it visualized us that if we want to start our own business we should assess e.g. marketability of our project, define the size of the market and market competition. Thanks for this Hallie! We hope that our answers and whole obtained data will really help to promote the success of iGEM participants among scientific community.

It was our first contact with the other iGEM teams from Europe. The meeting was organized by two French groups: iGEM EVRY and iGEM IONIS. There was a poster session- it was a great possibility to exchange the ideas of our projects, ask questions and create collaborations. Our poster presented an expression system induced by sugars as well as our preliminary results connected with the dependence of the codon content on the fluorescence protein production. Then we took part in two synthetic biology conferences with researches from France. They raised interesting topics such as economical and ethical issues in synthetic biology. In"

MIT
In the beginning of the summer, we collaborated with MIT, specifically their Recombinase team. Several members of our team worked previously with recombinases and used this time to discuss several topics surrounding this body of work. These topics included structures of recombinase circuits, the phylogenetic tree of recombinases, as well as the orthogonality of various heterospecific site-recombinase pairs. In addition, we worked with the entire MIT team to prepare for the NEGEM #1 conference, practicing both presentations and responding to audience questions.
WPI
During NEGEM #1, we mingled with the other teams in attendance to potentially collaborate to improve experimental projects or human practices projects.  During NEGEM #1 we discussed with WPI how they were using fluorescent microscopy for their assaying technique, while we were using flow cytometry. In the spirit of iGEM and further characterization, we proposed a swap: we would run several WPI samples on our flow cytometer and aid in analysis, while WPI would view and image our circuits under their microscopes. In both cases, we were able to validate that our parts functioned as expected. Specifically, we found that our results were replicable under both assaying techniques.
BostonU Hardware
We collaborated with our fellow home team, BostonU HW (Hardware) to develop one of our Human Practices projects, a blog about intellectual property in synthetic biology and software. Uniformly, we agreed that intellectual property was an important topic to iGEMmers and synthetic biologists at large, and thus the disbursement of this information was critical. The first post was a team effort to introduce our readers to intellectual property, patents, copyrights, etc. and to establish the tone for our blogs.  Each subsequent post was then switched off so the wet lab team wrote one week and the hardware team wrote the following week.  Of course our bloggers, Castor and Pollux, always edited each other's work before it was uploaded. You can read our blog, ""Who Own"
HAFS,2018," and blood pressure. Type 1 diabetes is always treated with insulin, and Type 2 may require insulin and/or other medications. One such group of medications are called sulfonylureas. Sulfonylureas are used to treat Type 2 diabetes as they bypass the normal glucose-sensing mechanism to initiate insulin secretion. As a result, blood-glucose levels lower and the risk of secondary complications decreases. Unfortunately, prolonged treatment eventually exausts the insulin-producing beta-cells leading to a loss of blood sugar regulation. The mechanism by which chronic sulfonylurea treatment affects beta-cells is poorly understood.
    In their article, Remedi and Nichols injected slow-release pellets with a type of sulfonylurea called glibenclamide into mice. They then monitored the mice’s blood sugar levels. They found that the mice progressively developed diabetes and were unable to secrete insulin. After the drug was washed out, insulin levels rebounded. This study may seem simple, but it tells us that sulfonylureas do not cause irreversible damage or beta-cell death, and exhausted beta-cells can recover to produce insulin again. This study also utilized normal mice rather than genetically-modified mice, which alleviated concerns about potential defects in pancreas development in mutant mice. Future work should address the precise mechanism of reversible suppression of insulin secretion by sulfonylurea treatment.

Worst Gel electrophoresis Scrapbook
    In the entire course of iGEM, gel electrophoresis was one of the experiment that we dreaded the most. Gel electrophoresis did not only confirmed that our pcr, miniprep, and cloning was successfuly, but also often confirmed the very opposite: our failures for everything. As a team leader, I was always harrowed by nightmares the day before conducting gel electrophoresis and roll in bed the night after enzyme cutting. In fact, we do have heaps of photos that showcase epic FAILURES of gel electrophoresis.
Yes, we've been there. And Many times.
    From the same spirit, UNebraska-Lincoln coordinated a collaboration project named ""Worst Gel Electrophoresis Scrapbook"" and asked for iGEM teams to share the photos of some of their failed electrophoresis results. Being an expert at failing, we couldn't help but to participate. In fact, we had so many photos that we ended up sending two photos!

TU-Eindhoven,2018," Since we are also working with hydrogels, this connected us easily. We told them that we were aiming at making a living material using a combination of E. coli and dextran hydrogels. iGEM Hamburg was interested in implementing our system in their trap and this started our collaboration.
Our dextran hydrogel was designed to be very stable, as it contains anchored bacteria. Any rupture within the hydrogel could increase the risk of bacteria escaping. However this also brought along a problem. As the hydrogel was very stable, this caused difficulties dissolving our hydrogel. This was important as it would be very interesting to test the bacteria witin the hydrogel for viability and other characteristics. When we told iGEM Hamburg about this problem, they told us they wanted to help us as they had a lot of scientists on their team, and would like to do some experiments on the hydrogels. Therefore, we sent them some of our cubic hydrogels.
They incubated our hydrogels (190 mg) in 1 mL of aqueous solutions of NaOH, HCl, lactic acid and the Thermofischer GelEx-Kit Binding Buffer for 2 hours, and then checked for decomposition. Afterwards they checked again for decomposition after 24 hours.
Only the acqueous NaOH solution seemed to work as a dissolving solution, as after 2 hours the mass decreased to 165 mg. In acqueous HCl solution and in lactic acid solution, there was no change in mass. Interestingly in the Thermofischer GelEx-Kit binding buffer the hydrogel seems to take in the solution as the mass increased to 215 mg after 2 hours.
After 24 hours they measured again. In NaOH solution, the mass had decreased further to 150 mg. In HCl and lactic acid solution the hydrogel also seemed to start dissolving as the mass was 170 mg and 157 mg respectively. The mass of the hydrogel that was immerged in Thermofischer GelEx-Kit binding buffer increased even further to 235 mg.

After lunch time the    most interesting part began: the poster presentations. We realized next to the other posters our    was – although designed that way by choice – really minimalistic and simple but anyway we    did a great job and could get the others into our project. Altogether there were many    interesting projects presented and we’re excited to see them all in Boston when they’re    finished. In the evening we had a BBQ with all participants which were organized by Team    Delft, too. This was a really great opportunity for us to come together and talk with people all    from Europe and not everyone is being biologist. It was great to meet students from different    schools. The last day of this event we spent in Rotterdam on a Pannenkoekenboot. This means    All You Can Eat Pancakes. We enjoyed it. Sitting together with our new iGEM friends on a    boat driving through the Rotterdam rivers and eating All You Can Eat Pancakes. As I said –    we enjoyed. In the afternoon we walked through Rotterdam and went to a Beer Bar ‘De wilde    Hollander’ in Delft. We enjoyed Beer with the members from Newcastle and had long talks    into the night. On our last day in the Netherlands on the 9th of July we drove to Den Haag and    walked along the beach before we took our way home. Of course, every evening while talking    about the day we ate traditional Dutch cheese and drank different Delft Beer. I don´t want to    mention the monster spiders there in Delft because we’re on our way to forget them. And a    big thank you to those bus drivers who let us drive for free because the tickets are too    expensive.    To sum up, we all had an amazing, exciting and informative time in Delft and great thanks to    iGEM Team TU Delft for organizing this big event.

Collaborations and Interactions with Other iGEM Teams
UC Davis Promoter Characterization
The UC Davis iGEM team asked us to help in producing a multi-lab, extensive characterization of a commonly used part library - from the iGEM part kit! The team provided us with a protocol and a list of promoters from the parts registry. One of our team members (David Dinh) resuspended these parts from the kit, transformed them into DH5alpha cells and grew them according to their suggested protocol. RFP expression was collected from a plate reader and sent to the UC Davis team. The data we collected is also available here.
TU/Eindhoven: Synthetic Facts Project
This summer, the TU/Eindhoven team made a website which they hoped would serve as ""a Fact Checker to help members of the general public associate with the field of synthetic biology. (Their) Fact Checker will become available online and will allow users to both view and submit facts of their own.  Each submitted “fact” will be reviewed and commented on by respected sources. This way it is hoped that (they) can prove or disprove a number of myths about synthetic biology and thereby promote the idea of synthetic biology to the general public."" To help the team, we researched one fact that can now be found on their site by clicking the badge below.
University of East Anglia (Norwich, England) Project
The University of East Anglia team asked for help obtaining soil and sediment samples from various locations around the world. The team wanted to use the samples to test a biosensor that they are developing for their iGEM project. Our team member, David Dinh, went to Crissy Field and Heron's Head Park in San Francisco and dug up sediment samples that were then mailed to the East Anglia iGEM team."

We helped Nagahama
Abstract
We helped team Nagahama by constructing a model and running simulations. By calculating the sufficient amount of culture fluid of E.coli which produce Geraniol to preserve food in a certain lunch box. The project is about making a method of preserving food not by cooling but by flavor, ‘KOZOKO: Flavorator'.
Setting the situation and Method
We assumed a situation and constructed a model that we were preserving rice in a certain lunch box and laying the “Geraniol sheet” which contains concentrated Geraniol produced by E.coli on the bottom of the lunch box.
   The size of the lunch box was 10W×10D×4H. Rice was packed and the ‘Geraniol sheet’ was laid on the bottom of the lunch box. The “Geraniol sheet” was 8W×8D×0.2H. The sheet contained concentrated Geraniol produced by E.coli in a culture fluid.
   As we laid the “Geraniol sheet” on the bottom of the lunch box, Geraniol contained in the sheet started to diffuse. We calculated the least concentration of Geraniol in the sheet in order to have the Geraniol concentration be above the effective bactericidal concentration even after laying the sheet for 24hours.
Results
Fig. 7-5-1-1.The State of Diffusion in the xy Plain at z=0[mm]
Fig. 7-5-1-2.The State of Diffusion in the yz Plain at x=50[mm]
Fig. 7-5-1-3.The State of Diffusion in the xy Plain at z=40
We use the culture fluid that E.coli were incubated for 48 hours. After the 48 hour of incubation, the culture fluid contained 183mg/L of Geraniol.
From our simulation, the culture fluid of E.coli should be concentrated 10,000 times in order to have the Geraniol concentration be above the effective bactericidal concentration even after laying the sheet for 24hours. The sufficient amount of culture fluid which we calculated in order to preserve rice in the box was 128L under our model.
This work was done using Matlab. For more information see here .
We were helped by Nagahama

WLC Milwaukee
We first met Jack from WLC Milwaukee’s iGEM team through a chance meeting at Cornell, as we happened to be presenting at the same symposium as him. He introduced himself as a member of WLC Milwaukee’s iGEM team, and we quickly got to know each other. We worked with WLC Milwaukee to share some of the knowledge we’ve built up about iGEM, and what makes an iGEM team successful. Our conversation centered on team organization and practices that have helped us grow as a group. We wish them the best of luck at the 2018 iGEM Giant Jamboree!"

Connected Purdue team to a professor at MSU for use of a GC/Mass Spectrometry instrument
Quantification of Benzene  via GC/Mass Spectrometry
Dates of Collaboration: 10/7/17-10/16/17
Where: GC/Mass Spec Facility- MSU
-Dr. Dan Jones
Preparing Phage Lysate
Purpose- The overall genetic construct used to degrade benzene into acetyl-coA and pyruvate consists of 9 enzymes, and was broken into two plasmids to increase the success rate of cloning.  Purdue only has been able to clone the first of these two plasmids into E. coli, Upper Operon (UO). The upper operon expresses several enzymes pertaining to benzene degradation, however it does not express the protein transporter necessary for cellular benzene uptake. To get around this obstacle, you will test the induced cellular lysate instead of the living culture via GC. At the end of this protocol, you should have 30mL of uninduced cellular lysate and 30mL of induced cellular lysate.

Team TJUSLS_China
As a team with relatively insufficient experience, we have been actively seeking collaboration with other iGEM teams to discuss our projects and learn from their experience. Particularly, we have worked in close cooperation with iGEM 2015 Gold Medal team TJUSLS_China. Team TJUSLS_China is an iGEM team from College of Life Science, Tianjin University and it has been a team with outstanding performance They won one single gold award and two single nominations last year. Moreover, the campus of Tianjin University is adjacent to the campus of Nankai University, which made TJUSLS_China the team that we had the closest cooperation with.
During this summer, we had several meetings to discuss our projects and share the problems that we had encountered. We had learnt a lot from each of those meetings and we believe that the projects of both parties have been promoted through the enthusiastic discussions.
Meanwhile, we have provided them with fluorescence microscopy as well as necessary training and instructions according to the requirements of their experiment. They obtained delicate pictures and further confirmed their results using the microscopy that we provided.
Team Tianjin
iGEM team Tianjin comes from School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University. Their project this year aims to solve the problem of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pollution using biodegradation method by express an enzyme that is capable of efficiently degrade PET in various species of model microorganisms. Besides Escherichia coli and yeast, they also asked as for strains of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and corresponding expression vectors, expecting to express the PET degradation enzyme in more chassis organisms. We provided the strains and materials they asked for as well as necessary instructions.
Team HFUT-China & SJTU_China
This year, we also helped iGEM Teams HFUT-China and SJTU_China test their software.                 Team HFUT-China designed a piece of software used for construction of synthetic biology devices and analysis of gene relationship. The functions of this software are relatively simple yet practical. However, we have still discovered some obvious bugs by actually using this software. For example, the scroll bar could not function properly. Also,"

Collaborations
iGEM has always been a platform for students to collaborate and share valuable ideas. We extended the bond that National Yang Ming University (NYMU) and Taipei American School had last year and continued to provide each other with feedback and laboratory help.  They have been both an excellent Advisor Team and Collaboration Team.
 
NYMU -> TAS
NYMU has been extremely supportive of our project by providing parts, education and modeling data that is critical to make our project comprehensive.
We needed a protein to secrete our Granzyme B inhibitor, and we saw NYMU 2014 iGEM team used yebF as a motor protein. As a result, we reached out to the NYMU 2015 iGEM team and asked to see whether they still had yebF. They were happy to help and provided us with yebF and its sequencing results.
During the summer, NYMU also helped us by hosting a iGEM summer camp, where they allowed members from the 2015 TAS iGEM team and 2016 TAS iGEM team to attend and learn. (Image on right"

Finally they made some recommendations about web templates that are compatible with the wiki platform and which ones have  worked the best for them and where we could get them."
NKU_CHINA,2018," gave some guidance to them and tried our best to help their school build up an iGEM team.
As one of our contributions to the promotion of synthetic biology, we decided to make this popularization of science as an annual event.
5. Cooperate with Team OUC-China
When attending the CCiC conference, we met OUC-China fortunately and collaborate with them in public education and science popularization.
OUC-China provided a science brochure about synthetic biology we used when we promoted synthetic biology in Tianjin’s Middle Schools. The popularization of science was as important as the innovation of science and technology. It was the wings of innovation and development. We took synthetic biology as the foothold of science popularization and participated in the popularization of science together, which greatly improved the depth and breadth of science popularization and strengthened the inheritance of synthetic biology. This is an innovative cooperation.
6. iGEM League Conference in Beijing-Tianjin Region
On September 16th, NKU-CHINA participated in the iGEM league conference in Beijing-Tianjin region. We communicated our experiments and cooperated with other teams. In addition, we invited teachers from the Institute of Biophysics to guide the work of various iGEM teams, who are expert in modeling.
After our discussion, we decided to form a league to hold such a meaningful activity annually. Furthermore, we would do our best to apply for National Science Popularization Day with the help of the league.
7. The iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University
On July 6th, we held the iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University . This event aimed to promote communication and cooperation between nine universities iGEM teams, and at the same time carry out science popularization to show the charm and essence of iGEM. This was the first time that NKU-CHINA successfully conceived and held this large-scale collaboration activity. Each team introduced their experiments and look for teams that can cooperate according to our needs, the exchange atmosphere was warm and reflected a good collision of thoughts.
What’s more, to show the charm and essence of iGEM, and at the same time to better promote iGEM and synthetic biology among college students so that more people can focus on synthetic biology and participate in iGEM, each team introduced their experiments and preliminary work about synthetic biology on the basis of a common theme. After the report, the teams also answered the audience’s questions one by one in front of their own exhibition boards, expanding the public's understanding of synthetic biology.

UCAS,2017," medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With"
UNSW_Australia,2018," suggestions for the other’s project extension. We also discussed the types of models we planned to use with our scaffolds. Bettencourt asked for project modelling advice, which we provided by suggesting that they could use MatLab and Molecular Dynamics for their model, as we were in the middle of building our modelling tools. As part of this, we also sent them a copy of the code of our model to assist them. Bettencourt assisted our team by sharing laboratory techniques, and putting us in contact with a Parisian team (the Pasteur Institute Paris team) who were also considering the legal dimensions of their project as an element of their human practices.
One of Bettencourt’s enzyme scaffolds was based on the StarScaffold system developed by the 2016 Melbourne University team . Bettencourt asked us to try reach out to them for more information as they had no luck contacting them. We contacted the team leader from 2016 through our 2016 team mentors, and emailed the PI of the project, however, we also had no luck with receiving a reply.
Pasteur Paris
Human Practices Legal Collaboration
Our UNSW team also contacted the Parisian Pasteur Institute’s team via Skype, following the earlier suggestion by Bettencourt. Initial email contact had led us to ask Pasteur a series of tricky legal questions with which we were having trouble, but needed to understand for part of our human practices. The Pasteur team kindly wrote a summary of both the French patent system and how the European Union affects (and does not affect) this law, as intellectual property is a supporting competence in the European Union so there is exclusive national jurisdiction.
The Skype call expanded on these questions, and we compared the systems in which our different teams were working. They also spoke about the Paris High Court, a specialist intellectual property court, which led to further research, and eventually formed the basis of one of the suggestions for improving the law’s relationship with science elucidated in our policy proposal. It also laid the ground for our team’s further consultation with Dr Alexandra George.

Designing a Device to Characterize Starvation-Based Genetic Part
AUG - SEPT 2016 | A collaboration with the Northeastern 2016 iGEM Wetlab Team
We designed a microfluidic device for Northeastern University's iGEM team to help characterize their starvation-induced genetic part, by flowing cells through a set of cell traps placed after a gradient generator, then flowing two variable amounts of nutrients through the inputs of the gradient generator, causing a variable amount of nutrients to hit each cell trap, and cause a variable expression level of the starvation-linked fluorescence. Unfortunately, due to difficulties on both sides, the device and the cells to put through it were never realized. The preliminary sketches and designs are shown here, however.
Open Source Materials and Synthetic Biology
Open source materials encourage a cooperative and connected community in any field of research. It allows individuals and labs to easily share their ideas for others to build off of and can inspire even greater creations. So we teamed up with the BU 2016 iGEM Wetlab Team to investigate the current place of open source materials in Synthetic biology and how, moving forward, open source materials could impact the direction of the field. We recorded our findings biweekly through posts in a collaborative blog entitled ""Who Owns What"".

We spearheaded an RBS characterization effort across three different teams - ourselves, University of Pittsburgh iGEM,          and Alverno College iGEM - using three different biological systems: one in-cell, two cell-free solutions. We sent a          blinded version of the RBS library to University of Pittsburgh’s iGEM team, who then proceeded to characterize the          RBSs in the cell free system S30. We also sent a blinded library to the high school team Alverno, who characterized          them using Richard Murray’s TX-TL cell free system. Our collaboration brought about the first time in iGEM, to our knowledge,          of measuring the entire RBS community library over a variety of induction conditions. Such rigorous characterization of the          RBS library, and iGEM parts in general, is necessary to ensure the validity of the use of those parts. Particularly with the          RBSs, this characterization allowed us to have greater confidence in their ability to tune the amplitude of any given transfer          function. These parts were critical in securing a portion of our circuit control toolbox. They also provided the teams we         collaborated with the ability to use them in their own genetic circuits. Further, such rigorous characterization encourages -          and often requires - collaboration between teams.
We also collaborated with the high school team of Broad Run iGEM. Broad Run iGEM had used activities from our 2015 educational          outreach activity booklet in their outreach events. Our main Education and Public Engagement project is the creation of          learnsynbio.org, which is a collection of educational videos and materials for high-school age STEM students. We worked with          Broad Run to facilitate the incorporation of the LearnSynBio module into their advanced biology classes. We also provided          guidance and advice on the development and implementation of their mathematical modeling in MATLAB.
We also participated in the Interlab Study .

We gave them detailed feedback after using                         it, and shared our familiar experience with them about how to promote it to more and more high                         schools. In return, they did much work to screen several compatible strains, which were used by                         us to screen the suitable strain to produce our “smart yogurts ” combined with our constructed                         L. lactis. They went to the supermarket, bought various bands and different conditions of                         yogurt for them, including Classy·Kiss and CHENGUANG DAIRY, finally isolated several local                         strains, which were mailed to us for our strain screening plan.

In the present project, since the oral table administration of GSH and SAM have some                         disadvantages, such as low stability and short life span, here we tried to develop a novel                         in-vivo strategy of produce and deliver them simultaneously by using NICE system. In the                         experiment, two-functional GSH synthetase gene (gshF) and SAM synthetase gene (metK) were in                         tandem inserted into the expression vector (pNZ8148), and the resulted plasmid (pNZ8148-SG) was                         employed to construct the target vector pNZ8148-SGC by introducing adhesion factor gene (cwaA).                         This target vector was transformed to get recombinant Lactococcus lacti, which was employed to                         produce our “smart yogurt”.
The project is outlined with two stages：
Demonstrate the function of SC-L7Ae-mRFP1 by H14Z1_Hangzhou
As team XMU-China’s HSFCM data shown, OmpA-ST inside OMVs could be detected. To validate the                         ST/SC conjugation inside OMVs, they linked BBa_K2623022/BBa_K2623024 with BBa_K2623025 (NG5) to                         form BBa_K2623028 and BBa_K2623030 respectively. Hence, they need to demonstrate the                         SC-L7Ae-mRFP1 inside E. coli BL21 to validate its presence inside E. coli BL21 and therefore                         OMVs.

1-4. Antisense Method
The antisense method consists in inhibiting the production of certain proteins by using an antisense RNA that is perfectly complementary to the target nucleotide sequence, thus preventing its transcription.
In this case we are using the antisense method to prevent the production of the enzymes G6PD and PGI so by representing the binding of the antisense mRNA to the nucleotide sequence with a Hill equation we got the following equations .
$$ \frac{d[G6P]}{dt} = \frac{V_{max_1} [Glc]}{K_{m_1} + [Glc]} - \left(1 - \frac{\alpha_1[mRNA_1]^{n_1}}{K_1^{n_1} + [mRNA_1]^{n_1}} \right) * \frac{V_{max_2}[G6P]}{K_{m_2} + [G6P]} \\       - \left(1 - \frac{\alpha_2[mRNA_2]^{n_2}}{K_2^{n_2} + ["

iGEM European meetup Munich
On Thursday the 19th of July we went with 4 group members to the European iGEM meetup of 2018. This was a three day event starting on Friday. It started with talks about biotechnology and physics behind synthetic biology. Afterwards we had a chance to get into touch with companies like DNA biosolutions and Promega. The conference ended with a poster session in which we had opportunities to present a poster of our project to 32 other teams from all around Europe. Afterwards we continued with a tour and some evening activities to finish it off.
On Saturday there was more talks about relevant topics in synthetic biology. We also had more opportunities to speak about our project and meet more iGEM teams. On top of that we had a workshop session. We had opportunities to do several workshops of which we followed one which was given by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. In the workshop we worked together with people from different teams to focus on the design and safety of a certain project.
On Sunday there was a short session with two more scientific talks and some inspiring words by Randy Rettberg, the President of the iGEM Foundation!. All in all we gave, and received, a  lot of feedback and additional ideas from other teams. We also gained great opportunities for some sweet collaborations with other iGEM teams.

Postcard collaboration
In order to people more aware about synthetic biology we collaborated with iGEM Düsseldorf. We made postcards of our own project to show what synthetic biology is and how this is related to the iGEM competition. A lot of other iGEM teams also designed their own postcards and all contributing teams received their respective post cards. We’ll be able to hand these out to people all over the world to show them how"

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Crazy fan of Arya Stark
Jiang who wants to study alchemy is a sophomore majoring in chemistry at UCAS.
Though sufferring the frustrating failures which shouldn’t have been experienced at his age, he learned a lot and knew better about synthetic biology. Through all this one-year journey, he confirmed his ideal again to attempt establishing the biological world based on axiom system.

On October 4, to prepare for the upcoming Giant Jamboree, our centre has hosted high school teams in Northern China have met. Meet up information was posted on the iGEM website in advance.
Firstly, at the beginning of the meeting, our team members Sally and Celina gave a welcome speech. Secondly, each team has a presentation. The instructors judge these projects and give valuable advice to these teams. Finally, we share our experiences each other. We also discuss how to improve our projects and how to do better in the next year.
With CIEI-BJ
2018 CIEI-BJ
In summer vacation, we participated in a meet up hosted by CIEI-BJ. We knew many iGEM members of the different team, such as BIT-China, USTBeijing and CIEI-BJ. Each team has done a presentation. Our team instructor Mary du has given valuable comments and advice for these team. Meanwhile, we receive some advice from the instructor Arya Qu of CIEI-BJ and other instructors. We focus on Implementation of experimental plan.
After that, we often communicate with the members of CIEI-BJ through Wechat or telephone. During our experiment, we need to use plate reader to measure fluorescent intensity and OD 600.   During CIEI-BJ experiment, they need to use chromatograph to measure the amount of aflatoxin。We discuss the Instrument usage and procedure together In addition to this，Mary Du often communicate with Arya Qu about part requirement, part submission, wiki editing and so on.
Communication promotes the development of the project, adds a lot of fun to the preparation of the project, and we have been friends.

Induction of colitis by TNBS
There are several ways to model IBD[1]. Team SYSU-MEDICINE used a drug TNBS (2,4,6-trinitro benzene sulfonic acid) to induce colitis, thereby modeling IBD. In analogous to human IBDs, the IBD mice shows many similar symptoms including intestine inflammation and weight loss. The experimental flow is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Figure 2. Diagram of the TNBS induced colitis. hEGF (5 μg in 25 ml enema) or saline enema was performed in Day 8.
TNBS colitis procedure
On day 1, carefully shave a 1.5 × 1.5 cm field of the skin of the mouse using an electric razor. To avoid the mouse from touching TNBS (may potentially induce oral tolerance), preferentially select an area on the back between the shoulders.
While holding the mouse with one hand, apply with the other hand, using a 200 ml pipette, 150 ml of the TNBS presensitization solution to the shaved abdominal skin. The solution is absorbed by the skin quickly. Control mice are treated with presensitization solution without TNBS. Leave the mice until day 8.
On day 8, weigh and mark the mouse.
Anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 150 ml of 5％ chloral hydrate solution per 20 g body weight.
Fit a 3.5 F catheter to a 1 ml syringe and fill with TNBS solution.
Insert the catheter into the colon 4 cm proximal to the anus. Proceed carefully to avoid damage or perforation of the colon wall.
Slowly administer 150 ml of TNBS solution per 20g body weight into the colon lumen.
Remove the catheter gently from the colon and keep the mouse with the head down in a vertical position for 60 s. To get reproducible results, it is important to ensure that the TNBS solution remains completely in the colon lumen.
Return the mouse to the cage.
hEGF alleviates IBD symptoms
The IBD mice showed many symptoms, including weight loss and colon length reduction (Fig. 3 and 4). As illustrated in Fig. 2, we sacrificed mice after 5-day treatment with hEGF or saline, and measured the weight changes over time, as well as the colon length"

Intro:
Starting this summer, we have formed connections and maintained communications with other high school and collegiate teams, and we are glad that we could offer our help to some of the teams, and happy to receive theirs.
FAFU-CHINA:
We helped FAFU-CHINA contact Zady Cytille, an international graduate student from Cote d’Ivoire, now studying in the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, to introduce their project and get feedback from him based on the conditions of his home country. ( See also )
BNDS_China:
We provided our TAKARA restriction enzymes to BNDS_China to help them with double enzyme digestion. Since high school teams do not usually have the financial support from school, most of the lab materials used by BNDS are purchased by their team members. We are very happy to share our lab resources and help keep their experiments going and make their project come true. ( See also )"

Throughout the course of our project, the Northeastern iGEM Team has collaborated with the following organizations and iGEM teams from other institutions.
Harvard University iGEM Team
The Harvard iGEM team has been a valuable collaborator during the last couple of months. The Northeastern team has worked with the Harvard team to help characterize four of their PETase producing plasmids. These plasmids were characterized using a fluorescence intensity assay after inducing the transfected bacteria with IPTG. Results showed a significant increase in fluorescence in bacteria containing the PETase plasmids as well as a significant decrease in growth when compared to a negative control. The Harvard team has been working  to confirm the expression of our NOX protein in BL21 cells as well as His-tag purifying the protein. We are excited to see the outcome of those experiments and are grateful for the collaboration effort between both Northeastern iGEM and Harvard iGEM.

After our presentation, we were asked about how our project would deal with false positive results to which our team member was able to provide a clearer insight into what we aim to achieve. The occurrence of such false positive results is due to the differential binding of primers. We were able to troubleshoot our project due to timely inputs from the audience. We received a general positive feedback for our project.
The second day concluded with the remainder of the presentations, a guest lecture and progressed to a team dinner. We were also given a campus tour of Indian Institute of Sciences, Banglore. At the end of the meet, not only did we have an exposure to the projects of the other Indian teams, we also have a fair share of insights into the functioning of our project as well. The interdisciplinary discussions facilitated by the meet turned the experience wholesome. We are happy to have been a part of the initiative.

It is the long history of humankind (and animal kind, too) that those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.
Charles Darwin
We believe that collaboration is one of the most important facets of the iGEM competition. It is only natural that certain teams will have skills that others lack and vice versa. The great advantage of working within the iGEM framework is that we are stronger together than we are apart. In light of this we worked with as many teams as possible in order to achieve as much as we could, while helping other iGEM teams to do the same. Overall we collaborated with 12 iGEM teams from 9 different countries. Without them, our project would not have been the same.
Edinburgh UG Collaboration
Initially we set out to design a CRE-Lox based “kill switch” for our system. It was during this time we discovered that team Edinburgh UG was working on creating a recombinase based tool kit. After reaching out to them we held a video conference in which we each presented our projects and discussed how we could collaborate in a meaningful and effective way. We discovered that team Edinburgh had created an extremely powerful mathematical model capable of predicting crucial, and application specific, information regarding recombinase usage. Team Edinburgh generously offered to simulate our “kill switch” design using their advanced model. The information they provided us allowed us to modify our plans and more confidently proceed with our chosen ""Kill Switch"" . Additionally, we tried very hard to coordinate a wet-lab collaboration in which we were meant to further characterize one of team Edinburgh’s many recombinases and compare it with their modeling predictions. Unfortunately, different academic schedules and a lack of time did not allow us to complete this final task.
Team Edinburgh also conducted an in-depth analysis of the"

""We are constructing a device that is induced by IPTG and that gives lysis enzymes and GFP as the outputs because, in order to elute methanol we need to kill our modified cells that convert ambient methane to methanol and the reason why we want GFP as one output is to be sure that it works. Our modelled device has promoter induced by IPTG, RBS, gene coding GFP and lysis cassette ending with cell death and we are glad to have it and it's working how we expected. So then, we use M4B to see that if it finds the exact device or the device that can do the same job. Since the software has only one place for output, we queried IPTG as an input and GFP as an output on the software and got corresponding 117 results. These results contain devices exactly what we have one for the same operation. However, we couldn't find the lysozyme output for the IPTG input in the software.""
We are pleased to hear the feedback of METU-Ankara Team and it's good the know that their first query on our software was successful. As for the second one, we haven't included DNA, RNA and tags yet. It's one of our future plans and next year, it'll be done. Furthermore, queries with multiple inputs or outputs will be available. So, in one operation, they will be able to get what they want. See our future plans on the next version .

NUS Singapore
Wilbert from the Singapore University team was extremely helpful, assisting us with any number of iGEM components and technicalities. He enthusiastically gave us pointers about the Jamboree as well as the iGEM “Do’s and Don’ts”. Because this is our first year participating in the iGEM competition, Wilbert meticulously explained some of the more obscure steps to achieve medal criteria. Most importantly, Wilbert graciously helped us with the Modeling component of our project involving the substitution of various Ribosomal Binding Sites. We can't wait to meet him in November!
Cadets2Vets/USMA- West Point/USNA Annapolis
Our team held a long Skype discussion concerning the iGem process and goals, as well as the Interlab , wiki details, and activities at the Jamboree with the teams from the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marines. The US Navy team advised us to complete the Interlab carefully and to use the already provided Excel spreadsheet. On our side, we guided the US Army team with troubleshooting their project. After the video conference, we were able to finish the Interlab swiftly with few hiccups.
Michigan State Meet-up
We attended the mini-Jamboree/meet-up on July 29th at Michigan State University. It was an awesome experience with several teams from across the Midwest gathering to discuss their projects. Our team gave a short presentation and received both criticism and praise concerning our work. It was fascinating to learn about the research and progress of the other iGEM groups! After the presentations, we talked with members from the other teams about everything iGEM!  We even spoke with an iGEM veteran who gave us extremely insightful advice on the inner workings of the Jamboree."

In turn we sent them the L-arabinose they needed to test their construct, as they did not have this resource available. This two way collaboration was great for both teams!
Wageninger UR Team collaboration
The Wageningen UR Team contacted us asking for help with their human practices, as they are developing a diagnostic test kit for Zika and other diseases, they wanted to know more about the issues in dealing with infectious diseases and whether their technology could help to tackle some of these issues. We talked about personal experiences and also managed to speak to Tatiana Mingote, from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and forward her answers to the dutch team's questions. We also exchanged thoughts and experiences about our projects and got some ideas of complementartity of our technologies, which both aim to help the fight against infectious diseases.
IONIS-PARIS Team collaboration
We had a great skype talk, followed by further conversations, with team IONIS-Paris which is working with temperature driven sensors to cope with climate impact on agriculture. For their Human Practices , they had a plethora of good questions about GMO regulation laws as well as the innovation atmosphere in synthetic biology in our country. It was great to contribute to such an interesting human practices approach."
OLS_Canmore,2016," from funding to founding a company.  Since our aim is to implement our construct industrially these kinds of questions are ones that we need to consider.  By participating in these surveys it gave our team a chance to consider things we may not have otherwise considered had someone not brought the subjects to our attention.
Our team strongly believes in contributing to the larger scientific community through research, mentoring, ethical reflection, and providing feedback.  For this reason we are always eager to collaborate with iGEM teams, or other synthetic biology teams and groups.  In the true spirit of collaboration, these experiences are beneficial to all parties involved either by providing specific knowledge or by unexpectedly inspiring an idea to improve each other’s projects.  For these reasons we’d like to say thank you to all the teams that collaborated with us this year!  And thank you to all the teams who interviewed us as talking to other iGEM teams is always a great experience!

iGEM Duesseldorf - Promoter Optimisation Tool
To read more about our promoter optimisation tool, please click here .
We received three inducible promoter sequences from the University of Düsseldorf iGEM team. We ran each sequence through an online algorithm ( see here ) to determine the likely -10 and -35 sites in each promoter. This was done in order to accurately compare the Düsseldorf sequences to the promoters in our database. Our tool works by assigning activities to each individual nucleotide at a particular position, so aligning the sequences this way was important). As the sequences we used for our project (obtained from Jensen and Hammer, 1998) were each only 60 nucleotides long, and Düsseldorf’s promoters were longer, we unfortunately could only optimize a small section of each promoter that contained the -35 and -10 sites. We have highlighted the parts of the promoters we were able to optimize in yellow.
We began designing the promoters to increase their relative activity. However, we realised that as Düsseldorf were using inducible promoters, they likely wanted to keep readthrough expression levels low. Therefore, we also determined the most optimal sequences for keeping readthrough expression levels low, with the results shown below.
The sequences that have been optimized for increased activity are highlighted in green and the ones that have been optimized for decreased activity are highlighted in red.
The estimated activity change for each new sequence can be found just below the sequence itself, labelled as either ""relative increase"" or ""relative decrease"".
We hope that these promoters will be useful for iGEM Du"

Collaboration is an important part of the iGEM competition. We worked with three different 2015 iGEM teams to achieve different goals.
Valencia (UPV) team
The Valencia (UPV) team are also working on plants. (Together with the Cambridge team we will be participating in the Plant Workshop at the Giant Jamboree).
We also received plant parts from Valencia-UPV,  which we tested in the plant chassis, Nicotiana tabacum, in a transient assay. We recorded the result using confocal microscopy.  We also sent them the ‘MoClo Flipper Constructs’ made by the NRP-UEA iGEM 2014 team, allowing them to easily convert their GoldenGate parts to standardised BioBricks. The Valencia-UPV team helped us by testing our plant-expression constructs in their laboratory.

Manchester-Graz team
The Manchester-Graz team are also working on a project centred around the gut microbiome. We learned this because our PhD adviser, Sibyl, met their supervisor at a carbohydrate conference in May 2015.
Manchester-Graz have developed an expression system designed to regulate single and multi-gene pathways for an intestine expression. They helped us to model butyrate production in the gut. We exchanged parts to conduct reciprocal testing experiments but have so far not been successful in collecting data.

NCKU_Tainan,2018," to collaborate with each other.                                         Their project has two parts. The main part is E-coding, which use E. coli to                                         store data. Another part is to sense the pollutant in river of Mexico, which is                                         the part that we could link our work. We had constructed a pH sensing biobrick                                         which express fluorescence under low pH condition, they suggest us to                                         incorporate our pH sensing construct in their pollutant sensing system, making                                         their system become more complete. Therefore, we shared our plasmid map and                                         construction protocol with them, which they can be used to construct the                                         biobrick in the future.
Also, we found out that the new combined sensing system can be applied in our                                         bioreactor as they aim to sense pollutants such as nitrate, phosphate or heavy                                         metals. This will be a useful alert system for our bioreactor since the flue                                         gas may contain pollutants especially heavy metals that are highly toxic to the E. coli.
Through this collaboration, we not only combined two sensing system, expanding                                         its application field, but we also found a more complete sensing system for our                                         device.

Mammalian cell culture in microfluidic devices
Purpose
Microfluidic device fabricated by BU Hardware iGEM Team.
Integration of microfluidic devices has advanced considerably in quantitative biological research [1][2]. The timing of the fluid flow can be regulated with high accuracy because of the short response time of in-chip membrane valves (as quick as 1 ms)[1]. Moreover, with the aid of hydrogel, cells growing in microfluidics can be structured in three-dimensional geometries [1]. Therefore, cell culture performed in microfluidic devices could resemble in vivo conditions due to tight control of the microenvironment [2].  On the other hand, automation is another advantage of microfluidic technology. Instead of manual intervention, programmable fluid flows can automatically change chemical conditions of the culture environment. This feature would be particularly useful to examine dynamically changing systems [1]. The ability to precisely control fluid flows and chemical species as well as the automation of microfluidic technology are highly beneficial to future development of our project. Thus, the MIT iGEM team decided to collaborate with the Boston University Hardware iGEM team to develop a protocol for mammalian cell culture in microfluidic devices .
How does microfluidics benefit our project?
Automatically simulates estrogen and progesterone cycle in vitro cell culture
Resembles dynamically changing estrogen and progesterone concentrations
Dynamically monitors cell response and output gene expression
Collaboration
We collaborated with the Boston University Hardware iGEM Team to culture mammalian cells in their microfluidic devices.  We started with the simplest experiment, which is growing HEK293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) cells in a microfluidic device. We performed the experiment with two different device models.

*This year we collaborated with another iGEM high school team in Shenzhen, the SZMS_15_Shenzhen. Besides communication on projects and team founding, we help and assist each other achieving experimental or Modeling goals. We helped them achieve an experimental goal in their experiment “Houyi shoots the sun”part. “Houyi Shoots the Sun” We constructed this system with two different kinds of E. coli bacteria, one representing the sun and  the other representing Houyi. The working mechanism is described in the following: first we transform a plasmid with the serial EC 1.7.7.2 to simulate the sun. EC 1.7.7.2 is a sequence of an enzyme that catalyses an exothermic reaction., causing the E. coli representing the sun to rise its temperature constantly. It should be noted that the expression of EC 1.7.7.2 is regulated by LuxI through the QS system. Second, we transformed a plasmid containing LuxI into another kind of E. coli representing Houyi. Due to the fact that the expression of EC 1.7.7.2 can be repressed by the presence of LuxI, the E. coli representing Houyi can effectively lower the temperature of the previously described E. coli with EC 1.7.7.2.

ETH_Zurich,2018," electroporation at 0.9 kV to successfully transform cells.
Results
20 aliquots were stored at -80°C in the freezer (room 3.80)
Electroporation
Introduction
This protocol was provided by the Marburg iGEM team to perform their InterLab study with Vibrigens.
Materials
Recovery media 10 aliquots (a’ 500µL )(BHI + v2 salts (204 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM KCl, 23.14mM MgCl2), and 680 mM sucrose)
Preheat the aliquots with the recovery medium to 45 °C ( pipetting mixing with cold cells and resuspending in chilled cuvettes will cool down the media )
Agar plates (LB + v2 + 1% agarose + 2 µg/ml chloramphenicol (Cm))
Procedure
Take nine aliquots of the prepared competent cells and place them on ice.
1µL of the Plasmid DNA (100 ng/µL) and the electrocompetent cells are combined and gently mixed (NO VORTEX, avoid foaming) in a chilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
(each aliquot gets one 1 µL of another plasmid from the box one aliquot is a control and will later not be plated out on a plate with antibiotics)
The cell-DNA suspension is transferred to a chilled electroporation cuvette with a 0.1 cm gap size
Cells are electroporated with the following settings: 900 V, 25 mF, 200 Ω (Eppendorf electroporator)
Cells are immediately recovered in 500 μL (one aliquot) preheated (45°C) recovery medium and transferred to a 1.5 mL tube
The cells are recovered by incubating at 37 °C for 1.5 h. (also put the agar plates for preheating in the incubator at 37 °C)
The cells are centrifuged down at 3000x g, most of the supernatant is removed
The pellet is resuspended in the leftover media (approx. 50 µL) and plated out on warm agar plates (37 °C) containing the appropriate antibiotic (2 µg/ml Chloramphenicol - Cm)
The plates are incubated for several hours or overnight at 37 °C for colonies to appear. Check the rest of the InterLab Protocol to keep track of colony growth

KUAS_Korea,2017," part submission and some other fulfilments for medal criteria, which can be often too overwhelming to manage all by themselves. This also actually helped us to look back and go through our own works and make sure that everything was properly managed to be reviewed and rewarded.
Overall, during the whole process of communication and content sharing, we gained valuable learnings on cooperation from their genuine thoughts and authenticity towards the project.
2. Manchester
With the team Manchester , our team has participated in the project of compiling legal and administrative regulations upon GMMs. In this project, 2~3 teams from each continent were allocated to answer 7 questions about the regulation (i.e., What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?). Us KUAS_Korea have addressed the answers via information provided from Korea Biosafety Clearing House, the government agency regulating the biosafety and GMOs. Additionally, we were designated to summarize the answers to the second question; Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis? We anticipate that this project will comfort many teams from IGEM and other stakeholders to easily inquire concurrent trends of GMM regulations from many different nations.
In the course of our investigation and comparing Korea’s regulation with other nations, we have discovered some legislation deficiencies. Thus, we decided to get in touch with the member of Congress who belongs to the biosafety committee. Further information is elaborated on the human practice page of team KUAS_Korea.

COLLABORATIONS
This year we participated in two major and six minor collaborations with both high school and university teams. Our largest collaboration component was the publishing of 2 papers in an online peer-review synthetic biology journal called BioTreks.
We also collaborated with the Lethbridge high school team. We worked on an ethical review of their project, as well as provided an insight from the perspective of our faith.
Lethbridge worked with our parts to characterize them. Through this, we helped them answer different ethical and faith  related questions that they had.
For other collaborations different members of our team were interviewed by other teams on how iGEM affected both their education and personal life. We also began mentoring a team from a high school that has just begun their synthetic biology career, shared our research with a team that is over 6,263 miles (10079.32 kilometres) away from us in Taiwan, and participated in many, many surveys.
University of Lethbridge
Our collaboration with the Lethbridge team began in mid-August and consisted of their iGEM team testing our construct, and us conducting an ethical review. Originally we had planned to also test their project but due to the nature of their project (working with blood) we would not have been able to do any relevant testing, because we are working out of a catholic high school.
For the ethical review, we answered in-depth, four main ethical questions and one faith question.  The completed review can be viewed in pdf format by clicking here .  It's a great read and we strongly encourage everyone to take a look at it because it raises some very interesting ideas and considerations.
Once we had completed the ethical review of their project they then conducted tests on our project as they are working out of a university lab and so we hoped that they could perform tasks we were unable to successfully complete. They ran a gel for us and a miniprep since we were struggling to properly miniprep and isolate our plasmids from cultures.  However, due to reasons talked about in the 'Results' page the results from Lethbridge only further confirmed a synthesis error.
Two weeks before the jamboree (October 13th) we discovered why were having so many issues transforming, cloning, and miniprepping. "

They provide general advice throughout the duration of the project including on CAS agar plate preparation. They also provided the use of a plate reader for us to complete the interlab study and -80 C freezer to store glycerol stock of our transformed BL21 cells for later gene expression experiments.
We sent our cell samples after IPTG induction to them and they performed a rust test indicating siderophore production and could also use our cells producing vibrioferrin for their own experiments.
After our successful CAS agar plate tests we provided some of our batch to iGEM ECUST for them to test their own project designs.

AHUT_China,2016," displayed and deeply explained our project, to which they gave some great advice such as taking time into consideration in case of traffic congestion to optimize our path planning, shifting the current quaternary system to ternary or binnary system to improve the efficiency in solving comparatively short distances and so forth, which were all very practical, valuable and meaningful.When furthering our understandings, we came to realize some obstacles getting in their way which we might be able to help. In the end, we made decisions about assisting them with producing a practical model designed by them through our 3D printing technology. The practical model is a physical unit which can degree 3-PBA thoroughly and sterilize agricultural waste water. Through our concerted efforts, we have successfully helped them produce the real model of their physical unit, which will be applied to the field to purify farmland runoff water. And we are really looking forward to the physical unit being put into the farm widely and helping to clean up the rural sewage.
（As above pictures presented, the machine was printing the physical model.）
Collaboration with UESTC-Software:
(https://2016.igem.org/Team:UESTC-software/Collaborations)
We helped team UESTC-software to accomplish the part of software testing. They were the developer of the software Bio101. For they need someone who can do an objective testing. We tested the fault tolerance and randomness of Bio101 as their first user and offered them with a software testing report. Meanwhile, we analyzed bzip2 compression algorithm they used in Bio101 through building mathematical modeling. And our members found some problems when using Bio101 in respect of restoring and extracting DNA data. After further analysis, our team made some suggestions to them. Through our cooperation, both of our teams firmly believed that the problem of storing an astronomical number of our pathway information could be solved. Also, their project Bio101 can be put into practice and be got upgraded.
Collaboration with JSNU-China:

iGEM Development Environment
We have collaborated with the 2017 UK Bristol iGEM team this summer in order to use and test their new tool called the 'iGEM Development Environment' also known as 'IDE'.
 
The IDE is a local testing environment created by the Bristol iGEM team. The environment would allow users to deisgn and upload their entire wiki pages after fine-tuning to the users desired end product. The IDE also has an in-built feature that avoids unwanted interactions between the users navigation bar and  iGEM's own navigation bar. This environment was perfect for our purposes!
 
The IDE was very useful to our team since our team members are proficient in many coding languages... except HTML coding! This was just our luck, however, once the Bristol team had contacted us via Skype we quickly realised their software is just what we needed for our main wiki editor (Jake) to get going with our wiki design.
 
We were not able to use the IDE to upload our entire wiki to the iGEM website as intended since we had already started when the Bristol team had contacted us. Nevertheless, we were able to use it to design each page of the wiki.

Freeze-dried Cell Revival
In September, we sent our freeze-dried cells out to Groningen and Sheffield in order to see how reliable the fluorescence from our keys can be read after revival using a set method.
 
The Key. coli key will contain freeze-dried cells that will produce a specific fluorescence spectra that will be compared to the ""lock"" colony in order to gain access to the locked appliance using our own software. Before this, the freeze-dried cells must be revived.
 
This was a very important collection of collaborations because we will need to know the required time to obtain sufficient fluorescence after revival as well as how easy to follow our revival protocol is for potential users. To see the results that Groningen and Sheffield collected for us, have a look at our results page

UCAS,2017," order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for"

We participated to the translation of several projects from other teams in French (KU Leuven, Moscow_RF, Tec Chihuahua, UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB and XMU-CHINA).                     The goal was to help the team Leuven to inform everyone about what is iGEM and what the students achieve during this competition in different languages and be accessible to everyone. It is also a great way for them to get in touch with synthetic biology and genetic manipulations, something that is currently held back and limited due to negative perceptions by the masses.
Here is SofterShock translated in 5 languages:

We first got acquaintance with Jilin_China in Nankai Conference and kept contact with each other afterwards. To ensure the repeatability of our data, we sent C-terminal and N-terminal of ECFP to them, requesting them to test whether we have split the protein right. Meanwhile Jilin_China works on RNA thermosenser this year and they need to test the expression of sfGFP in different temperature, indicating in what condition the designated thermosensor is open. We gave a helping hand by examing wheather their positive control will change with different temperatures.

BioBrick Tutorial with SDU-Denmark and UNIK-Copenhagen
The DTU BioBuilders 2016 hosted a BioBrick workshop during the Spring (May 6th - May 8th) for the other Danish iGEM teams; SDU-Denmark & UNIK-Copenhagen.
The scope of the workshop was to introduce all three teams to the BioBrick standard, get a feel of working with it in the laboratory and get to know the other Danish iGEM teams. During the weekend we had planned different lectures that all contributed to a better understanding of BioBricks and iGEM in general.
Our supervisor, Christopher Workman, gave a judging perspective on the iGEM competition and we discussed the gold medal requirements. iGEM alumni Pernille Neve Myers and Viktor Hesselberg-Thomsen from DTU BioBuilders 2015 held a lecture about BioBricks and 3A Assembly along with exciting exercises in the laboratory. The tutorial also had another aspect, namely the design and development of the wiki. Here, we had this years SDU-Denmark team give us a presentation of general advices for a good wiki and alumnus Mads Anderson introduced the “Wiki-Wizard”.
Beside having an educational weekend, we had a lot of fun and got to know the other iGEM teams in Denmark!
The weekend was a great success and gave the Danish teams a great foundation for collaboration and fun during other meetups and during our projects. In"

We are participating along with the NRP-EUA-Norwich team and Cambridge team, which also are working on plants in the Plant Workshop about PLant Synthetic Biology at the Giant Jamboree.
The NRP-EUA-Norwich team send us the MoClo Flipper Constructs designed by the 2014 NRP-UEA (BBa_K1467100, BBa_K1467100, BBa_K1467200, BBa_K 1467300 and BBa_K1467400). Thanks to these plasmids we were able to convert easily our GoldenBraid parts to BioBricks. In addition, we improve the characterization of this parts. Finally, they sent us four parts tagged with YFP (BBa_K1618029, BBa_K1618030, BBa_K1618031 and BBa_K16118032). They are acyltranferases candidates with the aim to acylate starch fused to YFP,  that makes them an expression construct
We transformed their parts into Agrobacterium tumefaciens. After two days we make a subculture. Next day we infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves; after four days we took samples and imaged them on a confocal microscope. We observed them localized in the cloroplasts as expected.

We reached out to various iGEM teams around the world with the invitation to join us for a virtual conference where we all exchange ideas and gain feedback to better our respective projects as well as our human practices.
A proposal was sent to all the various teams we had interacted with throughout our project
The conference began with 15 minutes of opening remarks, and introductions of all the various team members. After that, each team was given 5 minutes to present the main aspects of their project.This was done by sharing a powerpoint presentation that each team was asked to prepare prior to the conference. The screen-sharing feature was used to share the presentation with the conference participants. Each presentation was followed by 10 minutes of questions, feedback and advice from other teams to the presenting team.
Six teams, including our team ended up participating in the conference on September 15th, which took place over a google hangouts call for approximately 2 hours. The main challenge we encountered when planning and organizing the event, was arranging a time that was reasonable for all the teams participating taken into account the time difference especially as we were joined with teams from Turkey, Australia, China and India.
The points that the teams have discussed including but are not limited to the following:
1) Tell us more about your project and why you chose the idea. Are you participating in any special track?
2) What kind of experiments will you be doing?
3) What are some challenges that you are currently facing or you anticipate to face?
4) How will you incorporate integrated human practices into your project? Are you looking for contacts with experts in the field?
If your institution has participated in iGEM before, what are some winning project tips that you can give to the other teams?
Great appreciation to Team HKUST from Hong Kong, REC Chennai, VIT Vellore from India, Saint Joseph Istanbul from Turkey, iGEM Macquarie from Australia for the fruitful conversation. We look forward to meeting you in person in Boston!
We have initiated a collaboration request to ALL iGEM teams. We invite them to join us in showcasing the wonderment of iGEM and synthetic biology by creating a science sketch of their team’s project or any major techniques/principles that their project is using.
Through the series of 1-3-minute sketches, we hope to promote public awareness of the iGEM competition as well as to show how synthetic biology can be utilized to solve problems facing mankind in an"
BostonU,2014,"FP testing constructs. We gave them media with two concentrations of arabinose (1 mM and 100 mM) and aTp (100 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL). The used the following methodology for microscopy:
The pTet-pBad-RFP or pBad-pTet-RFP expressing E. coli strains were cultured in LB with kanamycin plus the additives indicated overnight at 37°C overnight with shaking. 20µL samples of each culture were dropped onto microscope slides and allowed to air dry.  Slides were then fixed in methanol for 10 minutes, dried, and wet mounted with a coverslip in a 50% glycerol solution. Slides were imaged on a Zeiss AxioVert microscope with an 100x oil immersion lens, and imaged with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera. Images were acquired using Zen software, and processed with Adobe Photoshop. All images were exposed for 2 seconds. Brightness and contrast adjustments made during processing were applied equally to all panels within the figure.
Micrographs showing the expression of RFP and GFP at different small molecule concentrations for pTet+pBAD+RFP
Micrographs showing the expression of RFP and GFP at different small molecule concentrations for pBAD+pTet+RFP
Arabinose is clearly inducing RFP induction but aTc induction is weak at best. This may have been due to a mix up in the media we gave them. Likewise, the presence of GFP in some of the cells suggests we may have gave them a mixed culture since we didn't see GFP for the same constructs when we ran flow cytometry analysis. The change in RFP under arabinose suggests that there are cells with the correct construct growing in the culture. For a more detailed result analysis, click here .
Interlab Study Collaboration with Tufts iGEM and MIT iGEM teams

BBa_I20260
BBa_E0240
We quickly located those parts in our freezer, aliquoted a few microliters of the plasmid out for them, and members from the Tufts team picked up the DNA so they could continue working towards finishing the Interlab Study.

Interlaboratory Measurement Collaboration
In light of this year’s Interlab study, we wanted to further assist this                     initiative by conducting an Interlab study of our own by measuring the                     constructs we have designed. We wanted to investigate whether stabilized                     promoters would reduce variability in interlaboratory fluorescence                     measurements exhibited by engineered genetic constructs across different                     laboratories. (Jake et al.)
Fluctuations observed in plasmid copy number are caused by small changes in                     the cell’s environment as well as the cell itself. For example, differences                     in growth temperature and growth medium composition affect the copy number                     of plasmids. Such variations may be more apparent between labs (e.g.                     differences in lab equipment, handling), becoming a major hindrance in                     scientific research.
The measurement protocol was the same as the one performed for the plate                     reader measurements in this years interlab study. There were 4 Test                     Devices:
TD1 and TD2 contained pupsp1 and pupsp2, two constitutive promoters                             .
TD3 and TD4 contained TALEsp1 stabilized pupsp1 and TALEsp2 stabilized pupsp2 promoters.
Due to the fact that the teams that took part in our Interlaboratory                     Measurement had, also, participated in the iGEM Interlaboratory                     Measurement, so they provided us with the interlab negative control and                     calibration data.

Collaborations
Collaborations play a very important role in terms of project development. Collaborations with other teams help us to learn about better ways to handle a problem, to learn new ways of working, to perceive different ideologies and to develop the project in general. It provides us a better chance to get to know other teams and to learn to cooperate. In scientific fields, cooperation and collaborations play a major role for growth and discovery. We are highly encouraged to work with other teams since it increases our horizon of knowledge and we are happy that iGEM promotes the idea of sharing knowledge and scientific materials. The following are the teams whom we can proudly call our collaborators this year.
iGEM TU Delft
Their iGEM project is called CASE13A. Both our projects are similar in terms of the use of Cas13a and paper microfluidics. Our collaboration started with our meeting in Delft. We were excited to see that TU Delft were also working with Cas13a as their major protein. We both are trying to work on different ways of tackling the problem of the antibiotic resistance using Cas13a. Therefore we decided to collaborate since it gave us the opportunity to discuss the challenges and also to try out different approaches together. We started a collaboration for our software since we both were working on optimizing the crRNA for our targets. In our team, we designed a software that could give us the best design and structure of the crRNA for different targets. For this reason, we created a database of different possible sequences using NUPACK and other platforms. Team TU Delft has a similar project where they predict the part of the target that can best serve as a crRNA. We provided them with a list of possible targets and best crRNAs structures for their software.

Technion Israel iGEM High School Team 2015
This year, we mentored a group of high school students who are participating in the 2015 iGEM High School track.  This is the first year ever in which Israeli high school teams are participating in the iGEM competition.
In order to give the high school students an introduction to synthetic biology and genetic engineering, we put together an introductory course in order to teach them the basics.  Following the introductory course, we helped the team with the brainstorming process for their project and helped them as mentors.
“When I started studying at Technion, I didn't really know what I was getting myself into with Biotechnology.  I had no idea what that was or that it even involved genetic engineering of any kinds.  As a high school student, I was never exposed to the idea of genetic engineering, much less the possibility of doing it on my own! We've all heard the cliche that children are the future, but high school students are right on the verge of having to make the important decision of which life pathway to follow, making it a critical time to get exposure to as many fields as possible, including synthetic biology.  We went from seeing a group of high school student more interested in computer programming than listening to use, to seeing the team develop a complex and impressive genetic circuit.” - Yael
Naseeb Saida, one of the high school student who participated in our program, reviewed his experience:
“Taking part in iGEM and participating in such a great and incredible competition had given us a unique opportunity to work as real scientists and learning how to start a new whole idea from nothing, making it a new working system.
iGEM was a very challenging competition which demanded hard work from us trying to get the best results we can, At first it wasn't that easy to deal with the responsibility of learning many new things, to be able to start a new idea in a field that we knew nothing about.  However, the Technion students' team was right next to us, helping us in many different ways, enabling us to skip the hard difficulties we faced in our first steps. Their presence next to us the whole way"

Ethic collaborations
We wanted to support the debates around ethics in science, in fact we also developped several points with our specialist in epistemology.
Therefore answering the Valencia poll was the opportunity to widen our range of questions about biosciences, to share knowledge, and to prove that we feel concerned by the problem that ethics tackles.
All the team answered the poll and we are grateful to Valencia for rewarding us with a gold medal ^^
Software tool collaborations
In order to develop a fully operational tool we created a poll that we send to other igem team to ask if it could be a great help for them or not and if they have also advices and expectations concerning this software.
2 Teams answered :
TUDelf Specially to Sriram and Tim
Valencia Specially to Juny
We had some interactions with the Freiburg_software team , specially with Paul Staab. They have developed a synthetic biological software suite, based on Google's collaboration and communication tool Wave : SynBiowave. The actual version is 0.2 but it is a project with a great potential!

- Shenzhen University
During the summer, Shenzhen University kindly shared their laboratory with us, since we needed the microplate reader—which we didn’t have one in our lab—to test the enzyme activity of FruA and Dextranase we expressed with escherichia coli. Also, they gave us some instruction in the experiments of Interlab. Their project this year involves comprehension of the property of chitin. Since our project last year required study of chitin, we shared sufficient information about chitin and some experience we went through with them to push forward their project.
- Shenzhen College of International Education
On October 15, we invited Shenzhen College of International Education (SCIE) to our campus to hold a lecture on synthetic biology and iGEM competition together in order to prevail the idea of synthetic biology and iGEM among high-schoolers. SCIE introduced synthetic biology and explain their project this year to the students, while we introduced iGEM and our project this year.
- Shenzhen Foreign Language School (SFLS)
After a meet up in Shenzhen, SFLS offered to provide us with some modeling resources since no member in our team has modeling experience. Also, we keep helping each other to increase the popularity of our WeChat official accounts by reprinting articles. Noticeably, SFLS kindly shared one of their sponsors with us. We gave SFLS permission to reprint some of our high-quality articles like the Interview of Experienced iGEMers, helping them with exploring the deeper layer of iGEM as experienced insiders. Additionally, SFLS made project propaganda and street interview in Lotus Hill Park, where we went for the same reason last year, so we shared some experience with them to validate their activities to advance their human practice.
- Nanjing Foreign Language School (Nanjing NFLS)
Students from team Nanjing NFLS help us with part characterization and checking our wiki and other works. We also discuss problems we face on phone frequently, and help each other to gather more information."

We have formed online collaboration with NEFU since September. We informed each other about our progress and helped each other with experimental puzzles. Some of the problems we tackled together are listed as follows.
♝:We plasmid vector can't be cut.
♗:It may be because of the enzyme had losed potency :
Plasmid was contaminated with protein
The plasmid may be dissolved in a solution that inhibited the activity of the enzyme
♝:What should we do to link three parts efficiently?
♗:Use isocaudamer.
♝: What should we do when we we want to dye the sample by Comassie blue staining and WB.
♗:When you add the samlpe, you should pay attention to the amount of it. Measure the value of OD to get the concentration of the sample you need and then add the sample. When making up polyacrylamide agarose gel, wash and dry the holder. In that way, you can get the gel free of bubble.
Vist the wiki of NEFU for more information at https://2017.igem.org/Team:NEFU_China/Collaborations
We obtained the plasmids from OUC-China at the beginning of October. We used the LiAc/SS carrier DNA/PEG method to transform yeast strain EBY100. The kit we utilized in the transformation is the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation ⅡTM from ZYMO RESEARCH. We used the YPD(G418+) plates and incubated them at 30℃ for 4 days to allow the growth of transformants. We picked several yeast colons and grew them in 10ml YPD(G418+) broth. Then we monitored the growth rate of the recombinant yeast cells to specify the expression of MINI system at a particular living stage. The fluorescence and Abs600 of the four strains were determined by a microplate reader as shown in the picture.
We gave the result to the team,OUC. They are glad to see their results was repeated in our lab environment and revealed an ideal result.

Skyping with the University of Lund
TThe first non-dutch iGEM contact we made was with the team from Lund, Sweden. Their university participated for the first time. We arranged a Skype meeting and shared to them our approach on different subjects. They had a lot of questions for us and we brainstormed with them about things like funding and time management. Thanks team Lund!
TU Delft
In our early iGEM days we made contact with the iGEM team from Delft. They helped us out with questions we had about our wiki and in return we helped them out with some questions they had on bioinformatics. We have had a lot of contact with team Delft after this and would like to thank them for the pleasant collaboration.
Meet-up Wageningen
The Wageningen iGEM team organised a Benelux iGEM meet-up, here we had the opportunity to present our project to other teams for the first time. It was a nice initiator to think about how to present our project and to meet the other teams and learn about their projects. Thanks iGEM Wageningen!
Meet-up Delft
The iGEM team from the TUDelft hosted a European iGEM meet-up, in which we participated. During this conference three speakers talked about synthetic biology in their field of work. After that every team presented their posters to all the other teams. We enjoyed the day and learned a lot of the poster presentation, therefore we want to thank the TUDelft iGEM team!
Meet-up Leuven
A month before the Giant Jamboree the team from KU Leuven organized a practice jamboree. During this event we got to practice our presentation and received feedback from the other teams. There were also some very inspiring speakers, that talked about being a scientist and the industrialization of products. It was a very informative afternoon and we are very grateful that the Leuven team set up this meeting!

Our second collaboration was with the UC Davis team on the IGEM match website. The UC Davis team has come up with a great idea to help teams with similar projects to connect and collaborate. Teams are able to join their specific track and also see different teams on the same track and select the teams they would most like to collaborate with. However we thought that the website could be further enhanced by creating a search bar to find certain keywords when looking for a collaboration. We sent this and other feedback to The UC Davis team and they gave us the code for the website, which we edited to implement our suggestions
As part of the iGEM community we felt it was crucial to help teams any way we could so we replied to all requests we can, such as filling out surveys made by other teams. We filled out surveys for UCL, XMU-China, Munich United iGEM team, UC Davis team on the iGEM match website,  Svce on Lab techniques,  the University of Manchester on Alcohol consumption and the Virginia team on biocontainment.
Finally, we also attended the UK iGEM meetup, hosted and organised by Westminster iGEM. Here we presented our project and got to meet various teams from the UK. Not only did we meet our collaborators from UEA at the meet up, we also received and gave constructive feedback to the UK teams’ projects."

Latin America
In our search to expand and build bridges within Latin America’s synthetic biology community we collaborated directly with team USP-EEL-Brazil and Team TecCEM, who hosted a Latin America meetup which we attended through video conference. We also attended to the brazillian team Jamboree, at the beginning of the year.
USP-EEL-Brazil
USP-EEL-Brazil team worked with estrogen contamination in water and needed their hormones in a purified form to test their degradation. We got in touch with Professor Wothan Tavares de Lima, who gladly provided us with the samples used by the team.
TecCEM
In the meetup hosted by TecCEM team we discussed the teams projects and received feedback on our project, especially in regards to how we designed ou plasmids and on their workings.   As a result of the meetup we were kindly invited to take part in the “Moves like iGEM” video in september.
Brazillian Meetup
One of our members attended to the brazillian team ""Jamboré"", at the start of the year, where we could share experiences from veterans, project ideas, and ultimately bond and strengthen our brazillian iGEMers community. The meetup was organized by the USP-ESALQ prospective team, that is planning on entering the competition in the near future. Teams USP-EEL, UNESP-AQA were present, along with other prospective teams, ranging from the whole country, from Rio de Janeiro to Manaus. The experience was great and we hope to see more iGEM teams in Brazil rise from this collaboration!
Düsseldorf
In an effort to evaluate how our system would respond to the chemically characterized HSL molecule, we got in touch with Duesseldorf team 2018. They kindly provided us 3OC6 HSL for our Lux system, which allowed us to conclude that our project has a great potential to test not only biological but also chemical crosstalk between different quorum sensing devices. This can be performed by using two compatible plasmids at the same time."

COLLABORATIONS
Collaboration
This year, we have carried out several collaborations with other iGEM teams. As a Health and Medicine team we have contacted the UCL iGEM team and had a quite interesting conversation about the difficulty and our experiences of presenting a Health and Medicine project, especially at safety and ethics section of the project. After asking questions about their aspects of safety&ethics, we mentioned our way to outgo these problems: With the creating of a platform, called as Virtual Hospital, where we can be more imaginary and feel like our projects can be applied to today's medical approaches. (Visit P&P to learn more about the Virtual Hospital). The UCL iGEM team accepted this suggestion and mentioned, that they want to join our virtual hospital.
Also we mentored the AUC Turkey iGEM High School team this year and guided them during their experiments to increase their possibility of achieving their set goals.

Welcome to the collaboration page, where we try to connect to different teams all over the world. Throughout the summer, we have made great connections with different teams and helped each other to bring both team’s projects to an even higher level. Not only did we connect with them from distance, our whole team even went to Shenzhen, China to organize and hold the first ever iGEM EurAsian Meetup together with iGEM BGIC Global . Before you relive the meetup experience on our and iGEM BGIC Global's EurAsian Meetup pages, retrace our collaboration journey by clicking on the stars on the map! Bon voyage!

SDSZ-China,2017,": I know it’s not extremely expensive so I can probably afford it. But I also know how people                         acquire bear bile powder. Ugh, I don’t want to cause that much pain to the poor bears. They say                         no trading, no killing right? So that’s not really an option for me.
Q: Yeah. It is indeed very brutal. Well, thanks for your time Mrs. Zhou. We really appreciate                         your help.
A: No problem! Have a good day.
Q: You too.
Contact with Chengdu Bear Rescue Centre
To find out more about the bear bile industry and the protective measures against illegal                         hunting, our team, SDSZ-China, went all the way down south to Sichuan province, where the                         biggest Asiatic Black Bear rescue centre is located. There, after exchanging conversations with                         the staff, we found out that Asiatic Black Bear is listed as endangered on the IUCN red list,                         and the most efficient way to rescue bears now is buying bile bears from bear farms. (Since bear                         farming is a legal activity in China, there’s no way to officially put a halt on this). After                         this trip, we went a bit west and visited a real bear farm where bile is siphoned. There, we                         learned the heartbreaking fact that people harvest bear bile only to make traditional Chinese                         medicine. Yet as most of the modern world would possibly agree, traditional Chinese medicine                         hasn’t prove to have a distinct efficacy in treating diseases, rather it serves as a method to                         nourish and build up people’s health conditions. Because of the all the above, the need for an                         alternative way to produce UDCA struck us as extremely urgent.

Collaboration on Media Analysis of gene technology related information  with NYMU-Taipei
Motivation with passion: Our team believe that media is the most efficient way to promote the knowledge and popularity of gene technology /synthetic biology(GTSB), not through sporadically independent advocate or educational activities .  Thus, we are curious and concerned about what gene technology related information in the media that the Taiwanese people are exposed to and whether the Taiwanese people can understand the information.  Thus, we told the NYMU-Taipei team about our idea to consult them.  NYMU-Taipei revealed their passion to iGEM and ambitiously suggested that we should do something for iGEM to support its influence on synthetic biology worldwide.
Goal: Thus, we decided to work together to conduct a large-scaled media analysis on the gene technology related information to make it as a significant project for GTSB.  In this way, using social study methods, we can provide solid and essential academic evidences that can be used in future design, plan, and implement science education in GTSB.  Thus, our goal is to investigate the media context on gene technology related information, and identify issues of the context.
Work on media analysis project: We analyzed the sufficiency and readability of media context on gene technology related information from magazines, newspapers and iGEM wiki.  We worked on defining the goal and scope of this project together.  NYMU-Taipei was in charge of establishing conceptual framework of our media analysis, designing survey sheets (codebook) based on the framework, and retrieving iGEM wiki; HSiTAIWAN is in charge of designing survey sheets(codebook), accomplishing data collection.  We analyze the data together and the results can be retrieved from the section of the Human Practice section on two teams.
