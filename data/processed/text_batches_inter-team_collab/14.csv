The European iGEM meet up
Evry & Ionis-Paris
The European Experience, a collaboration between Evry and Ionis, held in Paris over the 2nd and 3rd of July, was a massive success. It attracted 28 European teams from 11 countries, where each team presented their project informally through a poster.
We discovered some exciting project ideas including producing bio-plastics on Mars, and building a DIY 3D printer for tissues.
United Kingdom iGEM meet up
Westminster UoW
In August, we were invited to the UK Teams’ Meet-up at the University of Westminster. Almost the whole team decided to head to London to interact with local teams and gain feedback about our project. It was a really friendly atmosphere when we arrived and we even bumped into the UEA (University of East Anglia) iGEM team on our way to the University as we both tried to navigate our way around London.
The meet-up was a two-day engagement and both days consisting of a number of engaging talks in the morning with presentations from other iGEM teams about their projects in the afternoon.
The University of Warwick open day

Two of our team members; Jamie and Saylee went on a trip down to Warwick to demonstrate how you can extract DNA from strawberries!
Mexico Synthetic Bio video international collaboration:
TecCEM
TecCEM is making a compilation of videos sent from the 5 collaborating iGEM teams; Mexico, England, Germany, Taiwan, and Pakistan, regarding our experience in iGEM.
Surveys completed
We have contributed to projects and human practices studies of other iGEM teams, by providing information in the form of these surveys:
Aachen on Genetic Engineering Public Opinion
Paris-Saclay on Responsible Research & Innovation
Groningen on Digital Information Storage & Cyber Security"
TU_Delft,2015,". Some of these can be seen on the Policy and Practice page under iGEM Community section. For this we collaborated with the Berlin, KU Leuven and Amsterdam teams.
Moreover, we helped other teams by sharing the knowledge we have about biofilms and even printed a biofilm for another team. For sharing this knowledge we had several skype different teams, we helped with organizing different events where we talked to other teams, and we eventually went to Groningen to make a biofilm for them.
Testing Biolinker
Throughout the policy and practice assessment, it became clear that the strong point of our printer was that it could be used for different types and strains of bacteria. We believed that it was important to test this hypothesis. At the RIVM/Rathenau discussion meeting preparation we learnt more about what the other teams were planning on making. A popular direction was biofilms such as the team of University of Groningen .
The iGEM Groningen team were creating a biofilm that would be used to create energy out of salt and fresh water. Their plan was to create an ion-selective biofilm that would be placed as a barrier between the two types of water, to ensure that an electro potential gradient would develop. This gradient would then be converted into energy called Blue Energy. Their biofilm had to therefore be ion-selective and robust. But they had a couple of troubles with creating a stable biofilm containing their engineered selective bacteria, Bacillus subtilis 3610 comI strain. They wanted to create a membrane that would be able to maintain itself, making it very sustainable and cheap. The two teams believed that combining their projects would lead to a good result, as well as it being important to help out a fellow iGEM team to test their hypothesis. .
Just before the track decisions were made, we contacted the iGEM team of Groningen through Skype, on the 17th of August, to discuss the possibilities of a collaboration between us. Like we mentioned in our policy and practice assessment, it became clear that a strong point of their printer could potentially be the usage for different types and strains of bacteria. .
On the 1st of september, Marit, Anne and Biolinker (our 3D-printer) travelled to Groningen to execute several experiments. The aim of the two teams were as followed: We wanted to prove that our 3D-printer can be called an open source platform technology, by letting the team of Groningen print their bacteria. The team of Groningen wanted to create a stable biofilm containing their biofilm-forming bacteria, by using"

UCLA iGEM COLLABORATION
On September 23 we met with UCLA’s iGEM team via Skype. During this meeting, we discussed details of our project’s goals, progress, and impact. In particular, we shared what new updates we’ve made to our experiment from last year, discussing what changes worked better. This included updates to our secretion system, and updates to our method of analyzing chitinase gene expression via FLAG-tag. UCLA iGEM gave us advice on how to expand our chitinase project, especially regarding ways to create a chitin medium that would enable us to test whether the chitinase was working. We also shared ideas for human practices, discussing public outreach strategies that have worked and failed for us in the past. We also provided key suggestions to help UCLA iGEM with cell-cell adhesion as well as growth inhibition."
Freiburg,2017," 2007).
Therefore the substitution of the two hydroxylated amino acids, that are prolines at the positions 402 and 564 with alanines, would generate a HIF1A (P402A,P564A), that is stabilized and interacts with HIF1B under normoxic conditions (Ziello et al., 2007) to activate the hypoxia response element (HRE).
In return for our help with iGEM team Heidelberg's mutagenesis assay, they offered to help us with their Golden Gate cloning expertise to perform a site directed mutagenesis and generate the constitutively active HIF1A. It would be used by us as a positive control for CoCl2 induction in analysis of HRE.
Unfortunately, Heidelberg faced some challenges during the cloning. Due to the lack of time when the plasmid was finished and arrived in our lab, we were not able to test it anymore.

We helped 3 other iGEM teams:
1. Stony Brook iGEM Team
https://2016.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook
The Stony Brook iGEM team undertook the task of investigating the survivability of yeast under desiccation, an experiment equivalent to the one our team has conducted on E. Coli. Given the many potential uses that desiccated yeast could offer to iGEM as well as the scientific community as a whole, we’ve agreed to replicate the desiccation experiments performed by Stony Brook in an effort to corroborate their data. Their protocol consisted of exposing yeast to 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours of dehydration in an incubator. 20 microliters of yeast were placed on separate segments of parafilm which were left in an incubator for the aforementioned amounts of time. Afterwards the yeast was rehydrated and plated. Approximately 2 days later the colonies on the plates were counted. The results of our study are shown below:
Note: Given that the amount of yeast that would grow after little or no desiccation would surpass the capacity of the plates or prove difficult to count, we performed a 1 to 10,000 dilution of the 0 hrs of desiccation and multiplied the colonies by 10,000 to account for the dilution. A 1 to 100 dilution was performed on the 2 hrs of desiccation and the colonies multiplied by 100. There were no other dilutions performed on the 4-8 hrs of desiccation.
2. UGA iGEM Team
https://2016.igem.org/Team:UGA-Georgia
We helped the UGA-Georgia iGEM Team by characterizing their mCherry-based reporter system

SCU-China,2016," our considerations.
Based on this point, our international collaboration is a mutual exchange of knowledge and understanding of the policies regarding commercialization of science between China and Canada. The format of our exchange is making a handbook introducing the laws on intellectual property rights protection in our home countries, in order to improve our understanding of the differences on related laws between China and Canada.
The handbook introducing the laws on intellectual property rights protection in China made by our team member Luyu Jia contains the following contents: General Definition and Classification, Patent Law, Trademark Law, Copyright Law, and Trade Secrets. For the full handbook, click me.
Teams helped us:
1. TMMU_China
The assistance provided by TMMU_China mainly focused on the inhibition zone test. The inhibition test towards target microbes Staphylococcus aureus (Foot odor pathogen), Bacillus subtilis (Foot odor pathogen), Klebsiella pnuemoniae (Quality control strain), Escherichia coli (Quality control strain), Enterococcus faecalis (Quality control strain), Microsporum canis (Tinea Pedis pathogen) and Trichophyton rubrum (Tinea Pedis pathogen) were performed by TMMU_China. Unfortunately, they failed at the process of protein purification, which means the test was failed, but we still appreciate their effort on helping us.
2. IngenuityLab_Canada
In correspondence with the handbook introducing the laws on intellectual property rights protection in China made by us, iGEM team IngenuityLab_Canada designed a similar handbook introducing related laws in Canada, which broaden our internationalized horizon on intellectual property laws. For the full handbook made by them, click me.
3. SCUT-China_A
In order to help us while we were trapped at the bottleneck of the process of CecropinXJ prokaryotic expression, they provided us three specialized E.coli BL21 strain (RIPL, Rosetta and pGr07).
RIRL and Rosetta contain rare tRNA in the strain and pGr07 contains plasmid coding molecular chaperones for protein folding. pGr07 is applied in the CecropinXJ expression part in our project.
However, even we used three specialized E.coli BL21 strain (RIPL, Rosetta and pGr07) provided by SCUT-China_A, the results are still not ideal. Further experiments are required."
Marburg,2018,", because they broke during transportation and the plates were too moist.
For the growth curve experiment the teams simply measured the OD600 every 10 minutes for 5 hours, in the Vibrigens InterLab the iGEM InterLab cell measurement experiment was repeated.

Vibrio natriegens on a plate, ATTC14048
Flyer Vibrio natriegens 101
We created a Vibrio natriegens flyer containing the most important facts and most useful protocols for the organism. Our protocol for the Vibrigens InterLab is in our lab book on our Wiki.
For the Vibrigens growth curve we only sent V2 salts, Vibrio natriegens on a plate strain ATTC14048 and the Vibrio natriegens 101 Flyer.
Results
Figure 3: Pie chart showing the percentage of teams that would want to work with Vibrio natriegens again.
In our Google form we asked our participants to tell us all about their difficulties with the experiments and Vibrio natriegens and to answer some general questions. When asked if they could imagine working with Vibrio natriegens in the future, 7 out of 8 teams answered yes (figure 3).
We could identify four main critique points based on their feedback:
The shipping
We received a lot of feedback on our shipping. Some of the plates broke during transport because we didn’t pack them as well as we should have. For the future we recommend using bubble wrap around the plates or enough crumpled paper to really cushion the plates. Relying only on parafilm and paper towels wasn’t enough to send plates in an envelope instead of a box. Boxes provide more protection against mechanical impact and are therefore better suited for this.
Transformation
Some teams had problems transforming the plasmids into Vibrio natriegens and needed two attempts until they were able to insert the plasmid into V. natriegens. Two of the teams couldn’t perform the transformation, so we sent them the strains. In our lab we observed that the more experience you have, the higher the success rate of transformations. We believe that with guidance and a few more tries the teams would have been able to complete this step, but it would have taken precious time away from their projects.

Oxford iGEM
An iGEM team from Oxford generously offered us help in mathematical modeling of our experiments. We appreciated their operative and precise work a lot. We have agreed on the collaboration over a couple of Skype calls and continued to manage the deal by the emails over a period of two months. The description of the modeling Oxford team performed can be found here.
What is more, we did not only collaborate on the dry lab, but also on the Human Practices side. Since we found out that our projects looked quite similar and were based on the creation of probiotics, we have launched a survey on probiotics delivery method and compared the results between two countries. The results of the survey are described here.
WashU iGEM
We are very grateful to WashU StLouis iGEM team from Washington, USA, who agreed to collaborate and asked to confirm their results of a biobrick characterization. They have chosen to characterize a part from this year’s distribution kit – a HSP promoter. We have organized the collaboration over a friendly online conversation. The details of a biobrick characterization can be found here.
Aachen iGEM
We have organised collaboration with Aachen iGEM team . We tried to find out the opinion and to define the current knowledge of the common public about genetic engineering in Lithuania. Our team managed to question 57 people of different educational background. Results revealed that the majority of people in Vilnius were poorly informed about genetic manipulations.
Virginia iGEM
We were happy to help Virginia iGEM team by responding to their survey about the awareness and use of biocontainment in iGEM projects. We hope that our answers were helpful for creating a pamphlet for future iGEM teams to disseminate information about biocontainment and provide tools for teams to select and implement methods more easily.

We had a face-to-face meeting with them in National Cheng Kung University. They interviewed us about their environmental protection project, and we also showed our project to them. With their suggestions, we found a new method to present our project more clearly through the collaboration, where we felt more connected with other iGEMers. We are sincerely thankful for their interview and hospitality.
CCU_Taiwan iGEM team
This year, CCU_Taiwan is joining iGEM for the first time, just like us. Under the same circumstances, we built strong connections and collaborations throughout this summer. We asked them for a favor to measure the concentration of MSMEG5998 in supernatant and pellet to test the solubility of our recombinant enzyme. This experiment played an important role in our project because the results implied the efficiency of Thioredoxin. We encountered some problems that needed to be tackled back then. CCU_Taiwan generously helped us redo the SDS-PAGE experiment and provided us with the data. In return, we helped them in plasmid construction. At the beginning, they planned to digest their plasmid with two restriction endonucleases simultaneously and ligated with a new part, but they failed. As a result, we told them our Double Digests protocol, and suggested that they use High-Fidelity (HF®) restriction enzymes rather than fast digest enzyme. Therefore, the problem was then solved.
The SDS PAGE Coomassie G-250 staining result revealed that the synthetic MSMEG5998 fusion protein dissolved more in the supernatant (13000Su) compare to the pellet (13000P) of the cell lysate, indicating that the solubility is great. This result matched with our experiment.
NYMU-Taipei iGEM team
NYMU-Taipei is the first iGEM team in Taiwan to have participated, and their teacher, Prof. Chang, has extensive experience in iGEM competition. We seeked some advice about forming an iGEM team, and how to integrate a project. In return, we gave them some information about some professors in National Taiwan Ocean University whose specialty were focus on question similar to their project."

Collaborations
The depth of study in contemporary science has meant that an individual or team’s knowledge ‘base’ is becoming increasingly more specialised. As a result, no individual team or person can tackle problems in the most efficient way on their own – and so it is collaborative efforts between teams that pave the way for scientific progress. International collaboration is particularly valuable, as it exposes teams to completely new ways of thinking about a problem. We, the UNSW iGEM team, want to sincerely thank all our collaborators – you have all made us think about our ‘problem’ in new ways.

Athens
Team Visit
A member of our UNSW team also met with the NTUA (Athens) team between the 16th and 20th of July in Athens. The Athens team gave us a tour of their workspace at the Athenian Pasteur Institute, where we shared protocols and techniques regarding staining using Ethidium bromide in protein gel electrophoresis, as well as their unique method of casting agarose gels. Furthermore, during our meetings we discussed potential issues we may have with our project such as the covalent of the prefoldin to the enzyme with the Tag and Catcher mechanism may chemically alter the enzyme thus inhibiting action. After further research, this was dismissed due to previous literature on the Tag and Catcher systems proving otherwise. After this visit, there was continual discussion online, with the teams sharing relevant papers and international grant opportunities they had found. We provided suggestions to help them with expressing proteins.

We also discussed the types of models we planned to use with our scaffolds. Bettencourt asked for project"
Nanjing-China,2015," also ourselves to turn wastes into resources.
Unlike water has a strong nature balance itself, heavy-metal’s nature circulation is much slower. We need to use man power to turn every waste kind into resource. In this concept, seawater desalination combing heavy-metal recycling will be the key to build the heavy metal’s balance.
The origin of heavy metal comes from the river, therefore, it is hard to control from the origin. Most of the study dealing with heavy metal in seawater focus on recovery and has to work in an open condition. The efficiency of absorption largely depends on the mobility of seawater. IT also brings some safety concern by introducing new species to original ecosystem.
For example, the main recovery method focuses on mangrove in China. Mangrove is salt-torrent and absorb heavy-metal naturally. However, because it is plant, the study and application of mangrove will be relatively slow.
Seawater desalination is one of the few seawater alternating technology that pumps in the seawater. It also has complicated process, and part of it could be replaced by Nanjing’s project. Thus, we should look at two projects’ combination as environmental restoration and seawater alternation using the same artificial water flow.Back to circular economy, this will increase the force that heavy-metal waste change into resource with a low cost adding.
Journal
In March, we founded our team and recruited our team members, after with we divided our team members into several groups and each group is responsible for one part of the competition. We were also busy brainstorming about our project and signing up for iGEM competition.
In April, we confirmed our project. A majority of the team members wanted to deal with problems related to heavy metals. Then we searched online and read many articles related to our project. We also made a plan about the procedures of all the experiments.
In May, we were busy with kit construction and part construction. We were also contacting different authorities and scheduled for interviews.
In June, we went on with kit construction and started the homologous recombination part. We also interviewed with a government official.
In July, we were engaged in adhering the engineered bacteria onto the material that we used. We also tested for the four kinds of bacteria adhesion materials. Some members were busy with modeling. We also started our collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
In August, we were doing experiments about heavy metal adsorption and busy with the test of our designed device. We also attended the CCiC conference in Beijing and presented our project to Chinese iGEM teams. Besides, we also interviewed with a college professor,"

We joined up with the National University of Singapore iGEM Team to collaborate and help each other with the modelling aspect of our projects.
In order to assist us characterise our star peptide, we asked NUS Singapore to create a simple diffusion simulation on MATLAB. Their diffusion program and our subsequent utilisation of this simulator can be found here.
The NUS Singapore team asked us to help them visualise and compare the simulation and theoretical solutions they developed for their cylindrical diffusion system. Their model involves determining the concentration of a particular molecule in terms of cylindrical coordinates at a particular instance in time. The coordinate system of their model is illustrated below.
NUS Singapore provided us with results from a two-dimensional diffusion simulation they developed. The simulation data contains $r$ and $z$ values for different time steps in the cylindrical bacteria. The initial condition of their model is visualised below, with yellow representing a high concentration and purple representing a low concentration.
Using MATLAB, we were able to provide visual representations for various time steps of their simulation.
From the images displayed above, we can see that the system undergoes diffusion until the concentration field is essentially uniform.
NUS Singapore also provided as with us with the equations for the theoretical solution they had developed to the cyclindrical diffusion problem:
Using the same initial concentration field used in the simulation, we attempted to implement this theoretical solution in MATLAB. Our goal was to vary the number of terms in the series and visualise the resulting concentration fields. Unfortunately, due to some difficulties experienced in the implementation process, we cannot be confident that our results are an accurate representation of the theoretical model provided. In the future, we recommend that an integrator specific to cylindrical coordinates and this model be developed in order for the Kik term to be accurately determined.
Nonetheless, featured below are the concentration fields obtained for different final values of $I$ and $K$ after 10ms. Although these fields are not representative of the theoretical solution, the impact of the number of terms in the series used is still evident. It can therefore be recommended that if this theoretical solution is to be used for further analysis, the maximum number of terms permitted by the available computing power should be used.

In order to archieve this goal, iGEM Team Aix-Marseille designed an assay in which they combine three enzymes: a laccase, a lipoxygenase or latex clearing protein (LCP) and a cytochrome C. The purified product will then degrade synthetics polymers found in the chewing gum.
In order to evaluate the impat of their work, the team created a survey in which the participants were questioned about their knowledge about chewinggum, GMOs and many more. We took half a day off so we could support them with further data coming from the streets of Heidelberg."

August 26th: Detailed Skype call between ASU iGEM and SVCE_Chennai (skype handle (igemsvce chennai) took place. The collaboration discussion included details about the promoter prediction tool that Chennai had written in Python. ASU iGEM talked about how the promoter tool could be a great asset as our team had some issues with leaky expression in our synthetic gene circuits and the promoter tool could help us predict if the issue was within our promoters. ASU iGEM also expressed that they could provide the Chennai team back with detailed information about how well the python code for the promoter prediction tool was working and if there was any other additional feedback and critiquing they had for them to improve the tool. Chennai stated that they would share the Python code for the prediction tool via email.
September 14th: Several emails later and no reply from the SVCE_Chennai team ASU iGEM reached out to our PI, Dr. Karmella Haynes, to try and get some help reaching Chennai as we were ready to complete our collaboration and were only waiting on the promoter tool code to be sent.

AP center's website
All of our team members came from Hangzhou #14 highschool's Ap center. And we also put the synthetic biology's link there. Consequently, more students and facilities can see it.
The official website of Hangzhou #14 high school
This is the offcial website of our school. And you can find aboved links there.
     1.Training for iGEM
The iGEM program requires the interdisciplinary abilities. To approach this purpose, we designed a series of trainings including computer programming, biological experiment skills, etc. (The following photographs illustrates the process) The collegiate team from Zhejiang University provides an opportunity which shows us how the biological experiments run.
     2. Pre-research of project
We distributed questionnaires and conducted survey in order to learn about the current knowledge of local peoples towards cultural artifacts in Hangzhou. The following diagrams are analyzed by the data. According to the data, the current situation of protection and renovating towards cultural artifacts and synthetic biology does not have bright prospects. The lack of attentions in civilians can cause the enormous negative effects on research and the practical usage, so we organized a series of activities to publicize the cultural artifacts in Hangzhou, the synthetic biology.(more details in Publicity)
     3.Publicity
(1)To acquaint students synthetic biology, our team’s human practice group publicize this subject several times during the summer break in our city including the danger and benefits of transgenosis food that was familiar and relevant to the citizens.  Furthermore, we upload the basic synthetic biology knowledge in our school’s official website for months and update the latest information or the experimental knowledge at a time period.
(2)We hold a presentation in our school to introduce the iGEM to our successors. It consists that the general ideas of iGEM, the specific parts which are totally different from the biology competition in China, the judgements, also Q&A section and the advantages of taking this competition. Our team leader Andrew Luo gave an excellent lecture.
(3)As we mentioned before, to introduce local citizens the importance of cultural artifacts in this city,  we sent out the specialized post cards with 7 different kinds of landscape seals and our team seal in order to publicize our project and the local artifacts protection at the same time.

Collaborations
During our iGEM summer, we have been in contact with different teams. In the iGEM competition, working together is a springboard for going as far as possible. Indeed, we think that collaboration makes better science and inspire each other: Together, to go further!
This year iGEM Évry has collaborated with several teams:
Science
Paris Bettencourt
As working with Pseudomonas putida, we provided to the iGEM Bettencourt team our organism, allowing the study of its ability to degrade quercitin for their project.
We also helped them studying the degradation of quercitin, antocyanin and malvidin, by running HPLC and MS experiments. Check it out here!
Imperial college
This year, Imperial College aimed to develop a framework for engineering co-cultures. We were contacted by the team and we helped them by running specific grow experiment on our organism Pseudomonas putida KT2440. We provided the data for their tool to facilitate the design and optimization of co-cultures.
iGEM Event
The European Experience
On the 2nd and 3rd of July, our iGEM team coorganized the European Experience with iGEM IONIS: team. This event allowed to gather more than 150 iGEMers with about 30 teams coming from 11 different countries in all Europe.
All the teams were able to present their project in a friendship mood. It was a great occasion to share our ideas, our different points of view and explore new possibilities about our project and collaborations. If you want to know more details about it, click here!

Testing Water Samples From Around the World
As our project aims to develop a product to remove phosphate out of wastewater, we chose to test water samples from around the world for phosphate concentration. We would like to thank the iGEM teams- TU Eindhoven, Technion Israel and Leuven for their water samples! We also received water samples from Derby, Egypt, Yorkshire and Manchester.
Methods
200uL of all drinking water samples were pipetted directly in to the 96 well plate. All river water and bog water samples were filter sterilised to remove solid particles before 200uL of each sample was plated. A set of phosphate standards were prepared and 30uL of dye was then added before the plate was left to equilibrate for 30 minutes in the dark.  Following equilibration, the optical density of each well was read at 650nm using a plate reader. The concentration of phosphate in each sample well could then be determined using the equation of the standard curve.

Teams we collaborated with
Amazonas
As a team based in the United Kingdom, we did not have first hand knowledge about Chagas disease. The Amazonas iGEM team put us in contact with Professor Jaila Borges who was able to inform us about how South American governments address the disease. They also translated a survey we sent them (into Portuguese) and disseminated it to the public in Brazil, a country affected by Chagas disease. This was instrumental in improving our understanding of the type of diagnostic that populations in Chagas-endemic regions prefer. The survey results can be found here .
AQA Unesp
The team at AQA Unesp also translated (into Portuguese) and conducted our survey in Brazil. The survey results can be found here . In return, we were able to give them information about how type I diabetes is addressed and treated in the UK.
TEC CEM
Many countries in the Americas including Mexico are affected by Chagas disease even though it is most widespread in Bolivia and Brazil. The team at TEC CEM translated (into Spanish) our survey and distributed it amongst the Mexican public. This gave us essential insight into public awareness of Chagas disease as well as the Mexican public’s views towards potential diagnostic tools for the disease. The survey results can be found here .
City of London School
We met the City of London School iGEM team during the UK iGEM meetup in July. They needed help with their kinetic modelling, which we were happy to provide. We helped them convert their models in Javascript to Matlab to better model their system.
Judd School
At the UK iGEM meetup, the Judd school approached us for help with their kinetic modelling. We were happy to oblige them and gave them an overview of the maths behind kinetics as well as some basic Matlab codes that they could use for their system"
ZJU-China,2018,"estival with a hope of getting more iGEM teams involved. Here, as the collaboration we highlighted above, we sincerely thanks the participantion of JNU-China, ZJUT-China, HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS and ATSWS.
With the help of these teams, we successfully held the Shengxi ( means ""the rise of biotechnology"") Techfest and won a good reputation for this annual Techfest. Hope we can do better next year!
See their corresponding websites here： ZJUT-China and Jiangnan
Worldshaper-XSHS
Worldshaper-XSHS had problem in the E.coli transformation and then they came to us for help. After a brief introduction of their project, we analyzed and pointed out that it was the invalid homemade E.coli receptive state was to be blame. Hence, they did experiments in our lab by utilizing our commercial E.coli strain BL21 with a good receptive state. This attempt provided enough opportunities for them to discuss the difference between the experiments, which exerted great advantage for them to solve such problems in the nest phase. We hope they can achieve their project and take a good grade home!

Collaboration with CSU-China
Meetups help to communicate different ideas. This year, the student leader Xiangyu Li of CSU-China team came to our laboratory and shared the CSU-China project with our team. After brief presentations, we exchanged views on our respective projects. We were impressed by their ideas on cancer therapy and considered it a promising way to develop their project with the strong support of medicine school in CSU.
Keep in touch and inspire more!

Collaboration with UNSW
A collaboration across continents!
We met UNSW-iGEM team online over Skype on the 25th of July. This year, we two teams are developing a similar protein scaffold  using Tag/Catcher system.
We shared our sequence files of SdyTag/SdyCatcher, SpyTag/SpyCatcher, and SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher systems with UNSW team, while they sent us their design on linkers and SpyTag/SpyCatcher system..
Our teams also agreed to collaborate by sharing relevant purification and Tag/Catcher ligation protocols and discussing the use of these Tag/Catcher systems. Lastly, we shared suggestions for increasing expression activity in our similar projects – for example, extending the linker in the binding mechanism that joins prefoldin and enzyme.

Amsterdam,2017," reduce methane emissions by cattle. We explore the possibilities of ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system and the hurdles to overcome with these strategies. As iGEM UNL is working on E. Coli and iGEM Amsterdam on the production of  fumarate, we first define a strategy to make a fumarate producing E. Coli mutant. Then we assess the mechanism to reduce methane emissions with fumarate. Finally, we explore different ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system.
How E. Coli can produce fumarate
E. Coli can in theory produce fumarate by an oxidative (aerobic) or a reductive (anaerobic) route. In the latter case, the fumarate molecule itself is used as a final electron donor in this process, which is believed to be coupled with cell growth in anaerobic conditions (Iverson et al. , 1999). It is assumed that for this reason, it is not possible to genetically engineer E. Coli to produce fumarate in anaerobic conditions (Song et al. , 2013). This is problematic,as the cattle rumen is anaerobic.
Now if it would be possible to introduce E. Coli in aerobic conditions in the cow’s digestive system, we would be able to use aerobically producing fumarate E. coli strains. For this, we could imitate a genetic engineering strategy used by the iGEM Amsterdam project.
How team Amsterdam produces fumarate in Cyanobacteria
In the Cyanobacterial model organism Synechocystis PCC 6803 , iGEM team Amsterdam managed to produce fumarate in a genetically stable, growth-coupled way, by knocking out the fumarase encoding fumaric acid hydratase (fumC) gene.
How we can apply the Amsterdam genetic engineering strategy in E. Coli
To apply a similar approach in E. Coli and to end up with a respectable titer, multiple gene knock-outs are required. E. Coli has more fumarase encoding genes, then Synechoscystis,  namely anaerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase (fumB) and aerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase (fumA), which both need to be knocked out as well (Song et al. , 2013). Knocking out the Fumarase proteins leads to a dysfunctional or a ‘broken’ TCA-cycle, since malate cannot be formed anymore from f"
Warwick,2015," it could be due to issues with the ethidium bromide gel we were using. At the iGEM 2015 London Meet up we met the team from Glasgow University. They had just presented an ethidium bromide free method of producing gels, which then did not need to be visualised using a blue light. Instead these gels were visible under normal conditions, which we saw as extremely helpful to solve our issue. Glasgow kindly packaged off and sent us some AzureA, with which we set out producing the gel. While this did not ultimately solve our issue (we ended up using a different dye altogether) we are still thankful for the opportunity to test out a fellow iGEM team's ideas.

Manchester-Graz Collaboration
A key element of iGEM is outreach into schools in order to get the next generation of scientists thinking about synthetic biology and what they can do. As one of our team was born and bred Mancunion, we decided to set out on a collaborative outreach with the Manchester-Graz team. This involved iGEM members from the competing teams pairing up via the web to prepare lessons and presentations; ultimately leading to a full day of teaching where we presented to over 450 students. Our aim was to get the students thinking about going to university, studying a scientific degree, and for the older students; what they could achieve with synthetic biology. This collaboration brought together two teams to work alongside each other to plan and execute outreach within a school, this enabled a variety of experiences to be shared with students. We see this collaboration as a success; the Manchester-Graz team were fantastic to work with, and feedback from teachers has been hugely positive!

UChile Biotec
As part of our Human Practices, we collaborated with the UChile Biotec team. Last year they published a magazine called “iGEM Latinoamérica” to recognize all the work being done by teams all over Latin America. In this magazine, they mostly included descriptions of the different projects, of their Human Practices, and the difficulties they had been experiencing along the way. This year they decided to launch a second edition of the magazine and in the process of doing so, we contributed information about our project, difficulties, and even information about Peru, as a country involved in tourism. Because of their experience with creating magazines, we asked them to help us with our own magazine: the “Journal of FDR Science.” In this issue of the “Journal of FDR Science,” we decided to spotlight our iGEM project this year; in order, to promote the work we’ve done to the rest of our community. Our journal includes our abstract; articles about the health effects resulting from mercury contamination coming largely from metal mines in Peru; and lab safety. Throughout this last month, we have been in frequent contact with UChile Biotec asking for their feedback on each and every one of our drafts. Most of their feedback helped us review the content in our articles, the layout of the journal, and added crucial information about iGEM."
Tuebingen,2018," in all this collaboration allowed us to test our workflow BERT in a meaningful iGEM related context and we were able to provide the iGEM-Team Paris-Bettencourt with an epitope reduced sequence and a corresponding stable protein structure. Moreover, we could help Paris-Bettencourt to verify the structural integrity of their isomerase protein when fused to the ovispirin AMP. Besides the modeling, we were happy to get the opportunity to discuss some problems we had with or MD simulations with another team that is also using MD simulation to model parts of their project.

Our team enjoyed collaborating with the University of Nebraska - Lincoln iGEM's team. Over the summer, our teams noticed the similar topics of our projects and decided collaboration would be a great idea. One of our team members happened to have an internship in Omaha, NE and got the chance to meet with UNL's team in Lincoln. They discussed project progress, our teams, and spoke about plans to collaborate. We settled on making an informative brochure on emerald ash borers and their potential impact on the U.S. based on our collective multiple industry contacts. Copies of this brochure will be available at our poster session and is attached below.

Description of your project including the benefits and drawbacks
Our proposed long term solution to the devastation of EABs is to develop a Ash tree that is genetically resistant to them. We would do this with a known Bacillus thuringiensis Cry8Da protein, by inducing mutation in the protein’s receptor binding regions to create a Bt toxin specific for EABs. After screening these modified proteins, we would utilize leaf-specific expression of the Cry toxin, in order to target the EABs as they feed during adulthood.
The benefit of this project would be that the ideal urban landscaping ash tree could still be used, just with this implementation of genetic engineering. The drawbacks of the project are that it is a very long-term solution, and does not have the effective nature of a new treatment method.
Current treatments/other work:
Cutting down trees, pesticide options, predatory wasps, grading resistant ash trees, benefits, and drawbacks to these
The main current treatments in place are: soil drenching, injecting insecticides into the soil, grafting of resistant ash trees, and parasitic wasps. The arborists our team interviewed prefered the injection of emamectin benzoate, as it has minimal impact on surroundings, as compared to soil drenching or spraying of insecticides. Removing trees altogether, though it is an option, can be expensive and difficult in urban environments. Another option is to integrate resistant ash tree cuttings onto normal ash trees in nurseries, as this cloning is how most urban nurseries produce trees"
OLS_Canmore,2016," as animal feed and fertilizers. This is done through a semi-quantitative analysis of keratinase A (kerA) and keratinase US (kerUS) activity, and expression of these genes in E.coli.  The genes for production of kerA and kerUS originate from Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus brevis respectively.  These genes were optimized for expression in Escherichia coli JM109 and DH5⍺.  The KerA enzyme is most active in degrading keratin in feathers, while KerUS is most active in degrading keratin in hair. The production and effectiveness of keratinase was tested on human hair over five days at a temperature of 37°C.  Observations from this semi-quantitative assay, combined with results from a skim milk plate assay suggest that some protease is being expressed and secreted.
Abstract for ""Learning to Ker: Safety and Ethics in High School Synthetic Biology""
The Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Academy iGEM team is a dynamic synthetic biology group made of high school students from grades 10 through 12. On the team there are brains, athletes, princesses, and basket cases all working towards one goal: expressing Keratinases in E.coli JM109 and DH5⍺. Keratinases have the ability to reduce the 8.5 billion tons of keratin waste produced by the poultry industry every year, along with the keratin waste in wastewater treatment industries in the form of hair. The hair and feathers degraded by the keratinases could even be recycled into a high-quality protein product that can be used to make fertilizer and animal feed. While one focus is to complete this project, the true goal is to provide high school students with a well-rounded education beyond the classroom. This diverse scientific education is not limited to working inside the lab or on the technical aspects of the project. It extends to all areas of science, including safety and ethical considerations, as well as the acknowledgement of different religious and economic perspectives in scientific endeavours. Over the past 3 years, the Our Lady of the Snows iGEM and synthetic biology team has been learning how to build a lab that is economically feasible, through do-it-yourself projects and secondhand equipment. The team has tackled safety issues related to sharing lab space with many students in a high school. Students have also considered the project from a faith-based perspective, and addressed other ethical concerns related to young student scientists and genetic engineering.

Promoting iGEM in the Middle East
Throughout the duration of working on our project, we have been communicating with the iGEM 2016 Team Ain Shams-Egypt to provide feedback on ideas and collaborate as the few schools located in the Middle East. The main goal for our collaboration was to exchange ideas to increase the number of teams participating in iGEM in our region.  On October 15, 2016, we had a video-chat conversation between the two teams, and discussed how to bring iGEM closer to our communities.
After exploring different ideas, we decided to create flyers that would be distributed to high schools in the Middle East.

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015," is greatly appreciated that you could give us some insight from firsthand experience. We had a couple more questions regarding this email. Firstly, we were wondering about how you planned to implement the under-sink bioreactors ethically, and while given permission from the home-owners, because as we see it, many people would be scared about putting a bioreactor within their house? We also wondered if you still had the papers you referenced, because we do have some papers that we have read, those ones might be useful for us to look into. If you don't still have copies, no worries, but thank you again! I'm sure we will continue to come up with questions for you, as it is much appreciated that you would be willing to collaborate with us and share your knowledge!
Thanks, Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Academy iGEM Team
Hi,
I'll have to talk to some of my team about the bioreactor thing. If I remember rightly we weren't looking to make them compulsory, but would have put an incentive scheme in place with water companies for people that used them. We definitely interviewed some people about whether they'd be comfortable having one in their home, and most people weren't as worried as we'd assumed they would be.  I'll have a look for the papers tonight, I don't have access to my google drive from work. If I don't get back to you with them, just send me a reminder email.
Thanks,  Lara
University of Chicago
Our second collaboration was also with another team who previously attempted this project, the University of Chicago.  The University of Chicago 2013 iGEM team designed a construct to degrade feathers in the poultry industry but did not complete their construct. They also planned to use the byproducts in the reaction to make useful products “By developing an efficient process for the digestion of keratin, we would not only drastically reduce the cost of disposal but also allow the keratin to be used in products like animal feed, fertilizers and biodegradable plastics. Our final product would be a one-step continuous process in which feather waste could be continually added to B. subtilis cultures.” -University of Chicago. From the collaboration with the University of Chicago we hoped to get advice from them concerning our project and the issue we are tackling, as well as advice for implementation.

We discussed about assistance and drew a conclusion that if time and energy permit, we will help them with modelling.
Figure 7.6
In September, we had cooperation with them. Since our experiments had a lot of things in common, we cooperated in various aspects of the whole project. Especially, we had a deep discussion of the concept of modelling and exchanged views about the details, such as the way to predict the density of factors in the mice. At first, they were interested in our parts’confirmation in animal models, like fitting of fluorescence intensity. Later, they wanted to introduce that in their own models. We also gave them a little instruction about how to predict the factors in mice and analysis the data.
Communication with Team TMMU_China
At the very beginning, we talked about the Neutral Network with regards to its usage as classification, and regression model. We were excited to find out that both of our teams took similar ways to predict values. When realizing that there was a problem about how to define parameters, we both found a method to solve it. It was so happy to get the chance to communicate with someone who owned passion towards data analysis and we even promised to meet in Boston and attended some biostatistics classes in Harward.
Participation in CCiC
(Conference of China iGEMer Committee, 2016)
This year, Conference of China iGEMer Committee, 2016 is successfully held by School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University. (2nd~4th, September)
After invited, our team presented a poster and share our story in SYSU-CCiC conference. As a medical team, we brought a new therapeutical tool, mesenchymal stem cells, to participants, who were mostly not familiar with them. Surprisingly, we were excited that our project, MSCavalry: MSCs of next generation, attracted many attenders, which arose utmost praise and encouragement to us all.
SYSU-CCiC conference also provided us with an opportunity to communicate with"

Scientific Collaborations
Team Tübingen
At the European Meetup this year in Delft we met the Team from Tübingen. We talked about our projects and learned, that their project for this year’s competition involves the synthesis of a novel antibiotic to be used in humans.             As we exchanged ideas we came up with a way to collaborate. Since it is interesting to examine against which bacteria a novel antibiotic has an effect, we planned to test the antibiotic, made in Tübingen, in another bacteria, in Erlangen.             Thereto the Team from Tübingen sent us Clorobiocin, a molecule similar to their novel antibiotic, a protocol for an agar diffusion test as well as the needed material. As test bacteria, the corynebacteria C.             glutamicum has been chosen and we finally studied the influence of Clorobiocin on the C. glutamicum strain 13032 with the PEKEX2 plasmid for selection.             We performed the test with different concentrations of the antibiotic and – for control – with ampicillin, water and MeOH"

Tianjin assists us with the test of the mini combination in order to verify that the MINI-GRE can work successfully in different yeast strains and under various laboratories conditions.
Accidentally, the chassis in the project of Tianjin are yeasts but with a synthetic genome, so that they also tested our mini combination in their special yeast called SynX. Consequently, the efficiency of our MINI-GRE is validated.

We helped Nanjing-China validate the function of their formaldehyde whole-cell sensor. We transformed their plasmids to E. coli BL-21 and induced the becteria with 1400uM formaldehyde( or without formaldehyde for control).  After 13h’s  incubation, the difference was revealed in the picture. After pelleting the cells, we could see clearly that the medium in the experimental group turned red, while the negative control do not, indicating that their plasmids function well under our experimental conditions.

1-1. Overview
Our team collaborated with iGEM 2016 team KAIT_Japan and other teams, as we were asked to help them with the modeling in an early stage. From iGEM 2016 team KAIT_Japan we were asked to help them create a mathematical model for their project.
1-2. Project
Team KAIT planned on increasing the production of Bacterial Cellulose (BC) produced by the bacteria A. xylinum. To do so, we have to take into account the cellulose synthesis pathway.
Fig. 8-1-1. Cellulose synthesis pathway of an Acetobacter
Based on the mechanisms of this pathway, iGEM 2016 team KAIT_Japan planned to increase the amount of cellulose production by diminishing the amount of G6PDH and PGI enzymes by the antisense method.
1-3. Mathematical Model
Cellulose is produced basically by a series of enzymatic reactions, so in order to create a mathematical model for this project, we have to take into account the principal reactions taking place in this production. By doing this we obtain the following equations .
$$ \displaystyle \frac{d[Glc]}{dt} = - \frac{V_{max_1}[Glc]}{K_{m_1} + [Glc]} $$
$$ \displaystyle \frac{d[Frc]}{dt} = - \frac{V_{max_5}[Frc]}{K_{m_5} + [Frc]} - \frac{V_{max_6}[Frc]}{K_{m_6} + [Frc]} $$
$$ \displaystyle \frac{d[G6P]}{dt} = - \frac{V_{max_1}[Glc]}{K_{m_1} + [Glc]} - \frac{V_{max_2}[G6P]}{K_{m_2} + [G6P]}"

Prepare for the competition
Experiments don't work all the time, that is not a problem if you can find out the rea-sons. The real problem is irresponsibility. Anyone who doesn't do clean up after experi-ments, writes a lousy lab logs, or commit any actions endangering the safety of the lab shouldn't be allowed to conduct experiments further.
The principle is don't make troubles and let other people to pay the price.
iGEM is not an easy job. A strong team with tight relationship is essential.As the founder you need to set an example and motivate your teammates in any way you can like your passion, your charisma and your determination. Proper incentive and resting is also im-portant.
Interaction with teammates
Each teammates has their own impression or comment to you but you should stick on your original feeling about yourself.
As a leader, you need to understand each individual's uniqueness, learn how to get along well with them and deal with all sorts of stuff. Delegate properly and make sure eve-ryone's is working in their forte.
The competition is still continuing and many things I have yet experienced. This piece of article is limited by my own experience. If it helps you in any way, I will be excited and honored. Love and peace~

Mentoring from KUAS
We had a team meet-up with the collegiate team KUAS_Korea at Korea University for mentorship and exchanging ideas. Firstly, each team briefly presented their project to the other team. KUAS_Korea’s project was about demonstrating the game theory in a biological context, using two different synthetically modified bacterial strains. After the presentation, members from each team provided advice, critiques, and recommendations for the other team so that both teams could improve their projects. Although the content was from different tracks, we were able to get practical feedback on our presentation. Some of the advice included that our project needs not focus on the commercialization of our product, which is a heart failure immunosensor, as we are a high school team. It was suggested that manifesting our passion and efforts toward achieving our experimental procedure are sufficient enough. After participating in iGEM for more than ten years, KUAS_KOREA gave our team practical advice on Giant Jamboree requirements and informed us on many previous mistakes they have witnessed over years of Giant Jamboree participation. In addition, KUAS_Korea generously gave advice on wiki development, project presentation, human practices, judging criteria, and many other aspects. Finally, we were given the opportunity to visit the lab at Korea University. This meaningful discussion and collaboration helped our team not only to improve upon specific aspects of our project but also to perform better for the Giant Jamboree.
Proof-Reading Help
We would like to thank Nottingham iGEM for their invaluable collaboration on our project. Nottingham iGEM very kindly offered their grammar checking services, as native English speakers for our wiki. We collaborated intensely over the summer months, sending our team drafts and redrafts of our wiki submissions. Their team generously supported us, editing our drafts over and over until the grammar was perfect! We could not be more grateful for Nottingham iGEM's invaluable collaboration on this project. It has been a pleasure collaborating with them and their help with our iGEM project was vital to our team's success.

TU_Delft,2015,", so there was no reason to exchange plasmids. They had some questions for us about the modeling, because our model was already quite developed at that time. It was a good experience, and nice to           meet another team!
NCTU_Formosa Taiwan
On the 4th of August we had a Skype conversation with the iGEM team of NCTU. After 15 minutes of getting the technology to work, we finally can talk. We started with sharing our project topics. Jenny Gee, one of the team members held a comprehensive           presentation of their project. What we noticed and surprised us is that it seems that most of the teams have a lot of members. However, our team consist only of nine(9) members, we seem to be quite on track. We are all now working at least 40           hour a week on iGEM, and it was nice to hear that NCTU team also does. They are arranging a big event among the Asian iGEM teams. For us that’s maybe also an idea, to arrange one more time an event among the Dutch teams. It was a nice conversation,           we had fun meeting them and seeing how far other teams are in their project.
Oxford Team
Oh the 24th of June we received a message via Facebook from Kyle Sam Bennett of the Oxford iGEM Team. They contacted us because we were both working with biofilms. In their project they focus on the breakdown of biofilms in the urinary tract in order to treat Urinary Tract Infections. For testing the breakdown, they need biofilms with their modified bacteria. Because we also create biofilms with a modified E. Coli bacteria, with the help of a 3D printer, our projects fit really well.
Our project can be a good support for theirs. With the use of our printer in combination with the vector with the curli gene inserted in their modified bacteria, they can print biofilms in the structure. A second subject in which we can help each other is to discuss the safety of the projects. We finally decided to induce the biofilm formation with rhamnose. The last collaboration point with Oxford was about the modeling. We had in total 2 skype meetings, and a few times contact by email. We shared ideas.
Aix-Marseille
The iGEM team of Aix-Marseille Université asked us to participate on their survey about chewing gum. Examples of questions in their survey were:
- How much bubble gum do we consume all around the world during a year?
- Does your country have a way of removing"

Meetup held by ITCCC
On July 24th, we were invited to take part a meeting upheld by International Teenager                         Competition and Communication Center on campus of USTB, during which 4 teams shared the                         experimental process about their project of iGEM. We found some problems in the design of each                         other's projects through communication, and discussed some solutions and ideas. Each team                         received a lot of pertinent suggestions from the others, which helped a lot to our project.
Meetup in Shanghai
By the end of August, we had preliminarily completed all parts of experimental verification,                         constructed the relevant proteins, and verified the strength of each promoter. In order to                         further improve our project and make progress with other teams from communication, we                         participated in CCIC. All of the teams exchanged ideas about their project and original design                         and have a quick exhibition of the poster, give some simple but classic presentation. Among                         which we also try to find ways to better collaborate with other teams, especially in the                         modelling and outreach. We received more than 10 useful advises about our project and having a                         great time!

We determined the inhibitory effect of PLA (phenyllactic acid, a new type of natural                         antibacterial substance and preservative) on yeast CEN.PK2-1C. In this way, we knew more                         about the broad-spectrum antibacterial performance of PLA. (check here for more detail)

Macquarie_Australia,2017," 3 consecutive lanes within the green lines for each sample):
Pre-incubated: gRNA + enzymes (incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes in all samples)
Incubated: gRNA + enzyme + PCR product (further incubated for 1 hour at 37°C)
Deactivated: gRNA + enzyme + PCR product (further incubated for 1 hour at 37°C) and a deactivation step of 20 minutes at 80°C.
Our experiment used a commercial Cas9 with nuclease activity as a control (see Figure 2). From this sample we have been able to better interpret our results. The pre-incubated control shows an upward gel shift of the gRNA (Figure 2A), indicating commercial Cas9 binding to gRNA (Figure 2B, lane 2). Upon incubation with the PCR product, there is a disappearance of both higher bands and loss of smearing, suggesting the formation of a stable conformation of gRNA, Cas9 and the target PCR product. The deactivation step causes the disassembly of the gRNA/Cas9 complex, resulting in the reverting of the gel shift of the PCR product and the gRNA, and also shows specific cleavage of the PCR product. Absence of the protein bands after deactivation is likely due to denaturation of the enzyme that results in protein aggregation/precipitation.
From our results we observed the different truncated protein sites in the four samples: WT (dCas9), 3P, 5P and HNH (see Figure 1). The EMSA performed suggests binding to gRNA of mutant dCas9 in WT, 3P, 5P and HNH samples. This is evident from the observation of gRNA complexes shifting upon incubation with DNA. Protein shifts after incubation with the PCR product suggested that the mutants retained the ability to bind the target DNA. Deactivation of the protein DNA complex reversed the migration shift of the PCR product, providing further evidence that the dCas9 binds to the PCR product, while not having nuclease activity.

He                         informs that currently the successful UDCA synthesis rate is not hight enough and requires                         repeating measures to increase its purification ratio. It is very important for us to consider                         more about the balance between cost and profits if we want to further develop our method. Now,                         the exported UDCA drugs are highly demanded and we need to find ways to help simplify the                         production process and to increase the supply of UDCA-contained drugs.
Interview
Q：We still have some questions regarding to the market. It would be such a pleasure if you can                         share some of your ideas or understandings about them.
A : Please ask, I’m very glad to help you.
Q1: Could you please inform us UDCA medicine’s value in market and its efficacy?
A: UDCA is an cholic acid medicine that has choleretic effect to human bodies. It can cure                         various dan diseases like gallstone as well as hepatopathy including hepatic adipose                         infiltration. UDCA medicine has stronger healing effect than CDCA medicine while having less                         side effects in treatment. However, subtracted from bears, UDCA has a relatively high costs. And                         using UDCA directly converted by CDCA mainly has two benefits: first of all, it requires a lower                         cost because CDCA is subtracted from poultry like chickens, ducks, and geese; also, use CDCA                         instead of UDCA can help protect wild animals (bears.) Also, I consulted experts in our                         marketing department about it and they revealed to me that this approach has very high                         vendibility that medicines manufactured oversea are in short supply.
Q2: What is the basic principle of this drug design/production?
: First we extract CDCA from the bile of chicken, duck and geese. Then we convert CDCA into UDCA                         through two steps of redox reaction. These two substance are isomers than differ in their                         three-dimensional structure only.
Q3: We found out that there are only few factories manufactures UDCA medicine. Is it because the                         producing process’s complexity? Where is the complexity embodied in specific?
A: In fact, the actual process or technology used is not very complex but the key dangerous                         factor is the need of sodium, a dangerous, active metal that burns when it meets with water.                         Moreover, to consider this issue from other perspectives, UDCA medicine’s production copes wth                         the pressure from people’s safety and environment protection concerns. Therefore there are not                         too many factories that manufactures UDCA medicine.
Maybe there are only two factories in China that"
AHUT_China,2018," with original plasmid of PCDF-Duet1 (dry powder tube), taught us to overlap the secretion label Yebf (from BL21(DE3)DNA, GenBank: EF648003.1) with human-derived interleukin 10 (from BBa_K554004, Spring 2018 Distribution 21K 2018 Kit Plate 1), and required us to add the FLAG label at the N end of homoIL10 for subsequent protein detection. According to the requirements of our friend, we conducted the experiment on construction of secreting the plasmid Yebf-homoIL10. Having sequenced and verified the plasmid construction successfully, we mailed  no-less-than-100ng plasmid dry powder to them.
NEU-China-A helped us implement experiments on optimizing the conditions of prokaryotic expression of CSCA protein and purifying expression. Our friendship has thus been strengthened and the projects have also been pushed forward as the result of this collaboration, which is as a successful cooperation by both of us.

As the project continues to proceed, HP's exchanges and cooperations between teams are more frequent and in-depth. After seeing the cooperation application issued by the iGEM team of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-Madras) at the iGEM official website, we contacted IIT-Madras to discuss cooperation actively.
We are pleased to collaborate with the iGEM team of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-Madras) to make a video on the science of synthetic biology in the mother tongue. The Indian Institute of Technology is also working with other teams in English, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati and Hindi.
IIT-Madras sends an English script to our team. We need to match the provided slideshow video with the provided text and add the translated text to the subtitles, and finally make it into Chinese video.
We thought it was a simple matter, but there were some  problems at the beginning.The problems is summarized as follows:
1. The English script does not exactly match the sound in  the video, and some paragraphs are missing.
2. English and Chinese belong to different language families. They are slightly different in grammar, and the word order is reversed in translation.
3. Some video pictures and sounds are out of sync and need to be adjusted.
4. Our team members are not familiar enough with the Indian accent in English"

The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)
    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage."
BGU_ISRAEL,2016," is expected to  detect these products in the solvent and migrate towards them overcoming the diffusion's limiting rate. This mechanism can expedite the degradation rate of the PET products and make our system more efficient.
We got the structures and the sequences of 19 variants for ethylene glycol receptor and 9 variants for Terephthalic acid receptor. Unfortunately, we couldn’t synthesize these receptors and check their activity, due to time and finance limits but we thought on a theoretical way use them.
We wrote an assay of Terephthalic acid detection that can support the examination of this process. In the future, we also plan to find an ethylene glycol detection protocol.

1.OUR HP With TEAM HFUT iGEM
In this section of collaboration, we helped the Team HFUT test their software Biodesigner Coral, an online software that can help users search for particular part of iGEM and construct their own part, the relationship among genes, compounds, or parts, and offer the detailed information of a plenty of genes. We discussed about the software according to the using experience of our team. We tried to use this software to build a part we use this year and search for some genes we often use. We gave them some suggestions online. Here are the screenshot pictures of the online chatting records. (We use the common social network QQ to communicate, Haoran Ding represented our team and Xinyu Chen reprensented Team HFUT)
Ding: What is more, Your database may be incomplete, for I searched for the part BBa_E1010 used in one of our device, but I did not get the result even if I directly type the part number. Ding: (screenshot, to show the lack of result when search for a particular part)
Ding: And there is a BBa_E1011, but it is codon optimized mRFP-1 gene in yeast. Ding: But I do not need this optimization. Ding: (screenshot, to show the information on the box on the right of the page) Ding: Actually I have found this part in the information box on the right of the page. Ding: Of course it is excellent overall, I have constructed a device according to the guide. Ding: (screenshot, to show the finished device) Ding: This device has only one part different from the actually constructed part.
Chen: I will check the database after a while. Chen: To see if there is something missed and update the database. Ding: You need to update at all time, this year many new parts will enter the iGEM part database. Chen: Would you like try some other functions? Ding: OK."

Working Together
We collaborated with several iGEM teams from different countries and with different backgrounds. The exchange resulted in new inputs, insights and friendships.
Freiburg
We ran into the Freiburg team for the first time at the iGEM meet-up organized by the TU Delft team . Soon we realized that for both our projects the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role. Their designer cells should be able to reliably interpret environmental signals and only become active if they are in a solid tumor. Similarly, our bacteria should be able to do so as well but with different signals. Since it’s hard to reproduce such an microenvironment in the labs that were available to us we wanted to combine our expertises and help each other overcome this issue.
To discuss in more detail how such a collaboration could look like we were invited for a BBQ in Freiburg.
Visiting our collaborators in Freiburg to discuss our work and enjoy a nice barbeque together.
At the university there, our anti-cancer protein of choice, azurin, is quite well known and routinely purified at lab courses. They therefore agreed to make a killing curve of azurin on a mammalian cell line. Further, they provided us with samples of azurin so that we can reproduce their data and conduct additional experiments. Without their help, verifying the action of azurin would have been very hard.
We, on the other hand, leveraged our experience in modelling of the tumor environment.
Heidelberg
This years's team from Heidelberg worked, among other things, on mutagenesis plasmids for direct evolution applications. To improve reproducibility of their assay, they reached out to a number of teams and asked to participate in their mini-interlab study . We were happy to help out and are looking forward to the results of the experiments!

Collaborations with non-iGEMers
Collaboration with Engineers Without Borders Sweden
During the spring this year the adivsory board for Engineers Without Borders Sweden at Linköping University reached out to us for a project they were working on. Engineers Without Borders Sweden is an organisation that works with challenges related to sustainable development goals around the globe. One of their goals is to inspire more young students to become engineers. We teamed up with them for a tour of Linköping University aimed at inspiring secondary school students to pursue a higher education. This is described further on our Human Practice page."
Jilin_China,2018," When our team did the measurement, we cultured the bacteria to OD=0.6 and then re-suspended the bacterial precipitation with MM culture medium. We cultured the bacteria with different concentration of psicose and measured the Abs600 and fluorescence intensity once per hour.
The results are as follows:
Figure 8. Abs600 and fluorescence intensity once per hour in different psicose solution.
From the above results, we can see that with the increasing of psicose concentration, the fluorescence intensity increases, which matches their assumption.
XJTU-China has also helped us a lot. For our experimental design this year, we have lots of RNA-based thermosensors to submit to the part registry, which is a huge and challenging task. If we use the traditional construction method, the time and cost of constructing these parts will be a huge problem for us. Fortunately, we met XJTU-China at the CCiC conference, and they would like to help us design an intermediate device for constructing standardized parts.
In combination with their own experience in using Golden Gate assembly, they inserted an only 60bp DNA fragment into pSB1C3 plasmid. The DNA fragment contains BsaI restriction site. Golden Gate assembly will enable fast and efficient parts construction. They sent the device to us as quickly as possible so we could complete the construction of about 50 parts before deadline, which greatly reduced our workload, improved our experimental efficiency, and solved our problem.
Figure 9. The intermediate device for constructing standardized parts.
The plasmid was confirmed to be constructed as expectation by enzyme digestion (original plasmid, BsaI single digestion, and EcoRI and PstI double digestion). The agarose gel electrophoresis (figure 10) showed that these enzyme-digested products were all normal, and the brightness was also normal (5bp and 60bp fragment cannot be fully displayed on the electropherogram due to its short length ). Furthermore, they sequenced it. The sequencing results showed that the ligation of plasmid and insert was correct, and the sequencing results were of good quality.
Figure 10. Each gel pore reprenents 1kb marker, original plasmid, plasmid + BsaI and plasmid + EcoRI + PstI.
In our follow-up experiments, the constructing device was fully applicable, and the success rate exceeded our expectation, which greatly reduced our workload. We constructed all basic parts before deadline.
After this cooperation, we have established a deep friendship with XJTU-China. We often discuss some problems encountered in Golden Gate"

DLUT_China,2018," projects. Since our team currently lacks a lethal system, in this exchange, we worked with NEU_China_A to jointly verify and optimize the cold shock system, improve the project, and meet the iGEM safety requirements.
rIgem Xuzhou Communication Meeting
    At the beginning of the meeting, the four universities (Dalian university of technology, Lanzhou university, Jiangnan university, Zhejiang university of technology) publicized the igem related situation to the students present and answered everyone's questions. Since the meeting was in the third quarter of the National Undergraduate Life Science Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, it achieved good publicity. Next, the four universities introduced their projects in turn, accepted questions from everyone, and explained the bottlenecks of the project, hoping to get inspiration through discussion.
    Our team's project has aroused great interest from the teachers and students present. Everyone said that the project is novel, practical, and cleverly designed, but at the same time it also put forward many opinions. First of all, because our products have to enter the human body, the lethal system is essential, and how to maintain it in the body is controllable and effective is also an extremely important problem; secondly, how do we penetrate the intestinal wall to act on the blood; finally, respond in vivo What is the threshold value of uric acid and can be sensed before the minimum value. We answered the above questions one by one.
    This exchange will be very rewarding, not only learning the advantages of other teams, but also discovering their own shortcomings. And with the help of some teams, Jiangnan University expressed its willingness to provide E. coli exocrine system. Zhejiang University of Technology expressed its willingness to exchange experience in mathematical modeling and learned that Beijing University of Technology has a signal amplification system."

Collaboration with iGEM Team Bielefeld
Team Bielefeld sent us  a plasmid based on BBa_I746909 having a translation enhancing sequence (5’-UTR). We, the iGEM team Freiburg, sent a plasmid containing coding sequences for turboYFP, a His- and a Halo-Tag. We aimed to analyze if these parts will work in different cell-free protein synthesis environments.
To test the plasmid BBa_I746909 containing a translation enhancing sequence (5'-UTR) we performed a cell-free expression with our own mix and compared it to a sample containing no DNA (negative control).
Both samples were treated alike and compared. All reactions were performed in duplicates.  The samples were expressed for 4 hours at 37°C in a 384-well plate using our DiaMIX. After expression, the graph clearly indicates successful expression of GFP. This underlines the ability of the DiaMIX to express vectors from various sources and the effectiveness of a 5'UTR.
Figure 1: Expression of BBa_I746909. The expression was conducted for 4 h and relative fluorescence measured in one minute steps. Mean values and standard deviations were calculated from duplicates.
Collaboration with iGEM Team Stockholm
Stockholm sent us the lysate of a HER2 domain binding affibody with a His-tag as well as a glycerol stock of the E. coli Top10 strain they used for expression and organized the sponsoring of the HER2-antigen from R&D-systems.
Freiburg tried to measure the binding of the purified HER2-antigen to the His-affibody lysate in iRIf.

Figure 4. Meeting
Question from NEU
Quiz1：The idea of your team is very novel and has important practical value. But as a medicine that enters the human body, how to control it does not harm the intestinal flora?
Answer: We have reviewed a group quantity control system of Imperial College of Science and Technology in 2016. We have made improvements in light of our own situation. Simply put, the concentration of signal substances controlled by the bacteria itself controls the opening and closing of the suicide system, thereby regulating the number of bacteria.
Quiz2：Your final product is a bacterial preparation. There are great potential threats to the environment. Have you thought about any suicide mechanism? We are doing a cold lethal system, and if you are interested we can cooperate.
Answer：Thank you very much for your proposal. We also checked the information and found the Blu-ray lethal system, etc., but I am still very happy to work with you. You can provide our plasmids. We can help you to characterize and provide relevant data.
Question from DLUT
Quiz1: As a system for detecting lactic acid, what are the advantages of your products with lactic acid detection products on the market?     Answer: Compared with the normal detection of lactic acid products, we have more use of biological related technologies. By referring to some of the design experience of the 2015-year team at the ETH Zurich, we used the group sensing system of E. coli and used fiber optic circuitry for detection,. It is low cost and ease of use.
Quiz2: How do you ensure that E. coli in your system does not pollute the fermentation industry?     Answer: We intend to paste our product into a portable device, and the part that touches the fermentation liquid is only the probe. The E. coli inside the unit does not pollute the fermentation broth.

         Linking and setting the groups Experimental group:plasmid after digestion + target gene + T4 DNA Ligase + buffer Control group: plasmid after digestion *Experiment conducted under 16°C
1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

Mathimatical models
    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0."

Checking a Biobrick for iGEM Utrecht
The iGEM team of Utrecht came to us with a problem. In their project they were planning to use the Tar receptor, which was available in the iGEM distribution kit (2018). However, when they did the transformations, they saw something surprising. When they analysed the colonies using a biocular microscope, they were able to detect GFP expressions. However, the sequence of the tar receptor should not contain GFP. In order to find out whether the sequence for the tar receptor was correct they approached multiple iGEM teams to uncover the truth. We did the transformation like they did and checked if the colonies contained GFP like they saw. However, we were not able to see these GFP expressions. Like us, other iGEM teams also saw that there was no GFP expressions when they did the transformations, and therefore we claim this mystery solved. The given sequence of iGEM turned out to be correct.
Interview with NRC
iGEM Utrecht organized an interview with the NRC, which is a Dutch newspaper. All six of the Dutch iGEM teams were invited to attend this interview. On the 19th of September, we traveled to Utrecht for a sitdown with an NRC reporter. Several topics were discussed, such as the impact of Biobricks on the ease of synthetic biology, how to implement your system into society and so forth. We were glad that this opportunity arose since the iGEM competition, or even synthetic biology itself, is relatively unknown in the Netherlands and this would be a perfect way to increase public awareness the possibilites provided by this field of research.
Hydrogel exchange with iGEM Hamburg
During the European meetup in Munich we had an interesting talk with iGEM Hamburg right off the bat. Their project involved a mosquito trap that relies on a lure-and-kill mechanism. Their trap had 2 cultures, a culture of E. coli that produces mosquito attractants and are kept alive the second culture of S. elongatus. This culture produces glucose using CO2 and sunlight.  They were planning on using a hydrogel to act as a reservoir for odor bait molecules and insecticides, and to provide a surface for mosquitoes to land on. Since we are also working with hydrogels, this connected us easily. We told them that we were aiming at making a living material using a combination"

Mainly the general safety measures done on a genetic laboratory practice, which include the confinement procedure to not let any forms of genetic material (includes the seeds, spores, or any means of reproductive structure) to escape the laboratories used for the research and development of the GMMS.
In Japan, the Ministry of Health and Welfare established The standard of manufacture management and quality management of biological agents and The standard of structive facility of manufacturing place of biological agents. In this standard, there are several safety measures of workers.
• Keep good hygiene of workers
1. Don't let irrelevant people come inside the workplace.
2. Make workers wear disinfected shoes, working clothings, working caps, and working masks.
3. Make workers follow the rules when going in the workplaces that handles different microorganism or biological agents.
4. Don't let workers who are engaged in manufacture step manage animals.
5. Provide vaccines and other infection prevention measures when necessary, and make workers get medical check up on a regular basis.
6. If making biological agents using people's blood or plasma, provide vaccine of Hepatitis B virus etc. to workers if necessary.
• Manage hygiene of workers in a sterilised zone or clean zone
1. Check if workers are not in a dangerous condition by microorganism pollution or other reasons.
2. Let workers get medical check ups every 6 months.

Team NUS Singapore
We recieved an invitation from NUS-Singapore to collaborate on our iGEM competition and were excited to pay them a visit.
During our visit, we learned about their project regarding the use of E. coli as a drug delivery system to target cancer cells. The surface marker used for the attachment of E. coli to cancer cells is CD44v6, an isoform of CD44 with exon v6, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed specifically in cancer cells. We thought that it would be meaningful if Team NUS could have a negative control where the cancer cell line already has the CD44v6 knock-ed out. With this cell line, they could test for the targeting specificity of the E. Coli.
With an online search we found that the CD44 gene is heavily spliced to produce different kinds of mutants. CD44v6 is the isoform that is expressing exon v6(tenth exon), which is only present in malignant cancer cell lines. To generate a negative control for Team NUS, we targeted three regions of the CD44 gene. We targeted the first two exons present in all isoforms of CD44 so that they can all be inactivated at once. For the third target site, we made a segmental deletion targeted to exon v6. The target sites were made as far as possible for the splice junctions to prevent disruption of the junction.
gRNA design to target exon v6 for segmental in-frame deletion.
After cloning of the gRNA into the SpCas9 vector that we used for project Evaluation, we then transfected the constructs into HeLa and MDA-231 cells. However, before transfection, we made a mycoplasma test and found out that the cells we obtained from Lab A were mycoplasma contaminated.

Hence, we sourced for clean cells from other labs to start our transfection. With our current transfection reagent, TurboFect, the transfection efficiency is very low for MDA231 cells but HeLa"

Entrepreneurship
The area of ​entrepreneurship is essential for the development of any project, for our team, this area is very important because in our institution we have a lot of support from experts to develop it and some teams do not have the support of experts in entrepreneurship in their universities, that is why as part of our activities we decided to make all this support available so that other teams have the opportunity to develop this area as we do.
We conducted an online survey format that was sent to 209 teams from all educational levels and from all countries, where we questioned some aspects such as what their doubts were regarding entrepreneurship and what difficulties had been presented to them in this area throughout its development.
We received a response from approximately 20 teams, to which we devoted about a month of work on their questions along with our experts, we decided to classify the questions based on the approach we had in each question, and then consult them with experts in various areas, such as Raúl Lizarraras, entrepreneur immersion coordinator of Coworking TEC and professor
at the Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Chihuahua, also advisor to the support network for entrepreneurs at the National Institute. of the Entrepreneur (INADEM), Elías Solís Rivera, Director of Research and Graduate Studies in Development, Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Monterrey, Campus Chihuahua, has been certified as an instructor for the Environmental Leadership Program for Competitiveness by SEMARNAT and PROFEPA, likewise we received support from Alan Ventura Hernandez Talavera, Larissa Uribe Marioni, and
Itzeel Córdova Martín del Campo, graduates of the Tecnológico de Monterrey from the Biotechnology Engineering career and co-founders of Diagtech, a Molecular Research and Diagnostic center dedicated to the detection of specific genetic indicators for the prevention of diseases based on genes, as well as research and development of new diagnostic methods.
Thanks to the support we received from our experts, we managed to answer the doubts of the teams and with this benefit them for the development of their business plan and their activities in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, thus achieving that more teams have the advice they need to carry your"

Meetups in Peking University
We were invited to a meetup with PKU and OUC in August. We discussed some significant problems that we faced and shared the experience of being an iGEMer. For example, OUC iGEM team coming from Qingdao in Shandong Provence, China, gave us a presentation of algae utilization. Not only they raised a perfect project to deal with algae blooms around Qingdao sea area, but also abstracted polysaccharides ingredient from algae.
Cooperation in BCU
BCU has tidy labs and good equipment. Teachers and students of BCU gave us strong encouragement. More importantly, we has the history working together for several years. This year we continue teamwork with them. Meanwhile, we communicated widely. Industry, research and sustainable development of Synbio were discussed in these conferences. It made us to think more about what our project means to Synbio and its future expectations. Because our project is divided into several parts, many students in BCU help us to finish the synthesis of plasmid so that they relieve our heavy burden. So I am here, feel very grateful to my friends from BCU.

ECUST
This year, we developed a close relationship with an iGEM new comer—ECUST iGEM team.
Since SJTU-BioX-Shanghai is a more experienced team, we offer our help to new team to our best. In July 30, we visited ECUST, having a face-to-face meeting and a lab tour. In the meeting, we helped them get a brief idea of what                             modeling, human practice are, and gave them some advice on project designing, collaboration and visa application.
Besides continuous communication, two teams collaborated on experiments. When their experiment encountered problems we helped then transform the part they needed.
In return, when we failed so many times in transforming CrtI ,they did the transformation for us which helped us proceed our project smoothly. Also, they provided us with pSB1C3 when we were short of plasmid skeleton.
And here is a table shows briefly what we have done for each other. For more information, please visit ECUST collaboration page.

As one of the only teams working with yeast, we had difficulty finding another iGEM team with whom to troubleshoot research and/or design issues. However, one of our goals this summer was to assess and expand public knowledge about synthetic biology through education and outreach, and in order to achieve this it is important that scientists be equally aware and up-to-date in their understanding of the field. To this effect, we have participated in two surveys assessing our understanding of various aspects of synthetic biology work.
We participated in the outreach efforts of the following teams:
Virginia
University of Virginia iGEM created a survey about biocontainment practices and knowledge, titled ""Virginia iGEM Biocontainment Survey,"" which our team participated in.

International cooperation and engagement with other teams are important parts of the iGEM competition. Being in contact with more experienced iGEM teams helps overcoming difficult steps during the project but even exchanging thoughts with new iGEM teams always yields progressive solutions and creative ideas.
Team Eindhoven
Team Eindhoven can be seen as our main collaborator as for them being the team we had the most contact with. We were informed by our iGEM contact that they worked on a project similar to our LLPS approach to metabolic channeling. Their project called GUPPI (link) uses the concept of membrane less organelles to form a gel like structure which could be used in various applications. This was exciting news for us since they concentrated way more on the detailed properties of the droplet forming proteins.
They agreed to a first skype call during which we had a very informative and interesting exchange about our projects. Our teams agreed to a mutual collaboration by helping each other out with problems and talking about overall experiences we had during the projects. The main talking points were Human practices approaches and ideas how to efficiently explain their project to the public. They helped our wiki team getting started by providing HTML and CSS literature. We also set them up with a contact person regarding the modelling of their project.
At the end of summer, we kept in contact and had further skype calls and the collaboration continued by them helping us in a crucial part of the iGEM medal competition with simulating and modelling our LLPs system. This gave us a better and more detailed understanding of the inner workings of our project. General communication continued in the form of regular skype conferences. Furthermore, our wiki teams kept in contact and provided feedback for each other"
Aachen,2015," several partners they especially support startups but also global players like Bayer or Philips. We started to collaborate with them to get contact to possible sponsors, but soon recognized another immense potential. With their support, we could not only find new applications for our product, but we also found a great way to connect community labs with other partners in life sciences. They even invited us to their summer event, where we met many interesting people and associates for the future.

Stora Enzo
We got into contact with the paper industry through the MedLife network. As one of the main customers for starch in the industry, they were especially interested in our process. We were visited by two employees of Stora Enso, Heiner Grussenmeyer (chemical process engineering) and Kathrin Berger (paper manufactoring). We discussed the properties of paper starch and possible collaborations. They offered us to test our produced glycogen if it is suitable for the paper industry.
Celebration
Marburg - Meet up
We followed the invitation of the iGEM Team Marburg and went for their Meet up with six students of our team. During the weekend we had a lot of fun meeting the other iGEM Teams, racing in canoes and enjoying a great barbecue and music. Of course we also talked a lot about the project of each team and tried to support other teams as good as possible. Many collaborations were turned up during the Meet up. One of them was the collaboration with Team Göttingen.

ULaVerne_Collab iGEM 2017 team
ULaVerne_Collab team 2017 was also working with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii species. Their project needed to perform a transformation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with specific vectors to characterize three different superoxide dismutases (SOD) using two different plasmids that direct the SODs to either the cytoplasm or the chloroplasts, to determine SOD efficiency based on placement in the cell.           Our team needed wild type cell wall plus strain, with which they were working. ULaVerne team sent us this strain for our experiments and also their vectors for transformation. We in turn performed transformation of their vectors in our lab and sent electroporated C. reinhardtii colonies containing their vectors.
Moscow_RF iGEM 2017 team
We arranged a Skype meeting with the team and gave the presentations about our projects. We have discussed different areas of our projects and gave suggestions and advices for further improvements. We had issues with Interlab study and bacterial transformation. They helped us by sending working protocol for bacterial transformation using Eporator instead of standard chemical transformation.
XMU_China iGEM 2016 team
In summer 2016 our team member, Sultan Mussakhan, met with Xiamen iGem team during his internship in China. During his trip he organized a meeting and gave presentation our project and team. Xiamen team also presented their project and conducted a lab tour. During presentation we have exchanged ideas and gave suggestions for project improvements.
CCA_SanDiego iGEM 2017 team
We had a Skype meeting with SanDiego High School team, where we have exchanged our ideas and gave short presentations of our projects. We helped them with characterisation of their parts and expressed our opinion on their project. Because both our researches were involved in bioremediation, the mutual collaboration went very productive.
We had a meeting with Thomas Landrain who is the ambassador of iGEM. He had a tour in our newly set up algae lab and gave a good advice for further development of iGEM in our"
Glasgow,2016," strain, there is less fluorescence without IPTG, than with IPTG. While this does show that 1mM IPTG is sufficient to induce the BBa_R0010 promoter, this is not a perfect control for the concentration of IPTG used unless KillerRed and KillerOrange also have this promoter. In the DH5α strain, there is not much difference between RFP fluorescence with or without IPTG – this is due to DH5α not having a functional copy of LacI, the lac repressor, therefore lac-repressible promoters are not “OFF”, so cannot be switched “ON” by IPTG induction.
Sequencing
Other reasons there may not be any KillerRed or KillerOrange protein produced, are mutations in the promoter. This was something we encountered when attempting to clone a promoter in front of the toxin from the toxin-antitoxin system we were working with. If a protein is toxic to produce, any cell which is producing less or no protein will grow faster than a cell which is producing the toxic protein. This means a mutated, non-functional promoter will have a proliferative advantage during transformation. So, as we were sending our BioBricks for sequencing before submission to the iGEM registry, we decided to sequence the minipreps of KillerRed and KillerOrange as well with the registry standard pSB1C3 sequencing primer VF2, to check for any mutations.  Both plasmids had the BioBrick prefix, and the correct sequence for both KillerRed and KillerOrange open reading frame. The sequence between the prefix and the ATG start codon, we checked against lac-repressible promoters in the iGEM registry. We found a match to BBa_R0184, which is a T7 lac-repressible promoter. T7 promoters require T7 polymerase to be transcribed, as they are not recognised by E. coli polymerases. This results confirms the result of the fluorescence measurements. No KillerRed or KillerOrange fluorescence was observed, as neither gene was being transcribed by either DH5α or DH5α.Z1 as neither strain produces the required T7 polymerase. A protein overexpression E. coli strain such as BL21<DE3> which has the T7 polymerase gene inserted into its genome is designed to use T7 promoters would have been able to express these KillerRed and KillerOrange constructs.

BIT-China,2015,".4 Discussions with BNU-China
BNU_China for BIT_China
Click here to see BNU-CHINA's description of our collaborations.
○ Modeling
BNU-China mainly helps us to establish a model of substance changes during the pH regulation stage. Specifically, they build a model to link six chemical reaction processes together, all of which are controlled by switch in pH. With change in pH, main chemical reactions will change subsequently. We provided them the conditions and equations of each chemical reaction stage, and they are responsible for the realization of the equations and the whole regulation process.
The difficulty we BIT-China meet is how to connect the six groups of chemical reactions together with the switch in pH, how to identify the reaction time and the results of each chemical reaction, and how to draw an image to reflect the pH variation as function of time. Because some members of BNU-China are majoring in physics, math, computer science and chemistry, they have much experience in differential equations, application of MATLAB and designing computer programs. With these resources, they have helped us solve our problems successfully.

They chose this BioBrick because it was in the distribution kit and was already well-enough characterized to ensure that the only variable they tested was whether the sheets were processed. The data they provided shows that less protein dissociation occurred from the processed sheets.
Beyond the Bench
Despite the time zone difference, we held several skype meetings throughout the summer to discuss our collaborations and get to know each other. We also got together early on during the summer, sharing our enthusiasm over IGEM and the potential collaboration between the two teams. To celebrate our collaboration, the Edinburgh team baked an IGEM cake when we had a joint party with Brooke and Liusaidh in California at the beginning of the summer!

Cooperation
with Hubei University of Technology
    We established a close relationship with two iGEM teams of the Hubei University of Technology and the Shandong University in China, respectively, on both experimental design and collaborative research.
    The Hubei University of Technology (HUBT) participated in the iGEM and won the Bronze Medal in 2017, which is in the same city, Wuhan, China with our university. Two formal meetings with HUBT were held in the Hubei University, with the first one on December 1, 2017, and the second one on July 13th, 2018. Besides, there are continuous communication along with the whole process of our iGEM project. In the first meeting, the mentor and captains of 2017 HBUT-iGEM team shared their iGEM experience with us, including the team assembly, project execution, and the problems they encountered. In addition, they also gave valuable suggestions of our proposed 2018 iGEM project to help us understand better of the iGEM concept. At the end of the day, both two teams agreed to communicate further to build a closer relationship. In the second meeting with HBUT-iGEM team, both the team discussed the current progress of the iGEM projects. The HBUT-iGEM team members were inspired by our project goal and achievements, emphasized the importance of the work on wiki, and suggested to enrich the biological parts of the iGEM registry with Zymomonas mobilis, a unique non-model industrial microorganism. He also mentioned.
Cooperation with Shandong University
    This year, Team SKLMT-China invited us to help testing their promoters in different laboratory condition. They construct a promoter library characterized by firefly luciferase to improve pseudomonas fluorescens pf-5. Since this is a brand-new chassis for us, the cloning method is significantly different from our teams, as well as the experimental conditions. Therefore, we discussed a lot during the cooperation in transformation methods. Even if there were some problems with the experiment result , we still learnt so much from each other and were so happy to cooperate with each other. It really enriched the experience of our team, a newborn calf 2018.

                                                                                                                                                                They taught us the basic biology experimental techniques by dyeing colon bacillus in a bio-tech way.
                                                                                                                                                                Meanwhile, they invited the team instructor of Peking University to introduce us how to understand this competition.
                                                                                                                                                                Interview with the local experts
                                                                                                                                                                Since our research projects are interdisciplinary as well as socially-based,
                                                                                                                                                                 we consulted our ideas with professor in the field about the production of our experiment applying the other fields beyond the cultural artifacts protection.
                                                                                                                                                                We then communicate with Prof. Zhang, Zhejiang University, whose field is civil-engineering.
                                                                                                                                                                        Q1: How can the greasing removal apply in civil engineering?
                                                                                                                                                                        Q2: In the field of civil engineering, are there any other applications?
                                                                                                                                                                        Q3: How efficient is this method or else than biological method?
                                                                                                                                                                Based on these three question, Professor gave the following answer to all of these.

Rice iGEM - Humans of synbio
We loved the idea of sharing personal experiences within synthetic biology and ageing and wanted to collaborate with RICE iGEM.
Inspired by Humans of New York, RICE iGEM had the fantastic idea to do the same for all of us synthetic biologists working around the world.
It provided a great platform to open up about why we, and in particular teammate Abbie, are taking part in iGEM and what motivates us to be involved with synthetic biology.
After discussing the Humans of synbio questions, we saw the potential to spread the synthetic biology message globally. we were featured on their Instagram and Facebook pages. We hope this will open up a dialogue between teams but also with the public and will become something that future iGEM teams get involved with.

Collaboration with SCIE-SIAT
In order to enhance the communication between iGEM teams and improve the project, SIAT-SCIE and our team co-sponsored a meet-up. We invited eight iGEM teams to attend the meet-up in Shenzhen College of International Education. Professor Haoqian Zhang               from Chinese Academy of Science was invited to join this meet-up as well. Each team had a 15-minute presentation. Before the presentation, Professor Zhang explained the evaluation criteria for iGEM competition in detail and offered many               valuable suggestions to each team. After the exhibition of projects, each team had a 10-minute question time. It was beneficial for each team to understand the projects of others. Also, it gave us a chance to help each other.
Collaboration with BGIC-Union
Meet-up On Oct 5, 2017, we communicated with BGIC-Union in a Starbucks coffee shop and exchanged details of the projects on both sides. Both our projects are related to CRISPR/Cas9 technology and have the same off-target problem. It               is therefore possible to collaborate in modeling. We compared several articles on predicting off-target effects in mathematical ways and BGIC-Union iGEMers recommended us a better method named “Cutting Frequency Determination (CFD) scoring               method”. Thus we improved our model. They also supported our modeling group a lot by introducing us biological theory. Besides, we offered them several examples of molecular kenetics model and we still keep in touch after the meet-up.
We also shared the schedule of wiki design and they wanted to offer some help. We found that both of us wanted to make a pop science video about biosafety level (BSL) with similar ideas, so we decided to do it together. In addition, they provided               us with useful information about Safety Form and Part"

Collaboration with Jilin-China
[debugging a construct]
◎ BIT-China for Jilin-China
https://2016.igem.org/Team:Jilin_China/Collaborations
This year, team Jilin_China aimed to propose a new way to cure the solid tumor by expressing the TAT-Apoptin. The chassis they chose is Bifidobacteria, which can target the anaerobic region of the solid tumors since the microorganism is also anaerobic.
However, the functional device should firstly be transformed into E.coli to operate the methylation process in case that the devices were digested by the restriction enzymes inside the Bifidobacterium longum. They tried several times, but the results were not ideal. Since our team BIT-China is good at genetic operation on E.coli, we helped them realize the expression of TAT-Apoptin in E.coli.
We transformed four kinds of plasmid provided by Jilin_China into E.coli DH5α. The vector is pUC18, and the fragments are separately listed below:
num
Fragment kinds
1
positive control
2
TAT-Linker-apoptin
3
apoptin and Tmp1 signal peptide
4
apoptin and Sec2 signal peptide
After four kinds of positive clones separately containing these fragments were selected, we activated cells in LB culture medium overnight. We inoculated bacteria into new LB culture medium the second day and used IPTG for induction when the OD600 is 0.6. The induction was processed under 16℃ and 37℃ overnight.
After that, we treated the protein samples. We break cells after enrichment. We obtained the separation products of precipitation and supernatant. Separately, we ran those samples.
We have run the SDS-PAGE twice, here are the results:
Fig.1 Different temperature induced with supernatant
Fig.2 Different temperature induced with precipitation

Ten Teams. Three Days. One City.
In other words: The German Wide Meetup. This years German Wide Meetup took place in Dresden from June 30th to July 2nd. Nine teams followed the invitation by the iGEM Team Dresden.
The weekend started with some getting-to-know games in the “Großer Garten”. During this time, first exchanges about projects and experiences happened between the teams.
On Saturday, the Meetup continued with student talks, in which every team gave a short presentation about their projects. On top of that, even Prof. Dr. Thorsten Mascher and Marcel Thiel from Promega, gave  little input talks. The day finished of with a Sight-seeing tour through Dresden and a Tortilla-Party afterwards.
A last get-together occurred on Sunday morning. Prof. Dr. Hans-Georg Braun gave a talk about BIOMOD, a biomolecular design competition. Further down the line two workshops took place: “iGEM goes green” and speed-dates “Collaboration”. After a last group photo, the teams departed.
The event was a great opportunity to get to know the other German teams, to exchange ideas, experiences and to talk about collaborations. Thanks to the iGEM Team Dresden for organising and hosting this amazing event.

Munich United
The Munich team made a pretty good research about enabling factors in biotechnology and we collaborated with our input.
Toulouse France
The Toulouse France team did a really useful video guide teaching the synthetic biology basics. It included subjects from PCR to transformation. We contributed to their work by doing a voice-over in portuguese for their videos, so future teams from Brazil could watch it in their own language. The videos have a lot of different languages choices available. It is in their wiki.
USP-UNIFESP Brazil
We must also consider the USP-UNIFESP team as a collaboration for us. Even tough our teams did not have any active collaborations, their guidance and advices really helped us a lot. During our visit in their labs, they helped us with vital information about genetic design. During our first iGEM steps, they were also present and helped us to get university support. At first, the idea of jointing both teams was a real possibility for us.

Franconia,2017,".    Additionally, the combination of a short text and a picture, representing explanation and    visualization, enables a simple understanding of the subject, even to people without any    background knowledge. Thus, we decided to take part in this campaign.    For the front side of the postcard we chose a depiction of the 3D-structure of the    SpyCatcher/SpyTag System for it plays a key role in our project. Also, since we believe that    many people do not exactly know how to picture a protein because these structures are often    illustrated differently, this should give people a basic idea of real protein molecules. Together    with a short explanatory text on the back, we printed our postcards and sent 300 of them to    Düsseldorf. A few weeks later, we received a package with the postcards from every    participating team. All these cards looked amazing and seemed very thought-through,    showing how successfully all teams visualized parts of their projects. We were happy to    distribute all these cards at the Long Night of Sciences and in our universities.

Card Game
This year, as one of our Human Practice projects, we developed a card game called „Pathologia“ . The game consists of cards that represent human pathogens, cures, vaccinations and other special effects that affect human health. The aim of this was to educate about health and disease – with a special focus on the pathogens that cause the disease and their characteristics – in an easy and fun way. As we construed the game in English to enable it to be played all over the globe, we came to realise that a game is best played in one’s native language. This especially applies to our game since most of the cards contain special medical expressions that are not included in the general vocabulary of a foreign language. Additionally, aiming to educate about human health, we tried to include the – in our opinion – most important or most dangerous pathogens. But since many thousand human pathogens exist and different people think of different ones as important, it is nearly impossible for one team to make the game all-embracing. Also, to emphasize the influence of synthetic biology within the game, more new methods or ways to treat diseases using genetic engineering or similar approaches could be added. To address these problems, we decided to invite all teams to collaborate with us on making the game more international, more understandable and as comprising as possible. Thereto we personally asked other teams at the Germany-wide and European Meet-Up as well as posted a collaboration request on the official iGEM Collaboration Side looking for other teams that could translate"

William_and_Mary,2017," fairly hard to distinguish them from one another. This is likely because we experienced cell death and toxicity issues with higher concentrations of copper sulfate (1mM lead to extreme cell death), and because we were unable to test parameters as thoroughly as we would have liked due to time concerns. Never the less, we feel that this data still shows that our work is generalizable, and usable in circuits under imperfect real-world conditions

Maryland's Tests
We also had University of Maryland confirm degradation of our pTet mScarlet-I constructs in their plate reader. They transformed each one of our blinded constructs into a DH5-alpha derivative along with our pLac mf-Lon construct, and then did fluorescence time course measurements of cells in LB in their plate reader. Since their plate reader could only take density measurements at the beginning and end of the time course, we analyzed the relative expression of our constructs (fluorescence/OD700) at the final measurement. When unblinded, we observed that all but one of the pdts that we sent them degraded as expected. The difference in the remaining construct could be due to differences in growth conditions (LB vs. M9 media), plate reader conditions, or growth phase of measurement (Figure 4).

This year, we made a toolkit based on an endonuclease Csy4 and a RNA module named miniToe then applied it to polycistron system.  Coincidentally, the project of XJTU-China involves polycistron circuit. They use an hairpin coupling device to regulate the ratio of two CDSs which is the same goal to us. Each team thought it was a great idea if we could collaborate with each other on our project. For XJTU-China, it was difficult to model based on their project. We helped them to build model to calculate the coupling efficient of hairpin they designed.

As an another collaboration we prepared an online survey to see what people know about colon cancer. Some of the iGEM teams as iGEM XMU- China shared our survey on their social accounts and helped us to reach more people . This event showed us that not only people in Turkey but also all around the world people do not know much about colon cancer and it’s treatments . So we decided to do  human practices on giving information about colon cancer.
Spreading Survey of the Aachen Team
We collaborated with Aachen 2016 iGEM Team in Order to disseminate their survey. With Aachen team's survey we collected information about different countries' point of view to genetic engineering and compared them. We are interested in how much people know about genetic engineering and how they inform themselves. They want to compare the knowledge and the experience about genetic engineering in different countries.This is the reason why we collaborated with Aachen Team and other teams for  the survey.
Reflection
Our iGEM journey gave us many opportunities. One of them was to contact with order teams from all over the world and collaborate with them in order to share ideas and knowledge about many different subjects. We utilised previous projects and made them useful for our work. Furthermore, we had a chance to get opinions and feedbacks from different perspectives. It was a great pleasure for our team to collaborate with other iGEM members."
MIT,2016," for automatic cells seeding using a syringe pump. B) Input and output wires are connected to inlet and outlet of the microfluidic device. A 3D-printed frame is used to put the device on the microscope's placeholder, allowing dynamic monitoring. C) A syringe pump is set up to continuously pump the solution containing cells into the channel during seeding (seeding flow rate was: 20 ul/min, cell density: 120E4 cells/ml).
Results
Model 1
Figure. Images of microfluidic channel, 24 hours after cells seeding.
After 24 hours, the channel was completely dried out. The images didn't show any cells inside the channel even though cells in the control culture dish grew normally (image not shown), which was seeded at the same time with as microfluidic device. Since we couldn't check for cells inside the device right after seeding, We couldn't narrow down the main reasons for unsuccessful cell culturing in the microfluidic device. Thus, we decided to repeat the experiment (using model 2) with dynamic monitoring right from the seeding stage.
Model 2
Video. Images taken inside the diamond chamber, first 340 minutes after seeding. Frame rate: 3fps. Each image frame was taken at 10 minute interval. Red arrows: indicate cells. Blue arrows: show evidence of poliferation
Right after seeding, the cells were still in suspension; therefore, they all had spherical shape. After about 20 frames (190 minutes), they started to elongate and shifted out of focal plane. At the 26th frame (250 minutes after seeding), the cells were out of focus, which could indicate adhesion of the cells to the chamber's surface. The blue arrows point at cells showing evidience of mitosis, including appearance of two nuclei within a single cell and formation of the metaphase plate. Unfortunately, at the end of the video (after 350 minutes), the media within the chamber dried out, which has been a major problem for our experimental setup.

Collaboration of experiments
After discussion, we found that the team from Fujian normal university constructed their plasmids in a different way. According to our protocol, when we construct our plasmid, we firstly used overlap to connect each gene, and then combined them with plasmid by enzymatic ligation. But the team from Fujian normal university used Gibson assembly master mix system to construct the composite plasmid. Therefore, we decided to help the team from Fujian normal university construct plasmid proU-GFP, They help us build plasmid proLsrA-GFP.
Finally, we helped them construct plasmid proU-GFP (Figure 3a) successfully. According to their verification, this plasmid can express GFP (Figure 3b).

Since the members of the Bange lab , which is hosting the iGEM team of Marburg , are experts in the field of Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we did not hesitate to contact them for support. Our team cloned the aroE and aroA genes from B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively, and the resulting constructs are suitable for overexpression of the  N-terminally Strep-tagged AroE and AroA enzymes in E. coli. The proteins can be purified by Streptactin:Strep-tag affinity purification system from the IBA , Göttingen. The purified proteins were send to the iGEM team in Marburg (Figure 1). The ITC measurments were performed in Marburg. Unfortunately, not interaction between glyphosate and the EPSP synthases could be detected. Unfortunately, also the second ITC measurement using freshly purified AroA and AroE enzymes from E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively, did not reveal whether glyphosate may interact with the EPSP synthases. Nevertheless, we are grateful to the iGEM Team Marburg for performing the ITC measurements.

Designing an accessible Wiki
To support the iGEM Team Marburg on their way to facilitate equality and accessibility in science, we tried to design an accessible Wiki.   Generally, all elements of our wiki are accessible when using a keyboard leading to a more straightforward navigation. In addition, we tried to use a high colour contrast between background and text. All of our font sizes, distances and areas are set relatively, allowing scalability. Most of our headings"

Overview
As an active member of iGEM community, Team Tsinghua has always valued collaborations with other iGEM teams. Together with high school teams and undergrads, we have exchanged ideas, provided each other with inspirations and resources. Working together was both fun and productive. It was an experience everyone had enjoyed.
Working With High School Teams
This year we welcomed two high school teams on our campus, RDFZ_China and SHSBNU_China. Tsinghua University provided these teams with lab space and some necessary equipments. We worked closely (physically side by side) all summer, and it was remarkably prolific. Team Tsinghua and instructors from Bluepha have educated the high school teams about lab safety and helped them to find their ways around the lab. Furthermore, being physically no more than five meters away allowed us to be able to bounce ideas off each other at all times. When we were tuning the IPTG induction devices in our NEON system, RDFZ_China provided us with their own IPTG assay with Ptac which actually played an important part in our final design. On October 4th, we were invited to the Northern China High school iGEM Meetup and the safety conference afterwards to share our idea how iGEMers can contribute to the safety awareness in the community.
Working With Fellow Undergrads
Meetups are where teams meet each other and share their ideas, plans and troubles. In September we attended the 5th CCiC, where 25 teams helped us with our questionnaire in HP . Our friends from Peking University provided us with a new transformation technique. We also provided TUST with water samples to test the tetracycline concentration for their project.
We have worked with Tsinghua-A on multiple occasions, helping with each other’s projects and troubleshooting the experiments. They instructed us on the flow cytometer and we shared our experience on IPTG induction. Together we have held an exhibition on synthetic biology in China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM).

ZJUT-China,2018," attracted a lot of students of Jiangsu Normal University, so we had some audiences. In the beginning each team introduced their projects, then we gave our audience a basic introduction of what synthetic biology  iGEM is. Afterwards we had a further talk about the problems we had in our previous experiments, project design, modeling and hp work. Team Jiangnan_China and team LZU-China met some difficulties in interlab study, too, so we gave them some instructions, pointed out their mistakes and helped them find the correct way to finish the study. We had further collaboration with team Jiangnan_China by providing them the cell lysis gene that we tested  functional in our project. It helped them to improve the environment safety of their project. In this meeting, we benefited a lot from other three teams and therefore had new ideas about how to finish our project. Many thanks to team Jiangnan_China, team DLUT_China and team LZU-China, and we appreciate teachers and students from Jiangsu Normal University who helped us find a meeting room. Hope to see them participating in iGEM 2018.
