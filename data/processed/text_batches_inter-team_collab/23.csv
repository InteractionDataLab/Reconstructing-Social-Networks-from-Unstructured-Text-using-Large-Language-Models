Collaborations with NJU_CHINA
In this year’s collaboration, NJU_china helped us to test the microRNA binding ability of miRNA binding sequences. They constructed a dual-luciferase miRNA target expression plasmid with their vector and our miRNA target sequences. Then they transfected the purified plasmids into cells and verify their functions.
In return, we performed nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to have a more precise determination of the quantity and size of secreted exosomes. Extracellular vesicles, as nanoparticles, can be automatically tracked and sized based on Brownian motion and the diffusion coefficient. We measured the Nanosight enabled quantification and size determination of the extracellular vesicles in our experiment. The result we got from nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) can help NJU_china ascertain the relationship between protein concentration and exosomes quantity. Their acknowledgement to our contribution can be found in their wiki pages ( https://2017.igem.org/Team:NJU-China/Collaborations ).

Collaborations with BGIC_Union
During the FAFU CCiC (Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University Conference of China’s iGEMers Community) this year, we were reached by the BGIC-Union team asking for the sHRPN-dcas9 and sHRPC-dcas9 plasmids we constructed in iGEM 2016. It was a pleasure to hear that our design could provide convenience to other iGEM teams, so we provided them plasmid samples as well as detailed"
TJU_China,2018,"Failure is the mother of success
We believe that every one has made mistakes in labs, some mistakes are very interesting when thinking back. With a curious heart, we participate the collaboration ”Funniest Failure Experience”. Fudan-CHINA is collecting interesting and impressive reasons for failed experiments. A brochure will be designed, printed and handed our at Giant Jamboree to share these interesting experiences. Here are some experience from our team members:         Xiaoyu Yang: The first time I pure protein. After centrifugation at 18000rpm, the suspension with protein was directly poured away as a bacterial solution by us. This behavior directly led to our three-day useless working. After awakening, we went to the 4℃ cold storage to “cold” down.         Muchan Gao: When I added the last buffer WB of the plasmid, when we were happy, we dumped the centrifuged liquid.         Wenzhong Teng: Do you know how to dye protein gel? Yes, boil it with coomassie blue R250 for about 5 minutes. But do you know how to make a gel hard enough to knock out sound on plastic? Just boiled it until water evaporated and you will get one!
With these impressive experiences, we hope every one of us can be more careful about labs and find more interests in iGEM competition and synthetic biology."
Nanjing-China,2016," which is a team participating in iGEM for the first time. For starters, we offered timely help to them around May on how to establish a team by sending basic plasmids and answering questions through social media. After many rounds of discussions, we invited them to Nanjing University to have a face-to-face communication about each other’s project on June 9th. In return for this little conference, on September 24th, some of our team members and our team leader joined the meeting up with TMMU-China along with a few other teams. It is indeed a wonderful collaboration experience and both of us benefited a lot from each other by regular discussions. We sincerely hope that we can hear good news from each other in Boston!

Postcards
iGEM Duesseldorf, Heinrich-Heine University, Germany
We designed a postcard containing something characteristic about the project and a small description. The scope of this collaboration was to exchange postcards with teams from all over the world discovering easily about projects we didn’t know about and using those postcards to spread information about synthetic biology and iGEM.
DH5 alpha cells
iGEM Lund, Lund University, Sweden
We gave to iGEM Lund the DH5-Alpha Cells, E. coli cells that are used for maximizing the transformation efficiency. We plated them in LB and deliver them to their University. We believe that this kind of collaborations, in which teams exchange materials, are very useful because we save a lot of money and time and we understand the value of sharing and cooperating with other researchers.
Engineered Probiotics Around the World
Unesp Brazil, School of Pharmaceutical Science, Unesp, Brazil
The purpose of this collaboration was to exchange opinions about how engineered probiotics are regulated all around the world. By regulation we mean laws, trials, startups etc. After having thoroughly searched these information for the swedish and european countries, we wrote a document containing a summary and we sent it to Unesp Brazil Team. They will share with us what they learnt at the end of the iGEM period.

UESTC-software,2016," AHTU_China
In the dry-lab testing of our project, we invited team AHUT_China to help us accomplish the task together. As the developer, we tested our project to prove it had the intended function. Further, we needed someone who knew little about the development of Bio101 to do a more objective testing. Team AHUT_China tested the fault tolerance and randomness of Bio101 as our first user and offered us with a software testing report. Besides, they analyzed bzip2 compression algorithm we used in Bio101 through building mathematical model.

We also kept in touch to get timely feedback on the problems arising from the operation of Bio101. On September 16th, 2016, we had a video conference with AHUT_China. We both introduced our projects to increase interaction and understanding. Their project for this year is about BIO-COMPASS2.0, which is used to get optimal solution of path planning through bio navigation. Before putting into practice, extracting and storing information of a region in the map are needed, and our Bio101 can bring about convenience to their database storage and ensure their applications into reality, which is an exploration during our cooperation. Most importantly, we feel very grateful for what they have done for us.
iGEM Southwest China Union Meetup
We are developing and growing
Last year, UESTC iGEMers led the establishment of iGEM SouthWest Union of China (iSWU), which is a sustained platform for all the iGEMers in the southwest region of China. Nowadays, iSWU has a markedly increase in the number as well as the kind of teams.
This year, there were four universities and one organization interested in synthetic biology participated in the iSWU communication held in Sichuan University. The meetup focused on the theme, “To promote the communication and cooperation among iGEM teams in the southwest region of China” and the main activity forms were to discuss teams’ projects and to share experience. It gave all teams an opportunity to achieve a deeper understanding and exchanging.

We are recognized and encouraged
In communication meeting, professors impressed the innovation awareness and excellent iGEM quality on us. Yun Zhao, the vice-president of SCU college of life sciences, stressed that there is no need to mention first time in science, all science to do is the first time.

Botchan_Lab_Tokyo,2017," All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production. The exact procedures related to obtaining permissions to use GMOs in the production vary, however, according to the target use of the final products or the way the GMOs are handled in the production process. As a general rule, products related to human health as well as those used as food or feed have to follow stricter GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labelling your final products in a predescribed manner. Environmental release of GMOs is also given serious attention although the procedures are not as tight, just as in the case of contained GMO use. Usually, the target use also dictates which Ministry will be responsible for the evaluation and approval of the planned GMO use. These could include Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Food, Fisheries, Forestry, Environment and many more.   In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a payment of a examination fee that costs 4000 dollars. In the USA, GMO plants are considered equivalent to non-GMO plants and do not require much further approval; only if the plant express a protein that is significantly different from any protein originally expressed, will a respective institution be required to approve of such use. In Chile, on the other hand, it is forbidden to commercialize GMOs as only seed exportation is allowed.
As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?  It can be noticed all countries participating in this collaboration, share the standard protocols of good practices in a laboratory, which includes the following:
Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
Identify the level of risk.
Use of necessary safety equipment for each activity.
Maintain the necessary information and supervision with trained personnel.
Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
Maintain an infection prevention protocol and equipment in case of emergency.
Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
Good hygiene of workers.
Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
Waste disposal protocols, among others.
In the United States, Australia, Brazil and Indonesia, these protocols for the manipulation of biological agents are all that is required to protect the workers involved. On the other hand, the European Union, Japan and India also require medical records of all workers exposed to biological agents to be kept for a specified period of time. Japan additionally requires the employers to hold medical check-ups every 6 months for the exposed workers. The legislations of EU, Korea, Canada, Chile and India group biological agents according to the risk they might create. These groups, in turn, determine what safety measures"

iGEM Columbia
Our iGEM team collaborated with Columbia University’s team to create an anonymous survey focused on understanding the perspectives people may have on specified treatments for illnesses. This was done to analyze the possible perceptions people may have concerning our treatments and the resulting products. The surveys were distributed primarily through an online format among individuals with differing factors such as age, gender, and educational background. To ensure responses relating to both teams’ projects, we decided to include questions that prompted individuals to consider different areas of treatment. Our team included questions pertaining to whether people would be willing to receive antimicrobial peptide treatments, while Columbia’s team included questions specifically"

Tec-Monterrey,2016," team were going to the European iGEM teams meeting in Paris, they took the opportunity to share some of our struggles with the other European teams. They offered to expose the Latin American teams scenario (based on our team’s experience) regarding the difficulty in the delivery of the biological material, especially iGEM kit and Biobricks, because of problems with customs in most of Latin American countries.
Meeting at Toulouse
We also collaborated with team Toulouse by translating and recording in Spanish four protocols of the most used methods in genetic engineering: transformation, digestion, ligation and PCR. The team's purpose was to make an electronic manual, based in videos and scripts translated in 4 different languages: English, French, Spanish and German.
Spanish is one of the most spoken languages around the world, so translating the videos into Spanish will definitely help them reach a broader audience. Moreover, there are not many reviewed protocols online in Spanish, and sadly, there are less videos explaining on a pleasant and dynamic way how to carry out the experiments; so taking into account our own experience, we wanted to make this type of content more accessible to people who, like us, are not native english speakers.
iGEM EPF Lausanne
We collaborated with the EPF Lausanne team by helping them with their Human Practice. They wanted to create a platform where iGEM teams were presented, along with their projects, so that we could all get to know each other better. We thought this was a great initiative because iGEM projects are making an impact all over the world and we were happy to take part of it and help them spread the word.
We sent them a description of our project and a description of our team so that everyone could know what we are up to and could get to know us a little better. We also agreed to an interview via Skype where we told them all about our project, the team, our experiences, the struggles we had and all we have learned in iGEM.
Additionally, we shared information about the development of our project and we talked about important issues regarding the struggles we had (specially with customs) while doing research in Mexico and Latin America in general.

Experiment help to a high-school team CIEI-BJ
This summer CIEI-BJ aimed to produce one of the key enzymes copalyl diphosphate synthase 1 (SmCPS1) which initiates biosynthesis of tanshinone, a famous Chinese medicinal herb, by building a plasmid transformed in Escherichia coli. However, for a brand new high school team, they are lack of parts and devices to practice, which is essential for their plasmid constructions. On the contrary, we have took part in iGEM competition with our own independent laboratory for at least six years, perfectly storing a wealth of parts and devices and inheriting proficient technology from our last iGEM team members. With great sincerity, we took an initiative to send them some parts (J04450 with backbone pSB1A2 and the splicing vector J23106 and I13504 with pSB1C3) for their daily practice and pre-experiments.

In return, we got the badge due to our contribution.
Participation in newsletter of XMU-China 2016
This year, XMU-China 2016 issued newsletter of iGEM which would help iGEMers from all over the world to share information about their projects and the latest news about synthetic biology in general. We were honored to collaborate with XMU-China 2016 to publish the survey of our project.

This collaboration combined both teams’ detecting projects. We exchanged our hardware design, principle, commercial value, strategies so can make both projects more compatible. In the following paragraph, we will briefly show the function and mechanism of our nitrate sensor.
[ Figure. 1.4-2 ] Structure of nitrate sensor based on fluorescence.
． Sensor design
We use a 450nm laser to excite our E. coli. Then, E. coli. will emit 510 nm green light and the green light will be received by the light sensor. By analyzing different fluorescence intensity. We will get concentration value of nitrate in the water..
． Mechanism
1. The water will enter the boat and flow through two solenoid valves.
2. With the specific controlling, we can gather quantitative water for nitrate sensing.
3. The sample of water will react with our E. coli in a tube fixed in a light absorber.
4. The laser will excite the E. coli, and the E. coli will emit the fluorescence.
5. The fluorescence will be received by a light sensor.
6. The Arduino will process the fluorescence we collected and send the data to server.
7. Our server will calculate fluorescence into the concentration of nitrate in the water.

Collaboration with Team SDSZ China
A member from Team SDSZ China, approached us in April and mentioned the possibility of
consulting with us about iGEM competition. We agreed with alacrity, knowing the difficulty of
setting up a high-school team without assistance, to meet with her.
Several days later, we met with her on the campus of Tsinghua University and discussed wide-ranging matters
from how to participate in the iGEM competition to how to search for literature, including using PubMed
to search for Synthetic Biology papers. She was especially uncertain about the usage, creation and
delivery of BioBricks, and asked a lot of great questions, such as “how to define a ‘new’ BioBrick
eligible for earning a bronze or silver medal” and “how to deliver a newly created BioBrick to the
iGEM headquarter”. We were not only impressed by her familiarity with the competition, but also started
to appreciate the role of BioBricks in standardizing the use of plasmids for synthetic biology – it should
be educated to every researcher in the Synthetic Biology field because it permits convenient plasmid
sharing and inter-laboratory communication.
Reciprocally, we also benefited from their team. We were enlightened by their project – developing a cheap
penicillin detection method for people within relatively underdeveloped areas, and glad to find out
that the influence of iGEM has permeated into high schools and spurred the participation of high school
students in the iGEM competition. We were edified both by their intricate idea of fusing GFP with
penicillin binding protein and therefore creating a visual assay for evaluating the efficacy of penicillin
detection, and by its potentially far-reaching application for consumers with below-average income. What
did we learn? When designing a project, especially on topics that are entangled with practical and
industrial purposes, we should not only take into account how to make the idea fancier, but should also
heed the practicality of the project – is it valuable for the non-academic community? Can it be easily
understood by laymen and applied in daily lives? In addition, they also provided insightful advice on
how to improve our Wiki, such as the"

Collaborations
This year’s Macquarie University iGEM team collaborated successfully with teams from 10 other universities. In doing so, we enhanced our own outreach activities as well as assisting other teams to reach their goals - with regards to the scientific completion of both their projects and their human practice goals.
For our major collaboration, we were able to assist University of New South Wales , to achieve their goals by sending them a transfectable Synechocystis strain, along with an integrative plasmid psBH02 (Synechocystis hemeoxygenase II that had kanamycin resistance), for use as a positive control in the transformation. This clone was useful to them as they had problems with the transformation of their Synechocystis strain.
The iGEM teams representing University of Sydney , Linköping University , Birbeck University and Oxford University directly took part in an episode of the world’s first synthetic biology themed gameshow, So You Think You Can Synthesise. Trinity College Dublin also added So You Think You Can Synthesise to their Youtube channel, helping to spread the word of synthetic biology and iGEM.
We took part in the outreach activities of other teams as well; for the team representing the University of Colorado Boulder , we constructed a short video addressing questions relating to our understanding of fracking; for team Paris-Saclay , we filled out a survey answering questions about our choice of chassis and participated in a synthetic-biology themed music video for Linköping University . We also answered surveys for the Oxford University teams about our iGEM experience and synthetic biology in general, respectively.
Australian iGEM Meet-ups
The Macquarie University iGEM team, and the teams representing the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales gathered to meet on two separate occasions - the 15th of July and the 15th of September.
On each occasion, all three teams delivered presentations detailing their project aims progress-to-date. These presentations were followed by questions, feedback and collaboration discussions which proved highly fruitful for all three teams.

This year, we collaborated with Rice University's iGEM team on an app that would display information such as structure and function of a molecule once the user 'imaged' a moving crystal. The purpose of this project was to make a way for people to get a better understanding about molecules such as hemoglobin, as well as provide insight as to how the structures are determined.
Through the collaboration, we acted as guides for the development of the game, assisting in the preliminary planning stages, finding relevant tutorials and game engines, and acting as a reference for when they were unable to implement features. The collaboration initially began through email correspondence, but was later done through a shared Google Document where they would be able to post questions and we would be able to reply with relevant links and explanations."

Collaborations
Parallel to the development of our project, we have made a series of collaborations with other teams in order to obtain mutual benefit.
Attendance to Meet Ups
The meets ups bring several advantages to the teams. It is one of the simplest ways to reach a greater number of people to whom you can explain your project. And therefore they allow you to know first-hand the projects of the rest of the teams so that you can consult and clarify doubts. These meetings also allow for more kindred and powerful collaborations thanks to knowing the rest of the teams in person. And last but not least, they allow you to practice exposing your project with a view to improving the Giant Jamboree.Our team attended two meet ups that took place in the month of August.
Marseille
Mediterranean Meet Up (Marseille)
This meet up took place between Thursday 9 and Friday 10 August in the city of Marseille and was organized by the team of this city, the Aix-Marseille. In it, all the teams from the Mediterranean area were summoned, so they ended up attending both France and Spain. Francisco, Gonzalo and Ivan attended this meet up on behalf of the team.
The event began with a reception in which all teams had their first informal contact. Subsequently, a 5 minutes presentation of each of the projects was organized, summarizing the concept on which the project was based, the work carried out and the plans to complete it. After the exhibition, each team answered the questions from the jury and the rest of the teams.
Later they invited us to a joint meal. In the afternoon it was organized a sightseeing tour of the city, but due to inclement weather, it had to be suspended, although we could enjoy a pleasant evening of board games and conversations with the rest of the teams. At night a meeting was also organized in a pub to end a"
SYSU-Software,2017," their project using the same algorithm that utilized in our software simulation section. The following is the circuit they designed for their project redrawn by our design platform.
For a preciser measurement of the expression of their gene, SRRz gene, they used GFP as a reporter in this case alternatively. Our model simulated the concentration of the GFP expressed in their system.The mathematic formula and parameters’ and the results are as follows:
The simulation result is as follow：

The fitted curve of all the spots generated from real experiment can be seen from here:
From the three figures above, we can prove that our simulation have the same trend of the real experiment data, which also gave SCUT-China_A a meaningful design performance forecast.
Besides, our team also troubleshooted the image processing software of their project whose aim is to get the yellow degree of an experiment tube so that they can measure the concentration of the SRRz protein. We improved the system behavior and back-end of the software and gave some advice on the implementation process.
Also check on SCUT-CHINA_A's wiki page.
Bi-direction collaboration
During the whole collaboration process, we established very closed friendship. The team leader Chen Nanzhu and other team members also gave their feedbacks after we got an embryonic form of our main project. Besides, we also invited them for holding a high school meeting which we organized at very beginning.
NJU-China
Background & Demand
At the very beginning of this year around the end of March, NJU-China got interested in weight -reducing drugs. They noticed that people may use various emojis when it comes to topics related to “losing weight”, “body weight”, “fat” on their microblog. Some people may be eager for practicing their body so a very positive emoji would be used on their microblog while others are totally opposite. Out of an objective perspective, some big data was needed to scope a general relationship between the three keywords and the emojis used by microblogers under the analysis of statistics. As a result, they reached out for us.
Solution & Results
In this case, we built a python spider for them to extract big data to dig out the relationship between the three key words they wanted and emojis that people post on the social microblog media, specifically on WEIBO, in the last whole year (2016.1.1-2017.1.1). All the robot abstractor we built has been under the regulation of “ Robots Protocol ” file stated by the official WEIBO company on their website.
After couple of online discussion, the"
HokkaidoU_Japan,2015," Parties of the Cartagena Protocol will be taken place in Mexico, so they held this online forum like their government. Hokkaido University team participated in this forum and posted our opinions on every set topic.
Our opinions
We provided the following opinions to each Topic.
Topic1. Operational Definiton of Synthetic Biology
One team member said about definition that Synthetic Biology is the academic field whose object is synthesis of materials which is more useful than natural products for human beings by using some genes derived from different organisms. Another member said about Account for Synthetic Biology that because it becomes easy to investigate by standardizing various factors, you’ll get more chances and time to create new ideas. That is the benefit of Synthetic Biology.
In addition, another member proposed interesting analogy about difference between molecular biology and synthetic biology.  That is, when you think about the recipe of delicious apple pie, there are two ways. One is going to the cake shop which is famous for delicious apple pie and guessing the recipe of that shop. The other is making apple pie by yourself, changing each step of the recipe and selecting the best one.
These two ways are applicable to investigation ways of biology. The former, reductive approach is applicable to molecular biology. Just guessing the recipe of apple pie is easy, however it may be bothersome to try to analysis the complex organisms at the molecular level.
And the latter, architectonic approach is applicable to synthetic biology. Because of making by yourself, the complete apple pie has infinite possibilities. In addition, if the recipe is standardized and shared by everyone, that delicious apple pie is available anywhere in the world. This philosophy is just Synthetic Biology.
Topic2. Benefits of an open source approach; who benefits?
A member said that all people who experiment with the use of plasmid vectors reap benefits. It's because by open source, the operations are simplified and become smoother. In addition, if world-wide standardization comes true, exchange of genetic parts‘ll become easier.
Another member said that common people or companies who have never studied biology so much reap benefits. It’s because, by open source, they feel something familiar to genetic modification technology and use this technology easier, common people will get much more chances to come up the ideas and possibilities to append new decisions to their projects or businesses by using genetic modification.
And another member point the basal matter, ""anyway, now SynBio is not enough level to be suitable for the business. To overcome that matter, I think automatization of experiments is absolutely imperative. No matter how simplify operations of experiments by open source, if people who actually experiment don’t understand means"

NEGEM Meetup
We shared our progress with Tufts, Boston University, WPI, Harvard, and MIT on June 21. We got feedback on running killing assays and also heard concerns that AMPs were not suitable for clinical distribution. This feedback helped us to refine our focus on the foundational advance of post-translational modifications. We also completed surveys for WPI on lead contamination and for BU Hardware on microfluidics in synthetic biology.
INSA-UPS
We talked over Skype and email to team INSA-UPS concerning their work with AMPs for combatting cholera. We gave them feedback about their project and possible collaborations between our group including the opportunity for us to try to produce one of their AMPs in our cell-free reaction. Unfortunately the timing for this collaboration didn't pan out. In addition we completed their survey about a hypothetical water treatment device. We gave troubleshooting advice but were unable to test each others’ parts.
Boston U
We also talked to the Boston University Wetlab team working on cell-free expression for RNA controlled switches. We compared cell free protocols and discussed challenges in using the expression system but did not have time to test each other’s parts.

Meetups
The European Experience
The European Experience was a meetup of around 25 European iGEM teams from eleven different countries, including four teams from the Netherlands. The meetup was in Paris and it was organized by two Parisean teams, team IONIS and team Évry. It started with a gathering where everyone could meet and talk about their project. Immediately people showed great interest in our project and wanted to know everything about our biolasers and lenses. We found out that the Pasteur iGEM team is also going to work with silicate, and we had lunch with some of their team members to discuss about our projects.
After lunch there were two conferences about synthetic biology, one that focused on challenges and risks of doing research and one that focused on the economics of synthetic biology. At the end of the conference Randy Rettberg, the president of iGEM, talked about why he started the iGEM competition and about the values of sharing information between the teams.
On Saturday evening there was a party for all the European iGEM teams. First there was a possibility to watch the football match between Italy and Germany and later that night the party really started. There was beer and a deejay, so our team really enjoyed ourselves. Later on the evening there even was a real fire breather!
Our team had a great time at the meetup, and you can also read about our touristic activities in Paris over here.

HumHub Platform
The HumHub Platform, a new and original communication tool for all iGEM teams!!! Indeed, every iGEM team will be able to communicate, share and discover different ideas and experiences.
→ Why does iGEM need digital platforms for collaboration?
As iGEM grows in size and projects become more complicated, digital platforms for collaboration present a possibility for teams to work on challenges together, and for members of teams to collaborate on projects while not in the lab. Today, many iGEM teams use different established platforms to solve these needs. The communication between the different teams is complicated
→ What needs are met today?
Dropbox to share documents, Google Docs to write collaborative documents, Facebook to communicate between team members and with general public, Calendars.
→ What needs are not met today?
A discussion forum for all iGEM teams, closed spaces for collaboration between teams, platform for discussing BioBricks and past projects.

        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

iGEM Stuttgart
In 2017, iGEM TU Darmstadt worked with chitosan-producing and chitosan-modifying enzymes. This year’s iGEM team from the university of Stuttgart is working with chitosan, as well. In this context, iGEM Stuttgart contacted us asking for help and advice. Since, we were excited to hear of another team seeing the potential in chitosan as an antimicrobial coating, we were happy to help.
In agreement with our team members from 2017, we sent them the most relevant parts of the 2017 iGEM TU Darmstadt project. Stuttgart planned to produce chitosan in one single cell, using our chitin synthase ( NodC ) and chitin deacetylase ( NodB ). Based on the work and progress of our last year’s team, we could provide Stuttgart with helpful information concerning chitosan research. In particular, discussions with experts such as Prof. Dr. Moerschbacher helped us to recognize and tackle problems coming up during lab work. We recommended the team to contact him and other researchers.
Before the European Meetup, we had agreed on meeting the team there and answer questions, which were still unanswered in a personal conversation. During the Meetup we talked about the chitindeacetylase NodB and pointed out which difficulties we had come across during expression, purification and the assays. Also, we recommended them the kit Prof. Dr. Moerschbacher had suggested. Due to the problems with NodB inclusion bodies, we recommended them to use COD from Vibrio cholerae instead. The team appreciated our recommendation and"

1.Initiated the first iGEM meet up in Shaanxi Province.
At present, there are three official iGEM teams in Shaanxi Province: NPU-China (our team), XJTU-China, NWU-China.     Having been communicating with XJTU-China and NWU-China on WeChat in the past few months, we felt prodigiously more     and more eager to get together and hold a meetup as time went by. After a month of discussion, at the beginning of     the summer vacation, we three teams jointly held the first iGEM meet up in Shaanxi Province. During the meeting,     the three teams took turns to showcase their projects this year and had further exchange and discussion on team     building. We shared the problems encountered during the project and collectively strived to solve them. The results     of this meetup are as follows:
label We have encountered difficulties in implementing DNA time capsule activities.     XJTU-China expressed their willingness to help us contact Mawu Primary School in Xi’an to enable our DNA time     capsule activity to be carried out smoothly.

Kyoto,2016,"
Positive traits: It was very easy to use.
Traits to improve: User interface: even though it was simple and easy to use, the output screen for showing HTML texts could have been larger.
Comments: Our team makes HTML version of lab notebooks by making a template first and letting people (who may not know HTML) fill in the blank template. If no one in the team knows how to write HTML codes, we think this software could be very helpful. However, if there were someone who can, it may be faster for them to create blank templates. However, a system to register names was very useful, as we didn’t have to type in the experimenter’s name every time. Biobrick parts are also very long and tiresome to type in, so allowing us to register BioBrickparts in the same manner may also improve user experience. We would like to use this software with such improvements in the future.
From such feedback, we improved the registration process of the experimenter names, and continue to provide and upgrade this software. For more information, please follow the links we provided above."
UST_Beijing,2016," about the feasibility of some experiments.
Discussion on the problem
We brought out that we met with difficulties when synthetizing 4 gene fragments into a plasmid. The Tsinghua students gave us many practical advices. One of them is suggesting us using Gibson assembly kit. With this kit, the DNA fragments could be bound to each other by using master mix (contain 3 kinds of enzymes) in a constant temperature bath for 1 hour. However, Gibson assembly kit could only assemble the fragments less than 80 bp, while the DNA primers we need to assemble were 150bp. Thanks to team members of TSINGHUA-A, we were able to amplify our plasmid by the method of using both PCR and assembly kit.
Meanwhile, we discussed about other problems about wiki and social practice, and we all got a satisfactory result.
Visiting laboratory
There were not many researchers in their Lab when we visited, so they have times to show us around their labs and discuss about conducting experiments.
Summary
Through this communication with fellows in Tsinghua University, we have learned much about automation. It not only expanded our horizons, but also enlightened us that the combination of biology and information theory would have a broad prospect. Besides, fellows in Tsinghua University also impressed by our creative ideas of conducting experiments. In short, it’s been a pleasant and successful communication.

Cork_Ireland,2015," our lab at UCC. See figures 1 and 2 for results reported by TCD.
Also, to assist TCD, we researched into the possibility of constructing a detector to detect artemisinin resistance in species of plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria. TCD informed us that this is a significant problem in areas where malaria is endemic, as usually the most widely used treatment for malaria is artemisinin. Between the two teams, we found that the most common mutations that confer resistance are SNP’s on the Kelch 13 propellor (Haldar et al., 2015) . The mutations are point mutations, single base changes. Our detector was not sensitive or specific enough to pick up these small changes.

Meetups
In July Cork iGEM, along with Trinity College Dublin (TCD) iGEM, organised a meetup that was posted on iGEM.org. Cork iGEM travelled to Dublin where we met up with TCD for the first time. TCD met us at the front gate with a very welcoming sign and brought us to a hang out space called the Global Room.
We provided feedback on their project work and told them what to expect at the Jamboree. We were in contact with the team during its early days before the team members were selected and stressed the need for a diverse team from many backgrounds. This was something we learned at iGEM in our previous year and knew it was important to relay this advice. We also suggested the team not focus entirely on lab work and engage with the community throughout their project.
Over the course of working on the projects, we kept in contact with the team and aided them in their efforts to create a Youtube Channel “iGEM Academy” with videos of common lab protocols by providing a video tutorial of our “Detector Reaction” for use with our BaseHunter parts.
We gave a presentation of our project and our results up to the beginning of July.
TCD brought us to their lab and talked us through their plans for the project over the summer months. They then kindly gave us a campus tour and brought us to see the beautiful Book of Kells and the Long Room. We had a social that evening!

After inoculation, these plants were placed at 25℃ in incubator. We took photos everyday from different but fixed angles at 10:00 and 22:00 to record their growth status and health condition. We feed back the state of the plants regularly. After 15 days, we can saw these plants changed obviously. On the 30th day, we took them out of the bottles, got their fresh weight, then put into the dryer 105℃ for 0.5h.80℃ for 10h to get their dry weight. click here to see more details: https://2017.igem.org/Team:ZJU-China/Collaborations#uestc

UNebraska-Lincoln,2017,"e.g.: pipette tips, Eppendorf tubes and inoculating loops connecting with microorganisms).  Writing about the chemicals’ material safety data sheet (MSDS) and important safety pictograms found on the bottles and flasks would be also very useful because they are a basic part of biosafety and so that everybody not just biologists can understand the meaning of the figures found on each material in a laboratory.  We also recommend to write about the biosafety risk group of the used bacteria before and after the genetic modification (BSL1 and S1).  You should write some sentences about the biosafety laws of your country and institution and mention that your team meet all the requirements.  They may seem very basic aspects but we think you had better write about them to make sure about nothing will miss from the safety cases. In conclusion, we think, your safety part is a well-written, comprehensive, professional work. Congratulate!”
Using our safety case, Hungary also developed their own. We are very excited another iGEM team has tried safety cases!

From July 30th to August 3rd, 2018, we participated in the 6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference hosted by National Chung Hsing University, Taichung. There was a total of 22 teams and 140 participants from Taiwan, China, and Japan, warming up for the final Jamboree in Boston at the end of October.
The conference invited wonderful speakers from the field of Synthetic Biology and Ambassador of the iGEM HQ to give a talk at the Opening Ceremony. Among them, Prof. Kenji Tsuge from Kobe University explained the emerging synthetic biology technology that can link quantities of large fragments of genes and perform these genes; Dr. Zhang Jui-Jen, an associate researcher at China Medical University Hospital, shared his experience in using synthetic biology entrepreneurship; iGEM Asian Ambassador Chen Hong explained some new systems and shared experience on behalf of iGEM. We gained tons of new ideas from these lectures, which had great influences on our next work.
In the five-day conference, we also had a 20-minute English presentation and a poster exhibition. It was the first time to present our project frankly to iGEMers from Asia, and a good opportunity to practice for the final Jamboree. At the end of the exhibition, professor Yang Wen-Ming from the field of molecular biology at National Chung Hsing University gave a comment on our presentation. Through the conference, we also made suggestions to other Asian teams, longing for more cooperation opportunities.
This conference has provided us tremendous new ideas to improve our project and final presentation.
Collaboration with SUSTech
SUSTech
SUSTech iGEM
This year, the SUSTech iGEM team used the microfluidic chip as the core carrier to build a complete hardware platform, which was very similar to the idea of XMU-China team in hardware design. On this basis, these two teams had an online communication on issues related to microfluidic chips.
SUSTech used high-precision and single-channel chip tubes to achieve cell sorting functions, with a peristaltic pump that provides driving force, and a flow meter that filters and encapsulates cell droplets. These devices greatly improve the precision of the entire device.

What They Did For Us:
The two plasmids were first transformed into DH5α cells and grown overnight at room temperature in LB broth with chloramphenicol added. The two plasmids were treated under three conditions: one uninduced, one induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and one induced with 1 mM IPTG. The protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll a operon was tested with four genes, all of which showed good expression rates (Figure 4.). The Mg chelatase operon was tested for five genes, however the ChlH and ChlD genes showed lower than expected or no expression at all (Figure 5.). We are investigating as to why these two genes had lower expression once inducted.
Formula:
2^-(ΔΔCt) is used to calculate the fold change of gene expression after induction, in which
ΔCt(control)1 = Ct(uninduced operon genes) - Ct(Chloramphenicol gene)
ΔCt(test)2 = Ct(Induced operon genes) - Ct(Induced Chloramphenicol gene)
Finally, use ΔCt(test)2 - ΔCt(control)1 to get ΔΔCt

Other collaborations
The Macquarie University iGEM team skyped, emailed and responded to surveys from numerous teams around the world. The team also participated in a virtual conference and a symposium that allowed us to leave the university grounds and explain our project to the community. Though this communication will not be evaluated for any medal criteria, we feel that it is important to reference the teams that helped us along our path to Boston.

Ethics for Synthetic Biology
""The iGEM team BIOSINT México considers that when people talk about ethics, specifically, the members of all the teams, lack of an ethical code to serve as a guide for considering the ethical aspects of the projects.""
As an iGEM team, iGEM Pasteur thinks that it's a very important part of the iGEM and necessary for the evolution of the competition. We are encouraging this initiative! During this collaboration, iGEM Pasteur answered to the ""suggested topics"" survey and traduced from english to french, the ethics guidelines for the iGEM community: Ethics for Synthetic Biology.

NEU-China,2016," when they need help and that interaction led a                                 more closely communication between us. We have often exchange some experience and                                 experimental skills up to now.
At the very beginning of the competition, we had received a tube of plasmid provided by NAU-CHINA before DNA kits’ arriving. That solution contained the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone which could be used to submit parts. We were so grateful for that kindness behavior because we had nothing but the pSB1C3 at that time.
EXPERIMENT SECTION
WITH FAFU-CHINA
What’s more, we were seeking for an experimental cooperation positively until an                                 active team - FAFU-CHINA - stepped into our eyesight. What they were doing really                                 aroused our interests. In the later time, some students of us answered the survey                                 they did and contacted with them full of  enthusiasm.
Then, we proposed that we could help each other to solve some troubles on experimental. So, we send them the vector pBD024-tCas9-CIBN which should be transformed into E.coli, hoping for their generous cooperation. We hoped them to test if the tCas9-CIBN protein we created would be expressed in E.coli and to help us to got the accurate data about the induced concentration of arabinose. What they did acted as control experiments in order to demonstrated the validity of our former data. The result we concluded before was unsatisfactory. We were eager to get their feedback to compare with our idea. Well, facts proved that they were indeed an enthusiastic and efficient team! The feedback they gave had helped us to understand the results better and saved a lot of time for us. The details is shown at FAFU-CHINA .
WITH NEFU-CHINA
In the daily contact with NEFU-China, we thought we can help each other to do something to increase the efficiency of the experiment. Meanwhile, reasonable cooperation can also proved the correctness of the results.
We had did some experiments to help NEFU-China to find out the best induce condition and to observe the total protein we extracted. The details also can be found at progress part we received a tube of plasmid from NEFU-China. According to their description, we designed experiments below to achieve the test goals:
Transformed the plasmid into DH5alpla strain to amplify.
Then miniprep the right vector after culturing.
Transformed the obtained plasmid into Bl21 strain in 3 50ml centrifuge tubes respectively.
Cultured at LB liquid medium with ampicillin antibiotic."

Midwest iGEM Conference
Michigan State University hosted a small conference for nearby iGEM teams on July 1, 2018. Five teams, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, University of Iowa, Carroll High School, Michigan State University, and our team, attended and each team presented their project design and their plans moving forward. We gave and received feedback regarding design components and potential experiments moving forward.
Rose-Hulman Institute
Following the Midwest iGEM Conference, we reached out to the team from the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology about a potential collaboration. Over a Skype video call, we discussed the current status of our projects and the role that each of our teams could play in helping the other. They were willing to read a few papers that we intended on using as a basis for our mathematical models and suggested two different routes that we could focus on. We provided feedback on their wiki, giving tips and suggestions to make the information more clear and accessible to others. While both of these were relatively simple tasks, they went a long way toward helping us each accomplish our goals.

Mentoring Session for iGEM IGN 2017
This year, we have collaborated with iGEM IGN Bioscience team from Indonesia by giving mentorship to this new team. iGEM IGN Bioscience team will participate in iGEM competition next year. Their project idea is about producing biobutanol from empty palm fruit bunch (EPFB). Their team consist of various universities in Indonesia; University of Indonesia (UI – Depok, West Java), University of Gadjah Mada (UGM - Jogjakarta), University of Airlangga (Unair – Surabaya, East Java), University of Brawijaya (UB – Malang, East Java), and Sepuluh November Institute of Technology (ITS – Surabaya, East Java).
Because of the team’s uniqueness that comes from the collaboration within various universities and also their project track in energy, we believe it is important to give mentorship in the topic of fundraising and human practice. As for fundraising, our experiences for the past 8 months showed us that a early readiness in preparation of fundraising activity had ease our way to finish our ‘first’ challenge in iGEM which is paying the registration fee on time while we only had 4 months to prepare and do the fundraising activities. The struggle regarding the funding is that the amount we have to pay quite huge in our currency to be converted to US dollar. That’s why we came up with this topic to figure out what kind of fundraising activity that might suit them since their team is consisted of various universities’ member. We explained it by giving an example of our team sponsorship’s proposal, how-to-do fundraising presentation to future sponsor company, and how we can make several human practice activities, i.e. Synbio Day, Public Discussion Forum, etc., beneficial to our sponsor company too.

Eindhoven
Bacteria cultures are an established technology for industrial production of complex biological products. Decades of research and development were spent optimizing laboratory and industrial applications designed for highest possible yield. Highly controlled environments were invented: cell shakers and bioreactors provide ideal conditions for bacteria suspension cultures.
In environmental synthetic biology, the situation could not be more different. Cells are supposed to function as designed in uncontrollable environments under varying conditions and no maintenance. If a laboratory cell culture would be left unattended for longer periods of time, cells would overgrow until all substrate is depleted and die. Without shaking, cells would sink to the bottom and form microenvironments with deleterious effects for the desired function.
This issue calls for an innovative solution that allows environmental synthetic biology projects like ours to rely on modified bacteria while still being stable without maintenance. iGEM Eindhoven provides such a solution: They developed a dextran-based gel in which bacteria are immobilized by expression of matrix-adhering membrane proteins. This novel approach of 3D gel-embedded culture ensures even distribution of cells throughout the culture and poses an additional inhibition of bacterial cell growth, complementing our soft growth inhibition Parts. In S.H.I.E.L.D., we employ Eindhoven’s gel as matrix for E. coli. This way, we are confident in sustainability far beyond classic culture technologies could provide in the field.
iGEM Eindhoven developed their gel to be as stable as possible. Despite a desirable attribute for any application, this raises difficulties in characterization: How do you test whether gel-embedded bacteria are still alive and viable? Naturally, you would try to dissolve the gel under conditions embedded bacteria can survive. After their gel proved to be resistant to dextranase, an enzyme specifically for the degradation of dextran, they asked us to try dissolve it"

    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
     Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
    Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
     In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
    The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
     In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
     There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
        1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
        2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.
        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium"

Guangdong Country Garden School
Guangdong Country Garden School is the first IBC international school in China. The school encourages sthents to participate in any international competition such as iGEM. Last  year, they took part in the 2017 Guangdong iGEM High School United. This year our team kept close contact with the class majored in economic and biology. We introduced the theoretical knowledge about synthetic biology, and help to conduct the simple basic molecular cloning and gene manipulation. We put great effort in stimulateing their interests in synthetic biology and encouage them getting ready for the next iGEM competition. They aslo carried out the public education and survey according what they had learned from this activity to gave the public a better understanding on genetic modification and transformation.

Can we anticipate any interactions with any form of wildlife? What would be ideal conditions to grow and could they potentially be met?
Misuse. Can we think some steps ahead and imagine a potentially harmful usage with our open-source GEM?
Benelux meetup
The Benelux teams were invited to meet and present their ideas at the Benelux meetup and receive critical feedback from other teams, experts in the field and an iGEM HQ representative. Teams also participated in workshops to immerse ourselves in the shareholders perspectives and debate safety issues. The meeting was hosted by the Wageningen team.
European meetup
The European iGEM meetup was held in Delft this year. The meet up started with a talk by Cees Dekker, a well-known physicist. It was quite interesting to hear about the common ground between physics and biology. After the break a lecture was given by Denis Murphy, he is involved in palm oil research. Palm oil is used a lot for cosmetics in richer countries, and for sustenance in poorer countries. He expanded on a specific application for genetic engineering for making sustainable palm oil plantations. The main event of the day was, of course, the poster presentations of all the iGEM teams. We walked around a lot, talking to pretty much every team at least once. It was very pleasant to see all the Dutch teams again here after we had previously met them during the Dutch iGEM meet up in Wageningen. During the entire event we ""infected"" other teams with our 3D printed bacteriophages. The last part of the day consisted of a BBQ with some drinks. We left together with some of the other teams and talked more about how our respective projects were progressing.

UCSC iGEM
This year, our team collaborated with UCSC iGEM because our projects relied on using the same organism, namely Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7492. We gave them the strain because their lab did not have it, and we also discussed a number of strategies on how to take care of the bacteria and culture them properly. In return, UCSC iGEM was very helpful in giving us advice as a new team. We were very inspired by their project from last year, and they even helped us get in contact with a regional director at the American Diabetes Association. In addition, they offered to assist us with the tagatose detection phase of our project because their campus had the detection column that we were looking for.
CC-TP iGEM
We also thought that it would be important to collaborate with teams that were near to us. Therefore, we reached out to the high school students across from UCSD who also participate in iGEM. Because our projects had different focuses, we decided to discuss presentation strategies and general tips on how to prepare for the Jamboree. The captain of the team has gone to the competition for the past two year teams, and she helped us start thinking about the structure and narrative of our presentation. We also discussed the possibility of media exposure for both teams on the San Diego Tribune.
SDA iGEM
As a team we wanted to focus on making synthetic biology accessible to as many individuals as possible. Therefore, we invited a high school student, Ayse, to intern with the Golden Lab during the summer and sit in on our meetings and get a sense of how to run an iGEM team. Eventually, Ayse went back to her school, San Dieguito Academy, and we gave a presentation to the Intro to Biotech class. Afterwards, several students from SDA reached out to us and expressed interest in starting up a team. We sat down with them and showed them all our resources for starting up a team; best of luck at next year’s competition!

Collaboration with the Gaston Day School iGEM Team
Henna Saqibo, Lilith Tang, Parth Patel, and William Henry conversing over project plans.
We collaborated with the Gaston Day School team this year to provide advice and analysis of their project. We maintained a line of communication and advised their team on how to proceed with Arabinose Induction to characterize certain part submissions. We sent them a specialized E. coli strain optimized for Arabinose Induction to replace the E. Coli K-12 strain that was being used. This specialized strain has been used in our lab from North Carolina and sent to them. We consulted our faculty mentor and engaged in thorough troubleshooting of their issues such that errors in procedures were identified and modified for better experimental results. We sent Parth Patel, a graduate of the Gaston Day iGEM team, to personally discuss plans, identify courses of action, and relay samples, creating a solid bridge of information and aid to the team. We analyzed a colicin sample transformed in the pSB1C3 backbone through gel electrophoresis and sent back sequencing results that could not have been readily obtained by the team to determine the status of their transformations and further troubleshoot procedures. Following the competition we will continue to aid the team by doing transformations of colicin from original stocks into plates that contain antibiotic resistance so that the Gaston Day team's project may further progress from a solid baseline."
Yale,2018,". Instead, they were planning on expressing the two key enzymes (fucO and aldA) from a high-copy plasmid. By increasing the copy number of these key enzymes, the E. coli would be overexpressing the starting genes of the EG metabolism pathway and increasing the flux through the pathway.
Afterwards, we then talked about the different types of modelling we had done. Using Flux Balance Analysis, we had modelled E. coli metabolism under restricted growth conditions with only EG (or EG metabolites) as sole carbon sources. This allowed us to identify key genes that would need to be up-regulate and down-regulated for optimal flux through the pathway.
On the other hand, the RHIT team had used more of a kinetic model to predict how feasible it was for the E. coli to grow off EG as a sole carbon source and estimated doubling times under those growth conditions. Although we initially had trouble understanding their model, we eventually were able to grasp the way they had set their model up to be as predictive as possible. We also found it incredibly encouraging that their model predicted a fairly reasonable doubling time for E. coli growing off of EG, which meant that using a synthetic biology approach to solving the problem of PET waste was feasible.
Lastly, we talked about obstacles that we had each been facing and potential ways we could help each other overcome the obstacles. One of our main obstacles was the procurement of suitable PET samples to use in our downstream enzymatic activity assays. Initially, our last resort was to use PET pellets or water bottles. Luckily, the RHIT team had managed to contact multiple plastic manufacturers in their region and had collected quite a large variety of PET samples to use, ranging from powdered PET, to high/low-crystallinity PET, to PET films, etc…They generously offered to let us use some of their samples in case we ever needed them as we progressed with our project.
One of the main obstacles that the RHIT team was facing was challenges with secretion and challenges with cloning. With regards to secretion, they were initially trying to use a pelB secretion tag but were unable to achieve efficient secretion of PETase and MHETase. Since we had actually spent quite a lot of time testing various secretion systems as part of our Objective #1, we advised for them to try the yebF secretion tag, which worked extremely well for us and was relatively simple to use since the secretion system is native to E. coli. With regards to cloning, the RHIT team seemed to be having trouble getting their plasmids to transfect successfully into competent cells. We completely understood their frustration and"

Mentoring BNDS_CHINA - a High School Team
>>> Link to BNDS_CHINA
Since that the iGEM competition only has 10 years’ history in China, new teams without experience keep coming up in recent years. As pioneers in their own schools, they more or less have to face obstacles not only on equipment, resources and funds, but also about all kinds of knowledge concerning with basic facts, lab operations, tricks in this competition and so on. Although it is the first time for us to attend iGEM as well, we still hope to devote our scanty effort to helping other teams.
So this time, we are quite glad to mentor the high school team from Beijing National Day School (BNDS). Apart from offering some necessary reagents they need, such as restriction enzymes, we also taught them some important methods for experiments such as plasmids extraction and competent cells transformation, as well as correcting several mistakes during operations in Clean Bench (Fig. 1, 2). In addition, we also helped analyze the results they got, and gave some suggestions on their cutting and ligation protocol due to those outcomes.
Fig. 1
Fig. 2
The team members from Beijing National Day School have been working very hard. Beside this competition, most of them have to undertake the heavy load of Gaokao as well. They spend all the spare time staying in laboratory and consulting us with details in experiments frequently. Hope they will do a good job in Giant Jamboree.
All in all, we all felt that collaboration is quite meaningful and useful. It encourages communication between teams which brings new teams ready-made experience and creates more chances for iGEMers to make friends and share ideas. And the activity itself gives out the message that if everyone, not matter devoted to this area or just interested in Synthetic Biology, can work together and help each other, we can make a really big deal"

◎ BIT-China for CIEI-BJ
https://2016.igem.org/Team:CIEI-BJ/Collaborations
CIEI-BJ is a high school team and it’s their first time to participate in iGEM competition this year. In the middle of July, team CIEI-BJ came to visit Beijing Institute of Technology and communicated with our team BIT-China.
As an undergraduate team, we shared the core concept of our project this year and explained a little bit about how we have exchanged ideas among the team members and how to assess the feasibility of our design as a reference for high school students.
Later, team members in high school also shared their fascinating ideas. However, some plans are not that practical due to the objective reasons. A lot of questioned were raised by members of BIT-China to help shape the project of team CIEI-BJ this year. The considerations refer to the practical meaning and the possibility of conduct for an appropriate project. What’s more, some suggestions are given to optimize the details like designing an experiment to prove a concept.
After the discussion, we showed high school students around our lab and explained the brief function of some experimental instruments. Besides, we introduced them to the previous projects of our team with the aid of posters preserved.
After they designed the basic gene circuit, we gave some advice on how to improve it. In the next few months, the guidance of BIT-China to CIEI-BJ are not only limited to the project itself, but also extended to the details about the competition procedures. We have been in touch with CIEI-BJ through the Internet and give advice on many aspects, like how to present our iGEM program to potential sponsors and how to achieve the requirements for deliverables.
In September 17th, 2016, some members of BIT-China are invited to share their experience on how to design the wiki page. A few examples were given to explain the good elements in introducing the project in a simple way. What should be put on the wiki were also discussed during this meeting. Considering the web fluency and in order to design a clear page, notes are listed for high school members to pay attention when they are working on their wiki.
In the process of mentoring a high school team, we also benefited a lot. Not only did we engage in the competition, but also we had a better understanding of the"

ZJU-China attaches much interest in communication with other teams. It’s very necessary to know more about others and to help each other is the very tradition of Zhejiang University. This year, we helped H4Z to get started in iGEM, helped HZAU with modeling and provided BNU with two important gene circuits.
To help H4Z, we held some seminar in Zhejiang ST, in which we talked a lot about how to run an iGEM team and what should be paid attention to in an iGEM project. Also, we did our experiment in the same lab so we got even more time to help them. In the modeling part, our dry lab helped them write their wiki in a technical way.
The picture of teaching high school teams to do experiment.
BNU
To help BNU, We constructed two main circuits, first one expresses a serine integrase. This intergrase can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP (click here too see more information from BNU's wiki)  , the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome. This recombination results in the reverse of the sequence between attB and attP, changing the two sites to att"

Go to Jilin_China
This year we collaborate with Jilin_China from Jilin University.
We meet them during the CCiC meeting in China, we were then aware of their large amounts of RNA-based thermosensors to submit to the part registry. In addition, we have our experience with Golden Gate assembly. Therefore, we provide our help to construct the standardized parts: RT104 for them.
The parts is shown below, the number of the conserved sequence in the device is RT104.
We inserted an 60bp DNA fragment into the pSB1C3 plasmid. The DNA fragment contains BsaI restriction site. Golden Gate assembly will enable fast and efficient parts construction. We sent the device to them as quickly as possible and hopefully it will improve their experimental efficiency and reduce their work.
The plasmid was confirmed to be constructed as expectation by enzyme digestion (original plasmid, BsaI single digestion, and EcoRI and PstI double digestion). We sequenced it, and the sequencing results shows the positive result.
Moreover, Jilin_China also help us with the measurement of our Device A. We test the data once, however, after analyzing the data, we were then aware of several problems. For example, we suspected that both LB culture medium and psicose in the system may probably make the bacteria grow, and the osmotic pressure is not controlled. Therefore, we asked Jilin_China to re-suspended the bacterial precipitation with MM culture medium and test the data. The result is shown below.
Except for this cooperation, we also discussed our protocol in Golden Gate assembly and we solved many problems for each other that were encountered during the experiment. We also discuss some questions about modeling.

Cloning methods represent one of the core elements of synthetic biology and it is crucial for each iGEM team to know as much as possible about the broad varity of cloning techniques. This need has been recognized by the iGEM Eindhoven which searched for collaborators using different cloning approaches to share their experiences in the latest cloning guide. The iGEM Team Stockholm could therefore contribute with their experience in overlap-extension PCR (OE-PCR) cloning. This technique is a completely restriction enzyme free approach to integrate elongated fragments into a target vector.

Organization of the Meet Up Ile-de-France 2016
We established a partnership with the iGEM Pasteur team in order to organize the Meet Up Ile-de-France, an event gathering all the Parisian iGEM teams. Paris is a big city and its metropolitan area has a huge impact on the scientific community around the world. Parisian universities and research institutes are at the heart of the French scientific production and all the iGEM teams were created thanks to that immense influence. This year, the 6 iGEM Parisian teams are iGEM Paris Saclay, iGEM Pasteur, iGEM IONIS, iGEM Evry, iGEM Bettencourt and iGEM IMPACT. The event was hosted by Paris Pasteur Institute and organized for 3 months by iGEM Paris Saclay and iGEM Pasteur, with the help and consulting of iGEM IONIS.
Each Parisian team had the opportunity to make a 20-minute presentation of their project in the presence of a jury, composed by the following professionals and students: Dr Deshmukh Gopaul (Pasteur Institute of Paris), Fabio Maschi (Paris-Saclay), Guillian Graves (École nationale supérieure de création industrielle), Mathis Funk (Gustave Roussy Cancerology Institute) and Matthieu Fritz (Pasteur Institute of Paris). This jury had the purpose of giving advices on iGEM standards, oratory skills, presentation"
Aachen,2016," work for the collaboration started with the transformation of the single BioBricks. Afterwards, we cloned GFP and the Tar receptor as the first two parts of our expression system together by cutting BBa_K777000 (tar receptor) with SpeI and BBa_E0040 (GFP) with XbaI to form a scar between them and both with PstI to have them in one backbone. Then we integrated promoter and RBS via BBa_J04500 and accordingly BBa_B0015 (terminator) to our emerging expression system in the same way. We confirmed the successful integration of the composite expression system in pSB1C3 by performing a test digestion and gel-electrophoresis. On our agarose gel, we compared plasmids purified from 16 different colonies. We compared them with the control where the expression system was completely integrated and just the terminator was missing. In figure 4, colonies 2, 5, 7 and 15 showed bands with the right size. So we continued to work with these colonies to check for a fluorescence signal.
Figure 4: Gel of the finished expression system (different clones after ligation and transformation) cut with EcoRI and PstI; size of ~2800 bp for the expression system itself and ~2070 bp for the backbone pSB1C3 were expected. Clones 2, 5, 7 and 15 show a band with the right size on the agarose gel.
In conclusion, we checked the expression, the localization and the amount of the Tar-GFP Protein, produced by the created expression system. Therefore, we used the Tecan Plate Reader as device for measuring the GFP signal as you can see in figure 5 to 7. In these experiments we compared the background fluorescence signal of our wild type E. coli BL21 and the used LB medium with the positive colonies from the agarose gel. The evaluation shows that there is a huge difference of the fluorescence values between the wild type colonies (A) and the colonies of the produced expression system (2, 5, 7 and 15). This result indicated that our expression system works and GFP is successfully expressed through our expression system. We fulfilled the measurement with the device of the Tecan Plate Reader twice to verify our results of a fluorescence signal and expression of the Tar receptor-GFP fusion protein in our colonies. In the second measurement the incubation time of the cells was extended.

Oxford,2018," was performed which measured fluorescence of the GFP from the promoter construct in response to 100uM hydrogen peroxide. In addition to this A600 (subscript 600) was measured, showing growth, which would allow determination of the cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide at levels required for induction of SoxR. Sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, despite literature, was too low for sfGFP detection over the noise. Cell growth was highly inhibited and higher values we believe would be too detrimental to cell growth to give valid data. We thus believe hydrogen peroxide is not an appropriate substitute for paraquat and due to legal restrictions, our characterisation could not be improved.
Imperial College London iGEM - Outreach
We teamed up with Imperial iGEM to hold a joint stall during New Scientist Live at the ExCel Centre, London. Throughout the 4-day exhibition, which featured our respective project posters, we engaged with visitors to discuss various aspects of iGEM, genetic engineering, and our projects. In preparation for the event, we held weekly Skype meetings with the Imperial team in order to jointly design an educational leaflet designed to improve understanding about synthetic biology, including common laboratory techniques, to distribute to the general public. The leaflet is shown below:
Imperial College London iGEM - Software Testing
We tested a web app (‘let’s talk about this’) created by the Imperial iGEM team designed to help resolve team issues that may arise in extended projects. We provided feedback on various aspects of the software in order to improve its suitability as a tool to promote discussion.
METU HS iGEM - Mentoring
We have been in contact with the METU high school team since the beginning of the Summer. We have given advice on designing parts, restriction sites, protocols, interlab and helped out for judging criteria and deadlines. As well as this we have shared and completed each other’s surveys allowing us to get a greater range in responses. We have helped by discussing how they can incorporate modelling into their project, how a kill switch may be added to their device and why this may be necessary in order to improve biosafety.
Tec Monterrey iGEM - Project discussion
Having got in contact with the Tec Monterrey iGEM team through our respective social media pages, we arranged a Skype call at the beginning of the Summer. Each team presented a short introduction to our projects and answered any questions that arose. In particular, we discussed the concepts underpinning the modelling aspects of our experimental work. We compared how we performed procedures such as transformations as well as exchanging tips on various laboratory protocols"

$P_{M_2} = \big(\frac{M_{2\:max}}{F}) \approx \big(\frac{6 \times 10^3}{4^{10}}) = 0.6$% in a 2 BabbleBrick system ($11$% for checksum)

$M_{2\:max}$: Frequency of most common checkmethod 2 value
$F$: Frequency of possible unique bits of information
This has been plotted for a 2 and 3 BabbleBlock system in Fig.5 and Fig.6 respectively.     When comparing checksum to checkcethod 2 the frequency peak is approximately 20 to 30     times smaller in both cases whilst utilizing more values. In Fig.5 and Fig.6 the largest     improvement using the second iteration of the checkmethod is the utilization of every     integer value, checkmethod 1 appears shaded as the frequency varies frequently. The last     step is to test checkmethod 2 when used in a babbleBlock containing 20 BabbleBricks; the     largest value possible assuming a BabbleBlock containing the value ‘3’ in each digit will     grant a value of 60600 which falls out of the current limit of 10$^4$ values. Therefore,     it is recommended that one more BabbleBrick is added to the end of the BabbleBlock in order     to store 10$^5$ values.
To improve this method  further more complex multiplications could be added, it would be    a decision based on optimising efficiency of calculations and minimising false positives.    In a 2 and 3 BabbleBrick system the"

iGEM Kobe
iGEM Kobe is an iGEM team established by students of Kobe university. Since this is the first year for the team, iGEM Gifu had given some suggestions to improve their project and make it smooth to perform experiments.
On September 9th one of our team members went to Kobe to communicate directly.  Since both projects are common in Japanese traditional drink. we discussed the issue regarding how synthetic biology should be applied into food section. Furthermore, we talked about the importance of the fact that we have to perform inactivation of transformant after experiments. This year iGEM Kobe treats B.subtilis and we perform transformation of yeast and it was a good chance to understand how to conduct research and maintain bio-safety in cases of microorganisms but E.coli. Especially B.subtilis is said to be one of the strongest bacteria in the world because the species generates spore. This discussion was totally interesting for us.
Thanks to Kyosuke KITA and Saki MATSUI, members of iGEM Kobe.

iGEM Nagahama
Gifu and Nagahama had a meeting on September 24th. Both teams have similarities in that our projects are related to Japanese fermented products and we decided to transform yeast. Hence, we talked about the regulation of genetically modified food in Japan and how we should perform our projects functionally. At the meeting, we especially advised each other about the experiment of yeast. In addition, we discussed the characteristics of the promoters that each team decided to use and assure whether they are really the best choice for us.
We taught the research of terminatome to Nagahama that the expression level of mRNA can be regulated not only by the promoters but also by the terminators. Since they decided to use CYC1 terminator with no reasons, we suggested that they think about terminatome. We believed that this was really  useful information for their project to be improved.

Collaborations with other iGEM teams
Alongside with our approaches in biology and engineering, we aimed to socialize with other teams. We gladly collaborated with several other teams throughout our whole project. As first iGEM team of the RWTH Aachen University we have plenty of things to learn, but we have to offer a lot, too.
Aachen iGEM MeetUp 2014
On September 13th and 14th all German teams were invited to attend the Aachen iGEM Meetup 2014 to share knowledge, fun and some drinks.
iGEM Meets CASLMU - Munich meetup
Early into the competition we were invited to the meetup of German iGEM teams in Munich. Arne, Markus and Michael attended the event and had a great time meeting the other iGEMers. Meeting the other teams and talking about each others problems, was also a factor in starting some of our own collaboration projects.

Brixells modeling (University of Warwick)

I. Brixells modeling (University of Warwick)
Team Warwick has shown interest in our offer to help in modeling and quantitative analysis that we have posted on the iGEM Matchmaker . Team Warwick is aiming to provide precision control over spatial arrangement of cells by designing a tool that enables drawing and building with them.
Zinc finger proteins are intracellular molecules which recognize and bind unique dsDNA sequences. We have engineered these proteins to be expressed on the surface of an E. coli cell, such that dsDNA can be used as mortar to cement cells together. Team Warwick plans to demonstrate this principle by assembling fluorescent cells onto a 2D surface and producing microscopic images, with the ultimate goal being to build complex 3D structures comprised of different cell types. This level of control over cellular localisation is useful in multiple fields including research into cell-cell interactions in microbial communities, multicellularity, and the construction of 3D cell structures in tissue engineering.
The collaboration focused on two elements:
Calculating the probability of formation, including the probability of E. Coli bonding correctly.
Calculating the effect of arm length on structure changes increases. This has been motivated by the observation that the longer the arms the higher the likelihood  that the e.coli cells can attach because they are less closely packed and such wouldn't get in each others way.
There are many methods to look at this kind of problems, but the most realistic may require huge computational resources. So it is necessary to find an approach that is experimentally relevant, computationally tractable, and reflecting the biophysics underlying Brixells.
We, Team NTNU Trondheim have offered ideas, modeling frameworks, software simulation, and data analysis to answer these questions, based on information theory and thermodynamics. For Problem 1, we have suggested an approach in terms of binding affinity and specificity where the information entropy is used as a measure of specificity. For Problem 2, we have suggested a thermodynamics approach using the Poisson-Boltzmann theory where the zinc fingers and E. Coli are approximated by"
BUCT-China,2018,"ina, we can analyze the data of the group. The fluorescence value of the second group is higher than that of the first group of arabinose-only control group and the fourth group of blank control group. It indicates that the fatty acid operon plays a role, and the third group only adds fatty acids to produce fluorescence values, which may cause fluorescence leakage.
We are very grateful to TUST_China for helping us complete the experiment of measuring fluorescence, and have obtained good experimental data, which has advanced the progress of our experiments. At the same time, in addition to the experiment, the two teams often exchanged ideas on WIKI and other aspects to promote common progress. It is a great pleasure to work with TUST_China and hope that the friendship between the two teams will last for a long time.
Detailed information about the team-TUST can be found in the here: TUST_China.
Collaborate with  the team UESTC-China
What help did we give them?
After introducing the gene plasmid containing GroES and GroEL into DH5α strain, UESTC-China verified that the growth of the recombinant strain was significantly better than that of the original strain at 1% butanol concentration. However, the single experiment was not convincing, so UESTC-China invited us to repeat the experiment to ensure the repeatability of the experiment.
We helped UESTC-China measure the effect of the expression of the GroESL gene on butanol tolerance in the DH5α strain. The effect of positive and negative samples of UESTC-China on butanol tolerance was measured. (The positive sample is E. coli DH5α with the GroESL gene introduced, and the negative sample is the DH5α wild type strain).
The measured data of the Abs600 within 24 hours are as follows:
What did they help us?
One of the keys to our experiment was the ability to construct a plasmid of interest. The operon and the vector plasmid we constructed are the key to this step. The ends of the operon are BglII and XhoI digested ends, respectively, which are complementary to the vector plasmid.
Thereafter, we performed an enzymatic ligation of the operon with the vector plasmid fragment under the conditions of a 16 degree reaction for 5 to 6 hours. Thereafter, we transformed the enzyme-ligated plasmid into E. coli top10 strain and observed its growth (the AMP resistance gene was carried on the vector plasmid to confer selectivity)."

Team Genspace
This year, Team Genspace is investigating the ability of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to confer desiccation resistance. IDPs are proteins that lack a fixed structure in an aqueous environment but obtain a rigid structure upon drying out. It is hypothesized that these proteins act as a sort of scaffold holding all of the cellular components in place under desiccation and thus protect the cell. They sought to identified genes for various IDPs from organisms such as tardigrades and nematodes, and to express them in E. Coli. But in order to determine whether or not there is an increase in the desiccation resistance of E. Coli, the baseline ability of E. Coli to survive desiccation without the IDPs needs to be established. Because of this, dehydration survivability studies were conducted at the onset of the iGEM competition by Genspace. We are collaborating with the Genspace iGEM team by replicating their experiments in hopes of gaining similar data. This information would prove invaluable to the Genspace iGEM team in that they’ll be able to measure the resistance conferred by the IDPs by comparing the dehydration survivability of the transformed E. Coli to the preliminary data they generated in addition to the data we generated. The strain of E. Coli that was used for the experiment is TOP10 and the protocols followed required placing 20 microliters of E. Coli onto different pieces of parafilm which were left to dry in an incubator for 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours. The E. Coli was subsequently rehydrated and plated. The colonies were then counted and the data is presented below:

William and Mary: Circuit Control Toolbox
The William & Mary team is developing a toolbox of parts that can be easily integrated into genetic circuits to tune the resulting levels of protein expression. They characterize their parts exclusively in E. coli. We tested eight of their toolbox parts in Promega's S30 Extract System for Circular DNA to compare the behavior of the parts in cells versus in vitro. The eight plasmids had different RBS strengths, which are reflected in our data shown below. Learn more about the experiments we performed and the results by reading our report .

University of Georgia: Archaeal InterLab
The UGA team is developing an mCherry library for Methanococcus maripaludis, an archaeal organism. Their library currently contains over 30 mutations in the RBS, which cause different levels of protein expression. We took fluorescence readings for several of these mutations as part of the ""Archaeal InterLab."" Like iGEM's InterLab Study, which aims to standardize fluorescence readings across all machines, the Archaeal InterLab recognizes that fluorescence lacks an absolute unit. Thus, participating teams record the relative fluorescence of the cells containing various RBS mutations for UGA.
We were given five samples: three mutants (A, B, and C), a wild type (WT), and suspension buffer (S). Each of the samples was read in triplicate. Here are our average fluorescence readings for each sample. Error bars represent standard deviation. For more detailed protocols, notes, and data, visit our Week 11 Lab Notebook .

Sharing our experimental materials on the iShare platform of Nankai_China！
This is the first time Nankai University iGEM team asked our team for help. They asked us to join their iShare platform, in which all iGEM teams could find the resource and material. We shared the resources and materials through an excel, which includes all the Biobricks and cells information about our project. We strongly support the iShare platform created by Nankai iGEM. Fortunately, SZU-iGEM is the first team to share information in the iGEM teams. We have only one purpose to join Nankai iGEM iShare, which is to make our best efforts to help each team, so that we can share resources with iShare as soon as possible. We helped NanKai University iGEM with the resource sharing of iShare. In return, they gave us these badges as a reward.

We are exchanging and improving
With excellent and lively presentation, all the teams were aroused in passionate discussions and got numerous responses from others, including suggestions on the thoughts of project, detailed Q&A on integrated design and reflection on application. As the unique software team, we concisely described the project we had completed and the improvement in the following work. Many members showed their interests in our project. For Bio101, some asked the DNA storage capacity and the superiority of the algorithm we used. One of the professor suggested us to take subsection coding strategy. Others played the game, Bio2048, and hoped us to help them complete the extra work such as biological game. These precious feedbacks we got from the meetup led us to what we should focus on.
Fig.10. We shared with other teams.
Modern technology makes information transmission more convenient, but there is no other way better than face-to-face communication. iSWU meetup helped the teams acquire reflections, inspirations and enhance efficiency to perfect the projects. Thus it can be seen, the communication will make a significant improvement for all attendees in the Giant Jamboree.

Our teams met for the first time at the German iGEM meetup in Marburg held in the beginning of August. The team from Erlangen consists of many chemistry students and so they are more into this field than we. Getting our non-canonical amino acids solved in various solvents turned out to be more difficult than we expected. So we asked them for help. They took the time to dig deeper into this topic and sent us literature they found. In addition, we arranged a skype meeting, where we discussed possible strategies for solving our non-canonical amino acids.

iGEM Team Technion Israel
iGEM Team Aachen for iGEM Team Technion Israel
The iGEM Team Technion uses a Tar receptor in their project fused to a linker and a GFP Protein. Based on this expression system the team wants to check the function and the location of the Tar protein in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.This receptor is required for chemotaxis in E. coli and used by the team in Israel for several purposes.  Because of problems with the linker, our team suggested to build an expression system without linker to check the possibility of fusing the proteins without any linker sequence.  Thus we are able to check its influence and can discuss, if the linker could be a reason for iGEM Team Technion’s problems.
Figure 3: Expression system designed by team Technion, once with linker (top) and once without (bottom).
To build this expression system, we used several parts from the iGEM Kit plate and put them together partly using the common restriction sites of iGEM. For performing the experiment, we wanted to use the same conditions and parts, which the iGEM Team Technion used for their expression system. Therefore, we used the BioBricks BBa_E0040 (GFP), BBa_K777000 (tar receptor), BBa_J04500 (promoter and RBS) and BBa_B0015 (terminator) to build the expression system, which can be seen in figure 3.
The work for the collaboration started with the transformation of the single BioBricks. Afterwards, we cloned GFP and the Tar receptor as the first two parts of"

University of Calgary iGEM
One major challenge of working in a high school classroom is we don’t have access to most sophisticated testing equipment such as a spectrophotometer. As such, although we were able to show that our bacteria could break down fats by observing a color change, we were not able to generate any quantitative data – only qualitative. When we were at aGEM (an Alberta-focused iGEM competition), the University of Calgary team offered to establish a collaboration to help us run a quantitative experiment on our bacteria in their lab. We got to visit their lab on several occasions and they helped us design a time course experiment with proper controls to test in their spectrophotometer. We did some practice runs and then ran our actual experiment. They helped us design and run the test, as well as analyze our data and create a figure. This helped us see the rate of the enzyme breaking down the ester bonds of the test compounds (4-nitrophenyl palmitate and 4-nitrophenyl octanoate). We also showed them our presentation and some of their team members helped us with presentation advice and graphic design help for our figures.

In                         addition, team B students considered co-expression of Nanobodies with an enzyme to catalyze the                         immobilization of Nanobodies with the addition of an aldehyde group at the end of the                         Nanobody.
After the introduction of the team project, the students of the two schools raised questions and                         discussed the contents of some projects. The students of the A team of Northeastern University                         also took the opportunity to introduce some of the excellent genetic pathway design schemes of                         iGEM. Further exchanges of some views, including the design of the pathway, the problems related                         to the experimental process, the development of the practice, and the design of the website Wiki                         artwork. Everyone had a pleasant conversation during the exchange and expressed their                         willingness to carry out further cooperation.
Tag: The exchange meeting ended in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. We look forward to the                         exchanges and cooperation between the Dalian University of Technology and the iGEM team of                         Northeastern University.
CCiC in Shanghai
The CCiC exchange meeting was held at Shanghai University of Science and Technology. Two teams                         from our school went to the conference. The team participated in the trouble shooting process,                         shared some problems in the project with other teams, and got suggestions and help from other                         teams. In the poster session, we showed posters to everyone and showed our posters to interested                         students. In the exchange, we also gained a lot of suggestions and inspired. In the final                         representation.

University of Nebraska-Lincoln Safety Case
We collaborated with the UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team to build a Safety Case for our project. This is a method of building rigorous logical arguments about the safety of a project that the UNebraska-Lincoln team has pioneered in iGEM. Given the competition’s focus on biosecurity and safety, building this safety case helped us thoroughly evaluate the current and projected risks of our project.
University of Washington Wiki Tutorial
The University of Washington’s iGEM team helped us learn how to code for our wiki with their tutorial. Many of our team are first time programmers and this was instrumental in helping us get everything ready for the wiki freeze."

NUS_Singapore-Sci,2018," allowed all of us to get a sense of what the other teams' projects were about, and have a fruitful discussion on areas where we could help each other. We hope to continue this meet-up over the following years, as we expect more and more teams to represent Singapore in iGEM.
Translations Collaboration
We also helped multiple teams with translating their Human Practice documents and videos to other languages to further help their outreach. Below are the teams we collaborated with.
Team Washington
Team Washington produced a booklet which taught the basics of synthetic biology to those not familiar in the area. Among the topics they presented was on the CRISPR-Cas system, which we found relevant to our project. We provided the Vietnamese translation for the above-mentioned section.
Team IIT-Madras
Team IIT-Madras produced a series of videos explaining the basics of cellular systems. We helped translate and record the Korean version of one of their videos.
Human Practices Collaboration
We also collaborated with Team EPFL on a comparative study between the legislative frameworks for genetic engineering in our countries, Switzerland and Singapore. Thus, we did an analysis on the similarities and differences and how these can be accounted to context differences. Head over to #CasWrites to read up our analysis!"
Fudan-CHINA,2018," miserable though bring us a lot of joy. We consider those stories lively but meaningful to all of us. Thus, thanks to our great talented drawer Hao Tian, a comic book was born — made up of funniest failure in lab, in a tearful smile. Read our comic now! Thanks for support from: Fudan, ICT-Mumbai, NUDT_CHINA, JNFLS, Tongji-Software, TUST_China, GreatBay_China, SCU-China.
OUC-China
At CCiC, we were attracted by the exquisite comic books made by China Ocean University . This comic book introduced the basic knowledge of synthetic biology in an academic way without losing wit. We used this booklet to help the iGEM team at Fudan Affiliated High school and received fantastic feedback. ""I’m rather surprised at the affinity between synthetic biology and engineering，both featuring logic and inspiration, and thus have a better understanding of the “E” in iGEM.” “The comic vividly explains the basic logics in the biological gene regulation mechanisms. I used to know the very basic control systems like the Lacrosse operon model in E.Coli before, but now I found the more intricate systems no longer out of reach.""
Major Conferences
The iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University
Exchanging ideas is always good for igemers and researchers, so we attended many meet-ups and conferences this year. We intended to attend a conference in NKU on the 6th of July. However, bad weather condition prevented our flight. A video was made to introduce our project before we answered questions from professors and other iGEMers online. Advice was collected and applied to the refinement of project design and purpose. Also we watched the presentation of other teams, getting to know how their experiment goes on. We got familiar with Peking, NKU_CHINA and Jilin_China through this conference and developed collaboration afterwards.
6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference In Taiwan
At the iGEM Reporting Conference held by National Chung Hsing University , we introduced our project to professors of synthetic biology and other teams. By this way, we gained valuable feedback from them to enable us to perfect our project background and made us realize the importance of pertinency we should pay more attention to hereafter. Moreover, we are more convinced of the rationality of our modeling after discussing with other universities on modeling issue. Besides, we met many iGMEers cherishing the same ideals and following the same path and we still kept in touch. In the end, we got"
Exeter,2016,".2 \times 10^5}{4^{10}}) = 11$% in a 2 BabbleBrick system
$\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\approx \big(\frac{10^8}{4^{15}}) = 9$% in a 3 BabbleBrick system $P_C$: Maximum probability of the same checksum occuring after any number of mutations
$C_{max}$: Frequency of most common checksum
$F$: Frequency of possible unique bits of information
Therefore, it can be predicted that for an average sentence containing 9 words the maximum     probability of the same checksum occurring will be of the magnitude of 1%. The probability     should decrease marginally when adding BabbleBricks due to the slightly increased range of     checksums that become available. This value can be optimized by altering the method of the     checksum to utilize a greater range of values and to spread out the frequency more evenly as     to reduce the maximum probability of the same checksum occurring.
Currently one BabbleBlock has 4 BabbleBricks dedicated to storing the checksum, giving a maximum     10$^4$ possible values. The first step in determining a ‘CheckMethod’ is to ensure that all checksums     for a suitable amount of BabbleBricks can be stored without going over 10$^4$. It is also important    to not use operators that will result in negative numbers or decimals, therefore limiting the     possible checksum values to integers up to but not including 10$^4$, this rules out operators such     as subtract and divide. For this example, a suitable number of words in a sentence and therefore     BabbleBricks in a BabbleBlock shall be 20. All simulations will be carried out on 3 BabbleBrick     systems due to computing limitations.
Checksums are non-directional, for example a BabbleBrick of bases [2,2,2,2,2] would have the    same checksum as [2,1,3,2,2].  To alter this a checkmethod will incorporate the position     of the base in to the calculation. At each point the digit is multiplied by its position     in the BabbleBlock, where the first BabbleBrick has digit positions 1 to 5 and the last     BabbleBrick (20$^{th}$) has positions 96 to 100. A scaler $\alpha$ has been included to     increase"

Mentoring
Taking part in the iGEM competition can be a bit overwhelming at first. That is why we helped out our compatriots from Louvain-La-Neuve , who are participating for the first time. We reviewed each other's work, and provided useful input on each other's projects. Also, in the last week before the big Jamboree, we met up to review and discuss about each other's presentation and posters.
Apart from helping each other with the projects, we are also planning to organize a conference on synthetic biology together. In this way we can present our projects to the Belgian public, and educate them about iGEM.  Who knows, maybe we'll inspire a new generation students who will take part in the iGEM competition with their own, unique projects!
Interviews
Marie Matos from the EPFL iGEM team contacted us in September if we would be interested in a collaboration through an interview on Skype. Always interested in the projects of the other teams, this gave us an ideal opportunity to gain information on their project by the team members themselves. We also had a chance to talk about our own project, with a subteam consisting of three of our master students, and our advisor. Not only was this interview a lot of fun to do, and did we meet two new awesome people, they also published the interview on their igem.today site, where we are team of the week of 21 September. Under this text, you can"

II. iGEM Matchmaker and LabSurfing (Technische Universität Darmstadt)
Team TU Darmstadt noticed our match making algorithm and thought that their LabSurfing platform would complement each other. LabSurfing is a website for all iGEM teams and their members to be able to stay in contact with the iGEM community after finishing the annual project. The second main advantage is the opportunity for iGEM teams to get to know each other early in the competition. This facilitates meetups and collaborations right from the beginning. We plan to reserve a breakout room at the Giant Jamboree to present our side  roject Matchmaker alongside LabSurfing in the same room, so you also get the chance to present your application in one poster. The two websites will link to each other so that teams can find teams to get in touch with through the iGEM matchmaker, and use social network tools using LabSurfing.

They also provided us with their own hardware and filler (Fig. 5, 6). This greatly reduced the amount of our work. We had some technical problems while building their aeration tank, and the instructor from Nanjing-China tutored us with great patience through mobile phone.

Unfortunately, their hardware is not compatible to our project. They used Bacillus subtilis as a chassis organism last year, which naturally forms biofilm. What is more, they also transformed a biofilm protein into the bacteria, so their engineering bacteria grew well on the plastic fillers. However, we used E. coli throughout our project that does not generate biofilm. As a result, our bacteria cannot attach to the fillers after 10 hours’ incubation in a shake incubator.                         Although we were not able to use the device provided by Nanjing-China to test our design in real condition, we greatly thank them for advising us on building our own hardware.

Collaboration overview
a) Chinese high school team wechat group owner
Our team captain organized a group chat that include nearly everyone high school team captain from China. We not only actively help other teams, but also help forward ideas and important information to other teams. We are trying to built a iGEM high school environment that allows us to bond even after this year iGEM and we can celebrate and share ideas as iGEMer.
b) Communication with RDFZ
RDFZ is another reputable high school in Beijing, and we have collaborated with them.  What we did for them
We invited them to our laboratory and talked about our experimental design. We shared our experience on iGEM with them, since our school has participated in this competition for years. We shared our understanding of synthetic biology and current biological issues.
Jianhan(Jeff), as a two-year iGEMer, actively shared his experience with RDFZ captain at the beginning of this year's iGEM. They meet up in February to discuss how to efficiently start iGEM and shared numerous ideas while Jianhan visited their campus. During the meetup in October, we actively helped them host the meetup and are able to share his ideas on lab safety on a panel with RDFZ team's captain and other professionals.
What they did for us
We were invited to RDFZ’s bio-lab. They gave us a presentation with Jeff about their experiment design. Specifically, their calculations of specific growth rate inspired us to promote our model.

Nottingham,2018," of the best opportunities to make collaborations with other teams and bring back useful information that we gained during 2 days in Oxford on 12th-13th July 2018.
The first day was very interesting! We got an opportunity to present our project, answer questions and get feedback from other iGEM teams. This was very useful as it helped our team to understand what type of question the jury might ask at the Giant Jamboree. As well as this, we took part in a collaboration workshop. It was a great chance to meet other teams, discuss our projects and also make collaborations, which is a very important part of iGEM.
The next morning, we started with a short introduction of activities. We were split into 3 groups and started our lecture sessions. The first one was called “The iGEM Alumni Trouble-shooting Workshop”, where we focused on our problems and shared our iGEM experiences so far. This helped us to understand how other teams are doing and gain advice from last year’s winners and alumni. Then we had a lecture on human practices, safety and security. This lecture was extremely important because it helped our team to understands the concept of human practices and gave us some tips about how to avoid mistakes in the safety and security part of iGEM. The final lecture was about entrepreneurship. This helped us to look at our project from another perspective and learn about the After iGEM potential for our team.
Hassan, Sofya and Nemira were brainstorming a lot during these two days, so we came back to Nottingham full of different ideas about what we can do or change. We presented these thoughts to the rest of our team, who had even more ideas!
To conclude, we found the meetup incredibly useful and informative. We learned, plus collaborated with so many different teams and loved getting to know more about each other’s different projects. We look forward to implementing the skills and knowledge that we learned in Oxford very soon!

BNU-CHINA,2015," , and what problems they want to settle. Meanwhile, we helped them found some problems. For example, the variable numbers of each equations are inconsistent, and the parameter settings of some equations don’t accord with the fact.
First of all, by adjusting a series of independent variables and correcting the parameters, we solved the problems above. We gain the numerical solution of the equation by applying the Runge-Kutta Method as well. The method is suitable for differential equation system in different dimensions with high efficiency. According to concentration of hydroxide ion in equation ABCDE group , we get the pH and use the pH to judge the termination condition. In equation C and F, we jump out the conditions according to concentration of specific substances. The initial value of every equation group is the terminal value of the last equation group. By this way we achieve the whole cycle process and finally get dynamic image of pH.
Fig. 1.1 The dynamic change of pH during the regulation process
The initial concentration of OH- is 0.2×10-6, and the initial pH is higher than 7, so the whole reaction starts from Group A, and the reactions are, in order, Group A, B, C, D, E, F, A, B, C, D, E, F.
2.  We helped BIT-China to detect protein NhaA and NhaB.
BIT-China’s project this year is about regulating pH, thus they need to express two kinds of membrane proteins, NhaA and NhaB. Taking account of the fact that membrane proteins are especially hard to express and detect, we offered to help them with this part. To this end, we reviewed an amount of relevant literature and consulted several professors of this field, on which basis we tried various protocols to express, purify and detect NhaA as well as NhaB.
Initially we did SDS-PAGE of the whole protein of bacteria. To put it in detail, we centrifuged 5 mL bacterium solution under overnight shake culture at 4°C, 6000 rpm for 10 minutes, which was boiled for 10 minutes, then with protein loading buffer added. Afterwards we run SDS-PAGE of the mixture with the running gel concentration 12%.
As the whole cell was too stick, we couldn’t make an accurate estimation from the result, but anyway there was no sign of expression of the objective proteins whose molecular weight are about 46 kDa. Then we tried normal SDS-PAGE of the homogenate and supernatant and the result came out as Fig.2 has shown.

Meetings
In the week of 29 August, our advisor Steven went to Lausanne to meet up with EPFL iGEM team . They had a barbecue together on which both teams elaborated on their projects. Steven had a lovely day, with lots of new insights on how we can improve dewpal (which can be found under Human Practices). He also learned many new things about synthetic biology, with which he was not familiar. This sparked an interest in him to start exploring this, for him, new field, and even looked into taking a class on this subject.
Surveys
As iGEM is also about gaining new knowledge, we participated in several surveys of different iGEM teams:
iGEM Göttingen, Germany
The iGEM team of Göttingen is working on increasing the production of vitamin B12. This vitamin is invovled in metabolic functions in all organisms, and thus an essential nutrient. We completed their survey on the general understanding of vitamin B12, and its importance in living organism.
iGEM Virginia, USA
The iGEM team of Virginia are designing a novel biocontainment mechanism based on leucyl tRNA-synthetase. For their human practices, they created a survey around the awareness regarding biocontainment in other iGEM teams. Our wetlab team gladly participated, and the results can be found here .
iGEM Paris-Saclay, France
The iGEM team of Paris-Saclay is studying the effect of DNA-topology on gene expression. However, as part of their Human Practices, they send out a survey about responsible research and innovation. We filled it in, and you can see what they learned here .
iGEM Munich, Germany
The iGEM team of Munich are trying to develop an innovative way to print organic tissue using ""bioink"". For their Human Practices project, they wanted to investigate the enabling factors in biotechnology. To help them, we filled in their survey. Their findings can be found here .
iGEM Groningen, the Netherlands
The iGEM team from Groningen are working on a bacterial decryption system to safely store information. For their Human Practices, they performed a survey to understand the current perception around digital and physical storage of information. Their results are available here .

After understanding our needs for modeling, they helped us build a descriptive model based on                         the                         mechanism of action of fluorescent probes. The model validates this linear relationship through                         experimental data and predicts future possible outcomes by constructing a linear regression                         model.                         And they also analyzed the residuals of the model to ensure it works well. With this model, we                         can                         properly predict the output when the concentration of H2O2 is in certain                         interval.

Exeter,2016,", a list of submitted parts with part numbers, descriptions and links, the medal achieved, and any awards and nominations. Each project was tagged with all relevant keywords, in line with Purdue’s aim of creating a user-friendly, searchable database.
Purdue conducted a continuous culture of a kill switch that the 2015 Purdue team created but never submitted, and sent us the results of their experiment to give us a broader view of the reliability of kill switches, beyond our current scope of KillerRed and KillerOrange.
They followed a continuous culture protocol written by Dan, in which they took the OD of the continuous culture every morning and evening, adding a new flask to return the OD to 0.05 each time to continue the culture. For each day of week 1, and every other day for the weeks following that, they would prepare a glycerol stock of a sample of the culture, then test it in an appropriate way for their kill switch to test if it was still functional, and to what degree it was still functioning. Purdue said once they had substituted out LB broth for yeast YPD media, the protocol was straightforward and easy to follow.
Parts:Glasgow
We collaborated with Glasgow iGEM 2016 to test the efficiency of the T7 Promoter we were using to construct the KillerRed, KillerOrange and Lysozyme kill switches. We new that it was leaky and we speculated that it was reducing the efficiency of our project but we needed proof that the leakiness of the promoter could affect our project. In return they gave us a DH5α.Z1 strain in the hopes it would improve the efficiency of our promoter. After subsequent testing we were unable to express our KillerRed and KillerOrange proteins in this strain. This is the report they sent us for the test of the T7 promoter:
KillerRed and KillerOrange Promoter Efficiency Experiment
Methods
First, we transformed the plasmids for testing promoter efficiency into the E. coli strain DH5α.Z1:
J04450 (RFP with a lac-repressible promoter) in pSB1C3
lac-repressible promoter + KillerRed in pSB1C3
lac-repressible promoter + KillerOrange in pSB1C3
Next, we set up 5ml LB broth overnight cultures in boiling tubes with loose caps at 37°C shaking at 225rpm of:
DH5α, no plasmid
DH5α, J04450-pSB1C3
DH5α, KillerRed-pSB1C3
DH5α, KillerOrange-p"

Exeter,2016,"    a decision based on optimising efficiency of calculations and minimising false positives.    In a 2 and 3 BabbleBrick system the probability of a false positives occurring was reduced by     approximately 20 and 30 times respectively, although the numbers are too large to compute,     this new method has the possibility of lowering the maximum false positive error of the previously     used checksum by one or more orders of magnitude.    If continued further, research should also be done in to the reconstruction of data after it has been lost.
Stanford Brown
We initiated contact with Stanford-Brown this year with the intention of interviewing one of their supervisors, Prof. Lynn Rothschild. We were interested in hearing                 about her opinions as well as experiences with diversity and equality in science. Unfortunately we were never able to find a mutually suitable date to carry out the             interview. However we were able to organise a collaboration with her team.
The Stanford-Brown team have helped our podcast and YouTube series by making their own edition of Desert Island… Science? Which is now available on our             YouTube and SoundCloud channels.
Your browser does not support the audio element.
We are very thankful to Stanford-Brown for their contribution, as it has helped our work get further recognition on an international scale.
We are also proud and grateful in saying that we have helped and been helped by various other teams in this years iGEM competition. Utilising other teams equipment and different ways of thinking towards solving problems has provided us all with some great data and innovative solutions to some problems we have encountered. We are confident that what we have achieved will benefit the iGEM competition as a whole.
Good inter-team communication is a vital factor in all disciplines and at the core of the iGEM spirit. We hope to have contributed to this in several ways."

Collaboration:
This year, in order to accord to the standard of Gold Medal, we made contacts with other iGEM teams in China to exchange ideas, introduce each others’ projects and give advice to perfect them. Those teams that we cooperated with are NAU-CHINA , UESTC-software and JSNU-China .
We helped the NAU-CHINA producing a practical model designed by them through our 3D printing technology. Besides, we helped the UESTC-software team carry out a test of randomness and fault tolerance of their software Bio101 and build a mathematical model to analyze their compression algorithm bzip2 in the form of a software test report. We also worked with the JSNU-China team, shooting a flash video in order to let more people knowing iGEM Competition.
Collaboration with NAU-CHINA:
(https://2016.igem.org/Team:NAU-CHINA/Collaborations)
Before our meeting, we arranged a video conference, during which we introduced our projects and ideas briefly and planned the itinerary for meeting up.
On September 28th 2016, some team members of NAU-CHINA came to our college with their wonderful ideas and great interests to discuss our projects in details so that we could better understand both of our projects and dig into the part that we may need to cooperate. During the discussion, we talked about our understanding of synthetic biology, including its huge potential in benefiting human beings and all kinds of amazing breakthroughs that scientists made lately. Then we displayed and deeply explained our project, to which they gave some great advice such as taking time into consideration in case of traffic congestion to optimize our path planning"
Braunschweig,2014," get in contact with teams nearby, but also with teams overseas. We had a skype video chat with the iGEM Team Waterloo and discussed our projects, and exchanged our experiences concerning the competition.
The iGEM Team from Virginia created a survey about synthetic biology which was also to be conducted by teams from other parts of the world. Therefore, we translated the survey into German and conducted it at our university’s open house. The survey dealt with the public awareness towards and acceptance of synthetic biology and the aim was to get an impression of how people from all ages, origins and professions think about this. We do not know the results yet, but we still hope we could make a contribution for this survey to become more representative with regard to the control sample.

UFlorida,2017," linking all these bright minds to a common goal, international unification is possible.
Team TecCEM
Florida is often stereotyped as the citrus state, but in truth a majority of the citrus industry here has deteriorated due to the devastating impact of bacterial disease. Oranges especially have been dealt a hard blow from the spread of Huanglongbing commonly referred to as ‘citrus greening’. While our state has certainly suffered, numerous other countries have as well. The TecCEM group from Mexico has recognized and cultivated an inhibition strategy against future outbreaks. Solving a problem requires initial background knowledge and the TecCEM team wanted to learn straight from the source; the citrus farmers that were experiencing the losses. They needed to understand the disease pathology and the possible ecological impact of biological remediation. UFlorida aided by putting the team into direct contact with the Florida Department of Agriculture and the Citrus Health Response to reach out to specific citrus grove owners. With these contacts TecCEM could compile survey data from the producers and analyze their extension portion of human practices.
Team Michigan Software
Creating a biologically-engineered system is an achievement, but such success requires a streamlined series of protocols and experimental knowledge. iGEM doesn’t simply involve the poking and prodding of bacteria; it also relies on foundational projects to provide support to future projects. As such, many teams work in the pursuit of technical/software support or part characterization. Team Michigan Software has developed a protocol database meant to attenuate the problems associated with protocol reliability and replication. Synthetic biology depends on validated methods, but reaching standardization between labs has proven difficult.  ProtoCat 4.0 is designed to allow users to browse, review, edit or even upload dependable protocols of their own. With this collaboration, UFlorida completed a beta-testing survey to constructively critique the available tools. We also uploaded one of our own protocols that has proven to be consistently effective throughout benchwork."

Help SCU_China by developing SD Finder
In our communication activities, SCU_China team introduced to us an interesting idea. They want to find out SD sequence in DNA and analyze the strength of the SD sequence that affects translation issues. Then, they can standardize the strong SD sequence, so that it can be reused in future.
But there are two barriers in their works. One is how to find out all of unknown SD sequence in a DNA sequence. The other one is how to analyze the strength of SD sequence.
To deal with these two problems, we cooperated with SCU_China team( https://2015.igem.org/Team:SCU_China/Collaborations ) and CHINA_CD_UESTC( https://2015.igem.org/Team:CHINA_CD_UESTC/Collaborations ) team to study how to find out SD sequence and analyze the strength of it.
Then we developed an online software based on browser—SD Finder, which is used in helping users predict the location of ORF and SD sequence in DNA. User only needs to type sequence that needs to be predicted, select the initiation codons and termination codons. Then comes the prediction.
Online software based on browser—SD finder
We provide the related information about ORF and SD sequence in the result page. The column of SD sequence lists a 13bp sequence from -2 to -14 in upstream of ORF. We also tag the position of SD sequence signals with red. And the last column lists the type of the strength of the SD sequence.

In order to make it easier for subscription followers to understand the project idea, we translated the project description into Chinese, which was more convenient to comprehend. Meanwhile, we offered suggestions on ICT-Mumbai’s software to help them improve.

What will happen if every iGEM project represents one superhero with special power just like in the movies? As a superhero with the supernatural power of cleaning all the rust and killing iron bacteria, Iron Guardian is a part of the League of Superheroes, where Iron Guardian met many other superheroes with unique powers and ambitions. What’s more, by designing the trading card of our superhero, we managed to spread the main idea of our project in a more attractive and accessible way.
CCiC
As a grand conference for Chinese iGEM teams to gather up and communicate with each other, CCiC provided us a precious opportunity to exchange opinions and sense the Giant Jamboree atmosphere in advance. We did presentation, presented poster, held a trouble-shooting meet-up, gave and got suggestions on projects, and improved our design accordingly.

Georgia_State,2018," little as we spoke about limitations of our labs and were able to get a full understanding of the inner working of each team’s lab.    After attending this event, we all felt that it would be in our best interests to create a permanent platform where we could communicate, exchange ideas, and collaborate.
Emory is having a similar issue that we dealt with last year. Their team consists mostly of seniors who will be graduating. The 2018 GSU iGEM team was also made up of entirely new members, meaning we did not have any team members with iGEM experience, and could not benefit from any mentoring from returning members. We discussed with the Emory team the ideas, concepts and expectations we wished someone had left behind for us so we could cary on better. We both wanted to ditch the idea of the team starting from scratch every year. One can never fully understand all that is iGEM without having done it once before, but there are definitely expectations that can be discussed to help adhere to the mindset needed to do well in iGEM.
China Sister School
It is no secret that iGEM has become increasingly popular in recent years. One of our sister schools, Southwest Jiaotong University, has shown interest in starting an iGEM team, and came to iGEM GSU for advice. Their headmaster, as well as two faculty members and several students came to observe and ask questions about what iGEM is, how we conduct our lab and what our project idea is for this year. One of the faculty members actually lectures here at Georgia State and some of the students participate in an exchange program with GSU, and are here for the fall semester.
Following our presentation, we had a “Q&A” session where students discussed their concerns as well as their own ideas on how to start their own iGEM team. The session concluded with us giving a few pointers on what the best way to go about that would be. We had a presentation that included all this information and shared each of our own experiences.After our presentation, several students expressed a serious interest in iGEM, citing the opportunity for hands on experience that comes with participation.

University College Cork was also working on a biosensor. They wanted to test their sensor in a cell-free expression system but were short of time. As we had tested our biosensor in lysate very often, we had a well established protocol. We were unsure though whether it could be applied to a different biosensor, which is why UCC kindly reviewed our protocol, which we adapted to test fluorescence on a platereader.

This year, we collaborated with 3 iGEM teams of 2018, be showing as follows, and we participated in China 5th CCiC held in Shanghai. We helped each other and shared some good ideas concerning our projects, and we got some fantastic inspirations.
1.Collaboration with OUC-China
According to our appointment with OUC-China, We printed and propagandized the E.coli cartoon designed by OUC-China to the new students on the club recruitment day at our school. Many students are attracted by this cartoon book. It introduces complex Synthetic Biology with vivid pictures and words, which enable more students to learn about Biology and fall in love with it. We imparted some biological knowledge in the E.coli cartoon in detail for those new biological fan.
2.Collaboration with SKLMT-China
With the invitation of SKLMT-China, we made a contribution to the construction of Pseudomonas fluorescence promoter pool. With the help of report gene firefly luciferase, we managed to test the intensity of different promoters. This helped SKLMT-China team to build up promoter pool, which aimed to collect intensity data of promoter under different lab conditions. The process of cooperation enables us to learn from one another and achieve satisfying results.
Using the BERTHOLD Mithras LB 940 instrusment,  showed in the left, we sbtained some valuable results.  These results are showing as follows.

Hardware Improvement
This year we collaborate with ZJU with their hardware improvement and parts characterization. They are working on E.coli two component systems wherein transcription of the output promoter is controlled by different activating and inhibitory light wavelength, which is documented to produce reliable signals.
Previously, they use a device that can only emit light and the lighting is controlled manully. Controlling the on-off stages of each LED or even generating a sequential signals of different wavelengths becomes tedious tasks. Therefore we wonder if we could help with robust hardware construction that could improve the efficiency of their experimentation.
We devised a signal control system driven by Arduino microcontroller board located outside standard 96-well incubator. A wrapper was written for this library to enable simple commands to be used to drive the LEDs in the device, requiring user to specify only a row, column, color and intensity. In this way, the intensity can be programmed and the signals can be specified without having to interrupt the experiment. Moreover, as the device matches the standard biological incubator (2ml 96 well plate), more replication experiment can be conducted simultaneously, which enhance the reliability and repeatability of data acquired.
Parts Characterization
We helped ZJU with their parts construction too. We tested the robustness of two TCS system – the green-activated, red deactivated Ccas-Ccar system and the dark-activated red deactivated modified Cph8-OmpR system. The data shows that though Green light activation shows consistent enhancement, the red light deactivating system shows chaotic behavior This might possibly be due to ZJU's modification of plasmids, which they combined three plasmids from original paper into two plasmids.

A. Finalized component average results for each component in varying inducer concentrations using their lab’s protocol. E. coli strain BL21 is designated by “BL,” and strain MG1655 is designated by “MG.” Values were obtained by taking the average of the fluorescence at each inducer concentration. Negative controls, which consist of the wildtype strain grown in each corresponding inducer concentration, were averaged and then subtracted from each component value. Results from this experiment were variable and followed no set pattern.
B. B. Graph of finalized component average results with error bars showing standard deviations. R0010 in BL21 is designated by blue, R0010 in MG1655 orange, K314100 in BL21 gray, and K314100 in MG1655 yellow. Steep deviations were common for all cell lines at higher inducer concentrations. The results from this experiment were inconclusive.
