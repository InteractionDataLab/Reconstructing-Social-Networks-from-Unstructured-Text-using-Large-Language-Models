a. communicating with other iGEM teams
#Korean Regional Meetup  8/15 @ Lotte hotel Athen’s Garden
The three Korean teams gathered together and presented their own projects. We had an opportunity to show our idea and receive comments during Q&A sessions. Particularly, one overgraduate team called Korea_U_Seoul team asked us why we used E.coli instead of other microorganisms. We answered that it is for accessibility. Since our project is headed toward the welfare of farmers, we focus on the technology that is “available” and “easy” for them to use.
We also offered some opinions about two other teams. Three Korean teams collaborated to achieve better at Giant Jamboree. It was indeed a great time.
#i GEM mentors
Gha Young Lee, David Brown, Ricardo Chavez  We have applied for Pilot Mentorship Program, and were able to meet three great mentors who had experienced Giant Jamboree. In particular, Gha Young helped us a lot. She shared her experience about preparing for Giant Jamboree. We can’t wait until meeting her at Boston :) Also, we have skyped twice during the summer vacation( 7/1/15 10AM and 8/17/15 11 PM in Korean time) and got advice about part submission, human practice and the purpose of our project.
b. communicating with Bio Ethanol Research Institutes
#Jeon-nam University Bioethanol Research Institute 8/19
We started exchangin emails with JU Bioethanol Research Institute on August 19th. We not only introduced our bioengineering project but also Our questions were related to the problems that this institute encounters during their research. It answered that the economic feasibility and construction of infrastructure were the main problem it often faces.
c. Testing other teams’ systems
We’ve tested some systems of other iGEM teams such as Korea_U_Seoul,Nankai and Paris-Bettencourt."
Brasil-USP,2015," several iGEM project descriptions from populations of differents countries. This could generate significant information on how to propose better projects in the future.
     To this end, CGU Taiwan approached several teams asking for simple questions related to their own project. Then, all questions were presented to people from different countries, with significant different backgrounds. We have contributed with two questions:
How long does it take for one regular tire, the one used in our cars, to degrade if left in an open environment?
Is tire disposal regulated in your country? If yes, are these laws able to control correct disposal and recycling of rubber waste?
     To help them share this survey with in Brazil, we have translated it into portuguese. Visit CGU Taiwan team’s wiki to learn more about the answers to these questions and the overall feedback on our project.
Contributed to Modeling-Experimentation quizz from Team Aalto-Helsinki
     The scientific method is based on a closed loop between experimentation and analytical reasoning (modeling) on the data. While both are completely indispensable, there is a historical segregation between experimentation and modeling in natural sciences, probably due to a natural background divergence among different scientists. Team Aalto-Helsinki proposed a survey to investigate how most of iGEM team members see this issue and how each team is tackling the experimenting-modeling discrepancy. Visit Aalto-Helsinki to learn more about this survey!
     A few members of our team answered this poll. In particular, we are very happy that we could arrange a group of team members dedicated to modeling and bioinformatics. This group was in close connection with the Wet Lab, always keeping the Experimenting-Modeling cycle closed and working.
Participating in a survey from Paris-Saclay team
     In iGEM, we have a broad range of different backgrounds regarding to techniques and backgrounds. To better understand which chassis are being used and why, Paris-Saclay team prepared a short survey to gather this data. For instance, we have used E. Coli, from DH5a and BL21 strains.
     As a token of their appreciation, Paris-Saclay team share with us a Thanks Badge.
Participating and sharing a survey from UCL
     While iGEM projects are often motivated by day-to-day issues, solutions based on Synthetic Biology may yet not be well accepted by the overall population. It is, then, fundamental to understand how people will see your final product and make sure that there is some space for it in ther market. UCL team proposed a survey to investigate this topic, and we have helped them translating it into Brazilian port"

The new iGEM team
Learning the progress
Participate in iGEM
Bidirectional cooperation
Collaboration
Collaboration plays an important role among iGEMers, for we have become companions with reciprocity interactions. This year, we have done collaborations with NCTU_Formosa iGEM team.
The new iGEM team
NCTU_Formosa started to introduce experiments which is related to iGEM to the science-gifted class of Taichung First Senior High School(TCFSH) since April 14. Gradually, the background knowledge of synthetic biology was adequate, then the cogitation of combination to engineering and biology was shared, the core of the gene regulation, the design of biobricks were taught. What's more, they introduce previous project from NCTU_Formasa, giving us the prospect of the competition.
Learning the progress
The instructor of NCTU_Formosa, Pro. Wen-Liang Chen, invited us to learn about biology to our lab in the last semester. NCTU_Formosa then gave us a series of training, the SOP of NCTU_Formosa's wet lab protocol, including Cultivation of E. Coli, Miniprep, Digestion, Ligation, Transformation, PCR, and Gel Electrophoresis.
Participate in iGEM
We decided to participate in iGEM this year, as the first year of TCFSH_Taiwan. NCTU_Formasa members taught us many things such as useful databases (NCBI, Uniport), useful tools for protein (BLAST, COBALT, CD search), biology experiment design and debug, and write biobricks for synthesis.
Bidirectional cooperation
Our team member"
TMMU_China,2016," was hosted by Sun Yat-sen University, in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams. This was a great opportunity to present our work and learn from the other 28 teams. It was nice to see that we did a good job in presentation and the audience was attracted by our project. The most important thing to us was that we harvested much useful advice from the judges, mentors and students. Interestingly, we were lucky to have dinner with two former iGEMers Zhang Haoqian and Liu Yang, who encouraged us to go deeper in research and promote iGEM and synthetic biology research in our university. From the CCiC, we were aware of our current disadvantages in quantitative measurement and the overall logic, which laid a foundation for the later adjustments and improvements.
TMMU-China Meet-up:After several attendances of meet-ups, we hold a meeting one month before the opening ceremony. Although small in scale, this meet-up aimed at further promoting projects and better preparing for the whole competition. It is worth mentioning that with only one month from the competition, many teams felt they were under great pressure. Professor Rao Xiancai from TMMU-China shared with us his story. He told us that with the advent of the information age, acquiring knowledge and exchanging information had become much easier than decades ago, with iGEM as a good example of integration of network information and international communication. The whole world is enjoying a golden age of information exchange and multilateral communication. He hoped that given the chance, all the young adults could seize the moment to learn more, not for medals or awards, but to stand on the frontier of the age, and by working together, we would make a difference. Professor Rao’s speech inspired us all and we therefore deepened our understandings of scientific research. At last, the exciting hot pot dinner lighted up the happy atmosphere for every team member to enjoy the meeting and refresh for future challenges.

As a way to extend the applications of our biosensor we decided to think about environmentally friendly biodegradable papers. This led us to microbial cellulose as it is inexpensive to produce and can break down easily into glucose. At the same time, the Stanford-Brown 2015 iGEM project focused on reducing the mass and volume of supplies required to send on space missions by making self-folding biological materials called biOrigami. They are seeking to incorporate sheets of microbial cellulose produced from Gluconacetobacter hansenii into their project as one of their folding mechanisms.
In an effort to improve these sheets, they are processing them which could affect their properties. From there, they are experimenting with attaching bacterial spores to sheets of the microbial cellulose, and then using the contractile properties of these spores in the presence of differing relative humidities to cause the sheets to bend. To attach the spores to the cellulose, they are attempting to express cellulose binding domains (CBDs) on the spore coats. The sheets of microbial cellulose that they processed and gave us allowed us to compare the usefulness of the microbial cellulose as a basis for a biosensor through our experiments in testing the binding affinities of a CBD on both processed and unprocessed sheets. In turn, our experiments testing the binding affinities helped guide the Stanford-Brown choice of cellulose processing technique for making sheets to which the spores will attach.
For this collaboration we expanded on the characterisation of BBa_K1321357 which is sfGFP fused to CBDcex driven by LacI and used our dissociation protocol . We chose this specific CBD because it was in the distribution kit with enough characterisation to ensure that the only variable we are testing is the processed vs unprocessed cellulose. As you can see on the graph, there are large error bars however there is a clear"

Helping first year SYSU-MEDICINE
     It’s important to find new friends in iGEM. We are glad to help first year SYSU-MEDICINE, the third iGEM team of Sun Yat-sen University by offering vital helps to them on registration and part submission. We also offered them digested backbones for their BioBrick construction. Reference can be seen in the Collaboration site of SYSU-MEDICINE .

Wanting to improve last year's forum, we held a seminar together with East Chapel Hill High iGEM team and the Museum of Life and Science to discuss future outreach projects as well as how to improve our success in engaging a diversity of thoughts. Our mosquito forum from last year (see: Mosquito Forum ) primarily drew from Duke University and thus most people already came from a very scientific background. A variety of backgrounds and point of views is essential to having an engaging and meaningful forum.
We discussed with Chapel Hill and the Museum of Life and Sciences on collaborating to create forums in the future that can achieve this goal. During this seminar we examined the the incredible gap of opinion between the general public and scientist communities, and conversed about how scientific communities must create spaces to speak with and hear public opinion surrounding genetic engineering topics. We deliberated about appropriate ways to engage the public in learning about the scientific process and the research already being done with genome-editing technologies. We concluded that one of the most important goals of such public engagement is the interaction between trained scientists and laymen - this gives ""science"" a human face and allows researchers to learn from perspectives not often considered in their daily work or by their colleagues. The key structure of a forum is that it is NOT a lecture, but rather a chance for opposing sides to discuss; this enables scientists to reach out to people not accustomed to academic settings.
We also discussed price structuring to improve attendance in such public engagement forums. From what the museum found in their past experience, charging people a nominal fee encouraged a higher retention rate but saw an attendance consisting of people already knowledgeable and interested in the topic such as local scientists and graduate students. Making the event free, however, saw a dramatic drop in attendance since there was nothing to disincentivize dropping out the day of the event. What is important is to find a balance between maintaining acceptable retention of attendees but also keeping the event open to all community members. This often requires grant funding to attract a crowd diverse enough to have representative opinions (i.e. running the forum as a kind of paid study).
In a future collaborative forum run by Duke iGEM, the East Chapel Hill iGEM team, and the Museum of Life and Science there are several"

Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium
Figure 23: TecMonterrey team at Rice University
On September, our school shared the information of the Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium or GCURS and as soon as we saw it, we decided to apply for a place in this prestigious event. Some faculty members of Rice University generously supported us and gave us the chance to present our project in the Symposium along the Rice University iGEM team. We learned a lot from this experience. It was a sort of a pre-Jamboree for us. The feedback that we received was extremely useful for the final steps of our project.
Characterization with Team Tec-Chihuahua
Figure 24: First personal meeting with TecChihuahua
In collaboration with team Tec-Chihuahua, we attempted to characterize a nitrate promoter, which we wanted to use in our project. They agreed to help us but we wanted to take the collaboration a little bit further. One of our team members traveled to Chihuahua and assisted with the characterization. Team Chihuahua was extremely welcoming and they gladly helped us in any way they could.
Personal Meeting with Team TecMonterrey GDL
Figure 25: Liz explaining our mathematical model to TecMonterrey GDL
During the summer break, one of our team members arranged a personal meeting with team TecMonterrey GDL. This was a very productive meeting, since our team member got to explain the mathematical model to team GDL. This allowed us to exchange feedback because they also explained their project. The comments allowed us to improve our mathematical model in ways we were not thinking of.

Collaborations
The philosophy behind our project is that we can do better things when we work together, whether that be microbes working together in a co-culture, or iGEM teams collaborating together! Here, we will outline the collaborations we've participated in this year.
 
Interlab Study
We found the interlab study particularly interesting this year because it also related to our project. In the interlab, teams aimed to reduce variations in GFP fluorescence/expression. We think this is an important goal because in our project, we are measuring one of the bacterial populations in our co-culture using GFP. Hence, we wanted to help as many teams as possible participate in the interlab study this year!
Guelph iGEM
We gifted the Guelph iGEM team with black, flat, clear-bottomed, 96 well plates so that they could complete the interlab study.
McMaster iGEM
We gave the McMaster iGEM team E. coli DH5-alpha cells so that they could meet requirement #2 for successful completion of the interlab study .
Mentoring, Brainstorming, and Troubleshooting
McMaster iGEM
We met with the McMaster iGEM team several times early in the year to discuss the different projects each of our teams were considering. We listened to each other's ideas, and provided each other with feedback.
Guelph iGEM
We first met the Guelph iGEM team last year at oGEM 2017 (a meet-up we hosted with Ontario iGEM teams). It was their first year as an iGEM team. They described the struggles and financial barriers they were facing as a new team. We have kept in touch since then. We mentored members on their team about finances this year. Jehoshua Sharma, the Guelph team's head of research, reached out to us this summer to discuss how to obtain funding for an iGEM team. We offered advice regarding:
how to pitch iGEM to department heads (as an amazing opportunity, a way to showcase the university on an international scale, etc.)

OVERVIEW
NUSGEM is delighted to have interacted with so many teams around the world! We believe that collaborations have made our project more meaningful, and we are excited to share with you about our collaborations with the following teams!
TEAM CUHK-HONG KONG: WETLAB CHARACTERIZATIONS
NUSGEM initially wanted to explore using RNA aptamers as a reporter system for our stress promoter (PhtpG1) and blue light repressible promoter. However, we faced many difficulties in constructing our aptamers reporter system and we could not get a successful construct for many months. However, we read that the Team CUHK was working on aptamers. Hence our team leader, Nanda, met up with them in Hong Kong.
Nanda (far left) with the members from CUHK iGEM team
After an exciting discussion in Lee Woo Sing College at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, both teams saw a great collaboration opportunity between us, discovering many aspects of our projects which we could collaborate in - wetlab, modelling and hardware.
Selfie on a beautiful Sunday morning!
The two teams concluded our meeting by agreeing to keep in contact, and we continued to discuss intensively on our collaboration even after Nanda returned to Singapore. Eventually, we decided to collaborate on wetlab!
As the CUHK team worked on a RNA-based project, they were urgently looking for a particular strain of E. coli, BL21 Star. It is an RNase-knockout strain that will allow them to maximize RNA production. They asked whether our lab has this E. coli strain - we do! Without any hesitation, we shipped the strain over to them.
On the other hand, NUSGEM needed help on RNA aptamers constructions. Team CUHK kindly offered their expertise by redesigning our RNA aptamer constructs, as well as designing suitable primers to increase the chances of successful construction. In addition, they incorporated the RNA aptamer that they aimed to characterise, tRNAL"

Our collaborations
In scientific research, exchanging with other research groups is crucial. This is not only to broaden one’s horizon, but also to support each other’s work with the motivation of togetherness instead of competition. To get this spirit of mutual success also to our iGEM project, we collaborated with other teams from different countries on different topics. We not only worked together on a scientific questioning with the team from Tübingen, but also on human practice projects with many different teams. We really enjoyed every one of these, as they all had a very positive outcome. Therefore, we again want to thank all of our collaboration partners!
Pathomon Collaboration
During the development process of our Games app ""Pathomon"" , we faced many minor and major problems.             But through collaboration with other teams we managed to turn at least some of them into advantages.
We always wanted the social aspect of the game to be a key feature of the application and so we decided to realize             it as a game, everybody can play during the Giant Jamboree.
As the whole game is based on the distribution of QR-codes, which you have to scan to play the game,             it was essential to us to find a place where we can put them.             At first, we thought this would be no problem and asked the convention center for permission, just to receive the answer, that there is a strict no             sticker policy around the center. Our whole idea seemed to fall apart and started to look useless, because nobody could play the game.
But we knew we still have a chance, we just had to collaborate with other teams!
We contacted almost every team and asked for their permission to attach our QR-codes to their poster in Boston.             The feedback was overwhelming and everybody who answered was willing to help and supported our idea.             What has been a workaround in the first place, turned out to be an improvement for our app and the Giant"
BNU-China,2017," a one-to-one map between the “initial” states and the equilibrium states.
\[                 (c_{m,eq}, c_{p,eq}, c_{h,eq}) = f(c_m,c_p,c_h;K_1,K_2,K_3)                 \]
Now we are ready to expound the differential equations given in the beginning.
The first equation describes the phytoextraction process. The change in the imaginary “initial” concentration of heavy metals ($c_m$) is only affected by the absorption of the plant, which is assumed to be proportional to its actual concentration in the soil ($c_{m,eq}$). $r_a$ is the absorption rate of the plant.
Similarly, the change in $c_p$ is only related to the degradation of the actual available proteins in the environment ($c_{p,eq}$) and the new proteins produced by the engineered PSB. $r_d$ is the degradation rate. In the protein production part, since FAFU designed two parts, one for surface display and one for secretion, we also have two possible terms to describe them. For display, one PSB is only able to display a fixed amount of proteins in its lifetime, therefore the main source of protein production is the reproduction of PSB, hence the $a_1\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}$ term. For secretion, PSB is constantly secreting proteins, hence the $a_1’\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}$ term. However, we only have done the simulation for the display version.
The third equation is about the change in pH. In our simulation time period, we only consider the effect of PSBs’ secreting organic acids. $r_h$ is the acid production rate, which we have taken as a constant.
The fourth equation is just the ordinary logistic growth model with a varied carrying capacity $K(c_{h,eq})$ for the PSB (whose population density is $m$) in the soil. Assuming temperature and other relevant conditions are constant, we see it as a function of acidity. It is a quadratic function with respect to $\text{pH}=-\mathrm{lg}c_{h,eq}$ obtained from fitting experimental data in the literature. It reaches its highest point $K_{max}$ at $\text{pH}=6$ i.e. $c_{h,eq}=1\times 10^{-6}$ and decreases to $0$ at $\text{pH}=2."

Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018," model maps 3D, constrained growth (within a mold). Note that early iterations of the SBR model mapped 2D, unconstrained growth; this was changed to better suit our unique use-case for the model.
Both models incorporate density but define it differently: DTU’s defines density as the concentration of individual hyphae in a given surface area, whereas SBR’s defines density as the proportion of the physical mold that is filled from the base upward.
Both models’ parameters can be fine-tuned in accordance with lab results in order to account for the use of different fungi.
The SBR model is based on the Eden Model for tumor growth; DTU’s is based on a few different approaches, including a branch-extension simulation that provides the bulk of their rationale.
Finally, taken together, the two teams’ models can form a cohesive use-case. DTU’s first model simulates fungal growth kinetics from a single spore, growing into 2 dimensions and forming the initial “plug” used to fill the mold--this is the SBR model. Finally, DTU’s second model gives the properties of the brick necessary to make the final structure. In essence, DTU's model depicts the beginning and the end of the process, and SBR's model depicts the middle.

Physical Testing
Despite our two teams being separated by almost 6000 kilometers we were able to meet up with one advisor from the DTU Team, Kyle Rothschild-Mancinelli (in the gray jacket) who stopped by the Ames Research Center to look at our progress and exchange mycelium so that we could perform testing in our respective labs. Thanks to this visit we were able to test our glue on an independently created mycelium, further validating our results. In turn our advisor also was able to visit the DTU team in Denmark and advise on any questions they had about creating a mission to outer space.
To see the results of our physical testing on DTU’s bricks as well as our own please see our physical testing page, linked here"

-----* The world language *-----
KU Leuen
As we all know, the iGEM teams are from all over the world, even if we use English to communicate, the language barrier still cannot be ignored. Based on this reason, we cooperated with Ku Leuen team in translating other countries’ team introductions into the local language (for us are Chinese). In this circumstance, Chinese teams would grab the information more clearly, and handle cooperation more effectively.
-----* A standard protocal *-----
BIT
Recently, more and more teams selected microfluidic technology and lyophilized bacteria technology, but there were no standardized guidelines. This year, from September to October, we cooperated with the BIT team, based on our own project design, in making a micro-flow control and freeze-dried bacteria protocol. Importantly, this protocol standard can be opened freely, and we are glad if other teams would provide supplements according to their experimental data. Hopefully this standard protocol will be vital to iGEM teams as much as possible. See the protocol (Chinese only now)

Tokyo Tech Meetup
August 8, 2018
During the summer, iGEM teams from across Japan attended a meetup held by Tokyo Tech University. The teams attending were KAIT, Bochan lab, Gifu University, Tokyo Tech, and ASIJ. Each team gave a presentation about the progress they had made on their project so far. Each team's presentation was wrapped up by a Q&A, where other teams were often able to give many good suggestions. After all the teams presented, we were able to further interact and follow up on various suggestions. Our team received a helpful comment from the Tokyo Tech and Gifu teams, suggesting we use of a histidine tag to simplify and speed up the protein purification process and get more accurate results.
i-GEM Pakistan Video Call
June 2018
During the summer portion of our lab work, we participated in a Skype call with a Pakistani high school iGEM team, known as LACAS Biobots. We explained our projects to each other, took virtual lab tours, and got to know another HS team and the different ways in which various teams work.
Survey to other iGEM teams
We also worked on gathering advice from other iGEM teams using SurveyMonkey. In our survey, we asked a number of questions regarding the use of genetic engineering for medical therapy. From SurveyMonkey, we were able to obtain a wide variety of insight from other countries, including Pakistan and Mexico. Most countries had similar responses, that as long as genetic engineering was not used for aesthetics and was solely used for therapy that their culture and ethics agreed with the practice.

Collaborations
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. During our project we have met many inspiring people who have helped us, some of them we have listed in Attributions . But we have saved a special place for our fellow iGEM teams who have helped us. As an iGEM team ourselves we know how little time everyone has and we are very impressed with the amount of help we received and the happenings arranged by other teams:
DTU Biobuilders
We had a fantastic workshop weekend hosted by DTU in the beginning of our project. Our team benefitted a lot from the introduction to different Synthetic Biology techniques, especially since our team is such an interdisciplinary group with a limited background in lab work. We received safety introductions, learned how to do PCR, and had our first real team experience together. DTU biobuilders have also shared their template for funding application with us. A big thank you to our friends at DTU for putting together a fun weekend and for being great teamworkers. Read more about the DTU BioBrick Workshop .
SDU iGEM
SDU helped us by having a wiki-presentation held at the DTU workshop mentioned above. SDU won for best wiki in 2013 and 2014 and hence had a many good considerations and tricks for making a wiki simple, visually soothing and efficient at the same time. See this years team and their beautiful web design
Stockholm iGEM
Uppsala iGEM
We travelled to Uppsala, Sweden to participate in the Nordic iGEM Meetup hosted by the Stockholm and Uppsala iGEM teams together. There were iGEM teams present from Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. It was a really fun weekend and we had the opportunity to practice presenting our project for the first time. We got a lot of feedback and got to spend discuss our ideas and progress with the other teams from the region. Nordic iGEM Meetup"
Peking,2018," 63 wonderful presentations and excellent posters in the following days took us on a brilliant tour of synthetic biology. We communicated, we doubted, we thought and we learned. It is our great pleasure to be a part of this year’s CCiC.
Tired, surprised, but delighted, we were given the awards fo the best presentation and the best poster, which encouraged us to try our best in the last one and a half months.

Public releases: Purdue Biomakers releases, which they send to people that are interested in their work and circulate through departments on campus to raise awareness.
What We Provided In Return
In return for the documents and feedback provided by Purdue, we provided feedback on their club's organization and structure, their internship application, their Learning Objectives and, most importantly, we provided information on the course that our faculty mentors are currently developing so that Purdue's faculty-taught course can modify and improve where they see fit.
To see the full feedback that we provided for the Purdue Biomakers, please visit Purdue's team Wiki!
How We Integrated Feedback and Materials
We took the materials from Purdue Biomakers and used them in numerous ways. Most notably, we used Purdue's Constitution as a starting platform for the creation of our own official, registered student organization at the University of Iowa. By formally recognizing our team as a student organization, we gained access to additional funding opportunities and fairs, etc. where we could showcase our work to the student body and raise awareness, thus generating interest from a greater number of students.
In early August, our faculty began the process to register and develop the first ever synthetic biology course at the University of Iowa (!!!). This was great news for the students on campus who, before now, had no opportunities to engage in the discipline. With Purdue's supplied Learning Objectives, the course plan was improved and structured in a manner that took their feedback into account.
From the internship application supplied by Purdue's iGEM team, we were able to take a look at our own methodologies for keeping students in the laboratory. This year, the majority of our students worked in the lab on a volunteer basis, which we learned may not be the standard for other teams. Though we had great participation despite now being able to pay all of our students, we would love to, in the future, have dedicated funds to provide summer stipends to the undergraduate team members.  Ultimately, these funds would have to come from sponsors at the University of Iowa or from a partnership with industry, but we look forward to the challenge. With Purdue's application structure in place, our first attempt to fund students through competitive internships (hopefully next year) should go quite smoothly.
Take-away Points
With Purdue's insights, we were able to enact the following as a first-year iGEM team:
-Our faculty developed an official lab course in synthetic biology, the first of its kind at the University of Iowa.
-We successfully developed a"

Collaborations
Collaboration is core values of iGEM, we devote ourselves to promote the knowledge of synthetic biology and to expand the impact of iGEM in China. We introduced the purpose and overview of iGEM competition the students of Guangdong Experimental High School and helped them to set up a team named GDSYZX-United for the iGEM competition. During this project, we could give some guidance to their project. We also provided some plasmids to them. And we also sent two teammates (Wang Rong and Lin Yunping) to Guangdong Experimental High School for several months to be their art and modeling advisor to help them build web page and design poster. We held a meeting to communicate about project progress and team construction, sharing experience and learning from each other.
 
 
Besides, we participated the gatherings of Central China iGEM Consortium in Peking and Canton to enhance the collaboration and interaction with other iGEM teams in China."

4.Ocean University of China : OUC-China
In the information era, it is almost impossible to achieve success through one’s personal effort, and synthetic             biology is without exception. To make our software better meet the requirement of synthetic biologists, we collaborate             with OCU-China.
We exchanged a lot of information. We consulted OUC about parts and biobricks, such as the difference between parts and biobricks. They also helped test our system and gave some suggestions. We gave them some teams that were considered similar to them according to our system and they gave us the feedback.What's more, they helped us test our software, too.
5.Lanzhou University : Lanzhou
We helped Lanzhou University with human practice project. They sent a questionnaire, titled “Present Situation             of iGEM Teams in Chinese Colleges and Universities”, and we provided information for them through a video meeting.             For more detailed information, you can visit Human Practice page of team Lanzhou.
Lanzhou University helped test our system and gave us many valuable suggestions, according to which we improved             our system.
6.Xiamen University : XMU
Xiamen University team tested our system and gave some detailed suggestions about our system. They expressed             appreciation for the fine-looking exterior as well as the pictures of the system. They also thought the information             we provided was of positive reference value to them and the function of designing gene chains was really convenient.
7.Nankai University : NKU
Team NKU tested our system and gave us valuable opinions. They affirmed the practicality and convenience of our             system and put forward some suggestions at the same time. They suggested adding a translate feature, putting             some of the basic information out of the local dialect with the Google translation interface to make our system             more user-friendly.
8. Technische Universitaet Darmstadt : TU_Darmstadt
It is really pleased to have TU Darmstadt test our software. As a wet team, they searched for teams similar to             themselves and get satisfied results. But they also pointed out that there were teams whose information was not             complete.
Furthermore, they used the “Project” function of our software. Some bugs were pointed out by them and they also             gave positive remarks about our idea and the other parts of the system.

Collaboration with Macquarie University
We assisted team Macquarie by making a graphical user interface (GUI) on MatLab. The GUI that was made is a graph which shows how the concentration of various intermediates including ALA (on the Y-axis) changes over time (X-axis) in chlorophyll. Team Macquarie provided a list of specifications for the interactive graph they wanted. These specifications include:
1. Creating an interactive display that plots the Chlorophyll concentration as a function of time.
2. Increase or decrease the time duration with the help of a slider.
3. The maximum duration of time should be 16 days.
4. Users should be able to zoom in and out of plot.
The GUI was created using Matlab’s built in app, GUIDE (GUI development environment). GUIDE was ideal for this problem as it allowed for complete customisation of the of the interactive graph according to the specifications of team Macquarie.
The GUIDE interface allows the programmer to easily place plots, sliders, texts and buttons, amongst other handles, in the exact position that is needed. Figure 1 shows the GUIDE interface as well as the layout that was designed for Macquarie according to their team’s specifications. These included allowing the user to enter the initial total enzyme concentration as well as the ALA concentration. The user can also set the number of days using the slider. The plot is then generated automatically upon each input.

Bacterial overcrowding
During the European meetup in Münich we spoke with iGEM Düsseldorf about how we want to make a living material. They recognized the problem of bacterial overcrowding within our construct. Since our bacteria will keep dividing and cannot escape the hydrogel, at some point bacteria will be over-saturated which can lead to problems in protein expression. They offered to help us, and we had a meeting with them over skype. They were making a construct that uses the Lux Quorum sensing. Their construct contained 3 plasmids: Luxl (synthase for AHL), LuxR (molecule where AHL binds and can then bind to promotor) and pLux (promotor to which LuxR +AHL can bind). When the promoter gets activated, a phage lysis gene will the synthesized. In our case they offered to send us the plasmids without the Luxl in the construct, so when we add AHL to the hydrogel medium, cell growth will be inhibited. This is a great solution to keep our bacteria in control, as we want them to stay in steady numbers within our hydrogel, with steady lysostaphin production.

Biotechnology Conference in Brussels
The UCLouvain iGEM team organized a biotechnology conference on the 28th of September. This meetup existed of 2 parts. First there was a debate on the legal frame for applied research project, especially in the antimicriobial resistance, which is very relevant for our project. The second part was the conference in which three speakers that talked about biotechnology. On top of that we also got to show our project with a pitch in the European parliament!
Collaboration Interlab Marburg
iGEM Marburg from Germany also contacted us to collaborate. They developed their own version of the iGEM Interlab Study 2018 using Vibrio natriegens bacteria instead of E. coli along with electroporation instead of heatshock. When we agreed to participate in the study, they sent us the required chemicals, bacteria and protocol.
Their protocol started with making some high OD600 stocks of V. natriegens with an OD600 of 16 by washing and centrifuging. This was necessary to remove as much salt as possible to prepare for the electroporation. After that the protocol would exactly follow"

Exeter iGEM
After speaking to Exeter at the UK iGEM Meetup we arranged a collaboration. Initially, we had multiple ideas of how to collaborate, involving using some specialised equipment we had access to at Cardiff University. However, in the end we arranged an experiment to validate the hypothesis that they are working on for their project. They were interested in testing the use of UV as a bactericide, as a way to ensure the biosafety of their filter model.
Exeter sent us a  protocol, which we followed. We showed that UV treatment reduced bacterial growth and therefore that UV acts as an effective bactericide. However surprisingly we found that the shortest time of UV treatment (1 minute) was sufficient to reduce bacterial growth by greater than 90%. However extending the treatment time up to 20minutes did not further reduce the amounts of bacterial growth. They have published this data on their own wiki .
Valencia UPV
Valencia UPV contacted us as both teams were working on similar expression systems, using tobacco plants. We began by setting up meetings over Skype to discuss our projects and begin to understand ways we could collaborate. We began discussing the different promoters both teams were trying to synthesise, and agreed that we could validate the promoter in one another’s expression system to confirm its function. However, due to time constraints we were unable to complete the experiment to test Valencia’s PR1:Luc+:NosT construct, which they had created and sent to us. We also encountered issues generating our WRKY:Luc+:NosT construct that we had aimed to send to Valencia, meaning we could not complete the collaboration.
However speaking to Valencia UPV iGEM’s team proved very useful, as their host lab has a lot of experience using plant expression systems and we are using this system for the very first time in Cardiff.  Therefore during our discussions with them we were able to understand where some of our experiments may have been going wrong.

Helping other teams
Collaborations between teams is the very foundation of iGEM, and this year the Uppsala team partook in three major collaborations. Firstly, we arranged and hosted the very first Nordic iGEM conference together with the Stockholm iGEM team. In this project, planning, innovation and physical work was done in total collaboration. Secondly, we assisted the Chennai team in the start-up of their very first iGEM project. Planning an entire iGEM project is hard enough as it is, and to do it without any previous knowledge of the completion is even trickier. As such we provided Chennai with all the help we could give. Lastly we had a survey collaboration with SDU Denmark regarding the use of antibodies in iGEM.
Apart from these major collaborations, we also assisted several teams by answering surveys and providing them with previous years Uppsala biobricks not present in the distribution kit. Among the most popular were the famous Uppsala chromo proteins that were shipped to both Australia and Taiwan.

INTRODUCTION
Collaborations between research teams are one of the main bases of today’s scientific world. On several occasions teams obtain precious data with the cooperation of other groups that otherwise would be almost unlikely to get. Thus they will be able to solve certain difficulties as well as help in global research.
Therefore we determined to contact with several teams in order to help them with their projects, just as to contribute spreading SynBio, and complementing also our project making it even better.
CARDIFF WALES
Cardiff team is moving several stimuli-induced plant promoters to Phytobricks standard. After an skype video conference, we decided to send them our pathogen inducible promoter with luciferase reporter (Pr-1a:Luciferase:Tnos). Since both teams use GoldenBraid system assembly, modularity and standardization is guarantee.
COLOGNE-DUESSELDORF
As part of their postcard exchange, we designed and sent them a postcard about ChatterPlant to deliver them to the rest of the teams who took part on this exchange. Later we received a package with several postcards of many different teams. They are all amazing! They also helped us by sending us the regulation about transgenics in Germany, which will help us in our human practices.
UCHILE BIOTEC
As we share the same native language, we ask them to take part in iGEM connecta, our YouTube channel in which we pretend expand Synbio knowledge among spanish-speaking countries. With this, they had the chance to publish a video explaining their current project so they could promote it. On the other hand, they helped us by generating new content which will be very useful to spread SynBio knowledge"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018," at our laboratories and daily workspace. We strongly believe that such an event might become a pattern for the future collaborations.
iGEM Teams Worldwide
Many people and organisations are trying to reach the general public on social media by posting on Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook or Instagram. Our team is not an exception and we also have those accounts. But one of the most entertaining experience was to be a part of project @igem.teams.worldwide on Instagram, created by team Toulouse INSA-UPS. The main idea of the project is that various iGEM teams can manage this Instagram account for a week and introduce themselves by showing their casual life, laboratory issues and everything they imagine. We also had such an opportunity from 9th to 15th, July and it was a pleasure to share some brilliant daily routine moments, receive supportive comments about SynDrop project, gain more followers on our own Instagram account, and present Lithuania at once. It was not only an entertainment or a possibility to familiarize ourselves with other teams and their projects, but it has also induced our creativity in order to present ourselves differently.
iGEM goes green Survey
Last year team TU Dresden 2017 initiated the project “iGEM goes green” intended to share the ecological improvements of their work. This year the team didn‘t take part in iGEM but team METU_HS_Ankara was so impressed by this idea that they decided to continue the project this year. After agreement and permissions from team TU Dresden were given, team METU_HS_Ankara has sent a Lab Poster and “iGEM Goes Green Guide” to us which were placed in our laboratory. Also they asked to enter our data on GHG Emissions Calculator, as well as share it in Lithuania widely. That helped us to turn our community’s attention to the environmental impact of a daily working routine and share eco-friendly thoughts in Lithuania too. For more information about the movement visit team METU_HS_Ankara page.                  https://2018.igem.org/Team:METU_HS_Ankara
Exchanging self-designed postcards
In June we received an invitation from team Duesseldorf to exchange self-designed postcards between iGEM teams. The idea was to bring synthetic biology closer to general public by sharing other teams‘ postcards in our neighborhood and events. We had to send 100 postcards to Dusseldorf with the image on the front and a small piece of text on the back describing the idea of our project. As you may presuppose, we designed a liposome with the Iron Wolf, the main symbol of"
Pasteur_Paris,2015," create together. We imagine that someone will post an idea of project and interested teams would be able to be put in touch with them. « Forum » It could also be interesting to create a page where the general public and people interested in iGEM could interact. It would be a way to promote iGEM among non-scientifics.

Cloning guide
iGEM TU Eindhoven started to make a cloning guide for new iGEM teams to be able to make a clear choice on what cloning method to use. For this guide iGEM TU Eindhoven was looking for different teams who are working with one of the following cloning methods:
Classical Cloning.
Biobricking.
Rapid DNA prototyping.
3A assembly.
Golden Gate Assembly.
Gateway Cloning technology.
TA cloning/ TOPO TA cloning.
In-Fusion.
Ligation independent cloning.
Di or Multi cistronic cloning.
iGEM Pasteur took part in writing this cloning guide in collaboration with TU Eindhoven. We explained the principle of the Gibson Assembly, our design and our experiences with this technic, the materials we used. You can find our report at page 33 of the guide!
Feel free to browse through the cloning guide.
Newsletter for iGEM Competition
The Newsletter for iGEM Competition is being published for the second year in a row. This year, it is the result of a collaboration between our team, iGEM Amoy and iGEM Paris_Bettencourt. 52 teams all around the world introduced their programs, shared details of experiments, asked for help, and replied to requirements from counterparts. Seven issues are published this year, among which are three special issues. iGEM Pasteur wrote articles in the issues n°2, 5 and 7. The topics are:
Issue 1: How to set up and operate an iGEM team (special issue).
Issue 2: Project Introduction and Ethical Discussions.
Issue 3: Projects of the different teams.
Issue 4: Current situation of synthetic biology in different countries (special issue).

Ethics for Synthetic Biology
""The iGEM team BIOSINT"
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2016," help. Based on the model in the paper and requisitions acquired through the communication with their team leader, we accomplished a mathematical model instruction for them in which contains the details of the model they need and waits them to adjust according to their specific experiment conditions and sent it to their team leader. He accepted our idea and thanked us warmly.
Here are some key idea in the model:
We set the tissue into control volume which conduct heat to each other:
Based on Bioheat-transfer equation:
We can get the following equation:
With the equation where n represent successive time steps of size Δt and (i,j) represent the location of the control volume,combined with certain boundary conditions,we can do numerical simulation  to get the temperature distribution corresponding to time and location of the control volume in tissue after heating.[1]
We sincerely hope the igem team of Tongji University can conquer many problems they met and present a well-squared project which may promote the development of tumor hyperthermia to some extent.
Collaboration with Shanghai Tech University
This year is the first year of ShanghaiTech University to attend IGem competition. The communication between two teams began at the beginning of 2016 when some of their team members got in touch with our team leader and asked for advice on many aspects through Wechat. However, online communication is more or less obscure and inconvenient, therefore we decided to invite them to our university to help them deal with the problems they are encountering face to face.
The first problem is how to recruit team members. In the meeting, we introduced our way to them that is firstly holding up a training camp on biology knowledge and skills of consulting literature, after which we would have a test and an interview to ascertain our team members. Our way may of significance to their recruiting mechanism to some extent in the future.
The next problem is how to originate a novel idea. To inspire them, we showed them our summary of previous iGem projects done in the winter holiday and shared our view on many projects we adored. After that, we shared views on the categories of the projects we may further investigate and frankly speaking, we both broadened our horizons from each other.
Besides, they consulted us of the time arrangements in the remaining time up to Octorber. Firstly, we interpreted the rules of iGem to them and reminded them many dues in the schedule of the competition and told them to keep an eye on the notice on the web in case miss many important submissions and affect their performance. Secondly, we made a rough time plan according to our previous experience.
In the end, we shared many ideas with them on how to"

There are several iGEM teams in Japan, and as ‘iGEM JAPAN’, we collaborated with 'iGEM JAPAN Kansai Forum' and ' May Festival' written below. We also collaborated with many other teams inside Japan, and also with many teams in the world
＜iGEM JAPAN Kansai Forum＞
On February 19th, we visited University of Kyoto and participated on a meeting event ‘iGEM Japan Kansai Forum’. iGEM Nagahama team , iGEM Gifu team , iGEM Kobe team , iGEM Kyoto team , KAIT team , iGEM Hokkaido team ,and Botchan Lab Tokyo team gathered in Kyoto. In February, we haven’t decided the theme of the project yet, and had several ideas of the project. So, we presented our 4 ideas and got feedbacks and opinions on each idea in details. We also exchanged opinions not only on projects and experiments but also on team managing and activities. Since it was the first year for our university to participate in iGEM competition, all of the teams above helped us setting up our team. We also conducted a survey and asked  iGEM teams above the questions about what abilities we can get and how this experience be used in the future by participating on iGEM competition.
＜Collaboration with iGEM Nagahama＞
We collaborated with iGEM Nagahama , one of the teams in Japan. We got advice and hints of participating in iGEM as private university from iGEM Nagahama team, since we are both private universities, such as how to setting up funds, how to work on iGEM in the universities, and so on.  Because it was our fisrt time to participate, they also taught us how to write wiki. On the other hand, we helped iGEM Nagahama team as well. We advised about cloud funding, especially which website to use,"

Description:
"" Bacteria is a vital decomposer in our everyday lives. It decomposes and recycles things that can be reused in the nature. Our team came to think that this beneficial bacterium might be a solution to the problem regarding increasing trash in the Earth. Of all projects attempting to solve trash problems, research about plastic degrading bacteria is the most popular. However, our team felt that the research has not been efficient enough and fast enough to solve the fundamental problem. Through this research, as a student, we hope to dedicate to what our society is facing.                                                 The fundamental purpose of the research is to generate a more efficient and fast plastic degrading process through the plastic degrading bacteria and make plastic bacteria practically usable. The current bacteria are slow in degrading speed and low in degrading quantity, so our research hopes to find better solution for efficiency.""
KoreaSonyeod is a high school team working also on degradation of plastic. Due to the fact that our team is really concerned about the accumulation of plastic waste, we ventured to help other iGEM teams that also working to solve this problem. Therefore, we contacted team KoreaSonyeod and offered them our help. KoreaSonyeod team focused on PET degradation using a  different enzyme than ours. In their project, the monomers of PET bonds are broken by PETase and MHETase leading to the same two products as in our project - Terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol. As we developed TPA detection protocol, we helped KoreaSonyeod team how to detect TPA, by providing our protocol and mentoring them how to use it property.                                         We also noticed that other groups working with the same enzymes as KoreaSonyeod team. Therefore, we offered KoreaSonyeod to makes rational mutations in order to stabilize the"

BioBrick tutorial, Danish Technical University
The 10th-12th of March 2017, the iGEM-team from DTU arranged the BioBrick Tutorial for the Scandinavian teams , with the intention of lecturing the different teams on the BioBrick-standard, assembly of biological systems, coaching in techniques for presentation and project pitching, as well as socializing and networking. We had a delegation of three team members join for this conference; from this we were able to teach the basics of biobrick-assembly to team members with no background in bioscience, practice presentation techniques, and go to know friends and future collaborators from the different Scandinavian teams.
Online ethics Discussion, Uppsala
iGEM Uppsala organized a set of online discussions on the topic of synthetic biology and bioengineering between several different teams. On the 11th of August 2017, two members of our team participated in one such discussion on the topics of uncontrolled release of our biological system as well as potential misuse of our project. Along with the other teams, we attempted to answer those questions to the best of our ability, and it was refreshing and interesting to hear the thoughts of other teams with different projects on the subjects
Collaboration with NTNU
There are two iGEM-teams in Norway; UiO and NTNU. Because of this, it is quite natural for us to be collaborating and communicating together, and on the 1st-3rd of September, we traveled to Trondheim to meet the other team. This meet-up had three main purposes: networking, setting up a future laboratory collaboration between the teams, and holding mock presentations for both teams and be able to get feedback. As one of the main supervisors of the NTNU iGEM team is a former iGEM judge, both teams were able to get solid feedback on the contents, structure and technique of their oral presentations. There was also socialization and an agreement to collaborate on the labwork further. Overall a great weekend!
As a laboratory collaboration, we tested two of the plasmids in the system NTNU used; pLA230 and MP6 ( BBa_K2265000 ), as part of our laboratory collaboration."

Tongji_China,2017," iGEM has been in China for ten years, and many of the first iGEM contestants have become excellent synthetic biologists. Some of them came to the conference to share their iGEM and scientific research experience. CCiC Organizing Committee set up speeches, posters exhibitions, academic salons, panel sessions and other different activities, the atmosphere is really great. Here we also had the opportunity to talk face to face with King L. Chow and Kenneth Oye from the iGEM Headquaters. At the meeting we showcased our project: Ignis Fly, and shared not only just our project itself, but the opinions about SynBio and biology researches with the other teams.
What an amazing experience!
2nd Open Night Live
The 2nd Open Night Live also called Tongji iGEM x Fablab Shanghai Open Night. It was held to showcase the iGEM teams in Shanghai and to give people an opportunity to exchange ideas with different iGEM team members. It has been an honor for us to invite Fudan, Fudan_China, Shanghaitech, STJU_BioX_Shanghai and ECUST to our Open Night Live.
We were delighted to find out that there were many college students watching and expressing views. Some of them also made a few suggestions on what more our project could do, and we added the parts we thought were reasonable. There was a symposium among iGEM teams after the Open Night Live where we exchanged ideas. We also set up a live webcast and gave Open Night Live to iGEM teams in other areas. It's really an unforgettable experience that we meet members of other iGEM team directly and interact together with more iGEM teams on the internet!

TU_Darmstadt,2017,", we learned that even small things can make a difference. Even when we were not actively searching for these changes, the thought of iGEM goes green was always in the back of our minds.
When TU Dresden reached out to teams and asked them to create a short sequence for a video on iGEM goes green, a couple of our members took it upon themselves to participate, and went to work. The filming of the short clip was a lot of fun, and made us rethink why we wanted to create a more environmentally friendly lab space in the first place.
We want to thank TU Dresden for the great amount of work they poured into creating iGEM goes green, and for trying to bring this amazing cause into the forefront of people's minds. For us, it was a great way to learn how to think more about how we act in and out of the lab, and about what we can do to help our planet in the long run.
We are also very much looking forward to seeing the finished iGEM goes green video at the Giant Jamboree!
Collaboration with Berlin diagnostX
Next to our work in synthetic biology, we also set ourselves the challenging task of developing a hydrogel. Since these hydrogels are supposed to be used on wounds, we needed to learn more about wound care and healing. We also focused on researching which effects the hydrogels would generally have. So, we got in touch with the iGEM-Team from Berlin . We believed since most of their team is made up of medical students, they could help us with our questions. On top of this, Team Berlin also is in contact with some experts at their university.
In our first meeting, we talked about our project and what we are planning to do with our hydrogel. Our detection system for wound infections was also a topic we brought up. In this meeting, we decided to hold a web seminar via Skype so they could help us with our questions. For this, the Berlin team prepared a presentation based on our questions and also consulted a dermatologist for research into the topic.
In the following seminar we learned a lot about different wound types, wound healing and wound care, especially in regards to hydrogels. We learned about applications for hydrogels on burns and diabetes wounds, because their moist setting supports wound healing.
The Berlin iGEM team gave us great information about what we need to consider for the development of a chitosan-hydrogel. We learned which pH-value supports wound healing best and which substances are currently used to treat burns. They also gave us helpful feedback about our ideas"

iGEM NTU Singapore
WHAT WE DO?
ModVision and Finding Diphthy has found their way to do collaboration in iGEM 2018. We have managed to contact one of the members of iGEM NTU via Angelysia Cardilla in the beginning of July. We offered help in gathering data about the idea and survey application of Nanopore sequencing from the perspective of Indonesian people as representatives of developing country’s citizens. Our team went to Faculty of Engineering, exactly located at college auditorium, to do intensive proposal towards nearby biotech students to be intrigued with our project about Finding Diphthy, as well as ModVision. QnA sessions and survey filling form were available for the end of each introductory explanation. This session was such a participative event between NTU and UI, since different citizens have vast range of opinion regarding biological engineering. Profound discussion in several aspects, such as socioeconomic condition, law, bioethics, etc., of ModVision and Finding Diphthy development could offer insights about their application in countries, especially developing ones. In addition, we also analyzed the result we obtained for NTU and the analysis can be seen here
Figure 1. Our team presents projects of Finding Diphthy and ModVision in collaboration within iGEM 2018 for silver medal criteria. Discussion and surveys were done by our policy and practice division member iGEM UI Ainun Rahmania and Glory Lamria.
WHAT WE ASK?
After two months of lab session starting from June, we encountered such unexpected bad events in doing PCR amplification of the HT-1 and HT-2 fragments. These fragments are meant to be ligated linearly to form single basic biobrick part of HB-EGF/Tar since IDTTM were not able to synthesize as one gBlocks. The cloning primer Fwd and Rev (personally synthesized primer) and for amplification fail to specifically anneal in the 5’ and 3’ of both fragments. The results of the PCR amplification are shown in following figure 2.

NAU-CHINA,2018,", as well as new topics for this year's iGEM team.
The gifts of this event not only have the ""transport RNA"" keychain designed by our iGEM team, but also the cooperation support of synthetic biology comics designed by OUC . Many students have come to look up and ask.
Peking
Peking University provided our laboratory with the plasmid we needed.
HZAU-China
HZAU-China has designed the OmpA-RGD protein to achieve this goal because of the need to enhance the targeting of engineered Salmonella they use. RGD is a well-studied tumor homing tripeptide that specifically binds to αvβ3 (αvβ3) integrin, which is widely overexpressed on cancer cells. So there is a cell line called MDA-MB-231 that shows the αvβ3 needed for their further targeting and safety experiments. So we helped them contact the channel from the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology to get the cell line.
CPU_CHINA
Based on the problems encountered in the advancement of the previous issues, we developed an APP in order to solve the problem of communication between the teams on the subject, real-time understanding of the dynamics of each team, and seeking help.
The following is an introduction to our app:
We developed iGEMCloud to solve some of iGEM's current problems, with immediacy, openness and interactivity. Currently, information about iGEM comes from many websites. They are scattered, chaotic, and unfriendly to individual users. So we created this app (until now, it is based on android, we hope to launch iOS version in the future), we hope it is an information collection platform, receiving the latest information of iGEM, this is a microblog user who allows everyone to personally or The form of the team is involved in the discussion and the community built for iGEMer around the world.
In order to better get feedback from our app and improve accordingly to make it more suitable for team use, our ideas are more perfect. We contacted China Pharmaceutical University to help us test the software.
They help us fix the software by sending post updates and more.
Based on the posts they sent, we conducted another software fix upgrade.
China Pharmaceutical University gave us affirmation and help, and put forward corresponding opinions on the user's feelings, etc., not only give us encouragement, but also let us have a direction for the improvement of APP in the future.

As NUSGEM has also constructed the lpp-aptamers, we asked for their help to measure the fluorescence intensity of iSpinach-D5 under different assay temperatures. It is found that iSpinach-D5 is brighter and more temperature-resistant than the previous biobrick, Spinach2.1 .
Microplate Reader Results of the biobrick characterization
Lastly, NUSGEM helped spreading our survey regarding influenza-flu differentiation for gathering responses in Singapore.
Cooperation with team Uchile
Both our team and team Uchile are trying to make use of aptamer to simplify the detection process. Thus we get in touch with each other to discuss our common problems and give feedback to each other.
Team Uchile
Team Hong_Kong CUHK’s feedback for team Uchile:
Maybe in the presentation you could give more details on why you choose to detect this toxin instead of other toxin?
For the project, have you compared your accuracy with the current widely-used method?
In the results part, could you put some labels on the rows and columns on your results page because we are a little confused about what is inside the samples.
For the hardware part, we are still quite unclear about the design of your hardware, would you mind offering some further details on that?
Team Uchile’s feedback for team Hong_Kong-CUHK
biosecurity: Will tracer  be reusable? is it possible that with the misuse of the hardware, contamination can be generated?  How will you proceed in case the hardware is discarded?
Answer: Tracer is reusable and contamination will not be generated if people follow the user guide.Tracer is intended for the general public,  if people are diagnosed with influenza, then we will suggest the user to give Tracer to the local hospital/clinic to disinfect before it is reused.
In the results part, could you put some labels on the rows and columns on your results page because we are a little confused about what is inside the samples.
Answer: The refractive index of PLA is as low as 3%, which can prevent the diagnostics results from the influence of the outside environment. Moreover, with a melting point of around 160 °C, PLA provides great heat stability. Also, PLA is an environmentally-friendly material as it is biodegradable.
The proteins of the influenza present variable proteins. You have to be constantly making new vaccines. with his method it is said that it is easy to produce new sequences but will it be on the same level with the mutation rate?

They also helped us with troubleshooting our overlap extension PCR.
All India iGEM Meetup: IISc-Bangalore
This year, the IISc-Bangalore iGEM team organised the All-India iGEM meetup where six other teams from the country participated and discussed their projects. Team ICT-Mumbai was one of the them. We presented our project along with the other teams and gained valuable feedback and insights from them. Furthermore, we got to make many new friends too! It was a commendable effort by Team IISc-Bangalore.
Healthy Recipe: iGEM HAFS
Team HAFS is working towards finding optimal solution to diabetes. As a collaboration activity, they expected to collect healthy recipes from all around the world. ICT-Mumbai participated in this activity. We shared the recipe of 'Beetroot Raita', which is very commonly prepared in Maharashtrian households. The main ingredient, 'beetroot, has been found to have many health benefits such as lowering blood sugar, detoxification to name a few. This very easy to make, and very tasty at the same time, recipe was an excellent contribution to the healthy recipe initiative of iGEM team HAFS.

We helped Lambert high school with several activities throughout the semester. First, we helped them with the completion of their interlab. High schools do not have access to plate reader technology, so inviting them to UGA and conducting their interlab with them allowed them to partake in this activity.
We also went to teach at a summer camp for middle school students about synthetic biology concepts, ranging from basic biotech procedures to biology lessons regarding the central dogma. We also shared experiences and advice with the students, both from Lambert and those attending the camp, about our experiences with college life/research.
Finally, we helped test their in-house made electroporator, testing their product and recording plate reader data for the GFP construct they transformed.

Skype with iGEM Lund - October 3, 2017 - We were excited to Skype with Lund’s iGEM Team. We specifically talked a lot about our experiences at last year’s iGEM and loved hearing about their creative and extensive human practices. Lund also had questions about how an iGEM team that does not turn over every year, as many do, functions and the benefits and detractions of doing that.
Missouri S&T Regional Meetup - August 12, 2017 - We enjoyed hosting a mini-regional meetup when Washington University in St. Louis’ iGEM Team traveled to our campus. Both of our teams had the chance to present our projects and discuss how our projects would be continuing as we approached Jamboree. We also chatted about their experience with Integrated Human Practices and how we may improve as a team in the future. Our team and advisor also gave our advice on how to transform plants, though it was also new to our team."

Smaller collaborations
In addition to the bigger collaborations we also Skyped with UPMC-Paris and UPS-INSA Toulouse , as well as distributed and answered the surveys by CCU Taiwan and iGEM IONIS-PARIS . We also gave our Finnish video with English subtitles about synthetic biology to team Tübingen’s YouTube channel, which we found from the iGEM collaborations. This gave more views for our video and helped to spread knowledge about synthetic biology while also giving more content to a fellow iGEM team’s YouTube channel. The channel and our video can be found here .
The Purdue University team approached us through email, as the previous Aalto-Helsinki team (2016) had built a very cool and trendy wiki page, and they wanted to do something similar! We directed them to some of the internet’s best resources to get started with web development and shared with them some code from the previous team, in order to highlight features that they wanted to implement.

Who We Helped
University of Ottawa
We collaborated with the uOttawa iGEM team to design, implement, and analyze an ODE model of a genetic switch to determine under what conditions we could achieve tristability. We produced phase plane diagrams over a wide range of parameters to show their design was possible. This was a continuation of our cooperation with uOttawa from last year in their search for tristability. You can go to their wiki page and click “Modeling” in the sidebar to view their modelling work.
Aalto-Helsinki
We provided bulk data from the 2014 teams for Aalto-Helsinki's Team Seeker software tool to better search abstracts from all 2014 iGEM teams. We also provided information for the team's Collab Seeker tool.
Tec-Monterrey
We provided three plasmids to the Tec-Monterrey team from our 2014 project . The first plasmid contained DsRed, ermM, Amp, oriV (S. aureus) + oriV (E. coli), the second had oriT-Nes, and the third had the trs region.
Surveys completed and shared
We were asked to fill out and share a number of surveys, and did so for the following teams: University of Indonesia , IIT Kharagpur , Paris-Saclay and University College London .
Who Helped Us
University of Ottawa
We had some trouble with assembling some of our plant constructs, and the uOttawa team stepped in and helped us out. They assembled most of our B-set pCAMBIA plasmid [insert link] for us using yeast. From here we used Gibson Assembly to add our B2 target to complete the plasmid.

Collaborations
Being the first and the only iGEM team from Pakistan, we found the collaborative aspect of iGEM to be very effective. Many teams were willing to guide us through iGEM, and we shared the experiences and insights we had developed by being the country's first iGEMers. The truly international nature of iGEM made it possible to cross cultural and geographical borders, and made science an ambassador in international relations. Even though the constraints of time and experience made it somewhat difficult for us to offer acute technical help, we were extremely eager to help out in any way we possibly could.
User testing Team IIT Madras's Codonut App
IIT Madras built a mobile app Codonut to explain codon optimization in a fun and interactive way. In order to further improve this app, we tested it out ourselves and also shared it with our numerous followers on social media to get quality feedback for IIT Madras. Our feedback consisted of:
Advice about the educational aspect of the game and how they could make it more explanatory about DNA, ribosomes and codon optimization.
Feedback about some aspects of gameplay, that included instructions, color optimizations, reactions and more.
Attention to a typo and some design elements.
We compiled all of our feedback into a report complete with relevant screenshots of the game. This was appreciated by IIT Madras as it helped them understand the end-user's experience. Given the political tension between our two countries, this was a very unique interaction that not only enabled us to bridge divides and share science across borders, but also laid the groundwork for long and lasting relationships for the future.
Support in surveying for Team NCTU Formosa
An iGEM team from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan worked on farmer friendly project that tried to reduce the use of dangerous chemical pesticides. Realizing the importance of public awareness and to promote the acceptance of genetic engineering as an alternative tool, we disseminated their survey that explained the dangers"

The New iGEM team- TCFSH
     Since April 14th, NCTU_Formosa started to introduce experiments which are related to iGEM to the science-gifted class of Taichung First Senior High School(TCFSH). Gradually, the background knowledge of synthetic biology was adequate, then the cogitation of combination to engineering and biology was shared, the core of the gene regulation, the design of biobricks was taught. Also, we introduce previous projects from NCTU_Formosa, hope to give them the prospect of the competition.
     In the last semester, the instructor of NCTU_Formosa, Pro. Wen-Liang Chen invited the gifted students from TCFSH who decided to learn about biology to our lab. NCTU_Formosa then gave them a series"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,"GEMers and get a first impression on how the Giant Jamboree will be. The presentations of the other teams’ projects were incredibly interesting and gave us new inspiring ideas for our own project. It was nice to meet people from all over Europe and especially to reunion with our friends from the German teams we had already met at the German iGEM Meetup.
Figure 6 : Poster session at the European meetup.
Music video
Early in the iGEM year, the iGEM team TecCAM from Mexico contacted us to propose an idea for a video collaboration, in which different iGEM teams from all over the world would perform to a certain song. We thought about this as a great possibility to draw interest to science and to reach many people showing the funny sides of science and laboratory work. We had so much fun thinking about droll moves including in the scenes and it was hilarious filming these scenes in our laboratory.
KAIT_JAPAN
In September 25, we skyped with the iGEM Team KAIT_Japan . We noticed that both our teams had a strong focus on outreach and that they had a lot of questions regarding our Dual Use Research of Concern outreach. We sent them our survey and they presented our results at their university. It was highly interesting for us to share our results and experiences worldwide and to hear about their experience regarding Dual Use Research of Concern in research and education. Thank you for your openness towards this topic and for your feedback!

Athens
We also shared our slide-show about Dual Use Research of Concern with the iGEM team Athens 2018 and informed them on these topics in the context of science. After our discussion they shared our important topic by showing our slides at the Molecular Virology Laboratory of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute, where they conduct their experiments.
Open Source Presentation Slides about Dual Use and Research of Concern
We want to make it easier for lecturers to integrate Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern issues into their lecture and courses. That is why we prepared a concise set of slides with further explanations and instructions in the presentation notes. We started to spread them all over the world and want to thank all the teams who used our slides:

Overview
iGEM is a competition but science by its nature is a collaborative endeavour. Over the summer we were in contact with several other iGEM teams. We also attended a UK meet of teams to present the progress of our project.
Key Achievements
Attended and presented at YSB2.0
Had a Skype meeting with UCLA and set up a collaboration
Contacted by Stanford-Brown-Spelman and exchanged protocols
Created a model for the London BioHackspace iGEM team
YSB 2.0
We participated in the second YSB conference sponsored by the Wellcome Trust and UCL. It was a great opportunity to meet up with some of the British teams and SDU-Denmark as well as make some new friends. All the teams presented the progress of their projects so far as well as displaying a poster. It was excellent practice for Boston, given that there are no Regionals this year.

IISc_Bangalore,2016," processing, i.e., removing Ag43 by using metal affinity chromatography affect the net cost of protein production using the cellfifuge sysem?
d. (Problem) Are any proteins known to associate (chemically) strongly with Ag43? This question has significant impact on the diversity of proteins to which cellfifuge can be applied, if certain proteins of interest associate rather strongly with Ag43, some fraction of it will be removed with the Ag43, reducing yield.
e. (Problem,  Offshoot) Is it possible and if so, how can this system be implemented in gram positive bacteria and eukaryotes? This is of special importance if cellfifuge is to be applied to produce proteins with post-translational modifications.
f. (Suggestion) The arrangement of the cells in a cluster (aggregated because of Ag43 expression) is a factor that needs to be taken into consideration while calculating the drag force on the cluster and as a result, will affect the sedimentation coefficient of the cluster (the ”rate” at which the cluster settles down). This parameter was included as a part of our model of Ag43 sedimentation because of an SVCE faculty’s opinion.
Some of the issues we raised during the meet about the other team’s ideas:
The afternoon session consisted primarily of a discussion on troubleshooting protocols such as 3A assembly, more specifically, verifying restriction digestion, eliminating self-ligated products etc. Troubleshooting protocols – inputs from our iGEM team towards the SVCE team:
a. Ampicillin plates should be incubated only for ~16 hours (degradation of Amp, appearance of satellite colonies after that point). Working on a plasmid with a Chloramphenicol resistance in the backbone is preferable to Ampicillin.
b. Verifying Restriction Digestions before 3A assembly: Gel electrophoresis results were inconclusive - one of the digested fragments was only 100bp smaller than the undigested fragment and the resolution using normal sized gels and ladders was not sufficient to see this difference clearly; also, the 100bp fragment expected was not seen.
We suggested running the gel for a very short period of time (~15 minutes) as the 100bp fragment may have been run out of the gel due to the passage of current for a long time.
A PCR with appropriate primers (anneals to regions on both sides of the restriction site, cannot anneal at the annealing temperature after digestion due to a shorter region of annealing with each digested fragment compared to the undigested fragment)  was also"

Overview
    We collaborated with many other iGEM teams during the course of our project. We have built good friendships and keep communication with many teams such as BIT-China, NWU-China, TUST-China, ECUST… In addition, we helped each other to analyze data, develop models and so on. We are always willing to show our sincerity in collaborations to many other teams.
XMU-China
    Cooperation on the Newsletter
    We offered XMU-China the information of our team, including team introduction, project description, etc., which will be recorded on Newsletter edited by XMU-China. Through this platform, more people could learn about our projects and we have more opportunities to communicate and cooperate with the external world.
    Cooperation on the Handbook
    We designed a handbook that contains an introduction of iGEM and tips for preventing bacterial infections in daily life. We presented useful information in a more concise and clearer way, focused on the prevention of harmful bacterial and how to maintain environmental sanitation. (Details can be found on our HP page).
    Cooperation on the Human Practice
    In August, we held the 2018 Fujian Regional Exchange Conference with XMU-China . During the meeting we share the project with each other and we have been keeping close contact. They gave us a lot of guidance on the project and help us complete in Integrated HP. They  introduced us to the hospital's dermatologist and led us to visit the Xiamen Environmental Protection Bureau.

Collaboration
Since firstly taking part in iGEM, NJU-China has the tradition of communicating with   other teams in China. We do not only exchange our ideas and experiences with others, but   also spread the knowledge of synthetic biology as well as iGEM Competition in China.   This year we kept the tradition and took part in several activities. These activities strengthened our understanding of synthetic biology and deepened the   friendship with other teams. We benefit each other in a mutual way.
Collaboration with SYSU-Software
We cooperated with the Software team from Sun Yat-sen University to develop the   conditioned place preference (CPP) mice image recognition software, and utilize the   software into our CPP test to record the reflection of mice. The software is able to present the statistic results in the form of heat maps,   reflecting the movement of mice directly and vividly.  We thank our collaborator for receiving us with attention and for such strong   contribution to our work.
In this experiment, we have seven mice. Each mouse is placed in a pair of interconnected   cages, including a bright one and a dark one. Our experiment requires us to record the   mice movement in order to accomplish the following goals:
1.To tell which cage the mice prefer to stay, bright one or dark one
2.Record the mice coordinate precisely
It’s hard for us to finish such job in tradition way. So we decided to seek some   software to assist us. However, the software available to us can not meet our demands.   It is really tricky. Fortunately, in iGEM China Community, we contact SYSU-Software, a   well-known software team and ask them to produce a tool for us. With their tool, we   record and analyze the video. Finally we obtain the following results:
1.The data of the mice coordinate, 30 times per second
2.Based on the data, the tool can generate a Heat Maps, from which, we can know which   cage the mice prefer to stay
Once again, we would like to thank SYSU-Software.

UCSC,2018,"CEM iGEM team approached our team with an interesting proposal; their team wanted to create a fun iGEM-themed music video showcasing iGEM teams from around the world. They requested we take a brief video of our team dancing to the Maroon 5 song ""Moves like Jagger"" that they would turn into a fun parody called ""Moves like iGEM"". This collaboration was brief, but we had fun coordinating with other iGEM teams worldwide for a fun side-project.
iGEM ULaval
The ULaval iGEM team is working with S. cerevisiae to create adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine. They contacted us to discuss product isolation and quantification since we are also working with yeast. We shared information and discussed extraction protocols. Our team suggested they use a riboswitch to detect final products within their cell cultures, but they were unable to find one that worked for their products. Their team suggested we find an HPLC column and machine for our initial in-lab quantification and explained how we could find a less expensive way to use HPLC.

We feel that collaboration within the scientific community is key for pushing forward beyond frontiers and catalysing innovation. Nothing exemplifies this more than the opensource nature of iGEM. As such, we enjoyed fully embracing the spirit of cooperation that the competition embodies. Click the logos above for more details.
TU Eindhoven
We collaborated with Eindhoven iGEM in the writing of a Cloning Guide , which is a useful tool for future iGEM teams to have an overview of all cloning techniques currently used in every lab around the world.
UCL
UCL iGEM 2015 is working on the development of probiotics and has looked into several pathways, such as the serotonin, Dopamine, GABA and Acetylcholine pathways. To help them, we introduced their pathways into our expression system in the form of a modeling collaboration. We simulated the expression of the different pathways and had some astonishing results. The incorporation of their pathways into our modeling system gave us valuable data of how the system needs to be changed to be capable of different pathways.  Furthermore as UCL had already surpassed their limits from IDT, we helped them by ordering two gBlocks for them using our oligo card.
NRP-UEA-Norwich
Norwich iGEM 2015 is working on the treatment of colon cancer and has different approaches. One is to introduce the butyrate pathway into probiotics. For the collaboration the butyrate pathway was incorporated into the iGEM Manchester-Graz expression system model to observe the expression of butyrate under the control of our system. We obtained useful data for Norwich and it helped us to understand further how the system is dealing with pathways that consist of several enzymes.

Helping others by collaborating
A very big part of iGEM is collaborating with and helping other teams. The amount of great iGEM projects through time shows how important it is to work together and use previous projects and ideas to make new projects. This is exactly why it is a gold medal requirement to help another iGEM team, and why we have talked to a lot to other iGEM teams about our own and their ideas. On this side of things we have chosen to help two other iGEM teams with their projects.
Since we are high school students we looked for the ability to help other teams, however, this ability was limited when facing university teams. We decided to share our knowledge we have accumulated with the teams about how to link the scientific idea with social needs.
Paris Team Name: Paris Bettencourt
The Skype conversation we had with the Team from Paris was very special. Both teams do not speak English as their mother tongue and this made the conversation extra special. Team members spoke about the way they got organized for working in the laboratory and described how they overcame challenges in the lab, between team members and so on. Team Paris generously offered their assistance concerning the modeling of the kit and even explained to us the general guidelines of building a mathematical model system.
In addition, Team Paris gave us a few tips on how to raise funds. Surprisingly , during the conversation we realized that we have a lot in common, both Teams are working in the food field and thus it is possible to turn to charity organizations dealing in agriculture to request funding the team. Our team explained how it is possible to implement the science field as a pure social goal that comes forward to help a specific population group.

[Fig 1] Biomarvel team member & KUAS_KOREA Team member
This year, team KUAS_Korea has been collaborating with team Biomarvel_Korea high school iGEM team. We shared our trials and errors KUAS_Korea have made in iGEM for past few years as well as general understandings in synthetic biology which could help them starting things up.
Biomarvel_Korea is a high school team, and this is their first year in iGEM. This time they are aiming for synthesizing GBP-ProG fusion protein for electrochemical biosensor, which detects heart failure with high accuracy, inexpensive cost and high sensitivity. It is such a brilliant project reflecting socio-contextual issues, so feel free to find more of them at their wiki.
Two teams, Kuas and Biomarvel have consistently communicated through e-mail and Facebook for collaboration. The first offline meet-up was held on August 10th, and at the moment both teams were still at the stage of setting basic concepts and principals of the project. We discussed each team’s projects and gave comments regarding the direction of the project and further points to elaborate. Listening from the outer perspective, especially from young active students was a truly helpful and intriguing experience.
Besides contents of the project itself, collaboration with Biomarvel_Korea was meaningful enough in the means of giving a real help to difficulties most of the iGEMers are facing. We went through some basic requirements for iGEM together such as project scheduling, wiki management, part submission and some other fulfilments for medal criteria, which can be often too overwhelming to manage all by themselves. This also actually helped us to look back and go through our own works and make sure that everything was properly managed to be reviewed and rewarded.
Overall, during the whole process of communication and content sharing, we gained valuable learnings on cooperation from their genuine thoughts and authenticity towards the project"
Leiden,2018," Davis.
In return, iGEM UC Davis requested us to test the effects of hydrogen peroxide on bacterial cells to allow iGEM UC Davis to better understand their own results on testing hydrogen peroxide on mammalian cells. We tested hydrogen peroxide           at a concentration of 100 ppm on 10 different stress reactive strains (Figure 3). The strains pSoxS, pUmuc, pBaeS and plbpA do not show a positive stress response when exposed to 100 ppm hydrogen peroxide. However, the strains The KatG gene encodes for hydroperoxidase I. It protects aerobic, phosphate-starved cells from oxidative damage. Read more about pKatG on its iGEM               registry               page pKatG, RpoE is involved in the attachtment of RNA polymerase ti specific initiation sites. Therefore               this promoter is related to the stress pathway related to protein synthesis[5]. Read more about pRpoE on its iGEM registry page pRpoE, Spy is a chaperone protein related to the folding of proteins. This promoter is therefore related to protein synthesis stress[6]. Read more about pSpY on its iGEM registry page] pSpY , pInaA is involved in the regulation of homeastasis[7]. Read more about pInaA on its iGEM registry page pInaA and CpxR is a chaperone protein related to the folding of proteins. This promoter is therefore related to               protein synthesis stress[6]. Read more about CpxR on its iGEM registry page pCpxR do show a positive stress response following hydrogen peroxide exposure.
pSoxS, pUmuc, pBaeS and plbpA are           involved in           DNA damage stress responses[1][2], envelope stress [3] and cell division[4], respectively. For these strains hydrogen peroxide does not invoke a stress reaction, indicating that these pathways are not           upregulated and suggesting the           bacterial cell does not experience these kinds of stress. Because these stress visualizing strains reacted to the exposure to 100ppm H2O2 these results indicate an involvement of H2O2 in the stress pathways of oxidative stress, protein           synthesis and homeostasis stress.

USMA-West Point and USAFA Collaboration
The iGEM teams at USMA West Point and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) collaborated to validate the USAFA DNA submission part in the iGEM pSB1C3 plasmid. The USAFA created a bio-brick that contained an open reading frame that was intended for expression in either bacteria or yeast.
To confirm the presence of the bio-brick in the pSB1C3 plasmid, we performed PCR reactions using the intended submission part plasmid as the template, and primers (provided by the USAFA) that specifically annealed to the bio-brick insert. Prior to running the PCR reaction, the USAFA pSB1C3 plasmid was used to transform DH5alpha bacteria in order to create a bacterial stock and to generate a sufficient reserve of plasmid for all subsequent analyses.
PCR reactions were analyzed by running 10uL of 20uL PCR reactions on an 0.8% agarose gel in 1XTAE for approximately 40min at 100V. The intended iGEM submission plasmid generated a band at ~1300 bp (Figure 1, lane 2). By contrast, a control plasmid generated a band at ~1800 bp (Figure 1, lane 4). The ~1800bp product is consistent with the nucleotide sequence information provided by the USAFA team. The control plasmid used was a yeast expression plasmid into which the USAFA team previously and successfully integrated their bio-brick (pYTK-AFA18; also provided by the USAFA team). The control PCR reaction also used the primers provided by the USAFA team. The reason for the discrepancy between the PCR products for the two plasmid templates was not readily clear.

To independently probe the intended submission plasmid, restriction digest reactions were performed. The sequence information provided for the bio-brick insert showed that it contained two"

They used these interviews and questionnaire to conduct market research for their project.
They implemented our escape game design, a pedagogical game to learn synthetic biology and tested it on non-biologists. They provided feedback on both our design and our game play instruction rulebook, which we then used to improve the game.
Pasteur Paris - Aether
They gave us a basic part that they designed, which functions to produce silicatein alpha in bacteria. We characterised the part and submitted it into the biobrick registry. We used this part in our overall design as one of the biomaterials.
We attended the France iGEM meet-up hosted by the Pasteur team. They also attended our play testing of the escape room where we were also able to give them a tour of our lab.
IONIS Paris - Softer Shock
We provided our equipement and materials , such as the plate reader machine, incubator as well as the glassware and media needed. We also helped them design their protocol for the characterisation and discussed how best to detect their reporter systems. We also provided our nanodrop allowing them to measure DNA concentrations for part submission.
We tested their SimRNA handbook, used to model our RNA organelle strands.  Over a couple sessions, we discussed how best to model the RNA agglomerations and then downloaded the software. They then helped us fully understand and execute the software.
Surveys
We also helped other iGEM teams around the world by answering their surveys:

University of Valencia
Mentor for Mentor: Being a part of the iGEM mentorship program, we have had the opportunity to work extensively with the University of Valencia in Valencia, Spain. Xavier Molero has helped to guide us through the iGEM process, including warning us about deadlines, giving us tips and tricks, and encouraging us to pursue many opportunities, such as grant proposals. In addition, we have exchanged project ideas, helping each other to develop our ideas more thoroughly. We have also helped to proofread and revise written material for the University of Valencia iGEM team, to help make sure the information made sense to the average native English speaker.

Therefore, it would be an interesting comparison if we use the same protocol as Heidelberg team to conduct the assay of our circularization system. Unfortunately, we didn’t have enough time to carry out the experiment."
ICT-Mumbai,2018," helped them catch that they initially forgot to add the BioBrick prefix and suffix to their gene sequence!
iGEM ECUST said, “BBrickIt is a useful tool for iGEM teams in producing complete BioBricked part and is also very efficient.”
Human Practices: iGEM WashU
Team WashU is working towards engineering yeast to produce a wheat rust resistance protein. As a collaboration activity, they expected to collect responses from variety of wheat farmers across the world.  We helped them with relevant data from India. During one of our IHP visits, our team interacted with wheat farmers and collected responses to the specific questions sent by the WashU team. Team also provided the contacts of some farmers in India as part of the collaboration activity, thus helping them to improve their network of farmers and gain information about specifics of damage caused by wheat rust and their preventive measures.
Modeling: iGEM Tec Monterrey
Before going to actual in vitro studies, we wanted to check how our design of oscillatory circuit works in silico. We had already prepared a stochastic model of the circuit, but we wanted to verify it from experts.  We had a discussion with iGEM Tec Monterrey to discuss about the project earlier in this iGEM Season and they helped us out with our modelling. They verified our program and equations for us, and suggested the concepts such as leakage transcription which we missed to take into account. Their help was very valuable in terms of refinement of modelling of our initial circuit design.  Even though we were not able to gather the experimental data and decided to go about designing a different circuit , conversations with iGEM Tec Monterrey were highly informative and educative for our modeling experience.
Distance from Jamboree: iGEM Tec Monterrey-GDL
In this collaboration activity, Tec de Monterrey-Campus Guadalajara sent out requests to make a sign that said how far we were from Giant jamboree (Boston) in km along with the phrase #ScienceEverywhere. Then they wanted us to take a picture of one of our team members holding the sign board and send it to them. We, along with our well-wisher Dr. Suruchi Rao, performed this fun activity at the David Sassoon Library, a heritage site in Colaba, Mumbai.
Language Project: IIT-Madras
Team IIT-Madras is working towards spreading awareness about synthetic biology to as many people as possible, disregarding the barriers of their native language. To do so they have created a series of educational videos which they have translated into many regional languages"

Low Budget Colombia Competition
Low Budget Challenge by Uniandes Colombia When doing a synthetic biology project, there are several protocols that must be followed to obtain the wanted results. This protocols can cost a lot of money and most of the time there aren’t the necessary funds available to obtain the best materials and at the same time have the necessary parts to complete the project.  Our low budget proposal consists of two modified techniques: Miniprep and electrophoresis. Both techniques are widely important when doing a project and we chose them because we could prove our Miniprep results in an electrophoresis that is also low budget. When combining both protocols, the amount of money saved can be impressive.
Interteam Collaboration with iGEM Amoy
This year, Amoy team invited us to participate in the newsletter they developed along with Paris_Bettencourt and Pasteur_Paris. We participated along in the discussions about our project, the obstacles we overcome, about science in Mexico and various other topics. The best part of interacting with Amoy team was to see that through communication we can all share our ideas and suggest ways of improving. Here we share the link to the Newsletters: https://2015.igem.org/Team:Amoy/Newsletter
Biosint Queretaro
We reviewed the P&P work of Biosint team, “Ethics for Synthetic Biology, Guidelines for the iGEM Community“. With the help of our instructor, we reviewed their ethic code for the correct implementation of it in Mexico. In this code, they define Synthetic biology and its principles for its implementation in the research field.
Paris Saclay
We contributed with them by participating in their survey about safety and biosecurity of new chassis.
Tec Monterrey Campus Chihuahua Collaboration
We established a collaboration with Tec-Chihuahua team who are working with CNTs. CNTs are cylindrical structures formed by rolled graphite sheets, which are composed by structured carbon atoms rings. These have greater mechanical strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, and chemical and biological activity than graphite. Some authors have demonstrated that DNA can adhere to the CNTs by simple electrostatic interactions between positively charged groups on the surface"

Yi WU
Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.

Online meet-up about fermentation factories – SCUT-FSE- China
We skyped with the team of the South China University of Technology about our respective projects. They are working to improve fermentation processes as well, using CRISPR in E.coli to defend against bacteriophages. We shared some insights about mutual problems we might encounter and the potential CRISPR offers to fermentation industries affected by phage infections.
Outreach
We developed our own card game and shared it with Team Franconia & in return also evaluated their card game. Their input helped us improve our design so that the game is a bit more fun and engaging. We hope our input also contributed to improving their game balance.
We were curious about the history of IGEM and have collaborated with the MIT team to visualize the development of tracks, teams, topics etc. MIT has provided us with a file stating these and Groningen has analyzed and visualized the content . This provides insight into how the competition has changed over the years, information about shifting interests and emerging trends and technologies.
To further strengthen the bond between different IGEM teams we also send & received post cards from different teams initiated by team Düsseldorf. The postcards should quickly highlight the main idea of the respective projects. We received a vast variety of post card designs and had a lot of fun reading through the other teams’ projects and designs.

UoA_NewZealand,2016,"dney University Team
In true ANZAC spirit, iGEM UoA collaborated with the iGEM team from the University of Sydney. An initial introductory skype session allowed us to meet, give one another a run down on our respective projects, and to figure out how we might be able to assist each other.
We found that the best way the UoA iGEM team could help the Sydney team would be to liaise with large New Zealand horticulture companies on their behalf. This was done, and a relationship was established with Turner’s and Grower’s NZ who were able to provide the team from Sydney with valuable information regarding the influence of fruit ripening on the produce storage and transportation industry.
Members of iGEM UoA were also able to fill out a survey provided by the iGEM Sydney, and distribute this survey to other people in order to assist them in their data collection.
To help us at iGEM UoA, the team at the University of Sydney provided their laboratory protocols for His-Tag purification and IPTG Induction. These proved useful as resources in iGEM UoA’s own experimental design. Our Sydney colleagues also liaise with Australian Waste Management Firms on our behalf.

UCAS,2017,"’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi. We simplify this process as the graph shows below.
As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation,"

Interlab with ZJUT-China
    This year is our first time to attend for the iGEM, So We met up with ZJUT-China，DLUT-China and LZU-China in Jiangsu Normal University to learn some experience form them and share our own project to them . Before this meeting, we had some troubles in interlab and we couldn’t find correct method to solve it. So we shared our problems with them at the meeting. The ZJUT-China had finished the interlab successfully and gave us some suggestions on our interlab. We adopted their suggestions and finally made it. After this meeting, we had a further communication with ZJUT-China and What they studied in Lysis gene gave us some inspiration about our own project, which made us consider to add a kill switch to make our L.lactis safer towards the biological environment. In return, we also gave them some ideas and suggestions to help them with their project.
Kill switch with SSTi-SGZD
    This year we also had a deep cooperation with SSTi-SGZD. They helped us with Wiki construction and technical support, so our Wiki could be compatible with the required format. We shared our ideas that we want to add a gene as the kill switch and wanted to get their suggestions. Then they just provided us with a supernova kill switch in a light-controlled gene system, which was an essential part to their last year's iGEM project. In order to help them with their experiment, we suggested on a method called Ubbelohde viscomete, which they could used to test the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid.
Safety with  Unesp_Brazil
    This year we also contacted with the  team Unesp_Brazilr by e-mails. We all concerned about the safety of the synthetic biology so we talked more about how to construct a high efficient chassis microorganism which is safe enough. Although we wanted to make our strain applied into the practical application, we didn’t know anything about the application of engineering bacteria. Fortunately, Unesp_Brazil offered the regulations and instructed us to apply our bacteria in the correct way. They also offered us the gene which could"

Skyping with the Stockholm team
Our first contacts with other teams started together with 2014 Aalto-Helsinki team, as university students from Stockholm building a new iGEM team from scratch contacted Aalto-Helsinki. In one of the very first meetings of the Aalto-Helsinki 2015 team we had a Skype session together with Aalto-Helsinki 2014 and the new Stockholm team. We first exchanged ideas with Stockholm and Aalto-Helsinki 2014 gave them advice in starting a completely new team. We kept close contacts with the Stockholm iGEM team throughout the summer, often having Skype sessions for updates on both teams' progress and for sharing experiences and ideas.
We were eager to meet the Stockholm team already before the Giant Jamboree, and were strongly supportive of expanding the planned Swedish iGEM meetup to a Nordic iGEM Conference, which was indeed realized in Uppsala in the end of July. On our way to the conference, we visited the Stockholm iGEM team lab at the AlbaNova University Center and met with the team. Our wonderful guide Sarah from the Stockholm team also kindly gave us a tour around the Royal Institute of Technology and Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.

As part of our collaboration, we characterized two biobricks from the Newcastle team (whom we met in person at the iGEM Scotland and Northern England meet-up). BBa_K1895000, also known as “Electrically induced promoter system v1” consists of the heat shock promoter BBa_J45504 driving expression of a two-gene operon made up of the rpoH Sigma-32 transcription factor and superfolded GFP. BBa_K1895001, also known as rpoH, is the wild-type RBS for the rpoH Sigma-32 transcription factor.
Colonies were picked and grown overnight at 37 °C, 250 RPM in 50 mL conical tubes in 10 mL of LB medium containing 34 ug/mL chloramphenicol. Cell density was measured in a Jenway 7305 spectrophotometer and the obtained data was processed using Excel. Cells were then subcultured into opaque-walled 96 well plates and adjusted to OD600 0.05 in 290 µl of LB medium supplemented with relevant antibiotics.
Plates were then placed in the Fluostar omega microplate reader from BMG labtech, and grown at 37 °C for 20 hours at 300 RPM. Aside from monitoring OD600, fluorescence was determined by measuring emission wavelengths using a fixed excitation filter (485nm) and a fixed emission filter (538nm) every 30 minutes. Six replicates were performed. The data is presented in relative fluorescence units.
We want to thank the Newcastle team for helping us in the characterization of our improved phytobrick iLOV.

    As a new team in iGEM, we participate in 2018’ s iGEM competition with enthusiasm to synthetic biology. In this season, we received a great amount of guidance and assistance from many experienced teams and mentors, and we learnt a lot from them. At the same time, we hold collaborations with many teams in experiment, modeling and human practices.
1. With OUC-China
    This year, it is our first time to participate in iGEM competition.
Interaction
    OUC-China is an experienced team that has been participating in iGEM competition for 8 years. They give us huge support. At the beginning, they explained the process of the iGEM competition to us in detail and remind us some important deadlines. For the project, they gave us some pertinent suggestions.
Public engagement
    For human practice activities, during the summer vacation, they invited us to hold a summer camp. We are very glad to collaborate with them and explained to the campers how to make insect specimens.

2.With SKLMT
Interaction
    SKLMT-China and us come from the same university, so it’s pretty convenient for our two teams to communicate with each other. Because we were both freshmen to iGEM, we helped each other with all kinds of issues during the iGEM season, from project design to experiment support and competition issues. From the beginning, the projects were polished by two teams together through holding some seminars.
Experiments
    What’s more, we did the interLab experiment together, experimental materials and equipment were shared together, besides, we analysed the data and discussed the consequence we got together. Recently, we gave them a favour in testing their new plasmid backbone for standardization, and it worked really well. In a word, thanks to our sister team for"
Stockholm,2017," was also a “mini Jamboree” where each of the 9 teams got to present their project (still in its early stage for most of us). After the mini Jamboree, there was an organised feedback session where every team had the chance to discuss inputs and raise questions.
We are grateful for iGEM Team Copenhagen for arranging this fun conference, and for the meaningful feedback we received from all the teams that took part.
TU Darmstadt
In September, some members of iGEM TU Darmstadt visited us in Stockholm together with a high school class from the Johanna-Geissmar-Gymnasium Mannheim. It was nice to meet a new team as well as potential iGEMers while exchanging ideas on both of our projects, sharing our good and not so good experiences with iGEM so far. TU Darmstadt also helped us by taking part in our recruitment event for iGEM Stockholm 2018, where they explained why they joined iGEM, and why the attendees of the event should join Stockholm’s next iGEM team. Furthermore, we are helping iGEM TU Darmstadt to establish and refine the structure of their iGEM organisation.
Stockholm Genetically Engineered Machines - SGEM
Throughout the project we have been in a close collaboration with SGEM, the iGEM Stockholm alumni organisation created by the very first iGEM Stockholm team in 2015. For more information about SGEM, please click here
iGEM Memes
A meme is most often a picture with a humorous text. Memes are mostly used to spread feelings of humour, recognition and a sense of belonging. We know that working on an iGEM project all summer can be tough, and that is one of the reasons we decided to create iGEM memes: to try to bring the whole iGEM community together through laughter. In total, we have gathered over 900 followers on both accounts, resulting in a collaboration with almost 1 000 old, current and new iGEMers across the world.
We have used both Instagram and Facebook as our platforms. All the memes we have posted are created by us, iGEM Stockholm, or submitted by other iGEMers. iGEM memes got so popular, that we ended up creating the challenge “Meme of the week”, where iGEMers would submit memes, and the best one would win the honour of being posted on a Monday.
There was even one person who contacted us on Instagram, who was interested in starting a new iGEM team after"

Research almost always involves collaboration,  this is why it is so essential for progress. In the scientific fields especially, collaborations spread all over the world and this can be easily noticed when looking at the number of co-authors of a paper. iGEM Grenoble-Alpes team, guided by this ideal, first collaborated on a small scale, with its own team members, to give birth to innovative ideas, resulting in SnapLab. On a larger scale, iGEM Grenoble-Alpes team collaborated with other 2017 teams.
Collaborations are fun!
Collaborations are fun and awesome! Especially when it comes to participating to a discussion with 5 other iGEM teams. In fact, we had a discussion about social responsibility towards the scientific progress with iGEM DTU-Denmark , iGEM Wageningen , iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec , iGEM TECHNION-ISRAEL and iGEM Uppsala which hosted and organised the debate. Prior the debate, iGEM Uppsala sent us multiple questions to further think about the subject so it could be more constructive.  After introducing our projects to the other teams, the idea was to discuss on how to prevent safety related problems. It is crucial to realise that even when working on a project in the iGEM context, social responsibility needs to be considered. It is not because we are in a contest atmosphere that we can forget about putting our project into their contexts and working on the social and ethical issues they might bring.
In the end, we learned a lot from the other teams: each country has its own regulations and might think differently. Hence, this cultural aspect has to be considered as well. We would like to thank iGEM Uppsala for organising this debate it was a lot of fun!

Collaboration
This year, we collaborated with a collegiate team NCHU-Taichung iGEM 2018 from National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan. NCHU is just located nearby Mingdao High School (15 minutes distance by car). At very beginning of the journey in iGEM 2018, we met up with each other at NCHU and Mingdao’s laboratory and school campus. We helped them host the 6th Asian-Pacific Conference hold in August. We shared with each other many ideas and dealt with problems met in the project and experiments. In this moment, just several weeks before iGEM Jamboree, we’d like to say,  “Thank you, Friends. Happy to meet you because of iGEM”
MINGDAO
We helped iGEM team NCHU to verify the bacterial cell growth affected by their BioBrick devices. They want to utilize synthetic biology to recover an environment polluted with dioxin. They created BioBricks of HAD, TonB and TLCC. They prepared the transformed E. coli with BioBricks and growth media (KB medium). Go to our lab in Mingdao, we measured the OD values of the E. coli cultured overnight and added IPTG for the induction of the gene expression and completed the assay following their protocol and instructions.
EXPERIMENT BY MINGDAO
↓ Measure OD600 values for E. coli with HAD, TonB or TLCC genes
↓ Dilute to OD600=0.05 with KB medium
↓ Culture at for 2-3 hours until OD values reach approximately 0.6
↓ Add 1mM IPTG for gene induction
↓ Set a kinetic mode for analysis in Microplate Reader (BioTeK Synergy H1)

We made efforts to collaborate with other teams and foster mutual development in both their projects and our own. We spoke to several teams and assisted many others in their project by filling out their surveys. In addition, we created our own survey about biocontainment to distribute to iGEM teams and provided a collaboration badge for teams that responded (for the results of our survey and list of teams that participated in the survey click on the collaboration badge to the right).
We would like to acknowledge the following teams for collaborating with us throughout the course of iGEM 2016.
Broad Run High School
We discussed kill switch mechanisms at length with the Broad Run team. We also aided their team by providing advice regarding modeling techniques with Matlab software. We helped them successfully model their project by sharing our Matlab expertise.
CGU Taiwan
One of our team members, Sarah, spoke to Bill and Justine from the CGU Taiwan team. Sarah explained our biocontainment project to Bill and Justine, and they in turn presented their Leijuvant project to her. They had a great follow up discussion about biocontainment and whether or not it is needed for Leijuvant. It was determined that physical containment would best serve their purposes.
UMaryland
We had an excellent time visiting UMaryland for the the Mid-Atlantic iGEM conference. We presented our project and heard ideas from not just the UMaryland team, but also the UPitt, William and Mary, and Naval Academy iGEM teams. This was a great opportunity for all teams to share ideas and advice. Members of our team also hosted a dialogue regarding biocontainment. This gave other teams the opportunity to learn about biocontainment and ask questions about the different methods available.
Trinity College Dublin
Trinity College developed a unique and exciting website called “iGEM Academy”. The academy allows teams to share their work using video media. We submitted an animated short about our project and the more general concept of biocontainment.
Vilnius-Lithuania
We assisted Vilnius-Lithuania in their human practices. They created a comprehensive survey to determine the factors that contribute to a successful iGEM team. We discussed the questions amongst ourselves and responded to their"

Collaboration with Harvard
We met team Harvard at New England iGEM, a regional meeting held at Boston University. After hearing about each other’s projects, we became aware that both our teams envisioned cell encapsulation to be a component of our respective projects. During that time, team Harvard expressed concerns over finding an expert on hydrogels and encapsulation who could teach them relevant lab protocols and allow them to make informed decisions about their project’s direction. Therefore, both teams decided to continue correspondence in order to find an expert and get essential training.
In August, team MIT met up with Derfogail Delcassian, a graduate student working on hydrogels at the Langer Lab and she offered to help us get trained as well as provide imperative feedback that we could use to design future experiments. We got team Harvard in contact with Derfogail and they arranged a lab visitation day at MIT. Based on their feedback, the training and input that they received from Derfogail was very helpful. We continued our correspondence after that and planned to develop a cell-encapsulation protocol manual in the future for bacterial and mammalian cells, so that the technique would be more easily accessible for future iGEM teams.
Collaboration with University of Connecticut:
We met Team UConn at NEGEM as well. During their presentation, they expressed concerns about certain protocols they needed help with and some lab training that they wanted to receive (and for which they could not find relevant experts at UConn). We reached out to them after the conference in order to provide them training in the relevant areas that they needed help in. They wanted to learn more about the electroporation protocol, making stocks of electrocompetent cells, Golden Gate assembly and lab work-flows. Therefore, in August, team MIT hosted team UConn at our lab. After a brief lab tour, we answered a bunch of their questions about transformations and golden gate, and mentored them through our own protocols.
Collaboration with Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)

Over our Skype call, we both discussed our biofilm assay protocols and came to the realization that we had very different techniques to quantify biofilm formation. While we were using Colony"

We set up each of these both with 1mM IPTG and without, so 16 overnights in total, with 25μg/ml chloramphenicol for the strains with plasmids.
The next day, we spun down 500μl of each overnight in 1.5ml eppendorfs, resuspended in 1ml PBS buffer (PBS gives less background fluorescence than LB broth), and transferred to cuvettes for OD600 measurements. For the fluorescence measurements, we used a Typhoon FLA 9500 with the samples in a 96-well plate. Each of the 16 samples were pipetted into 3 wells with 300μl each. The settings on the Typhoon were: 1) excitation laser at 532nm and emission filter above 575nm (so would detect any wavelength above 575nm) and 2) excitation laser at 473nm and emission filter above 575nm. Both were across the whole 96-well plate, but the second lower excitation wavelength was included in case the first was too high to excite KillerOrange.
Results
For each of the wells, a fluorescence value in arbitrary units (au) was calculated using ImageQuant software, where we set the 3 wells of PBS only blanks as 0% fluorescence, and the well with the highest value as 100% to convert au into percentage. Next, we normalised for any natural fluorescence in the cells by subtracting the average of the “cells only” wells (DH5α, and Dh5α.Z1, both with and without IPTG) from all wells, and then corrected for the difference in OD600 values between samples by dividing the normalised fluorescence measurements by the OD600 values. The table below shows the average across the 3 wells of each of the 16 samples.

Collaboration with UCAS
To fully characterize UCAS's need of their data, we helped them characterize their nitrogen promoter to make their data more solid. In addition, we used their promoter to construct new parts which could sense the concentration of nitrogen, which could help enrich our input library.
Collaboration with Fudan-China
Our team visited Fudan_China in August to exchange ideas of two projects. We discussed the problem met in their modeling and found an available method to describe this complex dynamic model. Each part of this system will affect others at the same time, so it is impossible to give an analytic solution. We talked about the possibilities of dividing their circuit into smaller parts that can be delivered by their multilayer signal processing system and finally gave a realistic model.
Library construction
We collect parts from other teams to help with our project,constructing our library
Meeting
In this summer, our team attended several meetings organized by other iGEM teams. We have learned a lot from these meetings by interacting with other teams. We are also benefited from exchanging ideas and initiating collaborations during these meetings. On the other hand, our idea about the synthetic biology platform also synergized with other team’s project.

Dear Diary,
What a weekend! These past few days LiU iGEM participated in the Biobrick tutorial at the Danish Technical University (DTU) in Denmark. Although it was a struggle to get to Denmark (stupid railway) it was all worth it to meet up with all the other Scandinavian teams.
This was a weekend filled with lectures, workshops and fun challenges. During the weekend, we also worked in teams of 2-3 students (from different iGEM-teams) and tried to make Biobricks. During our stay in Denmark, we also had a chance to explore the campus of DTU and their student life and look how fun we had!

We had very fun, most teens were enthusiastic and interested in the experiment we did and it felt appreciated that we actually tried to make it fun. Because that was one of the main purposes of these days: to have fun and learn something in the same time! Who does not love to crush fruits and them mix them ethanol?

 Jiangnan
This year, we aims at using a bifunctional enzyme, xyn10D-fae1A, to directly break down the lignin-polysaccharide crosslink between straws and convert them into useful chemical materials. We introduced a group of cellulases (cex, cenA, xyl3A) to convert the cellulose produced by straw degradation into glucose, and then designed two pathways to ferment glucose to produce butanol and hydrogen respectively.
However, there is a problem that when the conventional E. coli BW25113 is used as a chassis organism for butanol fermentation, the yield is very low, so we hope to replace the chassis cells to reach an increase in the yield of butanol.
Through the discussions between our two teams, Jiangnan offered our team E. coli B0016-050 from their laboratory as a new chassis cell to help us make further increase in the yield of butanol. Click here to see them: https://2018.igem.org/Team:Jiangnan/Collaborations
