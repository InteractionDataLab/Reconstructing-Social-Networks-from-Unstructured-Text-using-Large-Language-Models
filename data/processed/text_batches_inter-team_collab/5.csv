Collaboration – Mentoring iGEM Team UNIFI 2017
The iGEM team UNIFI is representing the University of Florence and is participating for the first time in the iGEM competition. As the only Italian team this year, they took the chance to collaborate with other iGEM teams beyond their own country borders. We met the iGEM team UNIFI at the European iGEM Meetup in Delft on 7th to 8th July and initiated the mentoring. Afterwards, we started this collaboration, with weekly skype conferences (Figure 1) in addition to intensive communication via email.
Figure 1: Skype meetings with iGEM UNIFI for a two-way collaboration.
During the mentorship we picked certain topics for every skype meeting. Those topics covered technical and practical advices concerning the wiki and important points for human practice among others. Together we discussed all the gold medal criteria and gave tips how to fulfill them. Furthermore we discussed organizational aspects of travel and stay in Boston. During one skype call our HTML programming expert Maximilian answered questions concerning HTML coding.
In return for the mentorship, iGEM UNIFI helped us characterizing two BioBricks. To make sure that Escherichia coli is able to take up the unnatural nucleoside triphosphates from the cultivation media we had to introduce a heterologous transporter. One of the BioBricks encodes a complete   nucleotide transporter PtNTT2 ( BBa_K2201004 ) originated from the algae Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The second BioBrick is a truncated version missing the N-terminal signal peptide ( BBa_K2201001 ). This N-terminal signal peptide leads to some kind of toxicity in E. coli. Through cultivation experiments we wanted to investigate the extent of the toxicity by comparing the growth of the strain expressing the full version of PtNTT2 to the ones expressing the truncated version.
iGEM UNIFI had the capacity to perform the same cultivation experiment we performed using a microscale bioreactor. This ensured automatic measurements for OD600 values which would decrease errors concerning µmax. This characterization from iGEM UNIFI led to a more accurate estimation of the toxicity of a full length version compared to a truncated version of PtNTT2.

We really appreciate LZU-China’s help in 2015’s iGEM competition. LZU-China is a team supported by Lanzhou University which is the best university in the northwestern region of China, ranking as one of the top 30 among over 1,500 universities across China. And they have taken part in the last 2 years’ iGEM competition. This year, they mentored us and shared their competition experience with us. They provide many valuable suggestions which are about the presentation, the wiki design and the parts construction.
For example, they provided many useful advises for the construction of parts. We are HS team so that we do not have much experience in genetic engineering. LZU-China helped us to solve many problems we met like selecting the clone, assembling the plasmid.
What’s more, they pointed an important mistake for us, which made us avoid adding a wrong part, and told us many things about the part shipping. We completed the part submission form with their assistance. They helped to choose the suitable Part ID and told us how to fill in the Registry.
We are particularly grateful to International Teenage Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC). Dr. Mao Yong helped us to understand match process and how to enter for it in our preparatory phase. And igem team from Tianjing University, which presented handbook to us by post.

Instagram Challenge
In an effort to present our iGEM projects to communities in an interesting and creative way, we created an Instagram Challenge! The iGEM Photo-a-Day Instagram Challenge invited teams from all over the world to try to post pictures following a daily prompt for the month of July. We reached out to teams to submit prompts for the challenge, and received ideas from Michigan State University iGEM, iGEM Evry, iGEM Bulgaria, HHU Dusseldorf, and Estonia iGEM. Once our schedule was ready, we sent out the challenge. iGEM Hamburg, HHU Dusseldorf, iGEM Estonia, iGEM Evry, Michigan State University iGEM, iGEM Barcelona, Linköping University iGEM, iGEM Tec-Monterrey, iGEM TecMonterrey_GDL, NTHU iGEM, iGEM Graz, and iGEM NYU Abu Dhabi all participated.

Postcards Delivered to HHU Düsseldorf iGEM
On June 22nd, we had a Skype call with Dusseldorf iGEM because their project was very similar to ours. They were trying to establish a co-culture of S. elongatus , E. coli , and S. cerevisiae . Due to our shared goal, we exchanged a variety of information from culturing conditions to genetic assembly methods. We also sent a few articles that discussed co-culture that we found helpful for our project, and extensively discussed it with Dusseldorf iGEM.
In addition to the similarity between our projects, we were also both honored to receive an Opentrons OT-2 robot from Opentrons. Unfortunately, at the time of discussion, they have not yet received their Opentrons robot, so we wholeheartedly offered to run any protocols on the Opentrons that they wanted to test out. In return, they offered to let us try out a cyanobacteria gene circuit in their co-culture apparatus. However, due to time constraints and the extensive shipping process, we could not prepare and ship the gene circuit to Dusseldorf.
Furthermore, we were incredibly excited to collaborate with HHU Dusseldorf in their mission to send postcards to bolster public awareness of synthetic biology and allow teams to introduce themselves and their projects before the Giant Jamboree. We designed our postcard to have gumballs (as we are The Sucrose Factory) and described our project briefly on the back. After we shipped one hundred postcards, we received a stack of post"

Part of the project was also to share experiences with other teams from all over the world. These experiences were partly active and partly just participation. Collaborations helped us create a network of interacting students and teams that taught us what is the meaning of an active scientific community. After all, what makes a discovery or an experience beautiful is being able to share it.
BioBrick Tutorial DTU
DTU Biobuilders, DTU University, Denmark
In April, DTU Biobuilders, iGEM team from the Technical University of Denmark, invited us and other teams from Sweden, Norway and Denmark to participate to a BioBrick tutorial: a three day event in which we learnt how to build a BioBrick both in theory and in the lab and we also had the opportunity to exchange opinions about other topics. In particular:
We worked in the lab with the BioBricks, we combined three genes into a plasmid by digestion, ligation and transformation in E.coli.
We had talks about the iGEM Interlab Study: the largest international biology research project, by three alumni who talked about their experiences in iGEM, and one about Human Practices.
We had a workshop on how to pitch our iGEM project.
We had a talk with Abigail from iGEM HQ about after iGEM.
Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund
iGEM Lund, Lund University, Sweden
The Nordic iGEM Conference is hosted annually and serves as a meeting point for all the Nordic iGEM teams. It is important as teams get to meet other iGEM competitors to exchange ideas, knowledge, and discuss potential collaborations. It is hosted by the previous year's winners of the conference. iGEM Lund, being the 2017 winners, have received the honor of hosting the 2018 event. The NiC serves the purpose of gathering and preparing the Nordic teams for The Giant Jamboree event in Boston. In the conference, we had the opportunity to present our project and we also had a poster session.

UCAS,2017," to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

iGEM Botchan Lab Tokyo
We kept contact with iGEM Botchan Lab Tokyo this year since iGEM East Asia Meetup occurred. They introduced us their project showing us a PDF file ( Go to the wiki page of iGEM Botchan Lab Toyko ). We also sent some documents regarding our project back to them. ( Click here to download our PDF ) Their project may lead to a solution of food crisis from the viewpoint of Nitrogen fixation. They said that if E.coli can synthesize amino acid by taking in nitrogen gas from the air as a part of our intestinal flora, malnutrition can be solved much easier. Considering this project, we offered a scientific article written by our PI, Prof. Iwahashi. Since he used to research nitrogen fixation before. They also taught us the methods of cloning. They constructed really large plasmids and we asked for the advice from them. Sadly, we could not make them this year but still, it was totally helpful for us.
iGEM Paris Bettencourt
Cell-free expression platforms allow the production of proteins from DNA without live cells by making use of modified cell lysates. Their application is increasingly popular in synthetic biology where they allow fast iteration of design-build-test cycles of genetic parts and gene circuits. Now is the time to prepare for the widespread adoption of cell-free methods by iGEM teams.
With this concept, iGEM Paris Bettencourt planned to have a pilot-scale interlab to test the variation of cell-free expression systems between labs. Then Dr.Evelyn from Arbor Biosciences connected us to Paris Bettencourt team. Thus we had a Skype meeting and our team decided to join the collaboration. You can download the PDF which shows the result of our collaborative research below.

Additionally we discussed the BioBrick creation and submission.                 We really appreciate the hospitality and friendliness of the Bordeaux team members. We                 where picked up from the airport and even invited to have dinner after the meetup. We want to thank the Bordeaux team for this very nice weekend.
The Edmonton call
We talked to iGEM Edmonton through Skype about our iGEM experience. They want to make a guidebook for future iGEM teams which deals with any problems iGEM teams can face throughout the competition, for example problems that involved lab work, project design, team dynamics, etc. The book will also provide solutions to those problems. The Edmonton team wanted to have an interview with all the members of the New Applications track, so this can be the first ever total track collaboration.

Symposium Wageningen – getting to know our Dutch competition
Once we decided upon our subject and made a start in the lab, in MATLAB and in the manufacturing of the device, we started wondering how the other Dutch teams were coping. We were very curious to see their approach and ideas for the iGEM competition. Perhaps we could exchange valuable experiences in the first stages of the project, especially since this is the first time the Eindhoven University of Technology participated. Also important, we might be able to set up the first collaborations. No sooner said than done, we sent an email to the four other Dutch teams to gauge their interest for a get-together.
The Wageningen-UR team were enthusiastic and offered to organize the symposium at a location in Wageningen, which is a somewhat central location for all Dutch teams. The date for the symposium was the 9th of July. The Wageningen-UR team arranged the location, a lunch and the day ended with a barbeque. The program contained a presentation by all the Dutch teams, but started with a presentation by the Wageningen-UR team 2011. They gave insights and useful tips for this year's competition.  All Dutch teams gave a presentation on the current status of their projects and there was room for worthy discussion. At the end of the day, the barbecue offered a great opportunity to get to know each other; something which wiki pages and email contact could not substitute.  The Wageningen-UR team also arranged recordings of the day, which were streamed live. They are still available online: presentations part 1 , presentations part 2 .

Collaborations have been one of the greatest parts of iGEM, it was amazing to meet lovers of the science from all over the world, share whit them and make contacts. It was wonderful to hear all the ideas of their projects and share our idea too.
As newbies, we asked many questions and all the teams were always willing to answer, thank you very much. We shared whit teams from Mexico, Estonia, España, Chile and we participated in the MeetUp Latinametica. Below are the different iGEM teams that have collaborated with us.
ESTONIA
The iGEM team from Tartu Estonia, is working in the  production of mycosporine-like amino acids, UV  radiation protection compounds, in yeast using the genes from two different  cyanobacterial species. This compounds work not only as sunscreen but also are  able to protect skin from photoaging, have the anti-inflammatory effect and  antioxidant activity and even could be considered as anti-cancer agents.
As Ecuador is located on the equatorial line or parallel 0 °, is subjected to extremely high UV radiation indices, especially in the Andean area. In our country, there are constant campaigns to prevent skin cancer and protection against intense radiation.
In the meetings with the iGEM team from Tartu we talked about the importance of your project and how it would benefit tropical countries like ours. We also comment on experiences on how the sunscreens contain chemical compounds which are extremely toxic to the oceans and the environment.

XMU-China,2016," METU HS Ankara translate iGEM experiment protocols into Chinese. Besides, we contributed the spread of surveys of Exeter , Pasteur_Paris and Groningen by our translation. Among them, Groningen sent us a badge. In a word, XMU-China was making effort to push synthetic biology, an emerging discipline, to go further in China.
Software test and Modelling
We tested the software developed by SJTU-Software , which is expected to be an efficient tool for iGEMers, no matter for individuals or for teams. The software integrates calendar function, instrument appointment system into a social media. The function which impressed me most is its way to find the team nearby.
We also tested HFUT-China's software called BioDesigner Coral. They built it helping iGEM teams design and construct their device. Besides, BioDesigner Coral shows the relationship between genes, providing a reference of related genes. This function was expanded to the system recommendation, which provided a reference for the device designer.
Besides, we appreciate TecCEM for helping us in construct our Modelling . Because of the limited time, we got in trouble finishing our mathematical model. TecCEM gave a hand to us without hesitation once they saw the trouble in front us. Thanks to their assistance, our model can be shown on our wiki on time. They built the model to simulate the effect of sRNA towards pathogens. The first step was to
simulate the growth of the bacteria which produce sRNA. Multiplying a parmeter, the growth of the pathogens which was affected by sRNA can be shown. Finally, the growth curve of engineering bacteria should minus the curve of pathogens. On the basis of their effort, our project can be more complete and mathematically proved. Here, we sincerely thank them for their help.
Oxford
They sent us a BioBrick of great importance, the quorum sensing system of MRSA. Quorum sensing system was the key part in the detection of antibiotic resistance bacteria. With their help, our project can be more systematic and convincing.
EPFL
We had a skype meeting with them. They interviewed us about the drug-resistance. We show our project to them. With their spread, we found a new method to show our project wider by the collaboration, where we felt to be connected with more iGEMers. Sincerely thanks to their interview.

Bordeaux,2015," in their project and allowed us to discuss general safety issues such as containing genetically modified organisms and ensuring that they do not become out of our control. You can see the little videos which have been made this day following this link: LINK.  Afterwards, we had a discussion about Paris Pasteur's project and answered their Survey in order to help them with their project.
We would like to thank again all of the teams which came to our meetup, Cap Sciences for the loan of their place and for the videos. We also thank all the people who took pictures and videos this week-end and shared them with us.
Paris- Saclay
When talking with Paris-Saclay during our meetup we were very interested in their project this year which is concerned about safety. Safety in our project is not a particular problem since we are using our genetically modified organisms for production and all cells are destroyed during Curdlan purification. However, when thinking about alternatives where our bacteria would be directly applied on grapevine leaves, these safety issues are extremely important. We spent some time with them during the meetup and afterwards thinking about Safety of our project.
Oxford
The Oxford team of 2015 has generously proposed to help us to establish a short toxicology review of our Curdlan molecule. Our lab does not have the required material to do so and this would help complete our project. So we sent them a sample of our produced Curdlan so they could do tests on it.
Other collaborations
Throughout the year, we have been contacted to answer surveys and to share surveys. We answered to the best of our abilities all of the following surveys: UI-Indonesian , UCL , TEC-Monterry. When possible we gave feedback to improve their surveys. We also participated in Paris-Bettencourt's rhizi project

Surveys
We completed surveys for multiple teams throughout the project including University College London, Delft University of Technology and University of Westminster, and joined in an international survey consisting of teams from Germany, Mexico, Israel, Taiwan, England, Austria, India, Pakistan, France and Lithuania.
We completed surveys for other teams to help enhance their scope of knowledge of genetic engineering and modification.  We took part in the international survey as it represents public attitudes across the globe – here in Scotland we feel that GMOs are represented in a negative light and wanted to understand whether this attitude was constricted to Scotland, the United Kingdom (by checking Sheffield’s results), Europe (other European teams) or global.
Northern Meet Up at the University of Edinburgh
The undergraduate team at the University of Edinburgh organised for all teams in Scotland and the team from Newcastle University to meet up near the end of August to practice our presentations and receive constructive feedback on how to better deliver our project.
This was the first time we had presented to other teams and received encouraging feedback that our project and delivery were interesting enough to keep listener’s attention, however our presentation should be reordered as it was difficult to follow. There were also some slides that were not important that we should remove, as well as using that time to include greater detail on our lab work. We were told we had the knowledge to answer questions effectively however we needed to be more concise. This feedback was vital in shaping our presentation.
UK Meet Up at the University of Westminster
The University of Westminster hosted a similar meet up to Edinburgh’s, this time inviting all the teams in the UK. We delivered our presentation again; incorporating the feedback received in Edinburgh, and were met with similar enthusiasm.  We were advised to make our presentation more of a story with one slide following on from the former, as it seemed like we were just rattling off what we had completed over the summer. Once again this enabled us to improve.  The questions in London were tougher but our answers held up to scrutiny and we considered the presentation a success.

As a communication system, the use of CryptoGErM requires     collaboration and so, to test our system, we asked the other iGEM     teams in the Netherlands to help us with this. However, we also    collaborated with iGEM teams abroad. This article describes all our    collaborations with the other iGEM teams.
Sending our message in spores to iGEM Wageningen and Eindhoven :
The idea of CryptoGErM is to send information integrated in the     sequence of DNA. Our system is using highly resistant spores in     which the DNA is stored. Spores are then transmitted to the     receiver who can get the DNA from them and therefore the stored     information as well.  We wanted to prove that this form of     information transmission works. Therefore we decided to cooperate     with two other iGEM teams from the Netherlands and send our     CryptoGErM spores with a secret message to Wageningen and Eindhoven . Read the accompanying letter here .     Follow this link to see how we constructed the message B. subtilis strain.
Figure 1. (A) Microscopy picture of the CryptoGErM      message spores aka B. subtilis spores. (B) Tubes that were send      via mail. (C) This map indicates how the CryptoGErM spores      traveled through the Netherlands.
We went through all the 6 steps of our project. The message was     encrypted with our program and converted to a DNA sequence. This     sequence was synthesized by IDT. When this synthesized DNA sequence     was obtained, we integrated the message sequence into the genome of Bacillus subtilis. Subsequently we sporulated B. subtilis and     spores were obtained. These spores together with primers were sent     to Wageningen and Eindhoven via mail under GMO conditions. Spores     and primers were in the mail from the 6th September till the 9th.     In this case we sent primers for PCR amplification of the message     because we assumed the other teams did not include a whole genome     sequencing in their finance plan. We sent this CryptoGErM protocol     along with the message"
ETH_Zurich,2018," the official fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology, which is carried out by the iGEM competition itself but also in the InterLab study from this year’s Marburg iGEM team.       They are working with Vibrio natriegens as a possible new chassis for synthetic biology. In their project „Vibrigens - Accelerating Synbio“ they aim to establish Vibrio natriegens, the fastest-growing organism known to date (doubling time ~ 10 min) as the new go-to organism for everyday lab work in both academic and industrial applications. The task in their InterLab study was similar to the official iGEM InterLab study, i.e.       to measure fluorescence of different test devices at different time points.

With Team CIEI-BJ , Team BCU and BIT_China
May 9th is the day when we first met up. iGEM participants and instructors from two universities gathered together in USTB.Our journey started from then. Their fermenter and notoginseng by artifical cultivated gave us new perspective of our project     On July 24th, Team CIEI-BJ has invited Team BIT_China, Team BFSUICC_China, Team UST_Beijing and Team The Colorful Ladies together to exchange ideas.

It's our pleasure to be engaged in these activities and appreciate others' charm.
By inviting junior and graduate students talking us through, we have a better overview of our university's iGEM project in last year. No matter the legendary figure——Pangu in Chinese mythology or the algorithm Pangu named after him , both attracted the biology enthusiasts. Moreover, students form BCU introduced the methods of planting notoginseng, which increased our knowledge.
Undergraduate, high school, junior high students and their instructors together learned from other strong points and close the gap.

Mingdao,2016," and helped them to confirm a protein expression of one of their BioBrick.
We learned some experiment skills in molecular biology at Mingdao’s lab from our instructors. After discussion with NCTU-FORMOSA, we went to their place not only for learning more especially from an experienced iGEM team, but for doing them a favor by experiment skills we knew so far.
The following data was performed by us for a part of NCTU-FORMOSA’s project. We prepared E. coli BL21 with a plasmid of pSB1A3 carrying T7 promoter-driven Hv1a-lectin gene. When bacteria grew to OD600 around 0.6, 500uM of IPTG was added for induction. After incubation for 4hr, the lysates were collected and subject to SDS-PAGE with a 12% gel. And the proteins were observed by Coomassie Blue staining. (Lanes 1&2: samples without induction; 3: a sample with induction; 4: wild-type bacteria as control lysates. M refers to a protein marker).
Collaborating with another team definitely helped us improve our skills of doing experiments, especially when working with college students. By helping NCTU-FORMOSA team to do a part of an iGEM project, we once again proved ourselves that we are capable of doing lab experiments well although we are high school students. By working with NCTU-FORMOSA, we learned details of the experiment and got to know more about their project this year.
The following is the message from iGEM team NCTU-FORMOSA:
“To test the enzyme activity of AOX protein, which catalyzes the oxidation of alcohol and generates H2O2 products, produced by iGEM Team Mingdao, we performed HRP-TMB assay. TMB (3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine) is oxidized and changed to a deep blue color during the enzymatic degradation of H2O2 by horse radish peroxidase (HRP). The concentration of H2O2 can be determined by checking the color change, indicating TMB assay can be used to examine the enzyme activity of AOX with the substrate of alcohol.
We cultivated 3ml of the E.coli DH5α carrying the Mingdao iGEM team’s biobrick (i.e., Pcons-RBS-LO-AOX/pSB1C3, BBa_K1991009) in the LB media supplemented with Chloramphen"

Figure 5. The analysis of questionnaires of NEU-China.
As the result shows, there are lots of people think detecting tumor cell depending on their VOC is not an accurate way, but there are still 34% people think the accuracy can be more than 60%. Most of people think the cancer probably can be cured if it can be detected early. Only a few people think early detection has no beneficial to the cancer.
When we asked them what their attitude towards the iSmeller are. The majority of people thought it was really convenient to detect cancer at home, they hoped this technology can be developed quickly. But a few people still suspected its accuracy. And many people hoped it won't spend too much money. All in all, people really wanted iSmeller can work and develop a new way to detect cancer. Here is the link to their wiki
Since we wanted to get the feedback of our project, in September, after we got some results, NEU-China helped us interview associate Prof. Peiyong Liu, vice Dean of college of life and health sciences Northeastern University. They introduced what we did, and discussed with professor. Then, they asked her some views towards our project. She thought that the usage of Geneguard system was an innovative idea and it was feasible to control the engineered bacteria in the environment. She also thought that our project was meaningful when concerning biosafety issues. Solving this problem using synthetic biology methods was a nice attempt. She spoke highly of our project and wished the best for us. Her suggestions were meaningful to us and gave us confidence. We appreciated NEU-China for the interview.

On 12th of August, we had a voice conference with Tianjin, XMU-China, FAFU-China, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, SCUT-China_A, and UCAS. After the conference, we decided to build an alliance and a worldwide database for the contents of heavy metals in local soil. We took charge of sample collecting in the northeast China. Because of the huge sample size, we still continued to do this work after wiki freezing. We hope we can build the database in China, and guide our future work.

Let's do something together!
Collaboration in science is one of the most important steps to success. You are very good in your field but still, some piece of a puzzle is missing in order to see the whole picture? It is not a problem at all if you are open and not afraid to ask for help or to offer yours. Meeting other people while working on a science project is also essential. Other people with their fresh mind might easily notice a reason why something is not working properly, suggest solutions or inspire with a new direction. So, let's collaborate!
Team Vilnius-Lithuania Collaboration
We were fortunate to enjoy a productive collaboration with Team Vilnius-Lithuania over the summer. We were able to contribute a mechanistic model of the PURE cell free system which is documented in detail on our modelling collaboration page . Team Vilnius-Lithuania worked with us on wet lab protocols for the characterisation of DNA degrading switch which are outlined here.
DNA Degradation Switch Protocols
1. Introduction
Our DNA Degrading Switch requires the transformation of 2 plasmids prior to maxicell induction in order to function.
Construct pImm contains a coding sequence for DNase Colicin E2’s immunity protein Imm2 and an upstream recognition site for homing endonuclease I-SceI.
Construct pCol contains a coding sequence for DNase Colicin E2.
By transforming pImm into DL2524 (maxicell progenitor strain) culturing successful transformants, transforming construct pCol and carrying out maxicell induction the DNA degrading switch becomes active. By exposing DL2524 to arabinose homing endonuclease I-SceI is induced, this degrades the chromosome of DL2524 and linearises pImm preventing further expression of imm2. With its immunity protein no longer being expressed Colicin E2 should become active around 24 hrs later degrading the DNA remaining within our Maxicell.

Collaboration 3: iGEM McMaster
This year iGEM Guelph had the pleasure of attending the Ontario iGEM Annual Meet Up (oGEM) which was hosted by McMaster University. Multiple teams across Ontario gathered together to discuss our project and team experience. We were joined by iGEM teams from the Universities of Toronto, Queens, Waterloo, Brock, Ottawa, and Western Ontario. This year we were also joined by representatives of SynBio Canada and we all engaged in topics of the challenges faced by researchers in the field of Synthetic Biology and why there is an opposition to its universal implementation as a viable tool to help solve global problems. Our team’s own Jehoshua Sharma brought up one of the main talking points about a huge challenge of synthetic biology: We don’t have an accessible definition of synthetic biology, and so it’s hard for the public to realistically understand what it is if every scientist has their own personal definition and not a consistent answer for the general public.
The experience to engage with the other teams, by virtue of sharing values and critiques of each other’s projects has inspired Guelph iGEM to be the hosts of oGEM 2019.

We corrected their code by fixing the reaction for infection of bacteria by phage, and converting the rate law for infection of bacteria by phage and the rate law for lysis of infected bacteria to proper stochastic rates. Their code commented with our corrections can be downloaded here.
Exeter
The collaboration between our team and the Exeter iGEM team was two-fold. As one of our reporter modules for the Sensynova multicellular biosensor framework, we standardised and characterised a variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) not submitted to the registry before; deGFP. The Exeter team collected single cell data for E. coli cells expressing deGFP. To see more about this data, check out our results page .
The Exeter iGEM team have been working on a filtration system for water from mines using modified bacteria. A feature of their system will be to use UV to kill any bacteria in the system after use. To assist the team, we performed an experiment to independently determine the effectiveness of UV as a method to sterilise their system. We grew up Top10 E. coli cells and subjected them to UV for 0, 1,2.5, 5, or 10 mins, before plating out the culture. The cultures were static incubated overnight and the number of colonies on the plate were counted. This data was then sent to Exeter for further analysis.
Evry Paris-Saclay
We were initially contacted by Jérémy Armetta from the Evry Paris-Saclay team as our team was working on a synthetic promoter library and they were wondering if we could work together as they aimed to make a psicose synthetic promoter in order to create a biosensor.
We organised a Skype call to discuss how our projects intertwined. After a little chat, it was clear that we were taking different approaches to achieving our synthetic promoters and therefore could not help each other in such a manner.
We suggested that, once working, we could take the biosensor created by the Evry Paris-Saclay team and implement it to our framework as a variant to the IPTG biosensor currently used as our proof of concept. By co-culturing this biosensor module to the framework's other modules, we would be able to come up with various variants of the psicose biosensor for the Evry team.
However, due to synthesis issues causing delays and therefore time constraints, we have been able to implement the psicose biosensor into our framework but lacked the time to co-culture this part with the Sensynova platform's multiple"

Collaboration with Arizona State University
Our team was having difficulty assembling the two transcriptional units (VCP and PCP) into a multigene assembly. We contacted the ASU iGEM team to see if they could help with our problem. Stefan from the ASU iGEM team developed a cloning strategy to help our team assemble our multigene sensing plasmid within a few days of sharing the plasmid maps. This included designing primers for each of our transcriptional units in order to do digests and ligations using Type 1 enzymes (double digest + ligation). The ASU team also sent us an aliquot of their lab’s pET28 to use as the backbone for the multigene sensing assembly. ASU also helped troubleshoot minor problems that came up while trying to assemble and clone the sensing assembly, including suggesting a colony PCR, explaining protocols for assembling the multigene, and giving other advices/tips.  In return, our team helped out the ASU team by reading over their wiki and presentation.  As a result of this collaboration, our team was able to clone the sensing construct. We are very grateful to have received this tremendous help from ASU!

SZU-China,2018," L. lactis together. We went to the supermarket, bought various bands and different conditions of yogurt for them, including Classy·Kiss and CHENGUANG DAIRY, finally isolated several local strains, which were mailed to them for their strain screening plan. In return, they helped us make the content of our Mini Program abundant. They shared their amazing experience in it and helped us promote it to their high school."
Marburg,2018," them shaking at all times. It is also very sensitive to cold, so taking the flasks out of the incubator to take samples can have an impact on the growth speed. These small adjustments come with experience, and because the other teams are much more used to working with E.coli they treated the organism similarly, which worked well, but not as well as it did in our lab (after we gained experience). We think these small tricks created the difference between our growth curves. With experience it would be possible for them to achieve the same growth rate we started with growth curves that only reached an OD600 of about 1, and now we are able to produce ones with an OD600 of 14.
 
GFP/LUX
From all the data that we gathered from this experiment we formed an opinion on whether GFP measurements are adequate to realize the InterLab studies full potential. We think that by replacing GFP by Lux and measuring luminescence instead of fluorescence we could make a more universal experiment, easier to reproduce not only from lab to lab, but also from organism to organism. One of the Lux operon advantages is the almost complete absence of background signal without reporter expression. This is the reason why the Lux operon is suitable to analyze extremely low levels of expression caused by weak promoters or terminator readthrough. We also noticed we have a lower detection threshold when using Lux in our lab, which is why we did all measurements using Lux. The variability in the interLab results, represented by the large error bars and the order of strength changing, is in part a result of the low accuracy of GFP measurements in general. With fluorescence there is an excitation beam that produces light scattering and can falsify your emission measurement, resulting less accurate data. Lux has a lower detection threshold because there is no light being emitted to excite the Chromophore, instead a chemical reaction causes luciferin to emit light. There is no background! One big drawback of Lux is that it would be much more difficult to calibrate. For GFP, you can simply use a known concentration of fluorescein.
 
General
Organization
First of all, we were surprised by how complicated it was organizing and running an InterLab study. Writing universally understandable protocols for students on different levels of knowledge proved difficult. We only had to manage 11 teams, but this small number should not be underestimated. Each country has its own postage rules, which we had to learn about before we could send anything. 11 packages, each with about 40 aliquots needed to be prepared, labeled and wrapped individually took a lot of manpower and patience to pack.

Fostering relationships within the synthetic biology community is  a crucial component to the iGEM journey. By collaborating with other teams, we were able to aid our peers across the world while getting to know them a little better. Team MetaSense collaborated with iGEM teams by answering surveys, exchanging protocols, planning experiments and participating in an international effort to spread awareness and make synthetic biology more popular.
Purdue University collaboration
The Purdue University iGEM team also spent the summer working with cell-free expression of proteins and paper-based diagnostics. By Skyping with their team, we had the opportunity to exchange ideas at the start of our summer and discuss different protocols on getting our system on paper and exchange ideas about mathematical modeling of our system. We remained in contact throughout the summer and also had the opportunity to debug their paper-based assay.

There were a few more unsuccessful attempts to reach Chennai were attempted."
Unesp_Brazil,2018," if there already is any regulations about engineered probiotics and if there are clinical trials or companies using engineered probiotics in these countries. This work was done in collaboration with teams Chalmers-Gothenburg , IIT Delhi , Jiangnan China , TecCEM and Lambert . Thank you very much for all of the teams for your research!
China
In China, there is no regulation for genetically engineered probiotics, the present tests in the country approach pathogenic potential, and patronized standards for food evaluation. No companies or clinical trials that uses engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.
India
In India, the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) in partnership with DBT (Department of Biotechnology), created an official guide to evaluate probiotics in the country, so any probiotic product needs to be on this guide´s pattern to be released in the market.
Before being approved and released, food is submitted to standardized tests for identification and characterization of its new chains, such as PCR, in vitro tests mimicking the gut environment, in vivo testing to check the effectiveness in live animals, safety assessment for human use, evaluation of efficacy in humans, also there are standards patterns that need to be followed for the process of food packing and management.
Currently, the probiotic market in India is dominated by multinationals, which mainly commercialize fermented food products. No companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.
Mexico
In Mexico, all food that has been processed or produced by genetically modified organisms are considered transgenic, but food containing GM or transgenic compounds are not identified, even though there are biosecurity laws and norms for regulation, such as SEP, CIBIOGEM, SAGARPA, SEMARNAT, SHCP and the Federal Law for Protection of the Consumer.
In terms of the norm, the Official Mexican, Norm NOM-056-FITO-1995, is in force and regulates everything related to GM mobilization in the country, so all public and private company must fulfill the requirements in the norm to have their food with genetically engineered compounds transit through Mexico. Furthermore, the law of Biosecurity of GMO and the Federal Law for Protection of the Consumer controls the release for consumption and commercialization of pilot projects besides regulating importation and exportation of GM in the country. No companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.

Australasia
Prior to the 2017 Synthetic Biology Conference, we had a short meet up with the SECA_NZ and Melbourne teams to talk about the progress of our projects, presentations and wiki. We then met up properly with the Melbourne, SECA_NZ & Macquarie teams during the 2017 Synthetic Biology Australasia conference in Kirribilli, and presented our projects together during the iGEM session of the conference. The two days of the conference were capped off with social drinks and an impromptu trip to Luna Park!
Auckland University
Very early on in our project, we talked with the SECA_NZ team from Auckland University over Skype about our team organisation and the scheduling of our final exams around the Giant Jamboree. We were able to help each other out by discussing our teams' situations and proposing ideas that would work for each of our teams. We also reached out to the SECA NZ team for help with editing the fonts on our wiki. This lovely font that you see on our page is all thanks to them!

Dusseldorf
This year the Cologne-Dusseldorf team expanded their postcard exchange internationally, and we were excited to take part! The aim of this campaign was to educate the wider community about synthetic biology by designing a postcard with an image relevant to synthetic biology on the front, and information about synthetic biology on the back.
We designed a postcard featuring Kylie the Koala to inform the public about our project and how synthetic biology can be used help make therapeutics like insulin more accessible and affordable. We exchanged our postcards with the Cologne-Dusseldorf team and the 27 other teams who were involved, then distributed them throughout the university. Through this collaboration, we hope to get people from all over the world interested in synthetic biology and iGEM!

Tuesday was the last day of our stay in Bordeaux. After a short tour through the city, the team had a crepe lunch and said their goodbyes. David drove the team to the Bordeaux airport for what would be a hectic journey back to the Netherlands.
In conclusion:
- The Bordeaux team had a clear outline for the extraction and quantification of their target molecule from the cell mixture.
- The Bordeaux team learned the theoretical basis behind HPLC and how to troubleshoot a bad separation.
-  The Groningen team gained insight into the ethics of GMO use and what tools can be used to investigate that.
-  Both teams gained a list of experts who could be consulted for issues regarding ethical use of biomass, GMO-related ethics, and chemical processing of cellulose.

Thanks to the Utrecht iGEM team we were invited to be in the NRC.
iGEM TEC CEM
The iGEM TecCEM from Mexico had the great idea to shoot a music video of a parody version of a popular song, with biology related lyrics: “I got the moves like iGEM”. What’s even more amazing is that they asked teams from all over the world to participate and shoot part of the music video. As we loved the idea of such a worldwide collaboration we of course decided to participate! The result can be seen here.

Tianjin iGEM
This year, the Tianjin team in China worked on Clock Mechanisms, which would utilize some circadian clock proteins discovered in Synechococcus elongatus (strain PCC 7942) (Anacystis nidulans R2).
We XMU-China also made efforts in Circadian clock “Kai”. Unfortunately, three kinds of protein which we used can not be produced in our lab, because the DNA ordered from IDT was disabled.
However, when we talked about circadian clock with members in Tianjin Team, we were lucky enough to be informed that they could provide us with the DNA we needed. Thanks to their donations, our study on rebuilding circadian clock “Kai” in E.coli can proceed.
More details about Tianjin’s work can be found in https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tianjin
Newsletter
This year we have newsletters with other iGEM teams from schools of all over the world, like Boston University (BU), Technische Universiteit Delft（TUDelft）,TUST, ECUST, JNU and so on. Those letters are precious and beneficial since they enable different teams to share projects and views with each other, especially on topics like team information, team introduction, project description, etc. There is a link that you can see the new version of the newsletters . Through this platform, more people could learn about our projects and we have more opportunities to communicate and cooperate with the external world.

Valencia_UPV,2018,", faster and possible with todays methods. 
Collaboration
Initially, they requested us to do the interlab study with V.natriegens and to annotate how fast it grows but this gave us a really good idea. Why don't we try to use V.natriegens in Printeria? If all goes well, it would mean that Printeria is ready to work with other organisms which grow faster than E.coli, this way we reinforce the biofactory idea of Printeria. 
However, as things do not go as we spect in certain moments, we could not make the interlab with V.natriegens.
Marburg team gave us almost all the elements to do it except the strain. We had to buy V.natriegens in the CECT and unfortunately they arrived one week before the deadline. We tried several times using a leased frozen centrifuge but 3 tries later we could not achieve electrocompetent cells. As we do not have sponsors and the frozen centrifuge was not cheap we stoped trying.  
On the other side, trying V.natriegens in Printeria will have to wait after Giant Jamboree. Then we will have enough time to understand how to do electrocompetent cells. For the moment we leave you the photos of the attempts:  
On the left, our attemps with V.natriegens, on the right, V.natriegens without fluorescense.
Imperial College
Team Project
This collaboration was born when Ismael (Imperial College iGEM team supervisor) came to the Polytechnic University of Valencia to have a meeting with Diego Orzáez, one of our instructors. Taking advantage of that situation we met with him, and he explained us the Imperial College project called PixCell.
PixCell aims to get electronics and Synthetic Biology closer designing an innovative system where the culture is controlled by voltage.  
As they are also using Golden Gate assembly method, we thought that it could be a good opportunity to do what we could not do with Ecuador team: try to assemble their construction in Printeria and compare the handmade results with the ones obtained with our device. 
To do so, we assembled two of their genetic constructions (SoxR promoter-SoxR protein gene and the GFP coding sequence) into the pBR322 backbone. By using a pre-version of the final Printeria design, we were able to successfully assemble their 1-state construction by carrying out the Golden Gate BsaI reaction among our cold and hot PCB areas. This assembly product was then send back to them."
Heidelberg,2017," this idea, the iGEM Team KU Leuven started a translation center and asked all teams to participate. Each team uploaded its project description and translated other project descriptions into their mother tongue. This is a first step towards simplification and easier communication with the general public because one barrier, namely the language barrier, can be overcome with the translation center. We translated several project descriptions into German and could thereby hopefully contribute to a better communication between scientists and a broad public.
Postcards
Participating in the Postcard campaign of Duesseldorf-Cologne was a real success. Thanks to the inspiring and eye-catching designs of all postcards we started talks about synthetic biology, GMOs and other issues addressed by over 36 postcards we received.
No Science without Tolerance
Respect is an essential iGEM value and tolerance an important aspect of it. We were thus very happy to support the tolerance campaign by iGEM Team Technion (Israel). All our creativity was used to draw this lab-associated tolerance lettering and we can hopefully contribute to draw more attention to the fundamental value of tolerance in the scientific community and in public.

The Boston University Hardware team worked with microfluidic chips and wanted to establish an archive with different designs and protocols. Their goal is to fit the archival structure to any needs of its users. To support this project, we filled in their survey and could thereby hopefully contribute to a well applied, sustainable design of their archive.

Shenzhen-SFLS
This year we made a long-term collaboration with SSTi-SZGD. We helped them to build a team and figure out how to participate in this competition, including team management, details of competition, and experiment protocols. In return, they helped us test enzyme activity of CA and plot standard curves using two different methods.
You can see the results here.
In summer，we shared our laboratories with a high school iGEM team SMS-Shenzhen for they could not get into their campus during summer vacation. Furthermore, we also gave them some directions on experiments, involving transformation, ultrasonication and so on. Reciprocally, they helped us with regulating lab and data processing. We also helped team Shenzhen-SFLS with project model.
Bit
We were invited to BIT campus for a deep bilateral communication and we interchanged not only the designs of our projects but also our experience on the iGEM competition, which was of great help in improving our project. BIT-China was invited to alpha test for our website Corridor, making their efforts in establish a platform of all iGEMers. We assisted them in setting up their wiki.
SCU-WestChina
Before CCiC, we exchanged our experience and knowlodge of Bacillus subtilis on how to incubate those bacteria. We interchanged our protocols with SCU-WestChina, and helped them with transformations.
NCTU_Formosa
We invited NCTU_Formosa to be a member of Corridor, and also got invited by them to use their Parabase, a software aiming at predicting potential antifungal peptides, searching validated antifungal peptides, and finding the relationship between fungal pathogen, their host species and target peptides. We hope that Parabase can be a useful tool in synthetic biology."

Wiki Editing Tutorial
From zero to hero
The iGEM wiki is where teams write all the information about their projects to make it available for teams participating the next year, judges or people interested in the project. It is also the place where team members itself go to remember their iGEM experience and see how the project looks like after all the work done during the summer. However, most iGEM teams are mainly composed of students of biology-related fields, which usually do not have the necessary skills to set up a wiki.
What did we do?
We created a series of video tutorials about iGEM wiki editing with the intention to facilitate learning how to edit a decent iGEM wiki page to team members with no prior experience in wiki editing. This way, teams will be able to document their project in a better way in their wikis and let them focus on iGEM projects without struggling to learn how to edit the wiki.
There are lots of tutorials on web development. However, the iGEM wiki is quite a peculiar interface and amateur students might have a difficult time learning how to use it despite the information provided by iGEM about the topic. For this reason, this tutorial is totally focused on learning how to set up a functional but stylish wiki design that can easily be adapted and uploaded to the iGEM server. The tutorial consists of a total of 4.5 hours of video and a GitHub repository containing all the examples used in the tutorial. We really encourage you to check for more information about the purpose, design and contents of this tutorial by accessing its dedicated wiki page .
Why is this important?
We believe that this tutorial is one of our most ambitious collaborations, as all the teams participating in the subsequent years’ iGEM competitions will benefit from it. It also helps to solve one of the major challenges that other teams will face. By following this tutorial, future teams will be able to document their projects better in their wikis. Therefore, this tutorial is more than just providing help in wiki editing, as it will also represent an improvement on the way that iGEM projects are documented and this will have a great impact in the iGEM community.

It is fairly difficult for one team to tackle their problems along. This year, we made excellent collaborations with three iGEM teams from China: SCAU, SZU and XMU. We also attended several conferences including the south China meeting in Shenzhen, CCiC in Shanghai and Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference in Taiwan. We are grateful to have their opinions so that we made changes and did better
SCAU
Early in March, we visited team SCAU in Guangzhou and had a thorough discussion about both of our projects. During the discussion, we gave suggestions about the potential questions for their insertions of plasmids and what they may improve in order to accomplish that step.
However, our group benefited a lot from the way they carried out their Integrated Human Practices activity. What they did was that they used a rasterized world map with all lands in color yellow. On the school open day, they simply asked the crowds to paste trees and achieved great impacts. Back in March, our group was still frustrating about what to do with the integrated part, and this collaboration served as a helper. We were enlightened by its simplicity and significance, which gave rise to the first tryout of our later CCC project in Shenzhen.

The CLS iGEM team started this year on an uphill struggle. To enter a competition of this magnitude is an impressive feat for any high school, let alone one that is entering for the first time and with minimal help from any Universities. We were told countless times to wait till we go to University to enter, or to spend this year raising funds and to enter next year. However, thanks to the generosity of the School and in particularly to Sarah Fletcher the Head, we raised enough money to enter 4 boys and the PI to Jamboree although every boy has done enough to merit a place. We have completed the vast majority of our lab work without any outside help, and we are thankful to Imperial for lending a helping hand when, and only when, required. We are in the unusual position of being in a boys only team, simply because CLS is a Boy’s School. However the fact that our team is comprised from only one school, unlike many of our competitors, has proved advantageous. We are able to meet up at incredibly short notice and we have gone through the inevitable ups and downs of microbiology as a coherent unit. The smaller number of people in the pool to choose from forced us to look beyond Biology as the primary skillset of useful Team members, and the resulting montage of skillsets in our team has allowed us to reach such heights.

Imperial have been extremely supportive of our project and helped us several times when we encountered difficulties due to the limited equipment available to us.
We needed to check our cloning strategies, both when making the new parts for the registry and when thinking about introducing them into a dual-host vector. We checked our thought processes with them at various stages and learned some neat tricks (like using PCR clean up kits for something other than PCR reactions!)

We are collaborating with the following iGEM teams (in alphabetical order):
Bielefeld : Bielefeld characterised several laccases to purify municipal and industrial wastewater from synthetic estrogens and other aromatic compounds. After the European Jamboree we realized that our Sporobeads could be a nice platform to immobilize their laccases. The team Bielefeld send us immediately their laccases and set up a quick protocol for us so that we can measure the activity. We probably won't be able to get it done before wiki freeze so you will find all the results in our presentation or after the Jamboree.
Groningen : The team from Groningen also works with B. subtilis. We sent them our new parts that we designed for our BacillusBioBrickBox . Groningen could directly use them for their cloning and we got some useful feedback about our parts. They successfully used our vector pSBBs1C.
TU Munich : We worked closely with the TU-Munich to implement the Munich SynBio Day . Because we are located in the same city, when we heard that the TU lost some important BioBricks from the Spring distribution in September, we gladly provided our aliquots to them, saving their team project time.
UCL : The UCL iGEM team, visited us in Munich during the CAS SynBio Conference . When the conference ended, they stayed one day longer to help us with modeling. This afforded us the opportunity to explain to the modelers from London our project in person so that they could think of potential ways to"

Collaborations with FJNU-China
FJNU-China
2018 is the first year for FJNU-China team to participate in the iGEM competition, yet the teams competing in the first year are often lack of the relevant experience and grasp of the subject scale.
Since XMU-China team and FJNU-China are the only two teams in Fujian province in China, it is incumbent upon XMU-China team to instruct FJNU-China team and communicate with them to make the team fell they are parts of iGEM family as soon as possible.
In August, we held the Conference of Fujian Province iGEMer Community in China，and at the meeting, the both teams presented their own topics. Based on the topic of ideas, gene circuit design, experimental programs and practical application level, XMU-China put forward their own ideas, which helped FJNU-China better prepare for the competition and explain the ideas of their subject. After the meeting, we introduced them to the hospital's dermatologist and led them to visit the Xiamen Environmental Protection Bureau.
At the end of the competition, XMU-China provided years of experience to help FJNU-China to complete the safety form and judging form.
SYSU-Software
SYSU-Software
In the brainstorming stage, in order to solve the problem of preservation of Cas12a protein in microfluidic chips in hardware design, our team retrieved a large number of topics related to protein preservation in previous years. Finally inspired by 2017 TU_Delft's TDPs project and improving the characterization method. But it costed a lot of our time and efforts. After communicating with the team SYSU_Software in September, we asked them to quickly and accurately search for the previous project. They upgraded the functions of their software to cater our needs. We compared the information obtained by the manual search and the information obtained through the software search, and found that the software can be well positioned to the part of the experimental plan we need, which is equivalent to the accuracy of the manual search, but the work efficiency is improved and the work efficiency is lowered. After obtaining"
Wageningen_UR,2017," coli cells. We tested these three BioBricks:
BBa_K2306011 (T4)
BBa_K2306010 (T6)
BBa_K2306008 (T10)
We tested the cell stabilization properties of these BioBricks by drying E. coli BL21(DE3) cells that produce these proteins and measuring their viability. Apart from cell survival data, we also provided a possible improvement in their protocol. Instead of washing the cells with water, we proposed to wash with PBS. In our case, it provides a significant improvement in cell survival for 1 out of 3 BioBricks. The protocol can be found here and the results can be found in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Results of the BioBrick testing for iGEM TUDelft. We tested viability of E. coli cells with three different constructs (T4, T6 and T10). Viability was measured as viable cells per 108 cells plated.
Preservation in kaolin clay
In return, iGEM TUDelft tested another preservation method for us. We tested an easy method to dry and preserve cells: in kaolin clay. More about this experiment can be found on our demo page . TUDelft performed the same experiment for us using the same clay. This gives us more data on this procedure and feedback on the comprehensibility of the protocol we created. The protocol can be found here.
The results of this experiment performed by iGEM TUDelft were inconclusive. Either zero colonies were counted, or the plate was overgrown. However, we received valuable feedback on our cell preservation method. They used E. coli BL21(DE3) whereas we used DH5a. Since their results are inconclusive, the strain of E. coli might have an influence on the success rate of drying. Due to time constraints this could not be validated. Moreover, in their opinion this drying protocol was not easy nor practical to perform. Scraping the dried cells of the plate is a lengthy process and high concentrations of kaolin made it troublesome to distinguish colonies on the plates. From this, we conclude that our protocol is far from ideal. Although this preservation method is cheap and does not require expensive equipment, it may be more labor-intensive than expected and not as reproducible as we hoped. A next step would be to perform this experiments in different strains of E. coli and measure viability and reproducibility, as well as looking further into preservation methods. In this research, the use of Tardigrade proteins can also be taken into consideration.
iGEM U"
DTU-Denmark,2015," iGEM teams were mixed and half of the groups used the USER-cloning technique while the other half used traditional restriction enzyme cloning techniques. As safety is of great importance in our human practice  a basic safety guide  along with specific guidelines for working within the  DTU GMO lab  were provided before attendance.
The BioBrick Workshop was also a great opportunity to extract the hard-earned knowledge from previous iGEM alumni. Our own Kristian Davidsen was instrumental in running the experimental work and discussing the theory behind our lab work. SDU was kind enough to provide two alumni presenters for a session on how to create an effective wiki.
The complete agenda for the workshop can be found here  along with the SOPs , both of which can be used to inspire future teams to host their own BioBrick workshop. This is attributed on their wiki pages both  SDU and  UNIK Copenhagen .
 
No Money, No Project!
Getting the money to run such a big project as the one we have undertaken is not cheap. Therefore we have used many hours on getting sponsors and applying for different grants to make sure that we were able to participate in the iGEM competition.
The iGEM 2015 team from Københavns Universitet did not have as much time to apply for grants as we had therefor we sent them our list of grants and our template for grant applications so that they would be able to apply for the money and consumables that whey would need to make there project a reality. This is attributed on their wikipage .
 
What is Fracking?
In mid August we received a request for a helping hand from the CU Boulder from the University of Colorado. As a part of their project concerning hydraulic fracturing, they inquired our team about our conception and personal opinion of the topic. In response we provided the requested answers on a short video recording. Read more about the CU Builder project and the awareness campaign at their iGEM wikipage .

Team Hong Kong-CUHK
We are very honoured to have the chance collaborating with Team Hong Kong-CUHK. They have mentored us on laboratory skills and have reminded us what should be included in our protocols, which, helped us a lot throughout our whole project. In early July, we had our first meeting with them at their campus. We have exchanged our project ideas during the meeting. They also gave us some advice and questions which helped us improve our presentation skills and experiment design.
They have also shared their project with us and asked us whether we can help them make their device by 3D-printing it. We designed a model and printed it out. We sincerely hope it can really help them make the device easier to produce and bring benefits to the public. We have also helped them to modify their prototype in return.
In the middle stage of our project, they have provided us alternative solutions when we encountered difficulties which made our experiment much more effective.
In the last stage of our project, they have also helped us to send our parts for sequencing to check if it matches our parts. We are very grateful for their generous help.
Team Hong Kong-HKUST
We are lucky to have Team Hong Kong-HKUST sharing their experience of participating in the iGEM competition with us, for example, they have given a talk in our joint school iGEM camp (details of the camp can be found in public engagement page under Human Practices), and the talk is about how to start a good iGEM project.
Team SCU WestChina
We have in addition collaborated with Team SCU-WestChina from Sichuan, as we are working on the same topic and the same gene, ygfu, so we consulted their idea for a part of our project. We contacted them through Facebook messenger and had skyped in May and we have exchanged our idea on the topic of uric acid in blood, which has helped us a lot in our project.

TECHNION-ISRAEL,2017," Unfortunately, different academic schedules and a lack of time did not allow us to complete this final task.
Team Edinburgh also conducted an in-depth analysis of the synthetic biology learning process and the exchange of skills between advisors and students from different backgrounds. In an attempt to aid them, multiple members of our team wrote in depth reports concerning our personal experiences both learning and teaching different skills that were necessary for iGEM.
Collaboration with Team Tel-Hai
Our collaboration with Team Tel-Hai centered on the topic of ethics. As previously mentioned, our team wrote an ethics handbook we hoped could serve other iGEM teams. After discussing potential avenues of collaboration with team Tel-Hai we discovered that we both were dealing with significant ethical issues and could work together. We sent our ethics handbook draft to Tel-Hai, and they organized a meetup with two professors of ethics from their college. Together, with the aid of their professors, we discussed our ethical handbook, how it may be applied to their project, and the ethics of synthetic biology in general. The advice we received from their professors, as well as their valuable input, was tremendously beneficial to the final version of our ethics handbook.
Additionally, at the same meetup, we supplied team Tel-Hai with standard iGEM primers they were lacking.
IGEM Uppsala Ethics Collaboration
Team Uppsala was kind enough to organize a multi-national (5 iGEM teams from Germany, France, Netherlands, Denmark, and Israel) group discussion regarding ethics and synthetic biology. We participated in the discussion regarding “Social Responsibility.” It was truly a wonderful and eye-opening experience to discover both the similarities and differences of opinion concerning social responsibility and synthetic biology. During our discussion each team presented their project and discussed two fundamental questions in the field of social responsibility:
How can we responsibly and accurately report our project in media and inform public about the science we are doing?
Who do we want to report to? Is it other iGEM teams, journalists or general public? What is our niche?
The full discussion can be seen at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHIO7Ios2uc
Mediterranean Conference in Marseille
We received an invitation for an iGEM meet-up in Marseilles, France, organized by Team AIX .  This is the first Mediterranean conference ever held.
Even though we were in the early stages of our project, we decided to participate in this exciting conference. We thought it would be a great opportunity to discuss our idea with people from different countries and cultures. In addition, we were excited to bring our message of “Tolerance”"
NAU-CHINA,2018," the team, the basic aspects of the experimental part must be approved. After the preliminary determination of the project, each The tasks of the group are gradually becoming clearer. When we communicate with each other, we all have one thing in common. Most of us have a number of positions, which also strengthens the communication between groups. It shows that iGEM is a common combination, although there are different combinations. Division of labor, but everyone does not work separately, but is always closely linked.
Through the exchanges with the iGEM team at Xiamen University, we have a better system in the whole construction process of the team, and we have more experience in the future recruiting, and all aspects are more organized.
Fudan
We received the the plasmids with synnotch and surface-expressed EGFP from iGEM 2018 Fudan Team , which constributed to the construction of our upstream circuit.
ZJUT-China
By chance, we contacted Zhejiang University of Technology and hoped to communicate on the construction of the website. The two sides mainly conducted in-depth and multi-faceted exchanges on WIKI production and writing details, and also shared some problems they discovered during the construction process, reminding the other party not to make mistakes on this issue. Later, we discussed layout development, grammar optimization, and emerging Web development techniques.
Throughout the construction of the entire webpage, with the exchanges between our two parties, there will be some places that have suddenly realized each other, and they are very rewarding and have established a profound team friendship.

Improve the project of WHU-China in2014
Experiment background:
iGEM encourages  us to communicate and cooperate with other teams. We found that the project  conducted by Wuhan University (click here to see more details about  WHU-China 2014 Project) last year was meaningful and of significance to  environment and human health. Unfortunately, they didn’t finish their project  successfully. Therefore, we analyze Wuhan University’s last project and make  some improvements this year. They are also willing to collaborate with us and have already sent us their pSB1C3 vector in their detection system (click here to see more details about  WHU-China 2015 Collaborations). We start our  project based on this part. 
Purpose:
After our confirming experiment, we found that the reason for their  failure is mainly because the hxlR promoter’s starting ability is too weak and  their system will do harm to the bacteria’s metabolic system. So we decided to  change the promoter in their cleaning system and we add T7 RNA polymerase gene  in the detection system. By doing this, we are  able to reduce the unnecessary expression in the cells and make the whole  system work well.

SYSU-CCiC conference also provided us with an opportunity to communicate with other teams. During the conference, we found both advantages and disadvantages in our project and acquire significant suggestions, such as biosafety, ethics, efficiency of parts, etc. when we communicated with others. In next 2 months, we tried to solve them and change into better. We sincerely hoped conference next year can attract more teams and be more influential.

Collaboration with SYSU_China
As a new team for iGEM competition, we had confronted various problems since we established our team. Consequently, we asked SYSU-China, SYSU’s first iGEM team, for help, such as details of registration and how to understand judging criteria. As for part submission, they provided us backbone plasmid, pSB1C3. In addition, we gave them reagent for Interlab. We were pleased to learn from each other.

Water Samples
At the Oxford University SynBioCDT meet-up we asked multiple other UK iGEM teams to send us samples of water so we could measure the concentration of oestrogen and check for dangerous levels, while simultaneously looking for bacteria that already contained the oestrogen degrading pathways seen in Taiwan.
Hello iGEM Teams,
It's been a long, exciting and no doubt exhausting Summer. We have come a long way from the water samples you provided us in the Oxford Meet-up! You might be wondering what we did with them: Initially we tested the oestrogen concentration of the water, and found it to be too low for us to detect. In parallel with this we used the water samples to isolate bacteria we thought might possess the ability to degrade oestrogen. The behaviour of the circuit found in the sample isolated in Taiwan (2017) was not imitated by any bacteria from the water samples collected throughout the United Kingdom. Through these water samples we have expanded our understanding on just how rare these degradation circuits can be for such a common molecule as Oestrogen. We have all come a long way this Summer, and we wouldn't be here without you.
Thank you for helping us,
The Warwick iGEM Team
The team that sent us water samples are: Univeristy of Exeter, University College London, Cardiff University, University of Nottingham, Newcastle University. A big thanks to all these teams for collaborating with us and sending water samples to us.
Oxford
Oxford and Warwick shared DNA with one another - after both teams required more plasmids from each others kitplates, we filled in a few safety forms, met up and exchanged DNA.

BBrickIt
This year, at iGEM Team ICT Mumbai, we developed an easy-to-use tool to BioBrick DNA parts. We call it BBrickIt. Based on our experience while BioBricking our parts, we found ourselves alternating between many programs as well as the task of manually adding the prefix and suffix based on several criteria as defined by the RFC10 standard. We therefore decided to develop a software that would enable a user to perform all actions required for biobricking their standards in a single interface. More information about our software can be found here . We contacted this year's iGEM teams and requested them to try out the software and provide their feedback and suggestions. Many teams filled out our survey regarding the software including Team VIT Vellore . They also tried out our software for their sequence and sent us a screenshot of the same!
Feedback from iGEM teams
Many teams asked us to make a comprehensive user manual for this software and without any delay we created one and shared with all of them. The user manual can be accessed on our software page here .
We initially uploaded a .exe file on Github, which worked only on the Windows operating system. As the MacOS is also widely used, we also uploaded a MacOS version of BBrickIt on the GitHub repository.
Reviews of BBrickIt
Numerous teams tried out our software and we got superb responses from many of them. Kalyani from iGEM UCSD commended our software saying, “Amazing Work!”
iGEM IISER Kolkata were extremely happy to “bypass the hectic job of having to think of prefix and suffix sites, scars, illegal sites etc. before planning to clone anything in the standard vectors!” They used our software with 5 genes that were part of their project, and it worked amazingly well and without any bug.
Kyle from iGEM Washington University, St. Louis said, “The tool is easy to use and well outlined.” This software would have helped them catch that they initially forgot to add the BioBrick prefix and suffix to their gene sequence!

Calgary,2017," WB800 Colony 1 culture was diluted with 18.8 mL of M9 liquid media. These two liquid cultures were chosen due to its proximity to having a cell density of 106cells/mL but having a density high enough to allow for enough left-over culture for back-up use. 30 μL of the E. coli DH5α Colony 1 and B. subtilis WB800 Colony 1 overnight cultures were then plated in their respective quadrants on one set of plates. After the 36 hours in the incubator, no growth was found on the two plates. As such, two E. coli DH5α Colony 1 plates and two B. subtilis WB800 Colony 1 were re-made. However, there was still no growth was found on both sets of plates the following day.
Our TA, David Feehan, suggested to us that the agar plates may have been too thin to allow for proper bacterial growth. Thus, a new set of overnight cultures of E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 were made and was plated on a thicker agar plate (~5mL agar). To further encourage bacterial growth, the overnights were not diluted to a cell density of 106cells/mL prior to plating. The OD600 measurements of the new overnight cultures are as follows:
Overnight Culture
Absorbance at 600 nm
Cell Density (cells/mL)
E. coli DH5α Colony 3
0.821
6.57 x 108
B. subtilis WB800 Colony 3
0.419
3.35 x 108
After incubating the plates for 24 hours, scattered colonies could be seen in both the E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 quadrants. However, the plates were allowed to incubate for another 24 hours to encourage the formation of more colonies and growth lawns.
Figure 1. E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 plates with labelled quadrants after 48 hours of incubation.
Then, 5 μL of the diluted 8 μM DNAzyme was pipetted onto the E. coli DH5α and B. subtitles WB800 quadrants. 1 μL of DNAzyme was also pipetted onto the quadrants labelled as DNAzyme. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and were viewed using UV light.

We achieved 2nd place among high school teams, with a $1000 dollar travel package, as well as “Most Initiative” and “Greatest Scientific Rigour” special awards. We even had the opportunity to sit one-on-one with each of the judges to discuss the details of project and ways to improve going into the Jamboree. We even made some new friends in the OLS_Canmore iGEM team, who will be presenting right after us at the Giant Jamboree!
University of Calgary
The University of Calgary team got us in contact with Robert Thirsk, former CSA astronaut. While interviewing him, they passed along our most pressing question regarding human practices. This provided us with a new perspective of the impacts of space development and where our project can fit into that. They were also the host school for AGEM, and we are very thankful to them for being awesome hosts!

Collaborations
During our project we collaborated with several other iGEM teams.  This helped improve our project a lot. Our collaborations can be divided into human practice and wet-lab collaborations.  They range from podcasts, the Düsselorf postcard collaboration, and our own dear diary, to a wet-lab collaboration with iGEM Lund.  We also collaborated a little with non-iGEMers.  Through our work with human practice we came into contact with the advisory board at Linköping University for Engineers Without Borders Sweden.
Wet-lab Collaborations
Collaboration with iGEM Lund
Since we are both working on protein production in E.coli we started a collaboration with iGEM Lund.  During this collaboration we exchanged biobricks in order to verify them.
Human Practice Collaborations
Podcast - a Collaboration with iGEM Chalmers
Following the Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund we started a collaboration with the team from Chalmers University.  During the summer, a representative from iGEM Chalmers visited us and recorded an episode for our podcast ""Attempting Science"" with us.  In the episode we talked about their project and problems that have been faced during the course of the iGEM competition.  This proved a fun way for us to reach out with our projects, and to meet an discuss them together.  A link to the podcast can be found on our Human Practice page.
Postcard Collaboration with iGEM Team Düsseldorf
We collaborated with iGEM Düsseldorf on their postcard collaboration as a part of our human practice.  This is a worldwide collaboration where different iGEM teams design their own postcards.  These are then distributed to the participating teams with the help of iGEM team Düsseldorf.  Namely, to raise public awareness about the field of Synthetic Biology.  We then distributed the cards we received to students and to the public during events hosted by us.
Dear Diary
In order for us to get a better connection to some of the other iGEM teams we decided to start a diary collaboration.  We asked teams to write texts on what they did in- and outside of the lab during summer, and take pictures.  We then compiled these stories into a document that was published here and on our facebook.  The teams that"

Our financial research
A big thank you to all the teams that answered our questions and helped us to assemble our financial analyses of iGEM Expenditure. It really means a lot to us.
Previous teams
Although these teams are not present in this year's competition, they were very helpful to us and we feel the gratitude to consider them our collaborators.
The 2015 USP-Brazil iGEM team gave us really useful advice and mentoring, even long before we even started our project. A lot o skype calls with them lead us up the way of synthetic biology and iGEM itself.
The 2015 UFMG team also helped us cement most of our basis needed to develop our project. Even tough they are not taking part in the 2016 competition, we participated in their anual Synthetic Biology Summer Course, in which they covered much information about the competition and project itself. It even had a experimental project included. Not to mention how much light the shined upon us with information, tons of helpful and insightful classes and talks were absolutely vital for what we have achieved today."

Discussion
As a final comment, we wanted to reflect on the principles standing behind any GMM related legislations: ensuring citizens’ safety. As any scientific field, synthetic biology makes enormous contributions to the development of a more sustainable future. iGEM teams alone have created numerous projects, thus helping solve environmental, medical and nutritional problems. When left unchecked, however, gene modification may interfere with natural biodiversity and lead to irreversible outcomes. Government’s laissez-faire approach to the field of synthetic biology is, therefore, hardly ever seen. Yet the crux of the matter seems to be finding the golden mean as banning GMOs altogether would not necessarily make the world a safer place.

Connecting with the iGEM community
Despite this important competition within the iGEM itself, access to collaborations between opposing teams has nonetheless served to enrich our notions about our project. We put aside our adversity to allow us to exchange advice, which has been of great mutual benefit to our team. We were able to establish a communication with two teams

Collaborations
Although iGEM is officially labelled as a competition, this term does not fully portray the spirit of the event. Besides the integral research aspect of the event, another key characteristic of iGEM is its incredibly connective nature.
In that regard, teams from around the world get into contact with one another, for a multitude of reasons; to improve on their own projects, to exchange knowledge and scientific advice, to get to know each other personally, or even to join forces to create exciting projects together.
Animated Edutainment
Our team for example has created an educational animation movie, which was published on YouTube, and is accessible to everybody. Our movie comprehensively illustrates the idea behind our         project and introduce the viewers to the basic biological concept of biocatalysis via enzymes. The video is primarily targeted towards a broad audience, especially including viewers without academic background in life         sciences. Through a playful and vibrant animation style, the video aims to convey scientific knowledge in an easy-to-approach way, with the ultimate goal to excite the viewers interest for scientific topics in general.         We believe that the internet poses an extremely good medium for scientific education. To ensure that everybody interested can enjoy our movie regardless of their linguistic background, we have         collaborated with a variety of other teams, who generously provided us with subtitles in their respective mother tongues. On this notice, we want to wholeheartedly thank the iGEM Teams of Düsseldorf (Italian), Graz         (Austrian), Hamm-Lippstadt (Viatnamese) and Athens (Greek) for their great support.
In this matter, we provided german subtitles for their video project about synthetic biology in general. Thank you for your collaboration!
Security first!
We also collaborated with the iGEM Team of Bielefeld. For this, Verena got in contact with Bielefeld, which provided her with informational material and a presentation explaining the concept of dual use in science, so she could teach us with a presentation         in our meetings. Thereby we learned a lot about the issues of biosecurity and dual use. We want to thank iGEM Bielefeld for their truly enlightening work, the provided"

They borrowed pet28a plasmids from us to construct their parts but could only provide us with the bacteria, but not the purified protein product we wanted due to time limitation.
3 Meet up
We participated and presented our project in two very meaningful IGEMers Meet-ups, one local, the Shenzhen IGEMers Meet-up hosted by @SCIE and @SFLS; one national, CCiC(Central China iGEM Consortium) , which is the largest IGEMers Meet-up in China with both university and high school teams as participants.
The Shenzhen IGEMers Meet-up was much smaller, but we were still able to learn about the competition as well as the projects of the teams around Shenzhen. First, Dr. Zhang Haoqian, the CFO of Bluepha, taught us the essence of IGEM competition: Innovation and responsibility for developing the project; Originality + roundness for presenting our project; Sophistication when designing the bio-circuit. He also reminded us of the importance of several competition requirements, especially the judging form. Then he talked about his own experience with IGEM and encouraged us to work as an efficient team in the following months before the wiki freeze. We presented our project for the first time in this meet-up, and discovered several points we could improve on. The other teams’ presentation inspired us a lot and we continued to perfect our presentation for the CCiC meet-up as well as the Giant Jamboree. Dr. Zhang called us to pay attention to highlight the distinguished feature of our project comparing to the Peking 2015 project to make our story more complete. This was a truly valuable advice.
Besides the project presentation in Shenzhen College of International Education, we had the opportunity to enjoy the delicious food around the campus + the special gifts we received from the team members:

iTesla Collaboration
Collaborating with another iGEM team
This year, we were happy to work alongside iTesla to create an iGEM Guide for Community Laboratories interested in hosting an iGEM team. As high schoolers participating in iGEM through community laboratories in our city, we have witnessed unique situations and overcame challenges that other teams may not have come across. We created this guide with the purpose of encouraging community labs from around the world to compete in the iGEM competition.  In July, we found out about another iGEM team that was similar to us. iTesla, based in Seattle, Washington, was also a high school iGEM team that worked inside a community laboratory. After contacting them through email, we arranged to meet on Skype. During this meeting, we discussed the idea of an iGEM Guide, and the various aspects of iGEM that a new team would need to know.
Reaching out to the Community
Before creating our guide, we reached out to fellow community laboratories from across the world to ask a few questions related to iGEM. After explaining the concept of the iGEM competition, we posed our questions. They read as follows:
1) Have you ever considered having an iGEM team? If so, what were the perceived barriers? (ie. fundraising, finding students or mentors, etc.)
2) Would a report detailing our experiences in creating and maintaining an iGEM team be useful to you? This would involve sections such as recruiting, training and fundraising.
Out of the 29 community laboratories that we contacted, we were fortunate enough to have 11 labs contact us back, despite the language barriers there may have been. These 11 laboratories range from locations as far as China and Belgium to as close as Canada and the U.S. states. Some of these community labs have expressed that “they would love to read [our] report to know more about iGEM” while as others expressed their concerns with iGEM and"

Team München iGEM was in need for a working kill switch, so they contacted our team to ask us for BBa_K782063, a part used by team Slovenia 2012       and not yet available in the distribution. The Slovenian team this year is of course composed of different members, but we had to search for the part in      the collection of the National Institute of Chemistry and prepare it. In order to make sure the part was correct, we also did a control restriction and      sent it for sequencing before sending the part to the München team.  They additionally characterized the part BBa_K782063 and made some excellent improvements, for which we thank them."

    This year, we were happy to cooperate with BIT, we collaborate with each other in many aspects. Firstly, they did us a great favour in founding this new team. Secondly, we met each other and discussed about our project design in June. We explained the project idea and design to each other and we also discussed about doing modelling and hardware equipment. We offered some advice on modelling and they showed us some tips of making hardware in return. Besides, they showed us the labs around. Apart from this meeting, we shared the Interlab data with each other and analysed whether the consequence was proper together. We were truly thankful to be guided and cooperate with such a lovely team!

They have been working on improving this TCS for two years, which means they are more experienced than us to deal with the construction and usage of this system derived from cyanobacteria. They helped us with the approach where we could acquire plasmids containing the light-sensing components, and they also shared the experience on how they regulated the expression of CcaS and CcaR protein to control this optogenetic tools and what they achieved. Thanks for they guidance and their precious experience on CcaS-CcaR TCS.

    As an experienced team, SCU-China has developed a very mature model in participating this competition, which guides us a lot in team management, time arrangement and project designing. For example, they showed their division of labour and time table for the whole competition season. What’s more, during this season, they also gave us some valuable advice in many details and mentioned some notes for us to pay attention to in iGEM. Especially, we are truly thankful for the opportunity they offered to watch their idea screening through bilibili Live.

Harvard_BioDesign,2015," quantitative results for their various binding assays. However, it is possible that the modified pili interfere with biofilm formation. In that case, the biofilm assay would not be a valid method of quantification.
Harvard's Biofilm Assay using WPI's Antifreeze Proteins
Following the above protocol,                 we grew up our delta FimB strain (negative control), wild type CsgA curli bacteria (positive control) obtained from the Joshi Lab,                 the curli bacteria transformed with the BBa_J23117 plasmid and two separate strains with the curli bacteria transformed with                 two separate antifreeze protein plasmids developed by WPI (TiAFP and TiAFP-Beta).                  However, in executing the protocol we made a few changes which we felt were valid to strive for the success of the assay. Namely, round-bottom plates at the Wyss were not sanitary so we used a flat-bottom plate for that part of the assay instead. In addition, the curli strain obtained from the Joshi Lab was grown in 1 mL pure YESCA media (100 mg Casamino acids, 10 mg yeast extract dissolved in ddH2O per 1 mL solution) instead of LB and M9 (we were told this would be optimal for cell growth). Furthermore, the liquid cultures were also supplemented with 5 μL of carbomycin (since the curli strain itself was grown on a chloramphenicol + carbomycin resistance plate). Finally, having been informed by the Joshi Lab that the bacteria would almost certainly perish if left in a 96-well plate for 48 hours at 37 degrees Celsius, we followed their advice and incubated the plate for 48 hours on a room-temperature shaker (25 degrees Celsius) instead. The plate reader results can be seen below:
Our results indicated that on average there was more biofilm formation on the positive control (WT CsgA in row B) than on the curli bacteria strains that had been transformed with the antifreeze protein plasmids developed by WPI (rows D and E), while there was also greater average biofilm formation in the positive control than in the negative control (delta FimB in row A), both of which we expected to see. Repetitions of the assay will have to be done in the future to further verify our results.

In order to better develop our research ideas and have a chance to work with and learn from other iGEM teams in the area,                 we attended the New England iGEM ("
SECA_NZ,2017," As Max’s background is in computer science he was able to support the USYD team in this way.
Through the generosity of Synthetic Biology Australasia and the foresight of the USYD team, two of the SECA NZ team, Alastair and Jess, were able to attend the SBA conference in Sydney. This was the first time a New Zealand team was represented at an international meetup, something we hope becomes a traditional meetup in years to come.
This was an amazing experience in which our team got to share ideas and discussion problems with the Macquarie and Melbourne teams as well. This was also a fantastic opportunity to prepare for the preparation for Boston. Each team was given a 10 minute slot to present on their project in which we were able to present the major problems, applications and experiences of our year so far. Following this we were able to provide feedback which should result in more effective presentations from both teams. We can’t thank the hospitality of the teams and generosity of SBA enough. This was an amazing experience for all involved, creating strong connections between our teams which will be continued for many years to come.

From the practical part of work they have suggested that we could perform         transformations of our plasmids into different species of yeast in order to compare the         efficiency.
Collaboration with OUC iGEM team
In the end of July, the OUC iGEM team from China reached out to us with a collaboration request. We immediately agreed to collaborate with them and translated their creative comic book about synthetic biology into Estonian and Russian languages.

In the beginning of August, we contacted Hebrew University iGEM team from Israel in         order to discuss our collaboration ideas. They agreed to make a survey for us about the         sunscreen usage by the Google form and from our side we did a research about TCDD         polluted areas in Estonia and together we analyzed information regarding exposure of the         material in Estonia. On 5th of September our team participated in their livestream         conference about the latest news of synthetic biology. Our team enjoyed the lecture and         further interactive discussion with professor Jonathan Gressel a lot!

In the end of July Carroll iGEM team contacted us with a collaboration offer of taking picture with Mike the Microbe, an iGEM World travelling large friendly bacterium. Mike fit in our team really well!
Collaboration with Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team
In the beginning of July we reached out to Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team from Finland. As the idea of their project was to produce proteins, which already have colours and use those dyes to dye materials we noticed, that both of our project ideas can be applied in cosmetics field. After a video conference we had several creative ideas on how to potentially combine our projects:
Hair protection from UV light by including sun protecting compounds which can be included in the dye.
Combining our sunscreen and Aalto-Helsinki’s dye in order to distinguish whether a               person still has a sunscreen on or not - if the skin is coloured then the sunscreen is still               present and if not, then it’s removed"

Collaborations
The MIT iGEM team collaborated with the University of Georgia to help with the measurement of mCherry and protein concentration in an extract from M. maripaludis. The MIT team used the required plate reader and accompanied software to measure mCherry and protein concentration. The given samples were suspended in 25mM PIPES buffer at pH 6.8. As instructed, a designated extract from the set of 30 extracts was serially diluted to find the correct excitation wavelength for the plate reader. The goal of the collaboration was to contribute to the multitude of data points that the University of Georgia was looking to collect. We sent our data back to the team for analysis. We are glad that we could help with their project. https://2015.igem.org/Team:UGA-Georgia
The MIT IGEM also collaborated with the Wellesley-The Tech team to help test the prototype of their system intended on educating the public on how synthetic biology could eventually make colonization of another planet possible. We also aided them in giving feedback for their data visualization of personal genetic information. https://2015.igem.org/Team:Wellesley_TheTech"
USTC,2018," in this iGEM competition, either the happiest one or the most sorrow one. And also we communicated with a lot of teams about every we learnt from iGEM. Last but not least, during the conference, we met iGEM HQ Ms. Lizarazo who was really nice and kind. We had a long conversation about the whole iGEM competition, and we shared many stories about our team, which was an amusing meet-up.
The 6th iGEM Asia-Parcific Conference
In summer, we attended The 6th iGEM Asia-Parcific Conference hosted by NCHU Taichung. The conference included official presentations along with Q&A and a poster session, which not only serves as a drill for the coming jamboree, but also inspires us with new ideas and valuable advice we can make good use of.Taking an active part in the conference, we shared our ideas and studies in synthetic biology and made a great deal new friends with different backgrounds. We sincerely acknowledge NCHU Taichung for their warm services and we gained a lot through the conference."

・iGEM Japan Kansai Forum
iGEM Japan Kansai Forum was held in Kyoto University. Team Kyoto , Team Nagahama , Team Gifu , Team Botchan Lab Tokyo , Team HokkaidoU_Japan ,         and many ex-members participated in this event and shared information about their teams and their projects.
Team Kobe also took part in this event. We made a presentation about our project, and listened to their presentations. As we participate in iGEM competition for the first time, all presentations were inspiring to us. We understood what other teams were planning at that time, and realized what we didn’t consider about our project. For example, Team Botchan_Lab_Tokyo inspired us to think more seriously about our human practice.
After each presentation, we had a Q&A session. During this session, many participants actively asked questions, and all teams including presenters could understand their projects more deeply. We team Kobe are also inspired by their good questions and these questions gave us an opportunity to review our project plan and to learn more about tea itself.
Besides Q&A sessions, all participants wrote feedbacks on questionnaires so that they could share their thoughts and improve their project.

・SATSUKI Festival
May 20 & 21, 2017
Team Kobe participated in SATSUKI (May) Festival at UT-Tokyo. This was the most exciting interaction with iGEM community during summer. We gave a poster presentation to other iGEM teams (Kyoto, Nagahama, Gifu, KAIT, Tokyo_Tech, Botchan Lab Tokyo, UT-Tokyo) and also listened to their presentation. We had a great time sharing project ideas and giving feedback each other. We made friends with many iGEMers. Thank you to all of them!
Team Gifu
Since Satsuki festival held in May, we've been keeping in touch with Team Gifu.
We, Team Kobe 2017, are the first iGEM team from Kobe University. During this summer, we were sometimes at a loss faced with many problems in experiments"

This year Team Minnesota has been very active in collaborating with different iGEM teams. We contributed to Team Eindhoven's cloning guide by providing information on yeast recombinational cloning. This way future iGEM teams have a manual explaining how different cloning methods work so they can explore which technique is best for their project. We also helped Team Aachen, Michigan Software, Paris-Saclay, and Santa Clara by providing data and filling out their respective survey. Lastly, we helped Team Egypt by mentoring their new team.
Which other teams can we work with?
You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration gold medal criterion .

iGEM TU Delft
During the national meetup in the Netherlands, the iGEM team from TU Delft told about their plans of building a 3D biofilm printer. Our project is about an ion-selective biofilm so we decided to collaborate. When the K’NEX 3D printer was ready Anne and Marit from the iGEM Delft team travelled to Groningen to test if they could print with our B. subtilis 3610 comI. It was indeed seen that their 3D printer also worked with B. subtilis, using a mixture of bacteria in alginate, with using calcium chloride for polymerisation. As alginate is negatively charged, we decided to expand the experiment to also test the printed biofilm in our test device to test its selectivity for sodium ions. We tested the printed layer in our setup, but unfortunately the layer was not able to block water, making it impossible to measure a reliable value for the potential.
iGEM Linkoping
This iGEM team asked us to sing part of their Human Practices iGEM song, which would be used to create a iGEM song with all the participating teams. We submitted the first part of the song! The result should be visible on the Jamboree.

COLLABORATIONS
Collaboration with UPF-CRG_Barcelona Team
UPO-Sevilla, UPF-CRG-Barcelona and Valencia_UPV teams met up this year to share their projects. From that point on, and on-going active communication has continued. As a result, UPO-Sevilla and UPF-CGR-Barcelona teams found that they both were working with metabolic pathway modeling. Particularly, assessment of metabolite concentrations in different biochemical routes were necessary.
And so, it was time for the corresponding dry labs to cooperate. It turned out that both softwares were actually very similar, although UPO-Sevilla’s software assumed the first metabolite in the pathway to be a “source” and therefore constant in concentration. This is justified by the need to model primarily assimilation of a constant source of glycerol by Pseudomonas putida.
At the same time, there was a consensus between the groups to specialize in the format of the computer applications. UPF-CGR-Barcelona team opted for a more user-friendly approach (“Polyenzime”), displaying a graphical interface. This way, they facilitate computer analysis of biochemical pathways even for non-computer experts, and this constitutes an excellent contribution in the field. Then, UPO-Sevilla team worked to orient its metabolic pathway modeling software to advanced users. That is, researchers interested in making an intensive use of the program, or developers pursuing implementing the software as a module for their own programs. For this goal, all of the input parameters and output results in the application are set in the form of text files.
We met in Valencia in a meeting of the spanish iGEM teams and as a result we decided to collaborate.
Surveys collaboration
We have been collaborating with other teams from all over the world, helping with surveys and magazines. Thank to some of those collaborations, we have some badges they kindly sent us.
We would like to thank SVCE_CHENNAI Team (India) for helping so much with our survey. They kindly got a lot of answers from people in their country and sent us the results. We did the same by asking people in our country to fill their survey (see it here"
UCLA,2015," combat rising negative publicity and misinformation toward the use and safety of genetically modified organisms. Through our meet up, we hope to spur not only a collaborative experience in local teams to work together in solving synthetic biology problems, but also a space where teams can discuss  maintenance and sustained success of an iGEM team, especially in dire financial circumstances We hope to increase of presence in the California community, and encourage both Northern Californian and local high school teams to attend our meet up, in an effort to sustain further project collaboration.
iGEM Team Mentorship and Development
Outside of the meet up, we were honored to help assist in the development and conception of multiple iGEM teams in the local area.  Through advice and collaboration with Dr. Jennifer Tsui of the University of La Verne and David Yao, co-founder and advisor of the UCLA iGEM team, we delivered a talk at the University of La Verne to discuss our project and potential avenues for synthetic biology research at an undergraduate level.  From this seminar and from our work with Dr. Tsui, we are honored to have helped inspire and start the University of La Verne iGEM team!
Additionally we are honored to begin our work in assisting and developing the projects of the Granada Hills Charter High School iGEM Team, a newly formed team organized by student Anoop Nanda and advisor Jeanette Chapleu.  We are excited about the prospects of working in conjunction with this local LAUSD high school to bring STEM Education and scientific research to the San Fernando Valley area!
Lastly, UCLA iGEM project coordinator Fasih Ahsan was selected as a team mentor for the TecCEM iGEM team through the AlumniGEM mentorship program.  From this , Fasih assisting in implementing, designing, and mentoring much of the TEcCEM project, especially in the potential avenues for characterization of their BioBricks, feedback on the Jamboree presentation and project description, and in offering assistance for protocol troubleshooting.  He was honored to have worked with them this summer!"
Aachen,2017," knock outs in our project, this process was much easier for us.
We used primer sequences flanked by overhangs, designing them in such a manner that they would bind the sequences outside of the PEX7 gene. The overhangs are homologue to the previously isolated selective marker gene KanMX (G418 resistance) + loxP sides. When transforming the dPEX5 yeast strain using this cassette (both homologue regions and the KanMX gene), the PEX7 cell is removed from chromosome IV and replaced for the selective marker. The cell is then plated on plates containing G418 resistance. Once fully-grown colonies were observable, the genetic information was isolated and a verification PCR, using new plasmids, was performed.
The PEX7 knock out transformation cells (dPEX5 S. cerevisiae) were spread on a plate containing the antibiotic G148 (geneticin). As observed in Image #1, several colonies showed an observable culture growth. After this, 3 different colonies were picked and their genome isolated. Image #2 shows the verification PCR performed on the isolated genomes from the dPEX7, dPEX5 mutated S. cerevisiae using primers designed to bind to the sides of the knock out cassette. Having this in mind, we used a ladder that fitted the length of our amplified sequence. This knockout showed to be crucial, achieving a completely empty ghost for our friends from iGEM Köln / Düsseldorf. Getting rid of PEX5 and PEX7 genes would get rid of the own cellular peroxisomal protein import system. This important step would then allow our partners to integrate their own protein translocation system and therefore control the synthetic pathway that happens in the intercellular compartments. Through our experience and knowledge, we helped them overcome this obstacle which, as they explained, wouldn't have been possible without the knockout. The successfully mutated cells were prepared and delivered to our fellow iGEM Düsseldorf / Köln partners.
This love wasn’t one way! The iGEM Köln /Düsseldorf Team designed and produced 4 different plasmids containing the channel ATCLCc, a chloride channel from Arabidopsis Thaliana. Three plasmids containing this gene were coupled with different promoters (Gal1, Sac6 and RPL18B). The fourth plasmid contained URA 3’ and 5’ homologies designed for genome integration. We transformed this plasmids into our different mutants to further improve our salt uptake. Since we did not work with plasmids or golden gate assembly it was not possible"

CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan Fusion protein MSMEG5998 SDS-PAGE
We helped CSMU_NCHU _Taiwan team to measure the concentration of MAMEG5998 in the supernatant and pellet to test the solubility of our recombinant enzyme. This experiment can help them implied the efficiency of Thioredoxin. We did SDS-PAGE and Western blot check their data.
Figure 5 :Result
CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan team gave some advices on plasmid recombination, telling us that DNA is poorly cut by fast digestion, which makes it hard to ligate and causing low efficiency of transformation. So they suggested us that NEB should be used since it cuts the DNA much better. And it actually worked! We are very thankful for CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan for this advice.

iGEM Academy
Nowadays, iGEM has a very strong and growing presence on YouTube with many videos being created and uploaded by teams each year.  iGEM Academy aims to bring together and unify the iGEM community on YouTube. We encourage fellow teams to either put together videos or contribute already existing videos that fall into the following categories:
Project Introductions: a platform for teams to share their project ideas, work done so far and goals for the future.
iGEM Tutorials: videos that provide visitors with up to date tutorials on synthetic biology and lab techniques that are relevant to synthetic biology. Our set of lab tutorials ‘A Beginner’s Guide’ has already been uploaded, make sure to check it out!
Lab Art: a showcase of the colourful and creative world of synthetic biology.
Musical iGEM: a celebration of song and dance in the lab.
Outside the Lab: videos outlining synthetic biology work being done outside of the competition.
iGEM HQ: videos about the iGEM competition and the Giant Jamboree.
Let’s Talk: video interviews with members of the public talking about synthetic biology.
WikiFlicks in collaboration with UCSF iGEM.
Taking part is easy and straightforward. The teams that already have an official YouTube channel can contribute videos that are already uploaded onto their own channel. With the teams’ permission, iGEM Academy will feature links that will send users directly to these videos.
However, if these teams would like to contribute videos that are not uploaded to their own channel or if an iGEM team doesn’t have an official YouTube channel but would still like to take part, these teams can be made managers of iGEM Academy. This will allow them to upload their videos directly to the channel.
It is important to point out that this is a joint effort. We hope that as many teams as possible take part in helping to make iGEM Academy a base which connects viewers with the YouTube channels and videos of all iGEM teams. So far we have had a very positive response from teams and some videos have already been uploaded to the iGEM Academy channel.

USP_UNIFESP team project involves lots of molecular biology manipulations, in order to produce spider silk proteins associated with enzybiotics in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We established a partnership with them, exchanging different types of knowledge from our teams.
We also had a great time in Sao Paulo with them, attended a USP SynBio club meeting and share our iGEM experience from previous years.
Molecular Biology
Since our team has experience in molecular biology, we offered USP_UNIFESP team mentoring during their lab duties. Some Skype meetings were conducted, we discussed issues and gave protocol tips.

USP_UNIFESP team helped us having some discussions about the implementation of our bioreactor prototype.
3D printing of a bioreactor model
Our prototype bioreactor was constructed in Manaus, but we wanted to show the world what we've done! So, with USP_UNIFESP help, we designed and printed a 3D model of our bioreactor. This model was printed in São Paulo and sent to us in Manaus, so we can take it to 2016 Giant Jamboree in Boston.
University of Buenos Aires
To encourage and startup new teams in Latin America is a noble task which we are totally into. We participate in the TECNOx , a Latin American contest for disruptive technologies (including synthetic biology!) to help to solve the continent problems. We had a great interaction with teams from Argentina, Mexico and Colombia. From this event we also started a network in math modeling with experts from Buenos Aires University. The experience was so positive we brought a student (Denys Bulavka) to give a one-week workshop in modeling at our university. It was there, at the workshop, we learned a lot and we finished up this part of our project.
It's worth to remember the Buenos Aires University was the only one in Latin America who won the Best Math Modeling prize at iGEM (in 2013). So we hook up together and found ways to describe our work in math language as well as worked in prediction systems (link para modeling). We build up our model for RFP production responding to our designed promoters and check its force and also we mode  Phytochelatin production. Our idea now is to keep the partnership and create a new team composed by two universities from different countries in order to propel the Latin America participation in the competitions.

Cell Counting: Machine Learning
Our initiative to automate cell culture experiments using GCODe extended itself naturally into a software component — to count cells from images automatically. Haemocytometry — a cell counting technique traditionally used to count blood cells — uses a glass slide etched with a grid to provide a systematic way to estimate cell counts. Analyzing haemocytometer images manually is extremely tedious and some cell-counting programs exist to count these cells automatically, but none use the infinite versatility of neural networks.
One step of the initial image-processing based method
As a result, we tried to develop our own Machine Learning-based cell counting software, using Artificial Neural Networks. To do this, we needed images of cells to train our algorithm to distinguish between cells and background under various conditions of lighting and image quality. We initiated an All-India iGEM team collaboration, in which teams across the country — Team IISER Pune , Team IISER Mohali and Team IIT Madras — helped us to gather images that formed the training data sets for our neural network, following a detailed protocol we sent them. We were not able to achieve the desired results, due to issues with our model. A detailed description of our efforts is given below:

Our first collaboration was with the Georgia State iGEM team.  In 2014, the goal of Georgia State University’s iGEM team was to produce mambalgin-1 via a synthetic biological system. Mambalgin-1 is a peptide found in an extremely harmful venom native to black mambas. The task of milking these snakes is not only labor intensive, but dangerous, prompting research into alternative methods of producing this substance. Mambalgin-1 plays a critical role in the world of medicine as it mediates symptoms of and sometimes treats diseases such as epilepsy, cancer, and severe chronic pain.
To improve the part created by GSU, we decided to express mambalgin-1 in A. baylyi, and once it is purified, we will further characterize it by performing mass spectroscopy.
For more information on the work done by GSU, click here.
Our second collaboration was with the Imperial College iGEM team on their A.L.I.C.E. software. We submitted monoculture data from our A. baylyi experiments into their software program."
