We had an awesome time and met other teams at the iGEM meet-up in Paris and Marburg
We have also been part of the newsletter of Xiamen University
Our first steps to iGEM
Made possible with the help from Bielefeld
The first time we heard about the iGEM competition was when team SpaceMoss from Copenhagen visited us at the Heinrich-Heine-University in Düsseldorf, presenting their project and iGEM to us.
From this moment on, we were infected by the idea to create the first iGEM team at our university. In October 2015, some students decided to arrange a first meeting. At this meeting 60 students came together to discuss and talk about iGEM and how we could establish a team in Düsseldorf.  It quickly became clear that we had a lot of questions which we were unable to answer ourselves, so we decided to ask team Bielefeld for help.
Soon, we had a meeting with them in their hometown. As it is the seventh time that Bielefeld is participant in the iGEM competition, they have a lot of expert knowledge.
They welcomed us with an iGEM cake and we spent a really interesting and nice afternoon together. During our meeting they gave us a detailed instruction for the Gibson- and Biobrick-Assembly and much information about Sponsoring. Thanks to team Bielefeld we had a good overview and lots of necessary information which we would have never found out without their help.
After all, we looked forward to manage our project and decided to sign up for iGEM.
Enlightening Aachen
We first met team Aachen in Marburg , where they presented their project about proteases, that can be activated via light. Proteases in laundry detergents are usually suppressed by boronic acid to avoid early activity. With Aachen’s light inducible proteases, boronic acid, which is harmful for the environment, could be avoided.
To test the optogenetic constructs Aachen was in need of a light box.  Since every team lacks time we offered our help in building a light box for Aachen. Since we had to build one for our Team as well, we could already collect some experience in the construction, to produce an even better result for Aachen.
The box contains a high-power LED emitting UV-light, which is adjustable in height and intensity. This allows the modelling of the protein-construct.
"
Wageningen_UR,2017," the potential to obtain funding. We wrote a proposal entitled “Think before doing” which describes our approach on biosafety and how we aim to reach and inform our target audiences. This includes both a technical infographic as well as a comic for children. The RIVM encouraged us to think about the safety aspects of both our project and the device and rewarded us with a grant of €3000. We put our proposal into practice during the “Kennisparade”. On this day, the RIVM opened their doors to the general public, in particular children, to teach them about science. We informed the public about safe genetic modification and “crafting with DNA”. Communication was maintained with RIVM to track the progress of our project. You can check the result of the biosafety project on our Safety & Ethics page .
Rathenau Institute
The Rathenau Institute is an organization aiming to pinpoint and solve today's questions on science, technology, and society. It also has an active role in informing politicians and society on these problems and possible solutions. An important part of their portfolio is synthetic biology. The Rathenau Institute collaborated with all Dutch iGEM teams for their “Guide to Integrated Human Practices” workshop in The Hague to share their expertise.
More info
The workshop consisted of several parts. First, the “speed dates” with experts on several human practices-related fields. Each iGEM team got to practice presenting their case to these experts, followed by a short discussion and a round of questions. We got some very interesting feedback.
For example, experts advised us to get into contact with end-users, as well as NGOs, and to take advantage of the expertise present at the Wageningen University. They emphasized that, in order for a cheap and new diagnostic to be developed, it has to be both novel and successful. A good engagement will be the factor for success. Wieke Betten, from the Athena Institute (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam), said it is important for us to specify the disease we are tackling, and which population is affected the most. Other experts agreed that a clear, coherent and closed idea is needed for people to understand the aim of the project. This way, we can combine both specificity and modularity of the device.
After these speed dates we got an introduction to the iGEMmers Guide to The Future tool, developed by the Rathenau Institute. This very nice tool has exercises to facilitate human practices research for iGEM teams. For example, it contains guidelines for stakeholder brainstorming sessions, getting into contact with possible end-users and how to format techno"

Persuade members to join the team
iGEM is a competition that is all about teamwork. It cannot be done just by a few people and in order to do that, you need to find a bunch of friends who are willing to follow you and do the work. Now is the time to show how persuasive you can be. Persuade all sorts of talented people. You can get some help here such as get your teacher to spread the words, get your iGEM friends in top universities to give a speech. It is mutual beneficial because other iGEM team need this as parts of requirements to get a gold medal. With all this help, you can picture an oasis on a waste land and promise to get them there. Of course, while you trying to get them on board, you need to be a gate keeper. Don't miss any talents and makes sure those that will be staying is contributing.
Tips: Don't overlook the introverts, they won't advertise how much they have contributed.
Persuade your professors
After you have assembled your team, you have to persuade a professor (ideally with abundant fund and a good heart). Keep telling him the same story and get him on board. With the resources of a professor, you can ask for a spot in his lab to conduct your experiments or borrow equipment. Or even, the professor will help you to settle down on a research topic and if that happen, you are lucky! If that doesn't happen, don't worry! You are also lucky because you can chase your own interests now! If you think about why i"
Pretoria_UP,2016," a PDB (Protein Data Bank) input file to generate an aptamer that binds specifically to a target site.
We decided to use this software to design our thylakoid aptamer as it would allow us to not only choose a specific protein in the PSII protein complex but also to choose which area of our target protein to use in the analyses and design an aptamer for. We attempted to use the MAWS software but ran into some difficulties, afterwhich we contacted the Heidelberg team and decided on a mutually beneficial collaboration. As team Heidelberg is still developing and improving the software they agreed to run the analysis for us on their systems, and give us an output file. In exchange we would provide them with numerous candidate PDB files for them to test their system on, which would allow them to determine possible shortcomings, e.g. one of which was that there is a limit to the size of the PDB input file for the system to work.  We were also able to provide valuable feedback about how well their aptamer performed in our thylakoid binding experiments.

Manchester,2017," been genetically modified.
Any product made for human consumption that has different nutritional characteristics than conventional ones due to its genetic modifications must be clearly labeled as GM.
India has supported the mandatory labeling of GM food by Codex.
Out of the two options under discussion by Codex i.e.
Option 1 requires labeling when the products obtained through biotechnology differ significantly from the corresponding food as regards the composition, nutritional value or intended use.
Option 2 requires the declaration of the method of production for food and ingredients composed of or containing genetically modified/engineered organisms and food or food ingredients produced from, but not containing, genetically modified/engineered organisms if they contain protein or DNA resulting from gene technology or differ significantly from the corresponding food.
The labeling of food derived from biotechnology is a major issue for India as its delegation at the CCFL has been seeking to achieve mandatory labeling as set out in Option 2. However, Option 2 has also raised a number of issues of concern including the enforcement, methodology, economic cost, consumer perception and difficulties likely to be faced.
The products must be clearly labeled they contain GMO if they do.
There are no requirements for labeling products that do not contain modified gene or products do not contain protein made by a modified gene. There are requirements for labeling products of which the modified gene constitutes more than 5% of its materials or if the genetically modified ingredient is within the top 3 ingredients.
Any product containing more than 1% of genetically modified material, such as DNA and proteins, must be labeled as GM food.
6. What are the most important documents related to GMMs?
The documents related to GMM concern a wide range of issues like Manufacturing, Transportation, Safety, Environment, Health, etc.
When it comes to Biosafety, places like European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea, India, and Indonesia clearly have got laws and regulations concerning biosafety and documents are supposed to be submitted in this regard. US and Canada do not seem to have any separate regulation regarding biosafety. However, in the US, Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology (1986) ensures the safety of the public.
For GMMs products (food, drugs, cosmetics etc.), places like the European Union, United state, India, and Canada have a policy and law for the use and regulation of GMM products. To use GMM products in these countries, the government formalities should be done before use, as stated in their laws and policies. In Brazil, there is a registry for biological products. In Japan and Korea there is no such law for GMM products. In Indonesia, supplementary"

The Minnesota iGEM team created a pamphlet that will contain a variety of safety systems for biocontainment that iGEM teams have made. Examples of safety systems include, but is not limited to, antibiotic resistance plasmids, auxotrophy systems, and kill switches. This is intended to be resource for the future if teams are or will be considering a hypothetical release of their project into the environment and want to study how the system will behave in an ecosystem. It is of the utmost importance to consider safety precautions and implement them into the project beforehand. A google submission form was added to the iGEM news board so that teams across the world could input how they plan on retaining the safety of their project.
We received feedback from three different iGEM teams; iGEM Linkoping Sweden, iGEM Bulgaria, and iGEM Groningen.
We thank all the teams that made this collaboration possible.

Potsdam,2017," workings of our project. General communication continued in the form of regular skype conferences. Furthermore, our wiki teams kept in contact and provided feedback for each other’s wikis. We also agreed to help each other during the Grand jamboree by listening to each other’s project presentations before the main Grand Jamboree talk.
Team Peshawar
In order to collaborate with other teams we scheduled some video conferences via Skype.
This gave us the chance to directly exchange information with e.g. the iGEM team Peshawar. The discussed topics were amongst others talking about the progress in the lab, comparing notes inside and outside the lab and looking for possible collaborations.
Skype made it possible to get in touch with people from other far away countries with other talents than us and help each other in solving problems that accrued during our working journey and motivating each other.
Talking with you was very informative and great fun. Hopefully we stay in contact after iGEM! See you at the Giant Jamboree in Boston!
Team Dresden
“The future will either be green or not at all.” - Bob Brown
This year's Team Dresden had the idea to make iGEM a greener competition. In the first place this means to make participating teams aware of  the environmental implications of their projects and how to work more environmentally friendly.
Therefor the Team Dresden created a GoGreenGuide , an emission calculator, lab poster and much more. Moreover, they hosted a workshop during the German Wide Meetup . During the German Wide Meetup we participated in this workshop, afterwards we decided to take part. So, we read the guide and took some advice for a greener lab - below you can see the points we fulfilled -  and we also used the calculator. In addition, the Team Dresden suggested to think about ideas to compensate greenhouse gas emissions. We had the idea to give away Bryophyllum.

ITU iGEM Team Part Collaboration
We had a Skype call with ITU iGEM team. We discussed about arranging a meetup, part characterization and about helping each other. They characterized our 2A peptide-sequenced trial part and they made 3D simulation of FimH protein. And we helped them with restriction ligation and cloning of their part, K2141002. We used pET28a(+) as a vector. Furthermore, we helped them with plasmid purification. Members of the team came to Ankara from İstanbul, and we had a meetup at 29th of August to exchange parts, and we had a fun time together.
International iGEM Protocols
This year, we wanted to translate the iGEM lab protocols into different languages in order to make them more understandable and easy to apply at lab. Therefore, we collaborated with the teams : XMU China , INSA Lyon , LMU & TU Munich , Tokyo Tech , Toulouse , TU Eindhoven, Groningen and asked them to translate specific lab protocols into their native language. They returned and we achieved our goal.
Our second aim was to enable the lab protocols more understandable for new or other iGEM teams as it would be a lot easier to understand and apply protocols in their native language rather than English.
At the end of our collaboration , we received  iGEM lab protocols translated in French, German , Chinese , Japanese , Turkish and Dutch. We hope our cooperation can help other iGEM teams with their work ; Also we would like to thank each team to collaborate with us, it was an incredible experience.
Improving Harvard Bio Design 2015 iGEM Team Part
This year we decided to use FimH because of it’s ability to bind to the human epithelial cells which was used by HarvardBioDesign last year. FimH binds naturally to the mannose sugar that is found on the surfaces of eukaryotic cells. Because of this ability it can also bind to the healthy cells so we started to work on a more specific binding to target only cancer cells. We used RPMrel like HKUST Hong Kong iGEM Team to target specifically cancer cells and used their experiences to improve our project . Also we cho"

Testing the LabSurfing Platform
They asked us to test their “LabSurfing” platform. It is a social network for iGEMers, which allows the iGEM community to keep in touch and to ask for an available free “couch” when travelling around the world. We tested their platform both as a team and as individual users. We went through the test cases, including the creation of a profile and searching for other users in the different places of interest. We gave our feedback on the software, sharing opinions and suggestions with the TU_Darmstadt iGEM team.

Cardiff Wales
On August 9th, we spoke with the Cardiff team over video chat after corresponding with them through email regarding a new use of our parts. The team proposed using our ribitol induced promoter upstream of a fluorescent protein and transforming it into tobacco plants using agrobacterium. Since our ribitol promoter is a part of a larger operon, we decided to send them the sequence for the promoter. In addition the team decided to assist us on our device by 3D printing a model using STS files we provided them.
The team discussed the application of our device and project with a local agronomist, which contributed to our human practices work and project logistics. They assembled a plasmid with the ribitol promoter upstream of a fluorescent protein for transformation into Nicotiana benthamiana. They found some leaky expression of the protein during their testing.
Our team assisted the Cardiff team by helping them code parts of their wiki. We helped them interpret our code for the navigation bar to fit their pages and wiki design. In addition, some of their pages were adapted after ours.

    SDSZ_China team helped us to get some important response to our handbook from Cote dlvoire internationally students. Their responses were very essential for us because they offered the real conditions in West Africa. His gave us feedback as following. 1. You can add more information about the geographical distribution of different types of mosquitos that can carry different kinds of diseases, so that people from different parts of the tropical and subtropical areas can have a better understanding of what they need to be worried about. 2. I think most people actually living in the regions where mosquitos-carried diseases are prevalent already know the symptoms and basic ways to prevent them. Maybe your handbook will be more useful to tourists. So you can consider contacting local travel agencies and distributing your brochures to them.

65 Roses Campaign
Our team hosted the first ever 65 Roses Campaign in Israel. The goal of the campaign was to raise awareness and funds for research in the field of medical care for Cystic Fibrosis patients and CF treatments. We launched our campaign with 65 celebrities in various fields including politics, music, sports, and art to name a few. Each participant took pictures of themselves holding a red rose and posted them to their social media channels to help spread the word. We realized this promotional strategy was both creative and effective, therefore, we decided to try to use the campaign as a potential platform for collaborations with other schools. iGEM teams from all over the world generously participated in our 65 Roses Campaign. The iGEM teams that participated in our campaign are the following: BGU, Danzinger,Technion,Tec Monterrey-Mexico, Guanajuato-Mexico, Bordeux, Groningen, University of Manchester, Stockholm, Harvard, XMU China, Saclay-Paris,Graz,Bangalore, LMU & TU Munich and Sheinfel, Manchester-UK and NTNU-Trondheim-Norway.

Participation in iGEM Japan
iGEM Japan is an alliance of Japanese iGEM teams conceived as a platform for enhancing communication and cooperation between teams, as well as collectively promoting iGEM in Japan. We participated in several meetings to discuss the direction, membership and activities of this group. Two of iGEM Japan's major activities this year were the iGEM Japan Meet-up and a comprehensive, nation-wide Human Practices survey. Please look at the result for further information.
Joint proposal for Request for Comments (RFC)

They tested our combined densitometer and fluorometer . They found that we could hold the light sensor more securely using blue tack, or possibly superglue rather than the electrical tape we had been using. They also suggested we save a recording number rather than just whether or not a reading had been recorded and add the ability to download only the ‘recorded’ data. We implemented this, making data analysis easier and the fluorometer more powerful.
They helped us with our high school teams guide by giving us detailed feedback that we incorporated into the final guide. They gave us lots more advice for the ‘idea’ section of the guide, and helped provide us with other pertinent points for the ‘why enter,’ ‘fundraising’ and ‘equipment’ sections.

We collaborated with the Westminster iGEM team in order to carry our iGEM’s interlab study. We do not have a plate reader at CLS, but Westminster kindly agreed to let us use theirs to carry out the measurements. Their PI, Dr Smith, was invaluable in helping us setup and use the machines - we are very grateful for her time and effort. Take a look at our results on our InterLab page .
Carroll High School
Although an ocean away, we communicated a lot with fellow high school team, CarrollHS.
We’re happy to have made it onto their collaborations page .
What we did for them
We helped Carroll High School with several parts of the wiki. We first explained the way the iGEM wiki is structured and how to use Mediawiki formatting and templates. We later troubleshooted parts of their wiki, writing code to fix problems they were having in their navbar, footer and with the overall layout.
What they did for us
They reviewed our guide for high school teams wanting to enter iGEM, and gave us suggestions to make it more user friendly - for example, we"

Bielefeld CeBiTec
Midway through the iGEM season, the Bielefeld iGEM team discovered that our teams share a significant overlap in our projects: both teams are engineering synthetic single domain antibody libraries and using a bacterial two hybrid system for antibody selection. Naturally, we were very interested to collaborate in order to discuss and overcome obstacles in the laboratory and compare our library and selection designs. We discussed these details in five separate video conferencing calls. During the ensuing discussions, we were able to identify several important design considerations, such as theoretical antibody library complexity, methods for maximizing cloning efficiency and selectable markers for positive hits in the two hybrid. Additional details regarding our conversations have been recorded in our joint Collaboration Notebook.
In addition to our discussions, we also exchanged control parts as well as DNAs encoding different target epitopes to raise antibodies against. The Bielefeld Team provided us with their anti-GFP control samples which included an antibody with sub-optimal binding which may be used to assess the sensitivity/stringency of the bacterial-two-hybrid detection system. In turn, we provided the Bielefeld Team with an influenza capsid protein antigen. The purpose of the latter would allow our two teams to compare the efficacy of our respective antibody libraries and/or selection systems to identify antibodies with high affinity and specificity towards a common ligand.
Lethbridge High School
This year we collaborated with the Lethbridge High School iGEM Team. We provided mentorship for the team by teaching them lab skills at a GeekStarter workshop held at the University of Lethbridge. We also helped them troubleshoot issues with their lab work. In return, the high school team helped us by prepping lab materials that we would need for later experiments. As well, we helped each other by working out any issues on our wikis. Overall, collaborating with the high school team solidified the iGEM community around the University of Lethbridge."
H14Z1_Hangzhou,2018,"A, meanwhile the mixed amino acids were supplemented suitabley.                         Each fermentation process was maintained for 12 hour at 30 oC, and both of the end pH was                         around 4.6. Several samples were taken out carefully at some time points.
2) Product analysis
The comparison was made for product quality by using different strains. The results showed that                         the recombinant strain (NZ9000/pGMcA) had a little lower growth rate with regard the original                         host, but the function of the combinatory module was fully confirmed by measuring the content                         of the yogurts. The original host did produce GSH during the whole process, but the recombinant                         cells raised GSH concentration up to 11.8mg/l, which is quite comparable to the data in our                         laboratory. They also proved that the original host can produce a small amount of SAM during                         its growth process, but the introduction of our composite module did improved the SAM                         biosynthesis greatly. Moreover, high density (1.0 x 109/ml) of the strain NZ9000/pGMcA gave the                         good potential for their continuous biosynthesis of GSH and SAM in human gastrointestinal                         tract.

USP-EEL Brazil iGEM Team
In the frames of collaboration with USP-EEL-Brazil iGEM Team , we created a homology model for their expressed protein laccase, which functions to degrade water contaminating estrogens. We found that the homologous protein from the organism Myceliophthora thermophila has a higher affinity binding to 17A-ethinylestradiol than to estrone. Using the protein-ligand docking software, we hypothesized the explanations for the phenomenon in the hydrogen bond in the structure of laccase enzyme, which facilitates the redox reaction in the active site for 17A-ethinylestradiol better than for estrone. Thus, the model showed the affinity of the homologous to laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus protein to two similar ligands and it explained the reasons of difference between the interactions.
Duesseldorf iGEM Team
The collaboration with Duesseldorf iGEM Team has also given us interesting perspectives on our project and the transformation protocols of Synechococcus elongatus. Both of our teams worked with the cyanobacterial organisms, so through the Skype meeting we presented the ideas of our projects and could exchange valuable troubleshooting ideas. The team of Duesseldorf agreed to look at our protocol of transformation and suggested antibiotic gradient plates, which we consequently tried to use. They have also given us a piece of advice on the sponsorship attraction.
Stony Brook iGEM team
Stony Brook iGEM Team was one of the teams, who worked with the same strain of cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Collaboration with this team was very helpful for our team since the team shared their protocol of transforming cyanobacteria. At that moment, we troubleshooted the transformation protocol, media plate preparation protocols and antibiotic resistance for obtaining separate single colonies of transformed Synechococcus elongatus. The protocol of Stony Brook Team appeared to be successful and gave us first separate colonies which we could further use for the hydrogen sulfide assay. We, in turn, suggested some solutions for"

UAlberta,2018," in person brainstorm with the Canmore team at the meet up to share our knowledge and experience of ethics based on what they said they needed. We shared ideas of ethical issues their team might want to look into, like the elimination of jobs by the introduction of their technology, and the accessibility of their product to different municipalities and inequalities this might contribute to.
Beyond being a local team and the former home team of one of our members, OLS Canmore was also working on a project that had a special connection to the University of Alberta and the UAlberta iGEM team.Their project involves the use of mCherry, a fluorescent protein that was invented by team UAlberta’s principal investigator. This connection was a perfect opportunity for collaboration. We sent them purified mCherry for use in their experiments, and we were also able to provide them with information on the environmental persistence of mCherry from the lab the protein was invented in.
Calgary
This year was our second year attending aGEM, held by the University of Calgary. This collaboration with the Calgary iGEM team involves bringing together all of the Albertan iGEM teams. The conference allows iGEM teams in Alberta, to gather for a mock iGEM experience, by having each team present, participate in workshops, and work together to mutually improve. This year, the Calgary team was gracious enough to plan and host the conference on their campus in collaboration with geekStarter. The aGEM conference also helped facilitate our collaboration with the OLS Canmore Canada team, and other iGEM teams.
Utrecht, TUDelft, and Leiden
One of our team members spent the first two months of the iGEM season studying abroad in The Netherlands. This opportunity was used to connect with Dutch iGEM teams, specifically the teams at Utrecht University, Delft University of Technology, and Leiden University. We met with them in person to learn about their projects, and to share information about our work. We were also able to compare our progress and the difficulties we were experiencing in the early months of the iGEM season. We also kept in contact with these teams after our meetings. Team members at TU Delft were able to supply us with contact information for former members of the Wageningen 2016 iGEM team, who had also worked on a bee-related project. This connection allowed us to have conversations with Wageningen alumni about how they had created their kill switch, and considerations they had taken in making sure their product was safely contained in the environment.

Mentoring Team Ruia-Mumbai
Team Ruia-Mumbai have been working to create a synthetic biological device to degrade catechu, by extracellular expression of genes responsible for breaking the flavan 3,4-diol bonds in polyphenols which is one of the compounds responsible for the red stains caused by the same.
They approached us regarding mentorship at the beginning of July 2018. In our first meeting we got acquainted with their project and suggested different methodologies they could follow to make their project more robust for example, we discussed in detail about secretion tag to facilitate extracellular secretion of their protein of interest and suggested corresponding literature. After that, we organized regular video conference meetings between July and October to discuss the progress of their project and other aspects of iGEM competition such as Interlab and Human Practices. We discussed technical doubts they faced in Interlab and also shared data to validate the results.
Our team also helped Team Ruia-Mumbai with experimentation protocols like we shared our protocol for preparing competent cells. We suggested changes to their protocols to optimize experimentation for cloning of their construct. We also thoroughly discussed modeling kinetics of their enzyme but weren’t able to continue it due to time constraints.
Discussions with IISER-Bhopal
We have been in constant touch with Team IISER-Bhopal starting from the month of May. We discussed each other’s project and helped sort out technical problems related to it.
IISER Bhopal suggested an initiative to increase the outreach of each other’s projects. In this initiative both the teams exchanged slides mentioning brief overview about their project and introduced each other’s idea in public engagement events like Lecture Series conducted by IIT Kanpur and iGEM Day (25th August 2018) organized by IISER Bhopal.
Both teams shared each others’ Interlab data and interpretations to get a deeper understanding of the acquired data from experiments.
We also helped Team IISER-Bhopal with their US VISA procedures which eased their application process.      Along the way, we also cleared their other technical doubts and"

Throughout the summer, we were able to Skype with several iGEM teams to talk about our projects and discuss possible ideas. We talked with the iGEM teams from Purdue University, University of Iowa, UChicago, Cardiff Wales, and Peshawar
On August 12th, we went down to Rolla, Missouri to Missouri S&T's Midwest regional meetup. It turned out to be just us and them, but we had a great time. We each gave presentations on our projects and gave advice about the designs of our projects and possible areas of outreach
Our main collaboration was with University of Chicago's iGEM team. On our Skype call they offered advice on how to design our box for UV irradiation. We also sent three of our resistance genes, uvsE, Dsup, and phrAC, along with the BCP gene to U Chicago's iGEM team to transform our genes into yeast, in order to see how well the resistance translated to eukaryotic organisms. Unfortunately, the transformations were unsuccessful, but we hopefully will be able to continue the collaboration if our project continues in the future."

The fifth Conference of Chinese iGEM Community was held in Shanghai Tech University. CCIC is a platform for Chinese igem teams to share experience and receive suggestions from judges and all the Chinese igemers before the competition. CCiC Ambassador Haotian Guo queried and gave directions to ours consideration about cell’s target problems and how can we precisely control the functional particle’s expression in a complicated individual environment, which perfected our project and improved the project’s scientific rigor, becoming more convincing.

After the music, Tuğba İnanç ,our PI,                  talked about her experiences in iGEM with previous teams and officially initiated presentation session. Her presentation was followed by                  Dr. Ceyhun Kayıhan's speech in which he talked about the history of Synthetic Biology and its impact on the society.
Then, team presentations started and followed the order as Saint Joseph iGEM, Bilkent UNAMBG, METU_HS_Ankara, and finally Acıbadem İstanbul.                  We all have asked questions to each other, gave advice and shared our memories from the summer we left behind. It was refreshing to see new                  interpretations and ways of doing things. Also it was motivating to see that we were not the only ones to face problems and spend efforts to                  overcome them.
After the scientific presentations session, to have some fun and build stronger bonds as iGEMmers, together with Saint Joseph team, we followed                  the route to a tour in METU campus, which is known to be green, refreshing  and fun. Along the way, we shared our hilarious memories and struggles                  throughout our journey of iGEM.
We all think that this meetup was productive, and we wish all the teams the best of luck.
Modeling with Bielefeld
As a highschool team, we were short on knowledge such as programming and modelling. Another setback was working through the summer, when many                  people were on vacation, but the iGEM teams.
During the meetup presentations, one of the teams mentioned getting help and support from the iGEM Bielefeld CeBiTec 2018 team. They also                  mentioned being glad with how their project turned out. So we reached out to them.
Through our chats on Instagram, they acknowledged using multiple modeling approaches; they modeled toxicity kinetics of different metal ions and promoters which they can use for metal uptake related parts and a filter system for water purification. Moreover, they also had a software                  tool for siRNA, which can be used for modeling. Unfortunately none of these modelling approaches suited our project in any aspect. However,                  they wanted to help us improve our project, thus, they found us several programs that we could use to make a 3D model of an enzyme.
They sent us a list of tutorials and steps necessary to have a proper model. Additionally they taught us how to calculate the binding energy                  between two proteins and then to load the proteins into the software tool; Chimera. Here we could modify them by removing helixes and"

We also discussed about possible opportunities of comparing our work and validating each other’s project by exchanging targets and compare our results on the diagnosis, an idea that was never realized, due to time limitations.
Also, since the iGEM Bulgaria team did not participate in the InterLab study and our team was short on silica beads, they were willing to send us their own, which would arrive faster than those send by the iGEM Headquarters. Thanks to their immediate response, we were able to complete our InterLab study in time, without any problem.
Finally, we had a great time showing the team around our city and we presented them our lab space and our University’s campus!
iGEM Thessaloniki 2018 Team
Through our communication with the only other team from Greece this year and with the help of Dr. Konstantinos Vavitsas (University of Queensland) we came up with the idea of organizing a workshop in order to introduce Synthetic Biology to a wider audience. The “SynBio Workshop: The principles of engineering life” was held at the National Technical University of Athens and throughout its course we collaborated with the team members of iGEM Thessaloniki 2018. We worked together in order to create the educational material for the presentations and to find donors for the event. Two members of the iGEM Thessaloniki Team came to Athens to provide hands on assistance during the final steps of setting up and executing the workshop. Since none of us had any previous experience organizing such a huge event, it was truly a valuable collaboration and through it we managed to overcome many issues that arose and acquire new skills.
iGEM Greece 2017 Team
Since only one undergraduate team from Greece had ever participated in the iGEM Competition, when we decided we were interested in participating ourselves, we had a plethora of questions concerning many aspects of the process. The iGEM Greece 2017 team members were quick and eager to answer all of our questions and give us guidance through the first months of setting our team up.
Also, as the iGEM Greece team members had more lab experience, they gave us useful tips and helped us many times with troubleshooting. The iGEM Greece 2017 Team also participated in the SynBio Workshop by presenting their project.

Wageningen_UR,2013," controle plate for a period of 3-4 days at 30°C. One plate contained a control and no geneticin was present in the agar. The other two plates contained different concentration of geneticin: 60µg/mL and 220µg/mL.
Results
Transformation of A. niger requires the generation of protoplasts, which is a delicate process, and somewhat more cumbersome than the making of competent E. coli cells. After transformation the protoplasts take 3-4 days to grow. Interestingly, we observed growth on all the plates, including the negative controls, in which untransformed protoplasts were left to grow on plates containing high doses of geneticin.
On the left two plates with 60µg/mL geneticin and on the rigth two plates with 220µg/mL geneticin are shown. The control plates are also included on the right side of the two pictures.
Discussion
In literature study it was mentioned that geneticin has an inhibitory concentration between 60 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL for Trichoderma atroviride. For this reason we selected the concentrations mentioned above. We conclude that our A. niger strain, which is closely related to the standard ( and fully sequenced CBS strain ), is not sensitive to geneticin. Though it is possible that the geneticin resistance gene works properly in other Eukaryotes, we conclude that it is unsuited as a selection marker for Aspergillus niger.
Samples for NRP UEA Norwich
The iGEM team of NRP UEA Norwich is working on a biosensor to be able to detect antimycins, an anti-fungal compound produced by Streptomyces. For the quality of their project they asked different iGEM teams to send them soil samples from different places in their hometown. Of course we grabbed our bikes, played in the mud and collected samples to help out the iGEM team of Norwich.

Gel extraction and DNA purification kits are expensive to come by for most iGEM teams. Few of our team members found a cheaper and effective alternative for the same. These are homemade silica spin columns which have made it into the Elseiver journal, Analytical biochemistry. We sent this protocol to the iGEM team of TU Delft as they had problems with gel extraction and buying expensive kits.

Purpose of collaboration:
Provide data about the chemical makeup of water sources in Israel, present projects and receive feedback.
Description:
The collaboration with the Tec-Monterrey team was initiated through Instagram.We set up a skype meeting to meet, discuss our projects, and help each other.
On August 15th 2018, we participated in a skype talk and learned that the Tec-Monterrey team is focused on water pollutant and collecting data regarding the chemical makeup of water sources in different countries. We were glad to help and to assist the team with data collection form Israel. We contacted Professor Ovadia Lev, whose research focuses on identifying organic-sulfur compounds in water pollutants and got the required data for Tec-Monterrey team.
Through this collaboration, we learned about our local water sources in Israel. We found that in Israel pollutants in drinking water is very rare and that most of the water in Israel is recycled.  Most of the water from plants and sewage is recycled in water treatment plants that is being used for agriculture. We learned that by testing various micro-pollutants and determine their levels, the recycled water will be used (or not) for agriculture.We sent a concentration of the findings obtained in extensive surveys conducted in partnership with the Water Authority laboratory.

We also got inspiration from other teams’ presentation, applying some of those ideas in our own research. The lecture given by professors plays an indispensable role in expanding our basic knowledge of Biology."
Tel-Hai,2017," manifest spanning the world of ethics, covering subjects from the history of ethics to modern day implications. We read this text with guidance from Dr. Meshi Ori   and were inspired to write our own ethical guidelines. The insight we gained by reading their ethical standpoint inspired us to view our research in a different light, emphasizing ethics as a major component of our project.
Then came the time for our teams to meet and discuss in person. The session began with each team introducing its members and project and this is where we discovered that our projects share an important characteristic - their modular nature. This refers to the respective projects’ design, as a basic concept that may be applicable in other various contexts. Dr.Meshi began the meeting with walking us through the multi-faceted world of ethics, from the very arcane to the mundane. By doing so, we created a common language with which to discuss the ethical perspectives of our corresponding projects. Dr. Meshi enlightened the Technion team that, with the great depth their booklet goes into, it lacks a practical approach. Talking about ethics is a venerable pursuit, but in order to make our world a better place, we need to implement ethics in our daily reality.
Our benefit from this collaboration was the inspiration we gleaned from their book, which allowed us to draft our own take on ethics in general and how it pertains to our project. Thinking about our project with this newfound perspective, we reevaluated our role in the education for responsible alcohol consumption.
Dr.Ayelet Shavit then led a dialogue meant to challenge our perception of lab work, urging us to question all that we take for granted in terms of what we do every single day in the lab. The subject of this dialogue was the connection between science and morals, a cornerstone of this connection being objectivity - how can we assess the morality of what we do if don’t view it without preconceived notions? What is the role played by politics and money, within the scientific community and how does it affect the nature of the scientific work?
Rami, our Muslim team member, had a worthwhile perspecive to add to the discussion. As a practicing and devout Muslim he isn’t allowed to drink wine, nor does he wish to, seeing as how it’s not a part of his culture whatsoever. But when the time came to choose an idea for the iGEM project, he was the first to vote for our current idea. He realized that as a scientist he is duty bound to always ask questions regarding the nature and ramifications of his work, especially from an ethical standpoint.
Thanks to these various collaborations, our project grew in"

Collaboration with iGEM Aachen
Since our iGEM team as well as the team of the RWTH Aachen work with an expanded genetic code via amber supression, we exchanged our knowledge on this topic. Furthermore they tested the incorporation efficiency of our orthogonal tRNA OMT-RS pair with the ""Expanded Genetic Code Measurement Kit"" . In exchange, we modeled the molecular dynamics of Subtilisin E with the nnAA O-(2-nitrobenzyl)-l-tyrosine (ONBY) at the specified position.
To elaborate the influence of ONBY on the structure of Subtilisin E we estimated paramteres for the force filed CHARMm27 in a similar way as we estimated parameters for O-methyl-l-tyrosine. Afterwards, we virtually incorporated ONBY into the wildtype structure (PDB accession number: 3WHI ). The structure was subsequently energy minimized using GROMACSS 5.0.3 in TIP3P water and after equilibration simulated over 50 ns resulting in 5001 conformations. We applied similar conditions to the wildtype protein.
The RMSD over all frames in regard to the initial conformation was computed for both structures and is displayed in figure 1.
Figure 1: RMSD of Subtilisin E wildtype (red) and the mutation variant (blue) compared to the initial conformation.
The conformation with the smallest RMSD towards the consensus structure was chosen to represent the overall conformation and is displayed in figure 2.
Figure 2: Overlay of Subtilisin E wildtype (red) and mutant variant (yellow). The mutated amino acid sidechain is displayed as blocks in PyMOL.
It is evident that there is no relevant difference between the wildtype structure and the mutant variant. Therefore we can conclude that the incorporation of ONBY at tyrosine 77 is not sufficient to significantly alter the structure. This can be traced to the fact that ONBY is introduced at a surface position.

Peking,2017,"Symposium with HZAU
On 6th August, our team leader had a face-to-face conversation with a member from XMU and talked                     quite a lot about the foundation, organization and management of an iGEM team, in which we both                     gave some valuable advice to each other.
Discussion with XMU
In June, our instructor presented the Peking iGEM at the Asian Leader Workshop held by the Hong Kong                     University of Science and Technology. He had deep discussions with a number of other Asian teams                     there.
Mentor High School Teams
This year, we mentored a high-school team, BNDS China, from July to October. We offered them not only             guidance in fundamental molecular laboratory operations, but also experimental materials such as the             expression vector for Repressor Generator, and corresponding primers, as well as all enzymes and laboratory             equipment.
Mentoring BNDS China students to do an experiment
Additionally, we had several face-to-face discussions with other high-school teams, such as RDFZ-China, SDSZ, and HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou, helping them to design their projects.
Helping Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou with their obstacles
Offer Material Help
During the 4th CCiC, we found out that SCU-China is also using a repressilator in their project. We             therefore started in-depth communication from then on. As they faced some difficulties in knocking out the clpXP operon of E. coli, we offered them the E. coli DHL708 ΔclpXP strain,             which was a kind gift from Jahan Paulsson. SCU-China also gave us some valuable suggestions and help in             testing the mutant strains.

BioIQS-Barcelona,2018," are not alone
While creating our wiki editing tutorial (enllaçar amb link), we met other teams which were also contributing to wiki development in a different way:
The iGEM Marburg 2018 team created a guideline on how to design an accessible wiki to people with disabilities. You can check it here . We implemented their suggestions in this wiki and realized that it was so easy and so convenient that all teams should do it. For this reason, we encourage the rest of the teams to follow this guideline. We also recommended so in our wiki editing tutorial. So they have helped us designing an accessible wiki and we have helped them by divulgating the guideline in our wiki editing tutorial. Thank you very much iGEM Marburg 2018!
The iGEM Virginia 2018 team created a Wiki Build Tool which makes much easier to synchronize the content between the iGEM server and the files that are being edited locally. We have used their Wiki Build Tool to transfer and upload our wiki from the local version to the online version in the iGEM server. It is quite easy to use even for inexperienced team members in web development and incredibly simplifies the process of uploading the wiki manually. We also featured this tool in our wiki editing tutorials to get other teams to know it. Thank you very much iGEM Virginia 2018!
We are glat to see how many teams have worked in different aspects of the wiki to facilitate and improve this derivable of the iGEM projects, which might be one of the most important. This collective effort is a sort of collaboration, in which various teams work independently but in the same direction to solve the same problem.
Spanish MeetUp
The Spanish Meet Up organized by the UPF-CRG Barcelona iGEM team took place between over the last week of August. During this days, teams engaged in very diverse activities like project presentations, beach volley, listening to synthetic biology professionals’ lectures and a city tour. Five teams were present in the Spanish Meet Up: UPF-CRG Barcelona (the organizers, working on engineering an E. coli strain to increase palmitic acid uptake), OLM-Madrid , Navarra , Grenoble and us.
Maybe the most fruitful part of the meeting was the project presentations of each team. Our team did a very detailed and sincere presentation of our iGEM project. This way, other teams get to know what things we had already done successfully and what were our challenges. Presenting all the information about the project and identifying the strengths and the weaknesses of it help establishing collabortions between teams and receiving feedback and"

Feel free to browse through the cloning guide.
Golden Gate, Gibson, 3A, Standard Assembly – whenever you want to stitch two or more pieces of DNA together, you have a lot of options! But choosing which option to use for any particular task can be dificult, and that’s just the beginning; while each method has its advantages, they also all come with downsides or potential problems that must be troubleshooted. Thankfully for future iGEM teams, this task just got a little easier with TU_Eindhoven’s Cloning Guide, which was our collaboration project for this season.
We wish we could take credit for this excellent idea, but it was the TU_Eindhoven iGEM team that reached out to us and asked if we could write a chapter of their guide for them. Realizing the benefit of such a guide, we happily agreed!
Our team was assigned the 3A Assembly method. To complete the guide, we assembled our protocols, wrote an FAQ section, documented our personal experience with the assembly method, researched its history, and weighed the pros and cons of 3A. We also included a couple of diagrams and sources for further reading. To validate our protocol, we successfully used 3A Assembly to combine a yellow chromoprotein from the distribution kit with a promoter and a new backbone.
We checked in several times with TU_Eindhoven throughout the competition season for feedback on the guide’s progress. After incorporating the suggestions, we sent back our final version so that it could be incorporated into the complete guide. Keep an eye out for it to check out our contribution, as well as the sections on the rest of the cloning methods, which were written by other 2015 iGEM teams. It just might make your next cloning protocol go that much smoother!"
Marburg,2018,"11 packages, each with about 40 aliquots needed to be prepared, labeled and wrapped individually took a lot of manpower and patience to pack. We can’t imagine what a logistical nightmare working with 340 teams would be. Preparing the InterLab earlier would have been better. Tasks you never thought about will have to be completed and something will inevitably go wrong, so it is very important to leave margin for error while planing. Also sending the kits out when there was more time until the wiki freeze might have given more teams, not just NTNU (thank you!), time to repeat experiments.  Having undergraduate students test out your protocols, not team members who know the organism, would have been beneficial to find where small tips that we see as general knowledge at this point should be inserted into the protocol. We thought the language barrier might present a problem, but were pleasantly surprised by how easy understanding each other was. It was still difficult to communicate with the other teams at times. Email is somewhat formal and because we are young and inexperienced it still takes effort to compose emails (especially in a foreign language), which leads to much slower communication. It would have been better to have instant messaging where we could reach the teams fast and casually instead of email. To help with the experiments a group chat for all teams to exchange tips would have made getting information out faster, easier and possibly yielded better results. Another problem we encountered was that teams didn’t fill in our excel sheets instead making their own with the data we asked for. Maybe if we had explained how we would interpret the data the participants would have known to fill in the correct excel sheets.
 
Shipping
From this experience we learned that there is much room for improvement. Not only should we have packed the plates in a more secure manner, sending duplicates would have made the experiment less susceptible to human error. Unfortunately our lack of experience combined with our lack of resources made it so that we didn’t have boxes big enough to accommodate extra bubble wrap and duplicates. We didn’t realize we needed those until it was too late, at which point we had already bought the shipping containers.
 
Outlook
If we were to conduct an InterLab type experiment again, we would take all that we learned and mentioned above, and implement it.  If the team next year works with Vibrio natriegens aswell, they could examine if teams that have worked with V. natriegens before had better results because of their experience with the organism. Probably by then we would have the VibriClone strain that can live in colder temperatures, eliminating the fridge problem.

University of Edinburgh
The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of polystyrene performed could not have been done without the help of Ivonne Robledo and the University of Edinburgh’s iGEM team. They were kind enough to offer us assistance on developing the life cycle assessment and visualise the real impact that our project would have on the environment, from the first steps of reducing EPS waste to finally biodegrading it into biomass products. While assessing the impacts of currently produced plastics may help with understanding of their environmental effects, polystyrene and other common synthetic polymers have been around and unreplaced for almost a hundred years (Dow Chemical, 2012), another important issue to tackle in the modern world is the creation of new, eco-friendly plastics that leave a weaker trace on the environment.
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a polyester category of bioplastics that are ubiquitously found to be produced by various sugar and lipid fermentation processes as a form of energy storage (Jingnan et al, 2009). Their polymers may comprise of up to 200 different monomers that can combine to produce materials that completely differ from each other by properties.
The University of Edinburgh’s overgraduate team project focused exactly on the production of one form of PHAs that they plan to derive from whiskey distillery by-products, called poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-3-hydroxyvalerate) or PHBV. In their LCA analysis, they have confirmed that production of PHBV biopolymers would have an overall positive environmental impact and believe that further investigation and work on their pathway might improve the world of PHA bioplastics. While collaborating on the LCA, we found that the pathways our projects are using coincide at a specific point, enabling the products TodH breakdown of 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate; acetaldehyde and pyruvate, to be further processed into PHBV polymers through their PHA operon.
Testing on the intercorrelation of styrene degradation and PHA production has previously been done and found that 10% of polystyrene mass fed to the bacteria ends up converted into PHA polymers (Ward et al, 2006), offering exciting insight for"

iGEM Kyoto
We had a meetup with Team Kyoto. Ryo NIWA, a leader of our team went to Kyoto as a representative of team Gifu. We discussed the progress of the projects and some iGEM regulations. At that time, iGEM Kyoto provided us with KELN, a software which automatically translates a lab notebook into HTML. With the system, we made a calendar and some tables of components of media for cell growth. In return, we offered feedback to team Kyoto about software KELN. Even though you don’t know about HTML, you can use KELN and make some figures for wikis. It is completely workable for anyone and highly recommended to use. Thank you to iGEM Kyoto and Dr. Woltjen, secondary PI of the team.

One of our members visited Nanjing university on August 26, 2018. Our team leader sent the file of the project before the discussion. We had a small discussion regarding each project. Also, iGEM NJU-China held a lab tour to consider the lab rules for the safety.  Our member was given an explanation about how to use their laboratory instruments safely during the tour. They also offered some talks about their project. During the past few years, NJU-China focused on the ligand-receptor system targeting certain tissues or cells with the exosome containing siRNAs as a new therapy towards certain disorders. This year, they found a more specific element targeting the subcellular structure, dendrites of neurons. The element comes from the 5’-UTR (untranslated region) of a lentivirus, and they made several tests to find the most suitable package of the element. Visit their wiki page !

96% of people who answered to the survey in Greece are from scientific studies while only 70% for France. Despite that, it looks like french people answered with more accuracy than greek people. But it may be because of statistics, indeed, we received approximately 550 french answers and only 100 greek answers.
Postcard project
Done for : Gröningen Team
Description
The Gröningen Team set up a project to exchange postcards about synthetic biology. Each participating team creates its own postcard.
Our postcard
We chose to draw our logo on a petri dish with orange and yellow E. coli. Indeed, after a brainstorming was done in May, we still had two iGEM projects. One about cholera/crocodile and the other about modifying bacteria depending on light so it could form a drawing. We ended choosing the crocodile project so this postcard was the opportunity to mix our 2 main projects: crocodile and art.
Database of host organisms called ChassiDex
After filling out the survey of IIT Madras Team they sent us their database and asked for help to fill it. Indeed, ChassiDex is a database to gather the main information on organisms in order to modify them easily. Information such as biosafety level, genotype of strains, protocols of transformations and also iGEM BioBricks already available are collected to help future iGEM teams to quickly choose their organisms and to find relevant literature about it.
In the context of our project Croc’n cholera we entered data for Pichia pastoris SMD1168H and Vibrio harveyi JMH626
Meetups
We participated in the European iGEM Meetup in Delft on the 7th of July and also in the French Meetup in Paris on the 22nd of July.
It was obviously a nice way to practice our presentation and our poster before going to the Giant Jamboree, but it also enabled us to discuss our project with other iGEMers and scientists. As we presented the context of cholera and our ideas of a solution with synthetic biology, we got to confront with a lot of questions about ethics, safety and usefulness of our project. People gave us interesting feedbacks and it made us question our solution from other perspectives.

Leiden,2018," 100 ppm hydrogen peroxide (+) and a negative control without hydrogen peroxide (-). H2O2 does not induce a response in the wildtype, which does not contain a GFP gene and is therefore used             as negative control. The strains containing pSoxS, pUmuc, pBaeS and plbpA also do not show a stress response when exposed to 100 ppm hydrogen peroxide. The strains pKatG, pRpoE, pSpy, pInaA and pCpxR do show a positive stress response             due to hydrogen peroxide exposure.
We look back on this collaboration as a very positive influence on our project as we were able to test the toxicity of nalidixic acid, a known antibiotic, on mammalian cells. We think this is a very meaningful addition to our own system.           Thank you iGEM UC Davis for your collaborative input and we look forward to meeting all of you in Boston!

Utrecht,2018," For those reasons, we decided to stay in touch and update each other about problems and solutions, which formed the base for our collaboration. An example of our similar approaches was found in the way both our teams dealt with our intended use of split luciferase. Both teams intended to use reconstitution of a split luciferase as a way to create a read-out signal from the chemotaxis pathway. Unfortunately, we found out that luciferase could not be split again after reconstitution, making this approach impossible. These findings were shared between teams, after which we composed a strategy to find alternative approaches for this problem. We split up this task and shared outcomes with each other, which lead to our current solution to this issue.
In the future, we also aim to integrate our engineered bacteria in the autonomous robot AROMA from Zürich. We hope their biosensor will improve the range of detectable concentrations, while also broadening the range of substrates that could potentially be bound.
European  meetup in Munich (20 – 22/7/18)
During the European iGEM meetup 2018 in Munich (20th - 22nd July 2018), we contributed to the organisation by organising a Teambuilding Workshop for approximately 40 students in total. This workshop was inspired by both Amy Edmonson’s TEDx talk: ‘How to turn a group of strangers into a team?’ and the story about the Thailand cave rescue. We discussed the ways people with different cultural and academic backgrounds who did not know each other before, had to work together in one team to achieve their mutual goals similar as in the Thailand cave rescue. This truly reflects the collaboration within any iGEM team: all individual team members of the separate iGEM teams have one common goal: make the project succeed and win as much medals as possible at the Giant Jamboree, and teams consist of members with different cultural and academic backgrounds. In situations comparable to the Thailand cave rescue, especially good communication within a group of strangers, is essential in order to complete the task.
After the theoretical part, the participants got the chance to experience how difficult it is to communicate in a group of strangers by completing the ‘blindfolded rope square task’. In teams of 10 members, they had to make a perfect square out of a 15 meter rope within a 20 minute time limit, without knowing each other’s names. For this challenge each individual was blindfolded while holding the rope, which they were not allowed to let go of. Almost every team managed to make a perfect square in time.

Bioprocess mentoring
Another collaboration with the Manaus team was mentoring in bioprocesses, since one of the research groups involved in our work has great experience in this area. We had Skype meetings to discuss the use of models to implement the first tests of the bioreactor for mercury contaminated waters streams treatment.
Molecular Biology mentoring
UFAM-UEA team offered us molecular biology mentoring via Skype. Their tips helped us in our difficult task to polymerize MaSp DNA sequences, in order to obtain a greater number of ‘mer’ units for expression of this silk protein in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. They also contributed by telling their previous iGEM experience, better explaining the criteria to be evaluated and giving tips on how to build our wiki page.

Yan Oi Tong Tin Ka Ping Secondary School
1 teacher and 3 students from the school came to our lab SC364, and we taught some synthetic biology techniques to them. They performed transformation of E.coli TOP10 and spreaded plates under our supervision.  They helped us to spread our survey regarding cold-influenza distinction in their school and we have collected the opinions from a younger audience.
United Christian College
4 secondary school students from the school came to our lab SC364. We provided competent cells and plates for them to carry out their Interlab experiment. We also provided our plate reader BMG CLARIOStar for them to measure absorbance and fluorescence for their samples.  In addition, they helped us to spread our survey regarding cold-influenza distinction in their school and we have collected the opinions from a younger audience."

1. Modelling
NUSgem assisted iGEM Stockholm with the modelling of two of their genetic circuits: Cumate and Tryptophan. Using their timing diagram and genetic circuit, we generated the functional models of these two genetic circuits. In addition to generating the functional models, we also performed sensitivity analysis and provided feedback and possible improvements that could be made to their designs.

NEU-China,2017," vectors is heavy. We helped                                         them to construct hpRNA producing vector ecrL, which sped up their vectors construction                                         progress.
For us:
Teammates of Lanzhou helped us to construct the distribution of the olfactory receptor                                         Rho-OR1A1. Since the position of the initiation codon 64bp in the OR1A1 sequence                                         contained the EcoRI site which did not conform to the RFC10 standard, they used the                                         primer containing the synonymous codon to mutate the site and successfully mutated                                         the GAA to GAG.
With ZJU_China
Another partner was ZJU_China, we had a leisure talk about projects with their teammates                                         in their laboratory in the end of the July.We later had collaborated in fluorescence                                         detection tests. In their project, they only observed the fluorescence by fluorescence                                         microscope, while we used Microplate Reader to detect the EGFP expression in the                                         hyphae of T. atroviridewe.
First, we cultured Trichoderma that has been transformed EGFP and wild Trichoderma,                                         and then we picked mycelium for fluorescence detection, the following table for the                                         data:
The data we provided them were more quantitatively and measurable which proved that they have succeed in expressing heterogenous                                         gene in our aiming chassis.
For us:
The iSmeller biosensor constructed in our project will activate the cAMP pathway after                                         binding of the odor molecule with specific olfactory receptor. To determine whether                                         the activation of the cAMP pathway can be used as a test indicator for our reporter                                         gene (luciferase), the igem team of Zhejiang University has helped us to make a luminescence                                         detection by stimulation of forskolin which is a kind of adenylate cyclase activator.                                         Demonstrating that our reporter gene is available to respond to the activation of                                         the cAMP pathway, which further proves the feasibility of our experiment.
With NKU_China
We also helped Nankai University to verify the function of the lyase gene. We synthesize the lyase gene whose sequence from Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp10 and transformed it into Enterobacter sp. FY-07. After we added the inducer (arabinose), it is obvious that the bacteria begin to die which will ensure that the bacteria will die after working, and will not affect the environment.
For us:
Teammates of NKU_China helped us to construct the distribution of the olfactory receptor Rho-OR1D2.

Major Collaboration- wet lab with  NTU Singapore
Bidirectional Collaboration With NTU Singapore
For the third consequtive year, Macquarie University has collaborated with the NTU Singapore iGEM team . After a number of discussions, we were able to organise ways so that we could both assist each other.
Following our success last year in the purification and in vitro assays of their dCas9 constructs, they requested that we repeat said process with their new mutant variants this year.
To assist us, we required them to perform a quantitative PCR on two of our composite Chlorophyll biosynthesis parts. BBa_K2664007 which adds a tail to protochlorophyllide, turning it into chlorophyll a (Figure 4) and BBa_K2664006 which adds a magnesium ion to protoporphyrin IX (Figure 5). As we have changed the promoters from lac to trc on a number of parts, we wished to quantify protein expression after induction with IPTG in our parts.
What We Did For Them:
The in vitro assay that we performed was on four truncated dCas9 mutants: 3ple, 3ple 4QHP, Rec2_HNH, and Rec2_HNH 4QHP.  This project used the dCas9 enzyme to form a Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with gRNA, and subsequently bind to the target sequence in our PCR product (similar to what we did for the last two years). The results from the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) show that the dCas9 enzymes (3ple, 3ple 4QHP, Rec2_HNH, and Rec2_HNH 4QHP) no longer retain their nuclease activity (see Figures 2,3). This is evident from the gel shift present, the shift of the target sequence protein, indicating the mutant dCas9 has bound the target sequence of DNA from its slower migration through the gel (see Figure 2,3).

TecCEM,2018," doubt that the feedback provided by the                         specialists was crucial for the proper development of the projects, and beyond the                         scientific issues, we were able to get to know each other, get along and create bonds of                         collaboration and support between the teams.
Finally, our MeetUp was so relevant that it appeared in the magazine of our university                         CONECTA, so all the professors and students hear about it. The note can be found in the                         following link.
Primer Meet-up iGEM LATAM
Tec-Chihuahua
A great number of the iGEM teams are formed by undergraduate students, being still students,                         difficulties may come up during this period of time. While developing our projects, the                         team Tec-Chihuahua and our team had some struggles. After a long time of working hard, but                         not having results, we discovered that our IDT parts did not work properly. At that moment                         we started to examine the problem, in order to find a solution together. We found out that                         our oligos were missing base pairs before the suffix and after the prefix, affecting the                         correct function of the restriction enzymes during ligation. Therefore, during a brainstorm                         between the two teams, Tec CEM decided to create specific primers for the suffix and                         prefix, which add this extra pairs when our parts are amplificated. So, we designed and                         studied the best protocol to implement them and sent the information with the primers to Tec-Chihuahua for them to continue with their amazing project. By this making, they                         achieved results for their project.
So a problem that both of our teams had was worked out together for us to develop our                         projects and succeed at the competition.
iGEM TEAM Bioluminati IIT Kanpur Part BBa_K1629002 and Survey
Our planet is begging for help and each day that goes by our ecological footprint grows                         bigger and the conditions of the environment get worse. Because of this, the Biolluminati                         Team from ITT Kanpur were working to eradicate all kinds of detergents from the ocean.                         Being conscious of this problem, when they asked for the previous iGEM TecCEM from 2015                         part (BBa_K1629002) the sdsA Alkyl sulfatase enzyme from Pseudomona, which is capable of                         degrading SDS, we were happy to share it with them.
Also, we had the pleasure of answering a survey they posted in the iGEM                         Teams/Collaborations page called“Survey to Combat Water Pollution”,"

Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. It is encouraged that you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems which are easier to solve together.
iGEM Peshawar:
Our team collaborated with iGEM Peshawar, a first time participant and the first team ever from Pakistan to participate in iGEM. Since they were new to iGEM, they were quite inquisitive about it and we tried to help them as much as we could by addressing their questions. We had a separate Skype meetup with their team where we discussed each other’s ideas and about the wet lab procedures, the Giant Jamboree among other things. Since they were a little late with starting their wet lab work due to late registration and late shipment of the kit, we gave them some suggestions about how to go plan different experiments of the project in order to make most out of the limited time that they have. Advised them about which assembly protocol to follow, how to attribute the work in the group etc. They were quite friendly and we also shared some light moments after the Skype meetup. Apart from the Skype session, we helped them address the issues they faced as they went ahead with the project through regular interactions via email and social media. We also helped them spread their survey and we are thankful to them to help us spread our survey too.
IIT Madras:
iGEM IIT Madras team has made a wonderful android game related to Synthetic Biology. It was a great initiative by the team and it has inspired the fellow teams to think of such cool ways to spread the Synthetic Biology concepts. The game shows ribosomes “eating” the plasmids as the game progresses, which shows that the plasmids are expressed by the Ribosomes. They asked us to play and review the game for them which can be used to make the game better and come up with better versions in the future. We suggested them to increase the difficulty level of the game and to include more such modules where the role of each part of the cell the gene expression can be explained"
NYMU-Taipei,2018,"1C3 backbone. (For more details please look into their collaboration page .)
We returned their favor by supplying them with chemicals, reagents such as PEG8000 and MR17 broth. We also lend them electroporation machine and provided protocols for electroporation of Lactobacillus. Access and instructions for plate reader were given by us as well.
We are thankful for the help from TAS and hope to keep on collaborating with them afterwards.
iGEM Team of
Tokyo Tech
While working on our screening model, we found out that Tokyo tech is using similar techniques. Their topic this year is to develop an affordable kit to detect Dengue virus and predict its serotype. Although we have very different goals, both of our teams have faced the same problem of ELISA being too expensive to put into practice. In our online meeting, we conversed about the pros and cons of different modeling techniques and the issues that come up when we do not use ELISA. The discussion with them inspired us in improving our project, and we have maintained contact with them ever since. We hope that the meeting was just as useful for them and wish the best of luck for their project.

The University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM team has aided the High School iGEM team in troubleshooting wet lab experiments, specifically with the assembly of our three constructs Nuclease (BBa_K1792004), Dextranase (BBa_K1792002), and Petal Death Protein (BBa_K1792000). Advice was given with experiments such as transformations, restriction digests, ligations, minipreps, and construct design.
In addition to our collaboration with the University of Lethbridge iGEM team, we organized and hosted an Alberta wide wet-lab workshop designed to teach basic wet lab protocols to High School iGEM teams all across Alberta. Five high school iGEM teams, Consort, Our Lady of the Snows, Ted Harrison, Central Memorial High School, and Lethbridge were in attendance for the two day event.  Protocols of Ligations, Making Competent Cells, Transformations, Minipreps, and Gel Electrophoresis were taught, to name a few.

Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.
Which other teams can we work with?
You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration silver medal criterion.
In order to meet the silver medal criteria on helping another team,"
ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,", we sacrificed mice after 5-day treatment with hEGF or saline, and measured the weight changes over time, as well as the colon length. We found hEGF, but not saline enema rescued the weight loss phenotype (Fig. 3). In addition, the colon length of hEGF treated group was longer than that of saline (Fig. 4). In aggregate, with the joint efforts from both two iGEM teams, we consolidated that recombinant hEGF protein produced from engineered bacteria can effectively relieve several IBD symptoms in an in vivo model, suggesting engineered bacteria capable of releasing therapeutic agents (such as hEGF) could be an attractive approach to fight against IBD.

FAFU-CHINA
We have been keeping a good relationship with FAFU-CHINA iGEM team (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University). At the beginning, we had some troubles in gene cloning. We therefore sought help from FAFU iGEM team. FAFU team was very helpful and finished a very important part cloning pNorV (Reference can be seen in NO Sensor ) in two weeks.
We have also helped the advancement of their project. In their project, they aimed to use Chlamydomonas reinhardti to co-express toxin genes cry and cyt by a 2A-peptide system and purify proteins for bio-activity validation. (Cry and Cyt toxins are Bti toxins that are effective in killing various species of mosquitoes, fungus gnats, and blackflies, while having almost no effect on other organisms. ) They therefore asked our team to help purifying from bacteria by His tag. We were able to finish the protein purification on time and got the bio-activity validated by FAFU-CHINA team. We thought it is helpful to their team and we enjoyed helping each other to improve each other's projects.

DTU
Our initial plan was to both create and test microfluidic devices and the tools not only in E.coli, but also to manufacture and test it for yeast.  However, as we lacked some necessary  components in order to work with yeast we asked the iGEM team of the Technological University of Denmark (DTU) for assistance, which we knew after the Nordic iGEM Conference worked with yeasts. They supplied us with both a strain and required shuttle vectors, which we would have used if we had been able to perform the Yeast tests.   DTU later contacted us back regarding help with their shuttle vector between E. coli and Y. lipolitica. They were trying to insert chromoproteins into the shuttle vector, but had so far been unsuccessful. As we had chromoproteins in stock from prior iGEM Uppsala teams, we moved one of the chromoproteins from the psB1A3 backbone into the shuttle vector. To simplify the assemblies we first moved the standard RFP producing insert into the previously empty insert site of the shuttle vector. Visual analysis was done in order to compare overnight production of the chromoprotein and RFP in the shuttle vector to the production of the proteins in the standard psB1A3 backbone. The comparison was done with E. coli cells transformed with the empty shuttle vector as control. These tests showed no observable difference in the production of chromoproteins in the shuttle vector compared to psB1A3.
Aalto-Helsinki
The Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team helped us by supplying us with protocols for working with yeast.
Stockholm
To try their linker between spiderweb and a protein the Stockholm iGEM team asked for the UnaG protein. As UnaG requires the cofactor bilirubin to fluoresce, which can both be added and washed away, it is a good protein for characterization. We therefore assembled a plasmid with RBS and UnaG under the control of the specifically requested T7 promoter"

2. Cooperate with Team UESTC -Software About Wiki
In the wiki exchange group in China, we had the honor to get acquainted with the team of University of Electronic Science and Technology (UESTC-Software) and we provided some useful helps for them to build their wiki pages and they shared their experiences with us. At their invitation, we used the database established by their team to query the wiki page design of previous teams and some other statistics useful to us. Finally, we gave them some appropriate suggestions on how to improve the database.
3. Cooperate with Team Peking About Modeling
iGEM team Peking comes from Peking University. We discussed our projects during the joint conference we held in Nankai University. And they provided us with many valuable suggestions in mathematical modeling during the 5th Conference of the China iGEMer Community (CCiC). We keep a long-term communication with Peking since then and has benefitted from them a lot.
4. Publicize Synthetic Biology with Team TUST_CHINA and Team Tianjin
After meticulous preparation, NKU-CHINA held a science popularization activity for senior high school students together with team TUST_CHINA and team Tianjin . We went to Tianjin No. 13 Middle School to publicize the knowledge of synthetic biology, meanwhile, to understand the current situation of education about biology in middle schools.
This is a very meaningful publicity; students are very interested in what we introduced. Many of them heard these for the first time and can't wait to participate in the competition. We gave some guidance to them and tried our best to help their school build up an iGEM team.

Collaboration
Our ability to write, read and share knowledge yields high attribution to human intelligence and its modernized environment.             Without it, we won't be able to stand where we are.             Scientists from all over the world work relentlessly on their research projects,             all aiming for the same goal;             to accomplish innovative and groundbreaking research, such that novel and valuable knowledge can be spread across the world,             and it is very unfortunate if these get lost because of language barriers.
Translation Service
The most common language that science is shared in and communicated throughout is English,             which is understood and spoken by most people.             However, not everyone is able to learn English due to poverty, isolation and tradition.            That is why we came up with a translation service.                         We aim to give everyone the opportunity to be informed of what iGEM is and what the students achieve during this competition.             It is also a great way for them to get in touch with synthetic biology and genetic manipulation and to explore its potential for reproducibility,             something that is currently held back and limited due to negative perceptions by the masses.
The purpose of this service is to translate the project descriptions of every team that we collaborate with into as many languages as possible.             To facilitate this collaboration,             we created a Google Drive account in which every collaborating team has been granted access as well as their own folder.             Every team adds their project description in their corresponding folder and every collaborating team will translate each             other's descriptions into their own native language,             in which they will put the translated file next to the original team description in the folder of the translated team. In the end,             every team's folder should contain a list of files with different languages,             such that people from every corner of the world can read project descriptions that are available in their native language(s).
During the competition, 15 fellow iGEM teams, for which we express our deepest gratitude, were willing to collaborate with us and make the projects more accessible to less educated people. We also chose to implement this collaboration on our Wiki-page as"
Grenoble-Alpes,2017,"ONIS-PARIS team
This Parisian team counts several iGEM participations now. This is after the publication of a press article concerning their previous work in 2016 that we started to get in touch. As iGEM Grenoble-Alpes team is back on tracks after many years of absence in Boston, iGEM IONIS helped us through the human practices area. Via internet meetings, the sensitive subject of the genetically modified organisms (GMO) was talked through. Questions on how it’s spreading could be avoided were considered.
Collaboration with iGEM INSA-UPS team
Aware that cholera’s outbreak can cause many issues in countries where health inequalities strike, we noticed that another French team decided to work on cholera! That is why we decided to team up. The idea was to think about how to better manage health crisis by the means of our devices, how our projects can better assess the care quality during health crisis such as the one in Yemen.
iGEM INSA-UPS chose to focus on the detection and removal of Vibrio Cholerae on water, thanks to an ingenious bacterial communication system, on which you can have further informations here .
On the other hand, iGEM Grenoble-Alpes decided to detect Vibrio Cholerae for human diagnosis in particular.
Both projects are obviously complementary, which makes the collaboration even more interesting. In fact, our two projects propose two different but complementary solutions to better manage a Cholera epidemic. These two solutions could be brought to Non Governmental Organisations to help improve both diagnosis and decontamination of Cholera.
In a collaborative state of mind
We also decided to help iGEM Vilnius , iGEM Washington , iGEM Dalhousie , iGEM Waterloo and iGEM IONIS-PARIS teams with their surveys!

FAU_Erlangen,2016," familiarize ourselves with all iGEM standards. Team Marburg hosted the German meetup, so we decided to attend to get new ideas and perhaps some help. After the meetup, many teams offered us advice but we worked especially closely with team Marburg. Team Marburg and us designed a “game of cells” and chose to stay in contact.
Planning this year’s project, we thought about acquiring a high-quality biofilm and remembered a key detail from Marburg’s last year’s project: Curlis. So we asked our friends if they could send us the E. coli strain W3110 and their BioBrick pPickUp encoding CsgA, a part of Curlis. As this wouldn’t be enough, CsgA was tagged with a SpyTag – part of our own last iGEM project. Perfect teamwork!
Thanks to team Marburg for sending us the constructs and the E. coli strain W3110!

SYSU-MEDICINE
We hypothesized that the EGF (epidermal growth factor) produced by our engineered bacteria can be a therapeutic molecule for IBD (inflammatory bowel disease). To test this in an animal model, we collaborated with another iGEM team, SYSU-MEDICINE, who decided to apply mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy to cure IBD. We therefore purified human EGF proteins from bacteria and sent them to SYSU-MEDICINE team, who can evaluate whether our hEGF can be effective in treating IBD in their mice model. Both teams were excited to find that hEGF can significantly alleviate several IBD symptoms. Reference can be seen in wiki of SYSU-MEDICINE .
The detailed procedures are described in the following:
Purification of hEGF
To facilitate protein purification, we engineered a His-tag in the C-terminal of hEGF (Fig. 1A). A string of the string of histidine residues (6x His-tag) binds to several types of immobilized metal ions, such as nickel, under specific buffer conditions. In addition, anti-His-tag antibodies are commercially available for detection of target protein by western blot. In either case, the tag provides a means of specifically purifying or detecting the recombinant protein without a protein-specific antibody.

SYSU-Software,2017," held with SYSU-CHINA on which we managed to explain what we synthetic biology can help in the real world and aroused the public’s interests on iGEM and Synthetic Biology. We also corrected some misunderstanding of some people on synthetic biology and engineering genetics with scientific evidence and rational analysis.
SCAU-CHINA
It’s quite admiring for the outstanding performance of SCAU-CHINA last year in iGEM. This year, we are very pleasant to reach out to them and got several meet-ups during the whole year. We exchanged our ideas on plenty of aspects such as the importance and the tendency of Synthetic Biology, the experience on running a well-organized team and so on. We managed to collaborate on holding a synthetic biology meeting on their campus and introduced our software to the public. Additionally, we also visited their lab and guide them to tried our S-DIN project for search and design process. They shared the same concern with us on the information integration matter and gave us positive feedbacks on the user-friendliness aspect and our simulation functions. For their next year project, they said they will use our software for the pre-brainstorm inspiration and the design process in order to save plenty of time for detouring around aimlessly.

SDU-Denmark,2016,"
Over the summer we attended several meetups. Our first meetup was at the Danish Technical University, who held a meetup for the Danish teams. This was also where we initiated our collaboration about mathematics. We gave a talk about how to design a Wiki and we learned a lot from the other teams and generally had a blast!
In June we met up with the other Nordic iGEM teams at the Nordic Jamboree. We presented our project and received feedback on where we should further focus. When we heard the other teams presentations, we realized that the Stockholm iGEM team's project was almost identical to ours. Thus a collaboration was born with the iGEM team from Stockholm.
We also had a great road trip to Germany, where we met up with German teams. Here we had the chance to present our project and get some good constructive feedback on our video and project. It was also really inspiring to learn about the other team's project.
The University of Copenhagen held a meetup with focus on Human Practice, which we attended. We learned much from the meetup and had the opportunity to talk to Ana from iGEM Headquarters. She gave some great feedback! It was also at this meetup our collaboration with Chalmers University began.

Imperial,2014," working on exciting biomaterials. For them, it was spider silk production and functionalisation, in much the same fashion as our work with cellulose. Despite the differences in our chosen material building blocks, our overall goals were similar. Thus, a collaboration was only natural.
As part of our collaboration we wanted to bring all the iGEM teams a bit closer together. We invited them all to join reddit.com/r/igem a place where all the teams can discuss openly about aspects of their projects and the competition in general. We hope that it will provide a communication platform not only for the competing teams, but also for people that seek to participate in iGEM in the future.
Stanford-Brown-Spelman
Social media brought us to our second collaborator. After seeing a picture of our raw bacterial cellulose posted on Twitter, the Stanford-Brown-Spelman (SBS) iGEM team approached us. Our email exchange led to a fruitful Skype meeting and the exchange of protocols for cellulose growth and processing.
Both of our teams are working on bacterial cellulose, but at the same time we are participating in different tracks and have completely different approach on applications. While we are looking into water filtration, SBS is looking into building biosynthetic Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).
Edinburgh
We helped Edinburgh iGEM with their policy and practices project through a short Skype meeting about our team structure and dynamics.
London BioHackspace
The London BioHackspace, a community lab based in Hackney, London fielded their first ever iGEM team this year. Their project also involved bacterial cellulose, but focussed on using it as a medium with which to 3D print objects. We produced a model to simulate the 3D shape of their bacterial cellulose (BC) sculpture. More information about this can be found on the modelling page .

NJU-China,2018," from different countries, we spent some time discussing the way people carrying out experiments in different laboratories. We gave a tour about  academy and labs in our school to Wei Youyi and showed her the safety disciplines in our lab, and we found that safety is the highest principle in both labs we work in.
Nanjing_NFLS
Collaborating with Nanjing_NFLS, we got access to discuss our projects and help each other in a more profound way. As both of our teams wanted to share our projects and understandings of synthetic biology to the general public, we together held a special event for students in NFLS. Nanjing_NFLS helped to find the place for this lecture and invited students from synthetic biology club, who showed really great interest in biology. Both of our teams provided vivid presentations, sharing what synthetic biology and iGEM competition is and how we perform our subjects.
The lecture turned out to be a big success —students got fully engaged in the activities and a lot of them wrote their feelings about this lecture. It sparked students’ scientific curiosity and many of them even changed their views towards brain diseases.
It is a pleasure to collaborate with Nanjing_NFLS to held such a meaningful and influential event. It not only helps high school students to rediscover “horrible diseases”, but also sparks their scientific curiosity in Biology learning. We really appreciate and treasure this event.

DTU – Biobuilders
We collaborated with the DTU-Biobuilders team by providing them with the contact information of a prominent snake bites researcher in our country, called Dr. Opoku Manu, since their project is about snake bites.
Prior to providing the DTU-Biobuilders team with the contact information of this snake bites researcher, we spoke to him on the behalf of the team and explained to him the primary objective of their project and he was delighted to help.
In return, the DTU-Biobuilders team provided us with a lot of invaluable advice and guidance in our preparations for this year’s IGEM since they had already been to the Jamboree a couple of times and this was our first time.

UK iGEM meetup
In August, we were invited to attend the UK iGEM meetup organized by the iGEM teams from the University of Westminster, University of Warwick and University College London.  Almost the whole team attended this event which spanned over two days. The first day involved attending a series of lectures and a team poster presentation followed by debates and presentations by iGEM teams at the Shard on the second day.
This was a great opportunity for our team to interact with other teams and to gain feedback on our device.
University of Nottingham
One of our team members, Thea helped the Nottingham iGEM team in developing their game - NottPortal. Thea helped with providing he voice for one of the characters in the game.
We helped the Nottingham team in showing proof of application of their device. The Nottingham team sent us some freeze dried bacteria which we revived and then checked if the bacteria can actually be retrieved, stay alive and grow.
University of Peshawar
The Peshawar team helped with our human practices by speaking to clinicians in Pakistan.These clinicians informed us the medicinal practice and about antibiotic usage in Pakistan where we learnt that patients rely on self prescription and the availability of even fourth generation antibiotics over the counter encourages this practice. The Peshawar team also provided us with data of multi-drug resistant strains in Pakistan and the treatments regimens that are currently used."

COLLABORATIONS
In addition to working on our project, our team also assisted and collaborated with various other iGEM Teams. These interactions allowed us to form stronger connections in the iGEM community and ultimately benefited the projects of all parties involved.
UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA
Our main collaboration was with the University of Georgia iGEM Team’s Archaea Collaboration. This team’s goal is to help incorporate archaeal chassis into iGEM, so they asked several teams to help them characterize a ribosome binding site (RBS) library they had prepared. Our team was asked to compare mCherry fluorescence readings from 28 archaeal cell extract samples that they provided, each with different RBS point mutations. As each participating lab’s instrumentation is different, we had to develop our own protocols for measuring these values based on a standard set of guidelines provided by UGA. We used a fluorescence plate reader to measure the values, first setting a standard curve using their highest samples. We then had to calculate dilutions that put each of their samples in the linear detection range for this device, so we diligently ran two dilutions for each of the 28 samples. We reported our data to them, and also took a survey about our experience and an additional, more minor experiment in which they asked us to report how much dry ice was left in the package that they sent (from the above experiment). This helped them optimize their large study for amount of dry that was needed based on locations were packages were sent.
TÜBINGEN UNIVERSITY
We also provided the Tübingen University iGEM team with a construct previously used by the UCSF team. We sent them an E-Cadherin construct in a plasmid that targets the protein for surface display (pCTCON2). This part is a calcium dependent adhesion transmembrane protein, which plays a vital role in the formation of tissue, epithelial cell behavior, as well as the suppression of cancerous cells. We are excited to see how they used it!
WIKI FLICKS
To go above and beyond in terms of our policy and practices, we have introduced our innovative program WikiFlicks (please see more on our Wiki Flicks Page ).This feature acts as an extension of the annually required team Wiki pages which aims to bring science to a level in which everyone can understand.

geekStarter Workshop
On June 10, 2017, MindFuel’s geekStarter graciously hosted an event where teams sponsored by geekStarter were able to gather together, present their projects, and receive critical feedback from a panel of expert judges. Hosted at Notre Dame Collegiate High School, we were able to witness the presentations of innovative projects from other high schools, as well as present our own.
The next day, we got in touch with other iGEM teams at geekStarter’s iGEM meet-up, hosted at the University of Calgary. The UAlberta, Lethbridge, Lethbridge HS, and Calgary iGEM teams were present at the event. With the other teams, we were able to discuss a few of our problems and hear about the other team's progress'. Overall we had a newfound sense of direction for our project and had been invigorated towards starting the next step of our iGEM journey.
aGEM
In the final preparations for the iGEM 2017 Giant Jamboree, five geekStarter teams from across Alberta gathered for aGEM 2017, hosted by geekStarter, which occurred from September 23-24 at the University of Alberta. Again, our team was grateful to have been able to experience an event like aGEM. The iGEM teams present at the event were UAlberta, Calgary, Lethbridge and Lethbridge HS. We were able to practice presenting our work in a fully supportive environment, and also gained invaluable feedback. Furthermore, we gained insight into how other high school and undergraduate teams approached their project within the context of iGEM.

The University of Georgia iGEM team is continuing their work    on developing the archaeal Methanococcus maripaludis as an    inexpensive chassis for synthetic biochemical production    with a current focus on engineering the ribosomal binding    site (RBS). An mCherry reporter is used to measure protein    expression. In the team's efforts to standardize    fluorescence measurements and collect data, we are helping    the UGA iGEM team characterize RBS variants by measuring    mCherry fluorescence levels using flow cytometry and    performing statistical analysis.
Imperial College London
The Imperial College London iGEM team are working on a    co-culture technology that allows for self-regulating    artificial cell population ratios through cell communication    and regulation. As such, the team is also collecting data on    growth conditions in various medias. Here, we contributed to    the team's efforts by providing data on Pseudomonas    putida growth at different mixture ratios of LB and BHI    and determining the growth curve in each mixture at OD    600. This effort also benefitted us by granting us insight    into how P. putida containing our construct will fare in    these mixed media conditions compared to the wild-type    strain.
Genspace
The Genspace iGEM team is a team composed of high-schoolers    and citizen scientists working at a community laboratory. As    such, access to certain lab equipment is typically    limited. As a result, the Columbia iGEM team have worked    with the team members to help collect data on their    behalf. This year, we aided the Genspace team in their    efforts to collect data for the UGA-Georgia    team 1 and characterize    constructs by collecting data on cell growth at OD 700 and    collecting mTurquoise2 and mCherry fluorescence.

Unesp_Brazil,2018," provided under the pretense that it has a preventative or therapeutic effect on diseases in humans or animals states for a pharmaceutical, which is regulated by the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA). When this kind of probiotic is been prepared to be released the Swedish Gene Technology Advisory Board and the Swedish National Council of Medical Ethics are often involved and give out statements and input in regards to the applications for clinical trials.  There all pharmaceuticals that contain any modified organism need to be labeled with “This product contains (a) genetically modified organism(s)”, and all of the trials regarding GM pharmaceuticals are posted on the Swedish Medical Products Agency’s website . In Europe, the following companiy working with engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge: ActoBio Therapeutics (part of Intrexon) in Belgium.
United States
Engineered probiotics are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, as they are neither a food nor a drug. As a result, they currently do not require large clinical trials like other drugs in America.
The followeing companies working with engineered probiotics has come to our knowlegde: Azitra , Synlogic and ZBiotics .
In Brazil, there was no law that regulates genetically engineered probiotics, but in 2018 ANVISA, the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency, opened up the public consultation and now genetically engineered probiotics were added to the regulation. Besides, there is no companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics.
With this research, we were able to see that there is a growing movement of engineered probiotics mostly in the U.S., but that there still is a lack of laws and regulation all over the world to regulate these products before they can reach the market and the final consumers.

Besides the research about probiotics in China, we collaborated with Jiangnan China by helping them with the safety of their project. They needed help in designing a kill switch and, because we were both working with probiotics, they asked us some ideas. We shared with them information about our kill switch and also other strategies used for biocontainment.
Toulouse INSA UPS
iGEM Toulouse created an Instagram page called “iGEM Around the World” that was managed by different iGEM Team every week. We participated and there we shared pictures about our city, our College, our team and our project. It was really nice to show a little bit of our daily life and also to know the routine of other iGEM teams!

Franconia,2017," number    of members from different iGEM teams. It was great fun.
On Sunday, an interesting talk was given by Prof. Dr. Hans-Georg Braun,    who used to be an old iGEM advisor. He presented some of his supervised and very    interesting iGEM projects of Dresden.
Then the Dresden team offered some workshops for us: e.g. a speed-dating    for iGEM collaborations and a workshop for the “iGEM goes green”-initiative, introduced    by the iGEM team Dresden. Again we had a great time and learned many things about the carbon    footprint of the everyday lab work. Please visit the website of this beautiful project to learn     more about this initiative ! During our time in Dresden we found     many potential collaboration partners such as Cologne-Dusseldorf, Berlin and Potsdam.
After a short coffee break and the closing ceremony, where a photograph of all iGEM teams    has been taken, we made our departure from this beautiful city.
We would like to thank the iGEM Dresden team for organizing the whole meetup. We had     a great weekend and loads of fun getting to know the other teams and their projects!
European meetup
Delft
From the 6th to the 8th of July we were invited from the iGEM Team TU Delft to come    together at their university town. So four of our team members had the possibility to take part    at this year´s European Meet up. Amused by the mistake of the naked-camping- place we    booked an Airbnb in our neighboring country and set off by car at 5 AM on the 6th of July.    Tired of the long drive and walk we met several teams at an All You Can Eat in Delft in the    afternoon which was proposed by Team Delft. There we had the first chance to compare notes    with the others and look for some collaboration partners. Despite our tiredness we had much    fun and Leo enjoyed the free beer. Even on our first day in the Netherlands we found out that    there are more bicycles than people in this country. That is why you have to pay more    attention to bicyclists than to cars. The next day, after forgetting our poster and running back    to our Airbnb to take it, we all met at the university in Delft. Two biologists gave lectures on    iGEM topics and provided the basis for discussions. At lunch we met Team Freiburg. Or    rather Team Freiburg met us. They knew some of our"

Collaborations
To become an outstanding team, cooperation is essential, especially with other teams and social groups. On one hand, we work on improving our own experiments in collaboration. On the other hand, we promote IGEM along with the knowledge about synthetic biology. We did a lot of collaborations with other teams:
1. At the beginning of the experiment, the iGEM team Worldshaper-Wuhan found that the skeleton plasmids in distribution kit were not available. We put plasmids on the filter sheet and sent express packages to them with the necessary plasmids(figure1 to figure3).
2. In the work of Interlab, we also collaborated with other teams. We learned that the iGEM teams ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-Nanjing had problems with plasmids transformation, so we provided these two teams with Interlab related plasmids (positive control, negative control and device1~device6, a total of 8 plasmids)(figure4,figure5). Since we didn't have a plate reader, we borrowed it from iGEM teams ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-Nanjing. During the experiment, our three teams worked together to solve the technical problems during the experiments(figure6,figure7).
3. In the design and improvement of the experiment, we also have a lot of collaboration with other teams. From July 26 to July 30, 2017, the iGEM team Worldshaper-Wuhan came to visit. Our four teams, ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-Nanjing and Worldshaper-Wuhan, and us discussed the experimental plan together(figure8). We introduced the experiment to other teams, and we exchanged a lot of ideas(figure9). We also held propaganda activities with other teams(for more information: https://2017.igem.org/Team:Worldshaper-XSHS/HP/Silver ). The largest one was in Hangzhou Science and Technology Museum on 30 July(figure 10).The cooperation provided guidance and assistance for the reconstruction of their research subjects.

Collaborations
During the course of our participation in the 2018 iGEM Competition, we started communicating with many other teams, from our country and also from all around the world. Through talking and exchanging ideas we managed to help each other improve our projects. But also, those collaborations made us realise that the iGEM Competition offers more than just the experience of competing. It offers us the chance to connect with people who see the same subject, synthetic biology, in a different perspective than ours. We hope our collaborations benefited others as much as they did us and that in upcoming years Greek teams will be able to participate in more European and global collaborations.

iGEM Bulgaria 2018 Team
Trying to engage in more meaningful collaborations with other iGEM Teams, our team took the initiative to host the members of a team in our city Athens, Greece for some days during the summer months. We came in contact with a lot of teams, but we ultimately managed to host only the iGEM Bulgaria 2018 Team, which also works on a diagnostics project, similar to ours.
Before hosting iGEM Bulgaria in Athens, we had a series of Skype sessions, in which we discussed and exchanged opinions on our projects. In one of these sessions, we broached the subject of reporter proteins, such as Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and we examined their advantages and drawbacks. Their feedback was significant in helping us settling down to our current reporter protein.
During the team’s visit in Athens at July 23-26, we both presented our work and had an in-depth discussion on our projects, focusing on what difficulties we have had or we might have in the future and how we could have a meaningful collaboration that could promote both our projects. At that specific time, we were in the process of designing the assembly of our parts. Slavil, the iGEM Bulgaria’s team instructor, provided us with insight on the matter, by giving us helpful tips on primer design and different assembly methods. We also discussed about possible opportunities of comparing our work and validating each"
Tsinghua,2017," delivery, we met trouble that all of the courier companies cannot express our parts in time because the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was going on and traffic restrictions became much more rigorous. Introduced by Xuan Wang, advisor of team SHSBNU-China, we got in touch with Yihao Zhang, advisor of team Peking. We connected with Genscript in Nanjing and shared necessary information we needed to all of us. Then Yihao went to Nanjing by train on his own and delivered parts. Here we thank the two teams for their collaborations.

Collaboration with team Aachen
While we were working on our project, we had connected with several other iGEM teams. We  worked really well with a student team from Aachen, Germany. They had a similar topic as us, so  collaboration was easier due to common ground. Firstly, we had a few conference calls with them  and after exchanging our experience with already conducted research and preparations for iGEM, we  worked on possible ways to solve the problems we all pointed out. Furthermore we discussed other  ways of collaboration.  We helped them with their Human Practises by filling out their questionnaire  on lab organisation and also conducted several tests for them.
They were investigating the degree of GMO pollution in the laboratories we worked in, which is  indeed a valuable problem to explore. When dealing with something with such power to transform  the world as synthetic biology has, safety is very important, both in the outside world when we try to  apply our ideas to everyday lives and in the lab as well. GMO pollution in the lab is an important  question because it concerns our safety and the safety of other people we interact with, so we were  glad to be able to participate in their study.
We conducted several swab tests on different surfaces with agar chips by placing 3 on each selected  surface for 5 seconds and then placed them in petri dishes.  They were incubated at 37°C and after  24 hours we received the following results:
The agar chips were maid according to the protocol they have sent us:
•prepare 250 ml of LB medium with 2% Agar (2.5 g NaCl, 2.5 g Peptone/Tryptone, 1.25 g Yeast  extract, 5 g Agar),
•sterilize the black chip-mould by wiping it with 70 % Ethanol,
•fill the mould with hot LB and let it cool down for 1-10 minutes,
•use a sterile (wiped with Ethanol) scalpel to cut along the markings,
•move agar chips into sterile petri dishes with a spatula,
•store at 4 °C.
Collaboration with Aalto-Helsinki"
Georgia_State,2015," Tyson himself at the Fox Theater.  This year, GSU-iGEM participated in two events to help educate the public about synthetic biology.   The first event, Discovery Day, was held at Georgia State University.  The team met hundreds of guests and unveiled our fun and educational game we called “BioBricks.”  We also answered questions about bioethics and concerns people have regarding synthetic biology.  Both the parents and their children learned a lot with us that day!
Exploration Expo
Day 7: Atlanta Science Festival
For the second event, we collaborated with GTech’s iGEM team to greet thousands of people in Centennial Park for the Exploration Expo.  Once again, we hosted the BioBricks game and connected with people from all over the city.  We answered questions and raised awareness for science literacy.  We explained what iGEM is and how the program is beneficial to not only undergrads, but to everyone on the planet!
Careers/Ethics
The overall effort of this outreach was to address the general public’s concerns about the risk and benefits of synthetic biology. As a team we wanted to reach out and show that synthetic biology is a science that is helping to improve global quality of life not endanger it.
Assemble your Biobrick!
In an effort to bring synthetic biology/iGEM awareness to the public, the GSU-iGEM team, along with the GSU Synthetic Biology Club, developed a game that we could play with children and adults alike using Legos to demonstrate a standard, working iGEM construct.  This involved lots of hours developing a game that was simple yet informative.  We also spent a good chunk of time sorting upwards of 12000 Lego Bricks!
Legos were the obvious choice because, well, who doesn’t love Legos?  It also mimics the iGEM standardized cloning sites in physical form.  We created a key to help our new friends build their own BioBrick construct for a yeast or a bacterial cell.  We had a lot of fun.  It generated lots of questions from the kids and their parents.  I think we really helped them understand how we work in the lab better with this demonstration.  The hands-on aspect of it really aided in cementing the process into their heads (and ours too)."
OUC-China,2015," by dividing by the absorbance.
The tested cultures were incubated at different concentrations of arabinose (0%, 0.002%, 0.02%, 0.2%, 20%, m/V). We put 150μL (OD=0.15) liquid culture into a 90mm-diameter plate contained 20mL LB agar medium. One hour later, a piece of 1cm-diameter sterile filter paper was put in the center of each plate. 15μL Ara liquid was put on the center of the paper. Eighteen hours later, the black and white photos were taken under 362nm excitation light, another ten hours later, the colorful photos were taken by a digital camera. It showed that 2%(m/V) Ara had the best result. Each concentration had three biological replicates. And you could have an object image of the fluorescence of GFP under different concentration of Ara.

Assist in Survey of Chewing-Gum & GMOs
Aix-Marseille created an E. coli strain that produced enzymes, which could degrade rubber polymers. Nowadays, chewing gum is the second urban pollutant after cigarette butts. To clean chewing gum, specific machines are used. Because of heaviness and expensiveness, Aix-Marseille started their project.
They wanted to collect information about chewing-gum and GMOs worldwide. We were glad to help them to collect it. At first, we translated their questionnaire from English into Chinese carefully and checked it twice by two members of our team. Then, we went to Zhongshan Road and Taidong Business District away from our lab to interview the passersby one by one and randomly picked. The interviewees completed the questionnaire by themselves. At last, the results were submitted by us.
Because of our work, Aix- Marseille gave us a Gold Collaboration Badge, the highest level of honor. Here it is!

Fudan,2018," is the first time for them to participate in the iGEM competition, we provided them with many advice including how to conduct their experiment to the criteria of judges and parts documentation. We first explained our interpretation of things they were unclear about. In order to offer further help to them, we learnt about their project abstract and design through frequent mails. We further discussed with them on parts improvement and documentation. We explained to them what is parts improvement, listed examples of it and told them how it can be done. Moreover, in parts documentation, we examined their parts and provided recommendation on how to present parts in a more standardized way. Hopefully their documentation of parts will be very informative and they'll do well in part improvement.
Our cornerstone, Team:Tsinghua
Holding a long-standing friendship with Team:Tsinghua , we made extensive discussions over Internet. When we met at CCiC , we exchanged a myriad of ideas covering project design, human practice, team management and so on. By the way, they gave us valuable suggestions on our poster design .
Heading south, the iGEM EuroAsian Meetup
We participated in the iGEM EuroAsian Meetup , which was from July 24th to 26th, hosted                                     by Team:TUDelft and Team:BGIC-Global in Shenzhen . This July trip was our first opportunity to                                     share our ENABLE project internationally. The Meetup has provided us with many valuable suggestions.                                     For example, since then we started to focus more intensely on how we could help our general audience                                     better understand our project. It was primarily thanks to the workshop sessions where we had to come                                     up with solutions to promote our project and human practice within \[just 1 minute](link to our 1-min intro video or audio).                                     Furthermore, we made many friends, especially with members of Team:TuDelft and Team:SZU-China . We sincerely hope that our collaboration will extend to the next competition season. See you next summer!
Heading east, iAPC
Between July 30th and August 2nd, we attended the 6th iGEM Asia Pacific Conference .                     iGEMers from China, America, Japan and other countries gathered together to communicate about the                                     progress of their projects.

HKUST
We discussed our projects with team Hong Kong HKUST over a Skype chat and helped them with the modelling aspect of their project. We performed a mathematical analysis of the tri-stable system model, and revealed an unfamiliar behavior of the tri-stable switch. The tri-stable switch undergoes oscillations in specific conditions. We first developed a Boolean model and proved the existence of oscillation performed by the tri-stable system. A more detailed model based on ordinary differential equations was formulated to further characterize the oscillatory behavior of the system. This further confines the conditions at which oscillation occurs as well as identifying the parameters controlling the magnitude of the oscillation. A report of our contribution to their project can be found here . We thank HKUST HongKong team for playing our game and giving us feedback.
iGEM Meetups
We participated in two Indian iGEM meetups. One of them was conducted by SVCE Chennai team. Nitish and Venkat went to attend the meetup, held at their college. This meetup was attended by IISc Banglore team as well. All three teams presented their project to the audience, which was followed by audience questions. This event gave us a very good opportunity to share our ideas and experience regarding lab work, human practices and collaborations. We had a lot of fun presenting our respective projects and interacting with the other teams who attended( IISC Bangalore and SVCE Chennai ). After this meet up, we agreed to send some important biobrick parts to each other to help validate our projects.
We sent our [parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1956016 K1956016] part, which is to be used for efficient characterization with internal control to IISC Bangalore and SVCE Chennai for characterization. We are thankful to both the teams for characterizing our parts.
We also helped team SVCE by characterizing their part, which was a composite part made up of BBa_K115001 - RNA thermometer and BBa_K592011 - Cj Blue green protein(702bp). We digested their plasmid with EcorI-HF and PstI and we found 2kbp backbone and 100bp insert, which meant that their part was not cloned properly. We reporter this result to team"

Introduction & Acknowledgements
      This is our first time to participate in iGEM. We are completely novice, so the collaborations with other teams help us a lot in the process of carrying out experimental projects. This summer, we received a lot of teams’ help when we encountered straits from the project preparation to the experimental development owing to lack of experience and support. We would greatly appreciate these teams, SCU-China, SCU-WestChina, TMMU-China, UESTC-China, Peking, Shanghaitech. Furthermore, we also do our best to help other teams, striving for better results through mutual cooperation.
 
SiCAU & iSWU
      We joined the iSWU in 2015 which brings together all iGEM teams in Southwest China and some teams interested in iGEM. Members of the union include TMMU-China, UESTC-China, SCU-China, SCU-WestChina and so on. This year,the iSWU meeting was held by SCU-WestChina in April 2017 for each teams exchange views on the displayed projects. We had a more profound understanding of the project after participating in this exchange. The teachers gave us numerous inspirations of design and optimization the project after showing the initial project on cancer detection.It is also the intention of holding the southwest conference in the early stage, in order to discover the deficiencies and limitations of the project through communication, and improve it before the experiment is carried out. In terms of entry matters, we lack the experience of iGEM due to we are the first time to participate in this competition. iSWU gave us a lot of useful assistance, such as how to register, introduction of the schedule, experience of visa processing and so on. In a nutshell, iSWU played an vital role from our project preparation to complete the experiment. Thanks for the iSWU , the relationship of each team is closer.
 
SiCAU&SCU-China /SCU-WestChina

They had found a company in Shanghai called “Dajing”, which is relevant to their project. So we helped them to interview the manager of Dajing Company, collected suggestions on their project and answers for their question.
During our visit to Dajing Biotechnology Company, the manager emphasized the significance of NCHU’s project and introduced us how Dajing deals with the similar toxic chemical compounds from an industrial perspective. Besides, he provided useful advice as well as detailed answers to the questions that NCHU team asked.
