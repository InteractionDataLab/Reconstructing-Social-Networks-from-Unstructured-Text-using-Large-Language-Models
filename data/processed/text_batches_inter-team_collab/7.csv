Collaborations
Our team understands that iGEM is supposed to be a fun experience to have. That is why we participated in a light-hearted collaboration while also hosting our own.  Another collaborative activity we did was ask other iGEMers to take a nine question survey about invasive species and GMOs.
RHIT Collab
The RHIT Team wanted to recognize all the SUPER things iGEM teams are doing so they put out a call to assemble a league of iGEM superheroes.  We created our own superhero and his trusty sidekick to represent our project. The RHIT Team designed trading cards for all the superheroes.  The cards are super rare but there is a chance to grab a copy or two from us at the Giant Jamboree!
UNebraska-Lincoln’s Worst Gel Contest
Our team was inspired to create a contest for the worst gel electrophoresis after having one of ours unfortunately not turn out the best…  We wanted to find the worst gel from this iGEM year and believe us when we tell you that we found it!  We will start with our honorable mentions and work our way to 1st place.
Honorable Mentions:
We feel UPF CRG Barcelona’s pain. After obtaining their gene construct, several clonings were attempted.  The team performed colony PCR to get amplified product that was promising.  But alas, the electrophoresis was blank following miniprep and digestion. They've said this happened at least four times.
Barcelona
NEU_China_A was happy to share their blunder with us. In this gel, they were trying to extract the total RNA from a target plant.  The resulting “bands” look like tiny cotton balls! Their team says they still joke about it in their lab.
Neu-China
3rd Place:
Tec CEM is a team we have gotten along with for multiple years. Their submission is as fun to look at as they are as fun to talk to.  They said they were trying to take measurements of RFP from a different strain of E. coli.  Obviously, this gel put a damper on such things. Their team attributed this mishap to degradation and rookie sample loading.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017," found international approval by the teams of Darmstadt , Heidelberg , Paris and Taiwan . Since the teams of Paris and Taiwan could not attend the seminar in person, they joined us via skype.
The seminar started with a marvelous introduction given by Patrick Fischbach. Afterwards, we took advantage of the situation and presented each team’s project, followed by breathtaking discussions facing the difficulties and odds of optogenetic in their project. Introducing the practical handling with optogenetics, Tim Blomeier, who is an advisor of our team, gave a talk about working with optogenetics. With that we imparted all necessary aspects one has to consider when working with optogenetics. Nevertheless nothing is more helpful than practical experience - to attain that, we showed the attendants our laboratory, as well as our hardware and the dark room for optogenetic experiments.      At the end of the day we had a nice barbecue. This comfortable situation offers the possibility for lot of interesting discussions regarding optogenetic, our projects and iGEM itself.
Mentoring iGEM Team Stuttgart
The iGEM team of the University of Stuttgart is the first ever at their university. As we are only the second iGEM team of the Heinrich- Heine- University, Duesseldorf, and joined forces with the University of Cologne, which is completely new to iGEM as well, we still remember how hard it can be to meet the iGEM requirements. We found out that they built their team and contacted them to find out how they were getting started on iGEM. After a few friendly mails we decided to schedule a Skype meeting where we talked about many different kinds of topics. We stayed in touch and helped them as much as we could. Furthermore we invited them to the Synbio Day we organized, not only to get another team on board for our mission, but also to finally meet them in person.
As we also knew that they couldn’t afford to come to Boston with their whole team and we had one redundant registration space due to the absence of one of our members, we decided to give this space to Team Stuttgart . We are very happy that iGEM Stuttgart gladly accepted our offer and we cannot wait to see them again at the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
Human Practice collaboration with Valencia UPV
iGEM is not just about working in the lab but also about informing the public and discussing their worries. Therefore we participated in the Human Practice collaboration of Valencia UPV .
They made a worldwide study about the situation regarding transgenics, including various topics like the legislation of transgenic consumption"

Collaborations
Collaborations with institutions or other iGEM Teams promote exchange of experiences and know-how and lead to a benefit for both sites. Therefore, we got in contact with two local research institutions. They supported us with advice, materials and helpful methods for our experiments. One of the supporters was the Thünen Institute in Braunschweig with a research focus on the economy, ecology and technologies of rural regions, seas and forests. Dr. Ulf Prüße, an expert for renewables conversion technology, gave us professional advice for our experiments with beads and biofiltration. Furthermore, we received lots of material from the institute and had the possibility to measure the methane degradation at their gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector.
An important part of the iGEM competition is the cooperation between the teams. In order to get in contact with other iGEM Teams from Germany, we joined the iGEM Meet Ups in Munich and Aachen. We numerously represented the iGEM Team Braunschweig at both events and drew attention to this year’s project. We used these opportunities to give presentations and obtained encouraging feedback and helpful ideas during the follow-up discussions. At the Munich meet-up we made contact with the iGEM teams from Aachen and Hanover, followed by some nice barbecue evenings with the team from Hanover. We also met a few iGEMers from Aachen at the “Maker Faire” in Hanover and spent the day together. Team Aachen provided us with a self-engineered methane sensor which we would later put to good use in our experiments. Such collaborations were strengthened at the second meet-up which was held in Aachen in September. However, we did not only get in contact with teams nearby, but also with teams overseas. We had a skype video chat with the iGEM Team Waterloo and discussed our projects"

Collaboration with PITT iGEM Team 2018
We have been mentored by the PITT iGEM team since our iGEM program began in September 2017.  They are veterans in the iGEM sphere and gave us  a lot of insight on what the competition will entail.  During our first meeting with them,  they taught us a plasmid game and gave us some insight on the iGEM competition.   Throughout the year, they would visit the lab and help us with some of our experiments and updating our Wiki.  In the winter of 2018, two members of the PITT iGEM team helped us with completing our salt sensor data. The biosensor from the CMUQ 2017  iGEM team was selected for improved characterization (Part: BBa_K2467002).  Dorsin and Vivian came to help us with figuring out the molarities, concentrations of the reagents, and graphing the data.  The experiment showed that the optimal salt concentration for growth of E.Coli, which is an improvement of the biosensor of the CMUQ iGEM team.  During the summer, the PITT iGEM team attended our program practices and would help us with anything that we needed experimentally and technically.  Some of the PITT team members would help us with constructing our Wiki and other PITT team members would help us with troubleshooting our experiments."

Cloning Guide with TU Eindhoven
First, we were very motivated to discuss the potential for iterative capped assembly to open the doors for other iGEM teams to explore new features of protein synthesis. To achieve this, we collaborated with the great members of the TU Eindhoven iGEM Team, for whom we developed a cloning guide for ICA.  Our entry in their guide discussing the background, process, workflow, and troubleshooting tips necessary to utilize this system.  Our collaboration has not only benefited iGEM teams who wish to learn the technique, but also helped us gain a better sense of the implications of our research toward advanced synthetic biology. We envision ICA as a cloning technique that can be widely adapted not only to those using our parts collection generate novel silk genes, but for any team who wishes to rapidly and controllably assembly long repetitive genetic structures for functional use.
Feel free to browse through the cloning guide.
First Annual Southern California iGEM Meetup
The UCLA iGEM was honored to hold the first ever Southern California iGEM Meetup on Thursday, August 6th.  Team members from the University of California, San Diego ( UCSD ), University of La Verne and La Cañada High School , and the LA Biohackers Community Lab attend our meetup at the Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA.  Here is a link to the powerpoint we delivered at the meet up, and below are pictures from our event.  Teams discussed their ongoing projects and offered advice to members struggling with certain aspects of their experimental design, and discussed the pertinent issues for all iGEM teams in terms of logistics, team organization and project design.  Additionally, we discussed the state of iGEM and synthetic biology as a rapidly emerging biotechnology field in the United States, especially in the context of developing scientific communications to combat rising negative publicity and misinformation toward the use and safety of genetically modified organisms. Through our meet up, we hope to spur not only a collaborative experience"

In order to best find collaborations that matched our project, we read the backgrounds of every team’s wiki, finding teams that were also involved in pollution cleanup, environmental issues or crude oil. One of these teams was NU Kazakhstan, who is also cleaning up oil in their local environment. With NU Kazakhstan, we organized a Skype call. In this Skype call, we talked about our two projects, and compared them, talking about how they were similar in that they both degraded toxic substances, but different because of the methods of doing so. This was helpful for us as we were in the stages of forming our applied design, and hearing their ideas for them helped us build on our sponge idea from last year and create something different.
Another collaboration was with Team Bulgaria-The EureCAST. With them we created an environmental pamphlet, with the goal of spreading awareness about tips to be more sustainable in the lab, but also in life. We want people to be more environmentally conscious, as small lifestyle changes can make a big difference if everyone implements them.
The final collaboration was with Team USP-EEL-Brazil. We asked them if they would like to be apart of our outreach how to video series, which was aimed towards giving new iGEM teams tips and tricks we wish we had learned before starting our competition. Team USP-EEL-Brazil contributed in this video series, adding their own ten minute video to our collection. This was important to us, as we wanted the videos to appeal to international audiences as well as teams of all three levels. Including a high school and undergraduate team, allowed for variety as both our teams had different struggles to overcome and therefore different tips they wanted to include."
MIT,2018," we both discussed our biofilm assay protocols and came to the realization that we had very different techniques to quantify biofilm formation. While we were using Colony Forming Units (CFUs) to quantify biofilm, they were using crystal violet staining. We therefore decided to share our protocols and agreed to give guidance to each other while carrying out these protocols. We think our collaboration with WPI was particularly impactful for our project as we used both biofilm assays to characterize the formation of S. mutans biofilm and then compared them to see which one was more efficient across different metrics.
We concluded that CFUs seemed more accurate and more quantifiable, where the staining method was a lot more easier and cheaper to carry out. We realized that to determine if there was a reduction in biofilm growth or not, a staining procedure was probably sufficient enough. We made a biofilm assay protocol manual, with both methods explained. We hope that future iGEM teams can use this manual and determine which technique works better for their project."

Latin America iGEM GROUP
“Fellowship” is one of the words that widely represents the iGEM competition. Thus, we                         created a Facebook and a WhatsApp group for the Latin American iGEM community. This groups                         represented an opportunity to, first of all, know each other's project, and of course,                         troubleshoot about all kinds of issues and look for solutions together. Finally, the teams                         arranged collaborations to enhance the projects and strengthen the bonds between nations                         and present a united front.
IGEM UNESP Brazil
While developing a project involving synthetic biology you need to consider how is it going                         to be received in other countries, focusing mainly on local regulations. That is why Brazil                         asked for our help, in order for them to visualize how their genetically modified                         probiotics would be seen here in Mexico. Thus, we provided them with a report about how in                         Mexico this type of GMOs are a big taboo and there is a lack of regulation about them.
And also, during the realization of our project, we needed to know how burn injuries are                         seen and treated in other countries. Therefore, UNESP BRAZIL team did an amazing work                         making this report universal.

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

Human Practice collaboration
We have worked together with the University of Exeter and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) since the early development of our Mars-oriented human practice and have been able to influence and troubleshoot with each other. With the first skype call taking place on 23 of June between Copenhagen and Exeter and DTU joining in not much later, we've been able to work together over a longer period and use each others connections and knowledge.
Together we have made a report trying to answer some of the biggest questions concerning space travel and colonization of Mars. Together with DTU we hosted an event during the danish public cultural and educational event ""Kulturnatten"" in collaboration with the Planetarium. The event was planned and executed as a joint venture between our two teams and was based on research done for our collaborative report and materials made by both teams. We have also participated in a lot of iGEM events where we have gotten to meet a lot of fellow iGEM'ers! At the European Meetup we also hosted a workshop.

In the collaboration with BIT, we focused on the topic about human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several issues including the early diagnosis and treatment about HCC patients were discussed intensively. During the interaction, we absorbed interesting opinions about the disease, our idea also improved a lot thanks to BIT. In return, we shared the information with BIT about GPC3, emphasized the possibility and advantages of GPC3 as a biomarker for early stage HCC diagnosis.
Conferences
BUDS
BUDS, a meeting for iGEMers in China to exchange experience, was hold in Nanjing University on May 19th. This year, the theme of the meeting was team building. Two former captains of Fudan shared their experience and opinions about team building. After that, each team introduced the process of formation, development and inheritance. Learning about the characteristics and experiences of iGEM project in each school, we perfect our team building. Judging from the present situation, these valuable experiences help to establish and maintain 2017 iGEM Fudan a tight, efficient and sustainable team.
iAPC
From July 30th to August 3rd, our team went to National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan to attend the Fifth iGEM Asia Pacific Conference. This was the largest meeting many of our teamers had ever participated. Of course we wouldn’t miss this good chance to rehearsal our presentation. During the conference, we gave a presentation to iGEMers from America, China, Japan and so on, collected their questions and tried to provide convincing answers. Frank exchanges lighted up the flame of thinking and promote the friendship between us.
FABO Open Night
In August 19th, six iGEM teams in Shanghai gathered in the Fablab O Shanghai. Each team gave a speech about their projects and shared the latest progress, which was a good preparation for the final presentation. What’s more, we discussed that the close distance between us should facilitate a more convenient reciprocal collaboration in the future.
CCiC
From August 26th to August 28rd, Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) was hold in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. During the conference, apart from the speech and poster presentation, we displayed our self-designed board game, Cell War. The novel and interesting game caught everyone’s attention. We played the game with"
IIT-Madras,2016," and we found 2kbp backbone and 100bp insert, which meant that their part was not cloned properly. We reporter this result to team SVCE and they confirmed our results later on.
We would also like to thank iGEM team Peshawar and team IIT Kharagpur for publicizing our game and giving us valuable feedback on how we could improve the game, and thus make it a better educational tool. You can view team  Peshawar's abridged report here

Discussion and Outlook
Science
Vibrigens InterLab
It can be observed that Vibrio natriegens produces a much weaker fluorescence signal at the same OD when compared to E.coli using the same plasmids. In some cases, the fluorescence with a plasmid meant to express GFP is weaker than the blank. This happens because the cells block light more than they emit fluorescence at high densities. According to our measurements the strongest promoter was Test Device 5, followed by 4, 2, 1, 3 and 6. The other teams also found device 5 to be the strongest, but followed by 1, 4, 2, 6 and 3. Device 5, Part BBa_J364008 with the promoter J23104 is unequivocally the strongest. The experiments showed similar results, except that Device 1 was much weaker in our measurements than for the other teams. Device 6 and three had such weak GFP expression that small variations can change their place in the order of strength. We had some difficulty comparing resulting because the units of fluorescence are not standardized. We could only compare results and not analyze them on their own. Some teams had a much higher values then the other. This doesn’t mean that they measured a higher fluorescence, just that the values were given in another frame. The only quality control we could conduct on the data given to us were common sense checks, for example, the negative control had to show a lower fluorescence than the positive control. These checks excluded one team from our experiment.
 
Growth curve
In the five hours in which the experiment was performed by the other team, we reached an OD600 of about 12, and they reached one of 3,5 to 5. There are also some small factors that can combine to truly impact growth. Vibrio natriegens needs a lot of oxygen, so it’s important to take big baffled flasks and keep them shaking at all times. It is also very sensitive to cold, so taking the flasks out of the incubator to take samples can have an"

We would like to extend our appreciation to Lotte Hotel Seoul for offering sponsorship for the regional meet-up. They have committed to give special treatment for any iGEM teams when they visit Korea.  So, if you have a chance to come to Korea, please let us know.  We are more than happy to kindly remind the hotel of their commitment.  Also, we are ready to be your tour guide, which I believe will make it an offer hard to refuse!

Lund,2017," our delight. Together, we hosted a two-hour long public seminar discussing various topics of synthetic biology. It was well received and we are beyond pleased with the outcome. Chalmers Gothenburg navigated their parts with elegance, displaying fundamental insight into the subject area and a remarkable ability to communicate science. For more information about the collaboration with Chalmers Gothenburg, see engagement .
Dresden University of Technology
This year, TU Dresden made an excellent effort in promoting environmental sustainability through the introduction of the iGEM Goes Green initiative. The initiative takes on the challenge of presenting a comprehensive set of guidelines and recommendations on how best to approach the iGEM journey through a green lens. As we had decided to work with microplastics for much the same reasons - to promote and encourage a more ecoconscious attitude - we happily incorporated many of the suggestions put forward. For a more elaborate discussion on the iGEM Goes Green concept and our efforts, see GoGreen .
Uppsala University
Embracing a more contemporary take on scientific communication, Uppsala University hosted a series of webinars in which they discussed ethical and legal considerations in synthetic biology with iGEM teams from all over the world. We partook in the seminar concerning biosafety and the potential risks associated with the Open Synthetic Biology concept.
Other exchanges
The Nordic iGEM Conference
In June, the University of Copenhagen hosted the annual Nordic iGEM Conference, a weekend intended to bring the nordic iGEM teams together and give them a hint of what they might come to expect of the Giant-Jamboree in Boston. A total of nine different iGEM teams participated in three days of activities, ranging from seminars on synthetic biology and team organizational tools to more informal festivities. During the second day of the event, the teams were presented with the opportunity to elaborate on their project ideas in a mini-jamboree. The presentations were evaluated by a panel of professional scientists and friendly suggestions and feedback were given on the project design and delivery respectively. A winner was determined and we are proud to say that not only were we the judges’ choice and consequently the winners of the mini-jamboree, our presentation was voted the favorite among the NiC participants. We were awarded with a golden pipette and will be the hosts of the 2018 Nordic iGEM conference.
We want to extend our sincerest congratulations to the University of Copenhagen team for hosting such a spectacular weekend.

Collaboration
Our goals cannot be achieved alone, that is a fact - it is too grand a mission to go on alone. This is one of the central values of iGEM itself, and so no less than 10 international collaborating teams would do:
Collaborating Teams
Leiden
XMU China
Imperial College
DTU-Denmark
SDU-Denmark
Munich United
Gothenburg-Chalmers
Friendship Teams
ITU iGEM
Stockholm
NiC Participants
European Meet-Up Participants (including iGEMs own Randy)
Beyond the tangible lab-cooperation of the above, we have enjoyed many friendships with other teams - discussing our ideas, meeting at international meet-ups and spending hours upon hours on Skype co-developing our ideas.
Our most considerable collaboration is with iGEM Leiden of the Netherlands, who were true examples of the iGEM spirit when they performed experiments for us in their Random Positioning Machine (RPM), allowing us to know how our organisms grow without the usual knowledge of what is up and what is down.
In return, we conducted experiments on their organisms in the Jens Martin Mars Chamber located at UCPH, with parameters such as pressure, UV-radiation, CO2-atmospheres and temperature.
Imperial College are experts on mathematical modelling, and they offered to take a look at our system with this in mind. In return we offered growth and density data for our co-culture, so that they could anchor their theoretical work in actual lab-work as well. In the end, this exact exchange had little impact on our final projects - but it made us all a bit smarter, and made sure we all knew our projects to better detail.
DTU and SDU are our fellow Danes, and we have worked with them closely. From the Biobrick Tutorial hosted by DTU to our own Human Practices Workshop and the Modelling Workshop we all co-hosted at the University of Copenhagen Campus, and all the many social events we shared together"
BNU-China,2017," while the latter ones are the concentrations at the equilibrium state. To further expound this idea, we present the three major chemical reactions in the rhizospheric system.
\[ \begin{align}& \ce{M^2+ + pro <=> pro(M^2+)} \\ & \ce{H+ + pro <=> pro(H+)} \\ & \ce{MN + 2H+ -> H2N + M^2+}                 \end{align}                 \]
The reaction equations written above are highly schematic. $M^{2+}$ represents a typical type of heavy metal ion like $Pb^{2+}$. $pro$ stands for a heavy-metal-binding protein like MBP. $N$ is a general anion which combines with $M^{2+}$ to form insoluble salt. The first reaction is the binding process of heavy metal ions and proteins. From the literature provided by FAFU, we learned that when pH is low, hydrogen ions compete with heavy metal ions for protein binding sites, hence the second reaction. We assume one binding site of ions for each protein molecule. The third reaction captures the PSB’s ability of secreting organic acids into the soil to release heavy metals from their insoluble forms. We denote the equilibrium constants of these equations by $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_3$. We assume that temperature remains mostly stable in our simulation, which makes $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_3$ constant over time.
From our analysis in the overview, we can see that the external influences that can change the balance of this chemical system are the absorption of $M^{2+}$ of the plants, the display and degradation of $pro$, and the increase of $H^+$ brought about by PSB. The change of the concentrations of other reactants is an indirect result from the chemical balance shift. The mixture of external influences and internal balance shifts brings much difficulty to our analysis.
To address this problem, we noticed that at our scale of study which is typically in hours, the chemical reactions are comparatively microscopic, meaning that the system can be viewed as in equilibrium at all times. We can therefore imagine an “initial” state for every equilibrium state and separate the analysis of the chemical process and that of the external changes. With the help of $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_3$, we can also get a one-to-one map between the “initial” states and the equilibrium states.

European Meet-Up
From the 20th to the 22nd of July 2018, iGEM Munich organised the first European Meet-up for 2018. As we were eager to meet the other iGEM participants, a           delegation of our team drove to Munich. Here we enjoyed three days of interesting lectures, poster presentations, social events and sightseeing. It was a great opportunity to meet many iGEM participants and learn about all their great           projects. We look forward to seeing everyone again in Boston and to learn how all the projects turned out.
Postcards
Over the course of the summer we were approached by iGEM HHU to participate in a very cool collaboration set-up called: Postcards. The idea was to           let as many teams as wanted to participate design a postcard related to their project. We could all send them to iGEM HHU and they would redistribute them. Sending us 50 of our own design with addresses of all the other teams and one           from every other participating team. We have received all the postcards and were able to decorate our office with all of them. Thank you iGEM HHU for this great collaboration, we really enjoyed looking through all the great designs!
Eindhoven Mini Jamboree
We had the pleasure of attending the Mini Jamboree in Eindhoven on the 19th of October. Eindhoven organised a mock jamboree in order for the Dutch           team to practice presenting their posters and their final presentation. They even arranged for professional jury members to be present. Afterwards the day was concluded with food and drinks. We immensely appreciate the effort of iGEM           Eindhoven and thank them for inviting us.

Organization of a Meet Up: Another European Meet Up
Reason
After attending two meet ups we realized that these meetings are very enriching experiences in preparation for the Giant Jamboree. One of the main reasons for these meet ups is to get to know and know the project of other teams. Another reason is that it also serves to practice the presentations of the project and its results. And finally serve to open the network of contacts beyond the contest itself.
We realized that the events to which more teams come are usually the first ones to be organized, and in these, although if they serve to obtain collaborations, do not fulfil so much the function of practising to present the results of your project due to at the beginning of the summer there are no results.
This year the European meet up was on July 20. Date in which novice teams, without sufficient contacts, do not yet know how to deal with these events and do not have the necessary funds to attend. And teams with more experience do not yet have conclusive results. With this context, we proposed this ambitious project: Make another European meet up. We invited all the teams of the continent in mid-September. A date that was supposed to be the best for the organization of new teams and with the possibility of simulating the final event.
Event
The event was organized between September 14 and 16. Although this event was given as much publicity as possible and contact was made with all possible teams in Europe, attendance was low due to several factors:
- Spain is geographically at one end of Europe and travel is expensive.
- The teams were short of funds and were saving for the trip to Boston.
- The event was announced at the beginning of September, many teams did not have room to manoeuvre in their organization to attend
Despite these inconveniences, we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.

Protocols
1.DNA purification/Axygen gel extraction
Excise  the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean,  sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination.
Absorb  the liquids left on the surface of the gel slices using paper towels. Weigh gel  slice (tare with empty tube).
Add 3  volumes of DE-A buffer per mg of gel (so a 100mg gel gets 300ul of buffer).
Resuspend  the gel in Buffer DE-A by vortexing. Heat at 75℃ until the gel is completely dissolved (keep heating  for 6-8 minutes). If low-melt agarose gel is used, you may heat it at 40℃. Intermittently vortexing every 2-3  minutes will do a lot of help to accelerate the solubilization.
Note: Buffer DE-A is red liquid, so you can observe the color to make sure the gel is fully dissolved.
Add  0.5× Buffer DE-A volume of Buffer DE-B and mix. If the DNA fragment is less  than 400bp, supplement further with a 1×sample volume of isopropanol.
Note: After the addition of DE-B, the solution should be in the uniform color of yellow.
Place a Miniprep column into a 2ml microfuge tube (provided). Transfer the solubilized agarose from the step above into the column. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
Return the Miniprep column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 500ul of Buffer W1. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
Return the Miniprep column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 700ul of Buffer W2. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.

Cornell,2017," do you feel about the impact of synthetic biology on the world?”.
Figure 2: Frequency count of people describing how they feel about the impact of synthetic biology from highly positive to highly negative
Our data was skewed right, and we were overjoyed to see that a lot of people viewed synthetic biology as a positive influence on the world. Although it appears that more people in Stony Brook viewed synthetic biology positively, we found that there was not a significant difference (p = 0.41) in how people felt about synthetic biology in Stony Brook versus in Ithaca.
Perceptions change over time, so we asked the same question, slightly reworded. We replaced “on the world” with “for future science”, and asked: “How do you feel about the use of synthetic biology/genetic engineering for future science?” The response was not as positive as before:
Figure 3: Frequency count of how people feel about the use of synthetic biology in the future
Although many people felt that synthetic biology was a positive influence on the world, they also felt as if synthetic biology should be more restricted to certain areas of science compared to others. There was no difference in this view between Stony Brook and Ithaca (p = 0.21).
The results we gathered from our participants show us that we need to facilitate more conversation about synthetic biology in our community. We believe that the applications and possibilities of synthetic biology are endless. We hope that one day, others can also share this view.
Synthetic Biology vs. GMO
We started the survey primarily to analyze the impact of geography on the perception of synthetic biology. However, our analysis quickly expanded beyond that. Compared to synthetic biology, the term “genetically modified organism”, or GMO, has a much more negative connotation. GMOs are widely accepted by the general public to be unsafe and unhealthy. We wanted to analyze two things: understanding and perception. We hypothesized that people would answer the same question differently if we used synthetic biology instead of GMO.
Figure 4: Comparison of people’s answers to the questions “how would you rate your understanding of synthetic biology?” vs. “how would you rate your understanding of GMOs?”. On a scale of 1 to 4, 1 means “I know what it is and I can explain it”, and 4 means “I have never heard of it.” Sizes of the points correspond to the number of people and the line y=x shows where both questions have the same answer

Collaboration with iGEM Team Michigan
The Michigan iGEM Team shares the fascination for the use of aptamers in synthetic biology. Their aim is to develop an aptamer based detection system for pathogen related proteins. To create a robust test strip, they implemented their sensor in a cell free expression system using a different approach for riboswitch design. The actual aptamer sensing the substances is a small DNA oligonucleotide which is bound to a trigger DNA oligo. On binding of the aptamer, the trigger is released and turns on a RNA toehold switch leading to the reporter expression. To further extend their system, they asked us for the development of new aptamer sequences to be implemented in their sensor system. We therefore worked on the computational creation of aptamer candidates for proteins and small molecules with our software that might be implemented into their system. Furthermore we discussed ways to implement new aptamers in their existing system. In this process we assessed whether the use of our JAWS software may enable them to fuse a variety of aptamers to a single toehold switch construct. In this process we sketched a potential way for switching larger toeholds with very small aptamers.
To be more precise, we included several of the kanamycin aptamers which we validated in our project work into the toehold switch they intended to use. The figure shows the two states of the toehold switch for one candidate we designed. On the left-hand side, the state with no kanamycin bound is depicted. The toehold-switch is inactive as the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS"

Collaboration in Wego Education
As part of the presentation we brought forth to Wego Bilingual High School, we invited National Chang Gung University to collaborate with us. This presentation includes the introduction to synthetic biology, the process of developing, researching, and expanding on a research topic for iGEM in hopes of inspiring them to create their own team in the upcoming year. In addition to presenting our own topic and past projects of NYMU, we also collaborated with NCGU so that, through their presentation, the students would receive further insights in the understanding of how a research team and project come together. Our presenters started the event off with basic components of synthetic biology and iGEM; the NCGU iGEM team then followed up by focusing on the term “entropy” and, after a series of interactive questions with the student body, brought in their project idea of the de-inking paper. We believe that this collaboration was a success in not only the education of high school kids but also such that the two teams were able to learn more from each other.
Chung Shan Medical University
Assit a new team
In March 2017, thanks to the introduction of medical students in our school, we contacted the students from Chung Shan Medical University and National Chung Hsing University. These students are going to establish a joint team called “CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan”, and participate in the iGEM competition this year. They ask our teacher, Prof. Chang, and our team for some advice about forming an iGEM team, and how to integrate a project. We communicated through webcam, and we also explained and reminded them some competition rules. During the 2017 iGEM Taiwan Conference and the 5th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference, there were great opportunities to exchange both team projects and gave practical suggestions for improvement. We highly look forward to their project and results in Giant Jamboree in November, and are honored to participate in the growth of a new team.
Strengthening long-standing partnership with Taipei America School, we troubleshoot each project mutually by assisting TAS with teaching cloning and constructing primer. In return, they conduct an experiment to ensure our suicide mechanism. As usual, we continue our relationship with TAS. Two members of our team Catherine and Leona are from TAS.

UCAS,2017," development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive understanding of the practical conditions and improved our own project.
Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point

The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

Collaborations
Nowadays, collaboration between researchers plays a critical role in the process of making important breakthroughs in scientific fields. It is more and more difficult to finish a research project by individual group of researchers. That is why most recent Nobel prizes are shared by 3 different scientists. Similarly, for iGEM projects, the successes of we iGEM teams are also highly rely on the collaboration between different teams, although the level of our projects are far lower than those deserve Nobel prizes.
This year, there are totally 4 iGEM teams, FAFU-CHINA, IngenuityLab_Canada, SCUT-China_A and TMMU_China collaborated with SCU-China, either through one directional help or mutual collaboration between each other. The formats of our collaboration are variable. The details of our collaboration are listed below:

1. FAFU-CHINA
In 2016 iGEM competition, iGEM team FAFU-CHINA aimed to use Bt protein family to kill the larva of mosquito, in order to decrease the transition of mosquito borne diseases such as Malaria and Zika. 2A peptide was used to co-express Cry and Cyt toxin (Bt toxin protein family) simultaneously. At the beginning, they cannot express those two proteins, or achieve protein’s function successfully.
After we had a discussion with FAFU-China, we thought it is the 2A peptide residue remained at the end of Cry toxin that affected its function. In order to help them calculate the conservation level of Cry toxin-2A residue protein, our team used Swiss-Model to build a protein model. For Cry4Aa-2A and Cry10Aa-2A, we used homologous model of sequence to predict their functions and activities. Because of the lack of the PDB structure of template Cry11Aa, the homologous model of Cry11Aa-2"

North American Midwestern Meetup
Our team organized a meetup for Midwestern teams on June 30th, held at Michigan State University. In attendance were team members from Rose Hulman Institute of Technology, University of Michigan, Carroll High School, and University of Iowa, respectively. We spent the morning on a very warm tour of the university’s botanical gardens, learning about a range of plants and the history behind the gardens. In the afternoon, each team gave a short presentation and answered questions about their project, ending in a tour of our team’s lab and facilities. Through this meetup, we made connections with other teams and began our collaboration with Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
All of the Meetup attendants pose next to the MSU Horticultural Gardens' statue of the ""father of modern horticulture,"" Liberty Hyde Bailey.

Mid-Atlantic iGEM Meetup 2015
This year we had the amazing opportunity of hosting our first ever regional iGEM meetup at the University of Maryland. This meetup provided an opportunity for iGEM teams from around the region to come together mid-way through their projects to learn from each other, practice presenting, build relationships for future collaboration, and acquire valuable feedback from their peers. The University of Virginia, College of William and Mary, Duke University, and Rock Ridge high School were all in attendance. Each team gave a 25 minute presentation of their project including their progress, goals, and any difficulties they experience so far, followed by a Q&A period with the audience.
The College of William and Mary presented on their project of measuring the intrinsic noise generated by commonly used promoters in the iGEM registry.

    In order to place their research in greater context, many iGEM teams organise surveys and request other iGEM teams from all around the globe to participate. This year, our team participated on a number of surveys to offer help to theses teams. The followings are examples of various surveys that our team had participated in this year:
Survey about food problem : Team Botchan Lab Tokyo organized a survey that questions about society’s recognization toward food. We could not get a specific reason why they made this poll since we could not be replied by them. However, participating in this survey, we sincerely answered questions about nutrients of food or GMO(Genetically Modified Organism) problems.
Invasive Species Survey: Team UNebraska-Lincoln is trying to create an effective bait for the Emerald Ash Borer Beetle, an invasive species to North America. We assisted Team UNebraska-LincolnOur gathering data by answering 10 questions in the survey, such as basic knowledge of invasive species or preference of GMO products.
Burn General Knowledge Survey: Team TecCEM organized a survey to gain information about different treatments of burns around the world, the prevention that is held in your country and how are the statistics in it. By answering their project, we could help their project since Team TecCEM is looking forward to developing a new treatment for burned people, that will reduce the time of hospitalization and help skin regeneration.
Team ICT-Mumbai survey - BBrickIt: Team ICT-Mumbai developed a program that Bio-Bricks any dna sequence for you. The software checks for illegal sites and suggests changes in the sequence too. The team organised survey in order to gather the needs of iGEM teams in regards of their software, with questions regarding how each team created bioBrick parts and which softwares the team used in the course of iGEM project.

Due to limitations of the arduino microcontroller, it was found that there were lower and upper limits to the delay times between each execution of a step by the stepper motor. The suitable range of delay times was found to be between 2180 and 20000 milliseconds. Thus, in order to obtain a desired flow rate, it would be necessary to use different sized syringes for different flow rates.
Due to time restrictions, we did not did not have any more time to work on the stepper motor code which, ideally, we would have done to assist the Edinburgh iGEM team further. If we had sufficient time, we would have liked to develop the code to a point where multiple syringes would be controlled by the same code and where one of them would be able to switch between flow rates in response to a user input such as the press of a button. Additionally, it would have been useful if the system had been more autonomous and had a way of detecting the fluorescent intensity of cells and responding appropriately.

TJU_China for Jilin_China
We helped Jilin_China with an examination between Indigo synthesis and tryptophan. They used monooxygenase TfdB-JLU to degrade 2, 4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase and found that there is some blue matters when culturing bacteria. According to literature searched, they suspected that TfdB-JLU can catalyze benzprole or tryptophan to synthesize indigo. So we designed a test to confirm this guess.                  We cultured their bacteria in LB fluid medium. When its OD600 values reached 0.4, we divided the culture into seven test-tubes. Next, we added 0.2mM IPTG in each test-tube. Then, we added different concentrations of Trp solution, as shown in figure 1. Then we compared the color of the culture after re-incubation for 16 h. The result is shown in the picture. It is obvious that the higher concentration Trp we added, the darker the culture turned to be. Thus, we got a conclusion that tryptophan can catalyze Indigo synthesis within certain range. More Indigo can be produced with a higher concentration of tryptophan.
Figure 1. The result after adding different concentration of Trp.
Jilin_China for TJU_China
We went through the iGEM teams in recent years located in China and found that iGEM16_Jilin_China’s project was about Bifidobacterium longum, which we were to use in our project this year. So we turn to iGEM17_Jilin_China, wishing to be provided the strain, promoter HU and replication origin pMB1 gene that were used in B. longum but not in stock in Biobrick part registry. Fortunately, they were genuinely excited to help us. Samples made last year (one strain and two genes) are activated, renewed and mailed to us. In return, we sent Tianjin’s special local product,"

After our discussion with the HKUST team, we attempt to optimize the Gibson Assembly used to inserted OmpA gene into the desired plasmid.
 Our design to attempt restriction enzyme digestion before we insert the OmpA gene into the plasmids. This can lower the difficulty for PCR amplification as some suggested that if the primers are too close to each other during a circular DNA amplification, it increases the difficulty. As Suggested, routine linearization of plasmid DNA increases the efficiency of PCR amplification as PCR amplification works optimal with relaxed DNA. Hence, we choose to linearize the plasmids before the Laccase and after the Ribosome Binding site using BseRI. Learning from the Nitrogenase Gibson Assembly in our project, which we constructed overlapping region on all fragments, we choose to construct all overlapping regions before Gibson Assembly in this design. This ensure the assembly is specific and prevent frameshift.
 
On the other hand, HKUST team helped us with the SDS-PAGE, characterizing our PETase. As the HKUST team is more experienced with protein extraction, we offered them PETase constructs, which are inserted to pETBlue-2 and pSB1C3, and the result returned is positive, showing that the NEB 5 Alpha strain managed to express the protein in both pETBlue-2 and pSB1C3.
The Collaboration between HKUST team and our team have improved the quality of both teams’ project.

In our project, the reference circuit is important for our data analysis and more accurate data are required for quantitative measurement of our regulatory element. JNFLS helped us to measure the fluorescence intensity of GFP and mCherry in the reference circuit using flow cytometry and plate reader. What's more, in accordance with our protocol, they suggested us to measure the fluorescence when the OD was up to 0.45, which solved our confusion of sampling time.

Indian iGEM Meet Up
This year we hosted the INDIAN iGEM meet up in our campus. Presentations by the teams from IIT-Madras, IISc Bangalore and us to our professors which was followed by a questionnaire session. Possible avenues for collaborations was discussed, which turned out to be fruitful. Apart from this various fun events were organized that helped the teams bond together.
TEC-Chihuahua
We helped them debug their construct by suggesting possible promoters they can use, and answered their questions regarding T7 promoter. We also helped them with the CCMB method of competent cell preparation.
Purdue University
Purdue university helped us characterize our temperature sensitive promoter and exchanged surveys with us
IIT-Madras
We helped them characterize one of their composite parts, which is used to measure the strength of a promoter, transformed the plasmid containing their insert, and took fluorescence readings. In return they characterized one of our temperature sensitive parts..
University Of Westminister
Members of our team reached out to farmers in different districts in Tamil Nadu, to help team West minister understand the current scenario regarding biopesticides in India and the kind of impact their project would have. In return, they helped us with understanding the regulatory framework with regard to GMOs in the U.K. and circulated our urban survey.
IISc Bangalore
Along with IISC we visited two schools and conducted presentations on our respective projects, iGEM and synthetic biology.
Surveys
We also exchanged surveys with the following teams:"

2.2. Examining by GFP
After replacing Rlu with GFP, we transformed two plasmids system and three plasmids system into T24 bladder cancer cells respectively. The positive control group is T24 with a plasmid which carried normal GFP behind CMV promoter. The result we got using Leica fluorescence microscope photographs, which showed that the three plasmids system do have a higher expression degree than the two plasmids system as follows:

Groningen,2018," road trip of 10 hours, we arrived at our destination in Munich in the middle of the night. The next morning, the congress started at 9:00 with a great breakfast and subsequently at 10:00 the symposium started with excellent speakers presenting about various topics within synthetic biology.
After a coffee break, the poster presentation session started. We even had the opportunity to present our poster among others to Randy Rettberg (president of the iGEM foundation) and to Thea Chrysostomou (iGEM ambassador). Furthermore, a lot of cool pitches and great posters varying from personalized identification/treatment of cancer till an E. coli based mosquito trap were presented. Valuable discussions with groups that had similar themes were held. During the meet-up collaborations were initiated with the Bordeaux and Toulouse iGEM team.
The Bordeaux team could use our Chemistry knowledge to guide them with their project. In return they could help us with the ethics part of the project through showing new insights. The Toulouse team promised to send some of their own bacterial synthesized cellulose for us to use.
In the afternoon workshops were scheduled from companies and iGEM teams regarding synthetic biology, entrepreneurship, teambuilding etc. The day was secluded with an arranged barbecue in a restaurant with some drinks.
On Sunday morning two other scientific talks were given, the award for the best poster was given to ETH Zürich and to end up the congress a wrap-up movie was shown of the time at the congress. After the movie it was time to pick up our stuff, say goodbye to our new friends and wish everybody all the best with their projects.
We decided to stay another day in Munich to play tourist and see the beautiful parts of the city. Fortunately a couple of the other teams decided to do this as well. After some sight-seeing, we scheduled a dinner all together at the typical German restaurant “Hofbrauhaus Munich”.  This turned out to be an excellent completion of the weekend. We had life music, German food, beers and lots of fun.
Vilnius Bio Hackaton
The Vilnius iGEM team invited us to join in the first biohackathon organized in Lithuania. The topic of the hackathon: create something to make the life of a biologist in the lab easier. Since we are a very diverse team including many members with a background in a computational field, we gladly accepted their invitation.
We selected a delegation of our team to participate in the biohackathon and set to brainstorming. As we were throwing around some ideas for the hackathon in our office, some of our"

We had the pleasure of collaborating with the Boston University Wetlab iGEM team!
One of the many factors we considered when choosing proteins for our system included its modularity, and having the ability to add additional domains. After much consideration, we decided on using Ms2 to build upon current mechanisms to control alternative splicing (i.e. SSOs). With a gRNA sequence attached to the Ms2 protein, not only is Ms2 able to bind to the target RNA molecule, but the presence of the Ms2 can stabilize and prevent the degradation of the RNA sequence before it gets the chance to bind. Furthermore, there lies the possibility of adding more domains to the Ms2 protein to increase the chances that the RNA won't get degraded and will bind to the target.
In theory, the robustness and modularity of Ms2 should be helpful in transporting RNA. To test this idea, we sought a collaboration with the BU Wetlab iGEM team whose project also relies on RNA.
In order to activate the toe hold switches, and therefore activate gene expression, there must be a ""Trigger RNA"" present to bind the hair pin loop on the ""Switch RNA"". This allows the ribosome binding sight to be accessible to the ribosome for translation. This process only works if the trigger RNA is present and not degraded.
This is where M2s comes in. We had Ms2 attached to the trigger sequence, where the trigger sequence in this case was an SSO. We hope that the presence of MS2 would decrease the likelihood of RNA degradation, while also allowing the possibility of adding additional domains to make RNA degradation even less likely.
The ""target"" depicted in the Ms2 picture pertains to the elements on the Switch RNA used to extend the RNA molecule, and make the RBS accessible.
How did our team benefit from this collaboration?
The BU Wetlab team is using a cell-free system to test their toe hold switches. Since robustness was one of the criteria for choosing a sufficient ribosome binding protein (RBP) to"

The end
Research is fun, but it is more than just lab work. Communication is a very important part in science. Especially iGEM focuses on cooperations and collaborations of different teams all over the world. We met a lot of new interesting people during our iGEM time and hopefully we will stay in contact after the conference.
Meetup in Marburg (15/07/31-15/08/02)
Team Marburg invited all German iGEM teams for a meetup in their little city. After the arrival and putting up the tents on a camping site we split up into little groups containing one member of each team. In these groups we explored Marburg and started to connect. The next day started with the official part where every team introduced themselves and presented their interesting projects. We were pleasantly surprised that every team was very helpful and friendly – they all offered advice and gave tips in their main areas. Afterwards the fun part started when we took part in a friendly canoe race on the river Lahn. The great day ended with a barbecue followed by dancing in a rented club. All in all, the weekend helped to establish many new contacts and to connect all the participating teams.
Bielefeld - Water Samples (15/07/31-15/08/02)
Bielefeld 2015 is working on extensible biosensors to analyze the water quality and detect contaminations with heavy metals. Therefore they asked other iGEM teams to provide water samples. So we brought them water samples from Erlangen to the Meetup in Marburg, where we met Team Bielefeld.

1.HBUT-China & BNU-China
In our collaboration with HBUT-China, we helped them develop a mathematical model of the NcrB protein operon. Their corresponding page can be accessed here: Team:HBUT-China/Collaboration
BNU-China:modeling
Overview
Ni2+ is one of the heavy metal pollutants in our environment. In order to detect the concentration of the Ni2+, HBUT-China team are going to use the NcrB protein operon to achieve this goal. In this system, the nikABCDE gene will express the NikABCDE protein, which belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter. It can transport Ni2+ from the environment into the cell consuming ATP at the same time. And Ni2+ is the signal we need to detect. At the same time the ncrB gene will express NcrB protein, which is a repressor combining with the pncrA promoter, inhibiting the expression of the downstream gene luxCDABE. However Ni2+ will bind with the NcrB protein, causing the NcrB protein drop from the pncrA promoter. In this way, the luxCDABE gene will express. And the LuxCDABE protein can give out light by consuming energy in the cell. Thus we can detect the concentration of Ni2+ by measuring the luminescence intensity.
Hypothesis
1. The hypothesis on the diffusion equilibrium of Ni2+.
We assume that the ions distribute uniformly inside the cell immediately after they are transported into it through NikABCDE. As long as the speed of transportation is lower than the speed of diffusion, the ions are unlikely to aggregate around the transporter protein(e.g., NikABCDE). According to our knowledge, most of the transporter proteins do not possess such a high transporting efficiency, which means this hypothesis is valid in a larger degree"

UCAS,2017," recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component"

Collaboration and sharing, the key to step forward
As iGEMers, we all know sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. If a team seal themselves off, not only will they be trapped in projects, but also cannot stand in a higher position to grasp the overall situation. Instead of cooping ourselves up, we actively cooperated together for the betterment of Synthetic Biology as a whole. UESTC-Software had collaborated with other 5 teams in 6 different ways:
(1) Mentoring and supporting TMMU-China, which is a new team.
(2) Solving problems for UESTC-China, our brother team.
(3) Wet-lab help from UESTC-China, which helped us with validation.
(4) Software testing by AHTU-China, which was the first user of Bio101.
(5) Having meetup with SCU-China, TMMU-China, UESTC-China and SICAU.
(6) Participating meetup with Nanjing-China organized by TMMU_China.
Support for TMMU_China
Background
This year, TMMU_China as a young team needed a lot of support from other experienced teams. iGEM encourages help and collaborations among teams, especially the new teams. Our team built a friendly connection with other iGEM teams like TMMU_China, and we provided some useful supports for them in order to contribute to iGEM the competition itself, and even to Synthetic Biology.
During our iGEM trip, we helped TMMU_China to build Protein Calculator, a web app to predict experiment result based on their modeling.
This programming work is time-consuming but helpful, we believe our effort can cut enormous workload and free their time so that they can focus on their experiments and research.
Main work
After communication and discussion about the workflow and details, our engineer group began to build and test the web app since our Chongqing Trip. We used Django to manage the web and put all necessary contents into HTML files, with related models and views in Python files.

Besides, when SCU-China sought help due to lacking of experimental material, we provided team “SCU-China” LUDOX in our measurement kit to help them complete interlab. We provided the team “SCU-WestChina” the chassis cell , Salmonella, which can degrades uric acid.
SiCAU & UESTC-China
      Team “UESTC-China” lacked wild type of enzyme as comparison to meet the bronze standard. They chose to mutate mutant enzymes to wild type again. We helped them build the DhaA31 using the method of overlap pcr which as the control of BBa-K1199043. This part encodes the halogenated alkane dehalogenase which can degradat the trichloropropane to 2,3-2 chloro-1-propanol.

1. 3+net
3+net is a new concept in the environment track, jointly proposed by ECUST-China and many other universities in China. The purpose is to provide guidance and reference for the iGEM team and bioremediation field. 3+net separately elaborated from the three perspectives of application, biosecurity and society, and explored the relationship among the three.
In order to provide more feasible suggestions for others and better translate laboratory results into technologies with social value, 3+net summarize the protocols for general bacterial resistance elimination from the application point of view; The suicide switch and mechanism, summed up the hardware of various scenarios of soil, water and air; from the social perspective, formulated iGEMer's laws and regulations on bioremediation from China, and investigated the opinions of Chinese people on applying biotechnology to environmental governance. 3+net provides a universal solution to the current problems, which will greatly promote the development of bioremediation.

Picture1:3+net logo
As a member of 3+net, we took on the task of hardware. This is somehow a big problem. Every year, many “environment track” teams develop amazing biological pathways, which provides the possibility to solve some practical problems. However, time is limited. As for the platform of the application-hardware device, these teams will encounter difficulties more or less. Many teams are taking the detours that others have already traveled over and over again. We hope to solve this problem - in fact, many teams' projects are consistent in the application scenario, we can classify these application scenarios and provide an optimal hardware template for each situation. In the future, the team can find a template and modify it to suit their projects.

NEU_China_A,2018," meetup】
Collaboration is always about exchanging ideas and we believe that collective thinking can do a lot of good for iGEM projects. NEU_China_A have participated in a virtual meet-up with AHUT_China, SDU-CHINA, and NWU-China. In the virtual meetup, our four iGEM teams mainly exchanged the progress of each of team’s project, especially the problems encountered in the experiment, the progress of the modeling work, the interpretation of the requirements of the awards, etc.
Jilin_China
Jilin_China used sfGFP_optimism as reporter protein in their gene circuit this year. The existing sfGFP in the iGEM registry Kit has a BbsI restriction site and lacks ease of application. Therefore, this year Jilin_China optimized the sequence of sfGFP, and the optimized sfGFP no longer contains BbsI restriction sites, so sfGFP_optimism can be conveniently applied to GoldenGate assembly. To verify the necessity for sfGFP optimization, NEU_China_A sent experimental materials:superfolder GFP (BBa_I746916)  in the Distribution Kit to them. NEU_China_A utilized blue pigment protein（amilCP）as reporter protein after detecting NO signal this year. In return, Jilin_China very kindly sent Nitrate reporter: PyeaR-GFP composite (BBa_K381001) and Test Device 4 for interlab (BBa_J364007) to our team. After constructing the plasmid, we verified by experiments that the blue protein can be expressed normally after exposure to NO.
JNFLS
This year our project requires the use of the intestinal probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, as the chassis organism, but this strain is not a common strain in the laboratory. Knowing that JNFLS has relevant strain information, we turned to the JNFLS iGEM team for help. Fortunately, they sent it very generously to us with scribing plates and glycerol cryotubes of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 so that we can use it in the future.
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
At 5th CCiC, we learned that SJTU-BioX-Shanghai intends to develop new methods for diagnosing colorectal cancer, which is closely related to our project.

LZU-China,2015," transformed with a helper plasmid harboring genes encoding the λ-Red enzymes, I-SceI endonuclease, and RecA. λ-Red enzymes expressed from the helper plasmids are used to recombine a small ‘landing pad’, a tetracycline resistance gene (tetA) ﬂanked by I-SceI recognition sites and landing pad regions, into the desired location in the chromosome. After tetracycline selection for successful landing pad integrants, the cell is transformed with a donor plasmid carrying the desired insertion fragment; this fragment is excised by I-SceI and incorporated into the landing pad via recombination at the landing pad regions.[2] We think this more effective and easy method would help them overcome the problem. So, we recommended TJU to adopt the two-step λ-Red method to knock out the pflB gene.
After their reconstruction of the engineered strain, a more visible contrast was shown as below.

East Chapel Hill High School iGEM Team
This year, our iGEM team collaborated with the East Chapel Hill High School iGEM team to hold a conference geared towards other teams across the Southeastern United States. While we had a small start, three teams participated in the event. During our conference, we discussed our individual projects, and offered each other advice and criticisms and suggestions for improvement. We also invited a few guest speakers to participate, and they told us more about careers, ethics, and advancements in the field of synthetic biology.
Reddit Page
Later on during the conference, we chose to create a page on Reddit geared towards discussion of synthetic biology and ethics. Teams and individual iGEM members from around the world would be encouraged to research and take a stance on different topics, such as morally questionable experiments within the field and how science fiction influences the public’s opinions on synthetic biology, among others. Our teams also created a discussion-based game, influenced by the “Building with Biology” forum kit. Instead of discussing the malaria, however, our teams decided the Zika virus was more relevant.

BostonU_HW,2018," our own for when the new chip is assembled and tested.
Version 2
Following the observations made when testing the initial version of this collaboration chip, the overall chip area was significantly reduced while the actual design was made more spaced out. This, combined with a thicker layer of PDMS, lead to the chip seal holding. The chip was capable of creating the proof of concept droplets out of different colors of water, but when the different solutions were introduced, the viscosity of the sodium alginate solution inhibited the formation of droplets. Now that the chip no longer leaks, it was decided that perhaps shortening the length travelled by the segregated solution would reduce the effects the viscous solution.
Version 3
This version of the Harvard Collaboration Chip was not designed by the 2018 BostonU Hardware iGEM team, but by one of our mentors Ali Lashkaripour. It is similar to last version with a few differences. First, the three liquids meet right before the droplet generator. Second, the overall dimensions of the chip are smaller which leads to a better seal. Lastly, the channels have varying widths due to the initial purpose of chip. This last detail is not relevant to the chip’s purpose here. When this chip was tested with the sodium alginate solution, it behaved similarly to to the last version, with the viscous solution creating tailing droplets but no individual encased droplets. After observing
this repeatedly under a variety of different flow rates ratios, it was decided that a new geometry was needed to achieve the collaboration’s desire outcome.                 Using a similar chip with only a single input, we were able to conclude that the while the sodium alginate solution was capable of forming droplets, it did so independently of the chip geometry. After this test and some literature review, a T-junction was decided upon for the new version of this collaboration chip.
Version 4
This latest version of the chip utilizes a T-junction instead of the droplet generators we have been using in the rest of our chips. Similar to the previous chip, all three inputs meet right before the T-junction. Unlike the other chips, a T-junction uses only a single stream of oil instead of pinching the solution with two streams, letting the droplets formed partially independent of geometry. During the first test with parameters similar to those tested in the last design, the problem remained. While there were some droplets being formed independent of chip geometry, there remains no way of making consistent, uniform droplets with the viscous sodium alginate solution. Additionally this chip, like the other
versions, is prone"

With interactive learning activities centered around William and Mary’s synthetic biology teacher curriculum, and the Building with Biology kit activities that facilitated dialogues on synthetic biology, our collaboration with Loudoun STEM Day has resulted in outreach to over 700 people. Through these 2 collaborative Loudoun STEM days, we have succeeded in extending STEM learning, getting feedback from the public about their views on synthetic biology, and having useful and important conversations with the public about genetic engineering and its implications.
Building with Biology - Public Engagement Project in Synthetic Biology
We collaborated with Building with Biology, a synthetic biology project funded by the National Science Foundation and led by the Boston Science Museum,  American Society for the advancement of Science, BioBuilder Foundation, Science Museum of Minnesota, and the Ithaca Science Center. Intrigued by Building with Biology’s goals of creating conversations between the public and those in the field of synthetic biology, we applied to receive a physical kit of activities to be used at public venues and schools, in order to create these conversations. We have used their well designed activities, and the thoughtful, comprehensive guides to each activity, that included questions for sparking debates on the topic of synthetic biology. The public forum activity in particular was highly effective in stimulating deep discussions about the safety and ethical concerns of synthetic biology.  Collaborating with Building with Biology has provided us with lessons on how to better engage with the public in discussions about new technologies in synthetic biology, and their risks and implications."

Manchester,2017," labelling of GMO products. The European Union, Australia, India and Indonesia all require the packaging of such products to be bear the label “this product contains genetically modified organisms”, although exceptions do exist in the form of medical products (in the European Union) and foods produced by animals fed with GMO foods (in Australia). Japan and Korea follow a percentage scale, with GMO labelling required if a product contains more than 5% and 1% genetically-modified ingredients respectively.
*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*
There are no requirements for labelling products that contain GMOs.
In Canada, under the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada. The Standards Council of Canada has taken in the Voluntary Labelling and Advertising of Foods That Are and Are Not Products of Genetic Engineering. This states a requirement to label food that may potentially cause health and safety risks and well as have any considerable changes in nutrition and composition. Thus, there are no policies put in place for the mandatory labelling of foods detailing if they’re genetically modified unless there are reasons to do so such as a potential health and safety risks. Many food products might not be directly genetically modified but may contain ingredients such as corn or soy which have been genetically modified. To know if a food or its ingredients have been genetically modified, one would have to contact the manufacturer.
Final consumer packaging or pre-packaged products containing GMOs should be labelled: ‘This product contains genetically modified organisms [or the names of the organisms]’. This does not apply to medical products.
Under the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, it is a legal requirement for any food products derived from GMMs be labelled with the words “genetically modified” to ensure that consumers can make informed purchasing decisions. However, an exception to this is any foods produced by animals fed GM products which are not required to have this label.
Currently, if the product is made of a GMMs plant/seed or if the final product contains any traces of a GMM used as an ingredient, the package must have a symbol “T” of transgenic (figure below) on its package and the words “This product contains [name of the organism] transgenic.” However, the Congress and the Senate are currently voting on a project that modifies this law to remove the “T” symbol and leave the words “This product contains [name of the organism] transgenic” only if 1% or more of the final product has been genetically modified.
Any product made for human consumption that has different nutritional characteristics than conventional ones due to its genetic modifications must be clearly labeled as GM.

Mentoring IISER-Kolkata
For a team participating in the competition for the first time, IISER-Kolkata got in touch with us much before the announcement for iGEM 2018 came in. At that time, the later to-be members of these teams were busy with their project work at the National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore. The talk about iGEM started more or less over lunch when the topic of BioBricks came up.
Since then, we have been in constant contact regarding both lab work and administration on how to go about running the team. Being from an Institute from where teams have been participating for two years in a row, IISc-Bangalore was in the right position to mentor IISER-Kolkata with the knowledge we had gained from our predecessors. The interaction was especially valuable because it provided a more regional outlook on the issues we were facing and how we could go about solving them. From financial issues like how to go about submitted the registration fees to tips regarding cloning, the interaction shaped a large part of both the teams’ project work.
Organizing the All-India iGEM Meetup
A very important part of iGEM is the kind of interaction local teams have amongst themselves before they go for the Jamboree. Being from the same country we usually have similar problems relating to logistics and lab supplies.
This year, the IISc-Bangalore iGEM team organised the meetup where six other teams from the country participated and discussed their projects. The meetup itself was a mix of fun activities and presentations. This was followed by a poster presentation on the last day where the teams got feedback from the audience regarding their posters. A more strict analysis was done by two judges who graded the posters on multiple criteria. This feedback was sent to the teams after the meetup. Mr. Hassnain, the iGEM ambassador for Asia also joined us on the last day of the meetup to discuss after iGEM.
Other than IISc-Bangalore, the following teams participated in"
Missouri_Rolla,2018,". Another option is to integrate resistant ash tree cuttings onto normal ash trees in nurseries, as this cloning is how most urban nurseries produce trees anyways (rather than growing through seed). Predatory wasps would work most effectively in forested ash populations, as the trees are more clustered, and there is a larger gradient between the separate populations of ash.
What is the monetary impact of EABs in Missouri?
Ash trees are one of the most common types of trees used in urban environments. For example, in some parks and neighborhoods, up to 40% of all intentionally planted trees are some sort of Ash. This significant lack of species diversity means that the destructive effects of EAB will be magnified, as will the cost of dealing with it. Here in Missouri, cities have been using estimates from more greatly affected states to prepare budgets in preparation for the arrival of EAB. Considering the average cost of over $1 million in some Ohio communities, the city of Chesterfield budgeted $2.2 million for Ash tree removal and replacement alone back in 2012. Meanwhile, the city of Brentwood estimated their costs would be just over $500,000, with an average cost of approximately $65 per resident. Little information has been collected on the impact of EAB on Missouri’s logging industry, however, over 15,000 units of Ash lumber were harvested and sold in 2017 according to the Missouri Department of Conservation."

Kazakhstan Collab
Our collaboration with Kazakhstan team began when they contacted us to talk about molecular modelling. As we’re working with enzymes that can be highly influenced by their structures and their interactions, we were very glad to contribute with them.
We had a meet via Skype and we discussed and passed to them some of our data, and so they returned with a model, exploring the reasons behind all the molecular proprieties.
That’s important to understand the functioning of the protein and, maybe, we can solve certain problems or be able to find a probable substrate for the enzyme with these models.
Stockholm Collab
In September, we contacted the Stockholm team because our projects are similar and we wanted to exchange ideas and information. After a Skype meeting, we talked about how our projects were going and what we had done so far.
After this, they shared with us their knowledge about different Waste Water Treatment Plants presents in Sweden and we sent them the information we had about our local WWTP. With this information exchange, we were able to compare how Europe (Nordic) and South America (Brazil) regions treat their wastewater. This helped us on gain some perspective for our project's Application.
CCA San Diego Collab
Also in September, we received contact from CCA-San_Diego to do a collaboration. After some exchange on information about our projects, we decided to help their Public Engagement project
This iniciative consisted in a Video Series destinated to groups that want to attend on iGEM some day. It was a really nice way to see what we had achieved so far by sharing our expirience with future iGEMers. Check the videos here: https://2018.igem.org/Team:CCA-San_Diego/Engagement .
LATAM Magazine
Collecting information from Latin America teams, UChile_Biotec team designed a magazine that gathered several aspects of the competition and the projects of the participating teams, as well as integrating cultural information. We joined this project by sharing details and the implications of our project, our own experience as iGEM members and describing some interesting, fun elements of the Brazilian culture regarding science and biotechnology.
The final result is impressive and it can be seen here:"

Survey on Colorectal Cancer - Team Worldshaper-Wuhan
CRISPR along the iGEM - Team Amazonas Brazil"
BostonU,2015," were largely a computational design team. We suggested that they include more pertinent information about synthetic biology, such as more about the science behind the key reactions occurring in bacteria, in order to engage some of their older age group visitors. They ended up using actual BioBrick parts from the iGEM registry as elements of their synthetic biology reactions. We also suggested that more detailed information about methodologies be included, such as using “how to screens” to better explain experimental protocols. This was inspired by our own experiences doing wet lab research - we learned how different procedures worked when they were laid out in step-by-step protocols.
We heard more about Wellesley’s final device at the second NEGEM meetup. Their platform is very exciting, and we look forward to seeing reactions of the iGEM community at the jamboree! Furthermore, we are very excited to have participated in troubleshooting an exhibit that will someday featured in a real museum."
NUS_Singapore-A,2018," suitable primers to increase the chances of successful construction. In addition, they incorporated the RNA aptamer that they aimed to characterise, tRNALys3-iSpinach, with our stress promoter ( BBa_K2819010 ), for us to characterise. Both teams agreed on constructing the constructs from both teams simultaneously, using the set of primers which Team CUHK has designed. They advised us to use overlap PCR in our constructions, a technique that we don’t usually use in our lab.  We took their advice and were delighted to find out from our gel electrophoresis results that our overlap PCR was successful!
Gel Electrophoresis of PhtpG1-RNA aptamers
With their help, we eventually succeeded in constructing the RNA aptamer plasmids! We managed to successfully construct our plasmids, as well as Team CUHK’s parts. Subsequently, NUSGEM assisted CUHK in characterising their parts. We measured the fluorescence intensity given off by the RNA aptamers under different temperatures according to the assay protocol provided by them. After we obtained the results, we sent them the data obtained from our characterization. They subsequently found that that tRNALys3-iSpinach-D5 gives off a higher fluorescence reading than tRNALys3-Spinach 2.1, a previous biobrick ! Figure 1 refers to the graph which they have obtained from their analysis.
Figure 1: Graph was plotted and provided by Team CUHK
Last but not least, CUHK also hoped to carry out their survey with a wider audience, so NUSGEM did the survey and spread the word of their survey to help them with gathering responses in Singapore.

TEAMS TOULOUSE-INSA-UPS and ULAVAL: HUMAN PRACTICES
What started out as a informal discussion session between Team Toulouse-INSA-UPS and Team ULaval developed into a exciting collaboration opportunity between three groups from different parts of the world. All three teams wanted to bring to light how matters synthetic biology touches different aspects of our quotidian life in an interesting and educational manner.
After weeks of discussion and deliberation, the three main subjects we chose to discuss were bioethics in synthetic biology, economic aspects, and societal perspectives of synthetic biology. We are excited to present to you our Collaborative Report - please check it to learn more about the issues surrounding synthetic biology!

Collaborations
Collaboration between teams has been an important part of our project. Indeed, the data sharing and the joint work are not only necessary in this competition but more generally in the scientific field.  So, we were lucky to collaborate with different teams around the world. We have discussed about our projects and about collaborative work on common themes. The exchanges and discussions were mostly done during meetings, through e-mail and skype session.
Collaboration with Evry-Paris Saclay Team
We invited Evry-Paris Saclay iGEM team to join us to share with the pupils their knowledge, their lab skills and their vision of iGEM experience. Thus, we collaborated with two members of their team. Rose attended the practical class with us (1st session). She was very patient with the pupils and helped us in the long process preparation of the material and solutions on the day of the class. Yanis was here for the 2nd session (Interpretation of results, introduction to synthetic biology, Presentation of iGEM competition and our projects, overview of biology at university). He has an actual pedagogical talent and the pupils immediately appreciated him. This was a great illustration for the kids that scientific research is based on collaboration and team work.  We also collaborated on another side of the Human Practices: law. We met Evry team’s jurist, Maxime de la Fouchardière and we had the opportunity to ask our question and learn a lot about intellectual property and legal issues. He gave us an extensive view on the legal process regarding the authorization of use for human drugs and cattle oriented therapeutics. finally he gaved us insight on the legal issues regarding the use of GMO in Europe and the potential consquences of the widespread of one of these organism in the wild.  Thank you very much Evry-Paris Saclay, we really had a smashing time working with you.
Collaboration with Team Harvard
Harvard team had the idea to gather ethical, academic and political issues concerning projects of 6 teams: Harvard, Linkoping, AQA_Unesp, Aalto-Helsinki, Hamburg and ours"
OUC-China,2015," provide teams with biobricks related to which had been used lately, and information about other teams’ experiences.
In order to give better simulation results and predictions to users, we helped them to improve their functions of the simulation part and deal with some detailed statistics. We also concluded the common use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and logistic models and assisted them in the parameter choice and analysis. Thus they enriched their simulation part with deterministic model and parameter analysis.
For the development of the software, we also gave our sincere advice about the User Interface (UI). It then advanced their optimization and made the software better.
Help from Peking
We introduced Gibson Assembly to our lab this year. During the processing, we obtained a lot from Yihao Zhang, who is this year's team leader of Peking.
Help from Berlin
Fig.4. Team photo of Berlin.
We also got a lot for the help from Berlin. Early in our project, we had some questions about character of ferritins and the details of mineralization. Berlin answered us meticulously and gave many useful advices. Finally, they sent us the parts including BBa_K143800, BBa_K143801, BBa_K1438025, BBa_K1438022, BBa_K1438027, BBa_K1438028 and BBa_K1438031. However, we failed to transform the plasmid into E.coli, and we have to construct three parts by ourselves. We still thank our friends from Berlin so much, both their advices and cooperation spirits.
Raman Spectrometer of QIBEBT
The Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology (QIBEBT) was cofounded by Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the provincial government of Shandong and the municipal government of Qingdao in 2006. QIBEBT is one of China’s primary national research institutions for renewable energy and green materials, focusing mainly on research and development of the resources, technologies, products and processes for bio-based energy and materials.
We used Raman Spectrometer there to test the protein expression of our devices under Yetian Su’s guidance. We do appreciate the favour of providing us with equipment and technical support.
Participation in iShare

TMMU_China,2016,"
As a new team, with limited knowledge of iGEM competition, we desperately needed instructions and suggestions on how to start and manage a team. We have met obstacles and setbacks and we have been seeking advice from 3 teams.
NUDT-China: We invited iGEM NUDT-China that has participated in iGEM for three times to answer our puzzles. During the meeting, NUDT-China introduced the iGEM process, and shared their experience in team building in detail with us. At the same time, they gave comments on our project, and put forward a lot of good ideas.
Nanjing-China: After proposing some initial ideas of our own project, in order to polish up it, some of our team members went to Nanjing University to obtain experience. In Nanjing University, both teams gave a presentation on their project design. As a veteran team, Nanjing-China gave us constructive suggestions which were significant to us. From then on, we gradually became clearer in thoughts and got started with our work.
UESTC-China: The UESTC-China post some plasmids and introduced to us some details about the iGEM.
Counseling
Biosafety issues
Doctor Li Ming is experienced in doing research in horizontal gene transfer and teaching the lecture on biosafety for undergraduates. The biosafety issue is one of the major concerns of both participant teams and organizers of iGEM. Before we started in the wet lab, we asked Doctor Li to evaluate the biosafety issues of our whole project. He introduced the biosafety classifications of different organisms and protection practices among different biosafety level labs. The Vi antigen project was his major concern and he gave us valuable suggestions. He also communicated with Doctor Cong Yanuang to confirm our lab procedures, making sure we were not going to culture S.Typhi but just to extract the genomic DNA of S.Typhi. He helped us analyze whether there were potential transposable elements among the His targeting locus, and the result proved to be negative, which meant the device integrated into the His locus would not be horizontally transferred to other bacteria. At last, he brought up with several biological containment strategies, including the metabolic auxotroph, suicide genes and kill switches. We really appreciate Doctor Li’s instructions on biosafety issues and his thoughtful ideas helped us a lot.
Antibiotic resistance issues
Antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria to resist the effects of antibiotics. Due to the abuse of antibiotics, multidrug resistant bacteria have emerged and posed great threat to public health, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter ba"

Over the summer, our iGEM team started corresponding with the Washington University in St. Louis team. We decided to collaborate with one another by testing both of our projects at the same time.
The WashU team is comparing the “effectiveness of several genes on the level of UV radiation tolerance in E. coli”. They are using four genes that provide UV resistance: uvsE, Dsup, phrAC and BCP. This October, they mailed us these four plasmids so we could put them into our chromosome-integrating plasmids (then transform them into yeast).
In our collaboration, we gave the WashU team advice in the building of their UV radiation machine. While we were unable to test their genes this year, we hope to continue our collaboration and further characterize their parts.
GeneHackers 2017"
Munich,2017,"GEMers who came to meet us. We were very happy to have them in our lab and to get to know each other's team.
iGEM Bristol
Team Bristol have a project called BREATHE, in which they modify E.coli cells to metabolize NOx compounds from the atmosphere into ammonia. With help from a bioreactor, the ammonia can be oxidized to molecular nitrogen, producing electricity. This way, BREATHE not only reduces air pollution, but provides energy too. As a side project, team Bristol developed the iGEM Development Environment (IDE) to help other teams edit their wiki faster and efficiently. When we found out about this tool, we wanted to try it out and reached them, who happily explained us how to use it. The IDE helped us speed up our wiki editing, specially in the initial steps, and made working on the wiki more convenient and easy. In turn, we provided them feedback about the software, so they can further develop this useful tool for future iGEM teams.
iGEM Berlin diagnostX
Their iGEM project is called Wormspotter, where they want to use a toehold switch to diagnose tape worm infections. Tape worm infections are very common in many countries in Asia and Africa, and Team Berlin wants to help make the detection of such infections rapid and affordable. We have some similarities in the project regarding the use of RNA and paper strips. They are also working a lot on RNA extraction and on amplification of the RNA product. They also want to have a visible readout on the paper to detect the presence of tapeworm RNA as we do. Therefore we decided to help each other by addressing each other's problems and by helping to solve them. We had Skype meeting sessions and exchanged emails to keep each other updated. We also talked on how the challenges of RNA amplification could be optimized and how we can make good use of each other's detection system.
iGEM UCL
Their project is called LIT (Light Induced Technologies)and they work with light-activated gene networks in mammalian cells and aim to create a novel transmembrane protein. For that reason, they were looking for a signal peptide to deliver their protein of interest to the ER as well as a transmembrane domain to ensure its embedding inside the plasma membrane. We sent them two BioBricks from last year's team that were not released yet by the iGEM Registry: BM-40 (BBa_K2170214) and TMD-EGFR (BBa_K2170214) . They were able to integrate"
NEU_China_A,2018,", which has contributed to our cooperation in the optimization of CSCA protein expression conditions and product purification for AHUT_China. We tested the expression efficacy of CSCA at different temperatures, different induction time, and different IPTG concentrations. By comparing the protein expression level, we determined that the best induction condition was induced at 37 °C, 0.5mM IPTG for 6 h. After induced by IPTG, CSCA protein was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, which suggested that the CSCA protein was expressed with molecular weights of about 60 kD. Since the N-terminal of CCA carries a 6 x His tag, the expression product was purified by passing the Ni+ affinity chromatograph column, which ultimately helped AHUT_China to obtain 1 mg of purified CSCA protein with a purity greater than 85%.
DLUT_China
【Data comparison of kill switch】
Security issues have always been a very important part of the iGEM competition. This year NEU_China_A and DLUT_China have worked together in the kill switch section. From the proposing the idea of a kill switch, the choice of lethal system, the construction of the plasmid vector to the characterization of the part, NEU_China_A and DLUT_China cooperate with each other. After discussion between two teams and with reference to the experience of the previous iGEM team, we choose the maz-EF system and Lysis two different systems. Two characterization methods were used to verify the function of the kill switch, one is plate induction and the other is a growth curve.
NEU_China_A and DLUT_China compared the lethal efficiencies of two different kill switch systems. The two teams verified the efficiency of cold shock expression of Lysis and mazF by measuring the growth curve under the same experimental conditions. Our data indicate that due to the high toxicity of mazF, even low expression of toxic proteins is sufficient for cell death. In contrast, the cold shock expression Lysis showed a better kill switch property. In vivo at 37℃, low expression of lysis is not enough to cause functional probiotics to die, while short-term (<4h) cold shock induction in vitro can fully inhibit cell growth. In short, cold shock expression of Lysis as a kill switch is a better choice.

Mentoring the iGEM team Wuerzburg
We consider iGEM not only as a competition but as a possibility to create bonds with a great community of highly motivated students. At the German iGEM Meet-Up in Marburg we were approached by the newly founded iGEM team Wuerzburg . As the Munich team is well established in the iGEM competition, we agreed on helping them with their first iGEM project.
Throughout the following months, we advised their team. We discussed their project and shared our knowledge on all topics. These were ranging from the competition itself to financing. After this great bonding, we decided to become their official iGEM mentor.
We focused our mentoring on:
Regular contact via Skype, E-Mail and WhatsApp
Guidelines on finding financial support (sponsors portfolio)
Professional appearance
Team contract
Solving technical issues during the InterLab study
Track selection
We met again during the European Meetup in Munich and tightened our bonds even further. In the future, we plan to consolidate our partnership.
Assessing Water Quality with iGEM Tec-Monterrey
After the initial contact via E-Mail, we decided to have a video call to further discuss about collaboration possibilities. We were especially interested in their human practice program, in which they compared the water pollution of several rivers all over the world, by photometrically testing its Nitrate burden. This is also interesting for us, because bacteriophages can be isolated from waste water and rivers.
Therefore, findings on the biological and chemical composition of open waters are highly relevant to us. Since iGEM Tec-Monterrey also wanted to include a German river sample to their data, we had the chance to start our collaboration right there. The Isar, the main river in Munich, flows right behind our lab, allowing us to take a sample. Due to some problems with the postal service, the team had trouble receiving all their samples. Luckily, we were able to test the samples with ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy in our lab using their experimental protocol. In return, the iGEM Team Tec-M"
Aalto-Helsinki,2017,"’s team contacted us and offered a collaboration in human practices. The idea was to see how people view bio-manufacturing opposed to currently common factory methods. This way Harvard’s team could analyze the differences in the interaction between culture, political regulations, and people’s perceptions of bio-manufacturing since they would have answers from both Europe and the USA. We had a conversation via Skype to develop the collaboration further and spread the world to other European iGEM teams in order to get more responses.
The actual collaboration consisted of coming up with some questions and commenting on the questions by other teams on Harvard’s Global Perspectives Outreach (GPO). The other teams involved in the survey were Linkoping, AQA_Unesp and Hamburg.  We also distributed the survey through our social media channels and gave our thoughts on how to process it. For participating team Harvard gave us the results to use in our own human practices, but unfortunately despite being distributed in several countries only 30 people answered it and therefore one cannot draw any proper conclusions of the survey.
Skyping with team Harvard
iGEM Team Cologne Düsseldorf
We noticed Düsseldorf Cologne’s announcement on the iGEM collaborations page and decided to participate to this fun idea. Therefore we designed a synthetic biology postcard about our project according to the organisers instructions and send 200 postcards via Düsseldorf Cologne’s team all over Europe, so that we could in exchange get a mix of all the other postcards from all the other team. The postcards were then distributed in different events like Biotech Tour in Heureka, Turku presentation and Aalto University’s events.
Our postcard
Hamburg and Delft
We had lengthy and productive discussions about our projects and human practices with team Hamburg while at the European iGEM Meetup in Delft (the Netherlands). We also tried to have a bigger collaboration with team Hamburg and team TU Delft in which Team TU Delft would have provided us with folding-related tardigrade proteins which might have allowed us to send our peptide dermcidin to team Hamburg’s Biosafety Level 2 laboratory without loosing too much activity. This would have allowed us to access safety level two bacteria essential to our application like Propionibacterium acnes in order to test dermcidin’s antimicrobial properties further. Unfortunately this did not work out due to time limitations, but it would have been an interesting collaboration.

August 28th 2018 until the Giant Jamboree
As a team interested in building a good wiki we liked to know which iGEM team pages were the most popular. To get     the best data for inspiration, we made a web application for ranking all teampages by views. Using this application     we can search for the current best pages. There is even an option to filter for a certain team and/or subpage. Of     course, this application is now publically available on our wiki! We find this application helpful and we hope     other iGEM teams will use it to better their own wiki.
Biotechnology conference
Organised by Utrecht and Aachen
September 20th 2018
Team Utrecht and Aachen organised a biotechnology conference, which was really interesting. Many different     speakers, businesses and backgrounds were presented at the conferenfe. Also did we get a little presentation from     the organising teams themselves and team Utrecht 2017 with their projects. We learned a lot about the other teams     and got some tips from team Utrecht 2017. It was a nice evening and we wish team Utrecht and team Aachen the very     best, see you in Boston!

Nordic iGEM Conference
In the collaboration with Uppsala's iGEM team, we organized and hosted a meet-up for 60 students from eight Nordic iGEM teams. Teams participating in the Nordic iGEM Conference were Oslo, SDU Danmark, Aalto Helsinki, Linköping, Copenhagen, Gothenbug as well as Uppsala and us, Stockholm. We also had a pleasure to have Randy Rettberg, president of the iGEM foundation, with us during the conference.
Our Nordic iGEM Conference was a three-day-long event. We had a mini-Jamboree along with the project presentations and a prize – the famous Golden Pipette. There were also workshops, fabulous dinners and a great bar-crawl in Uppsala. It was a great experience, and the Nordic iGEM Conference will be certainly repeated next year.

BGU Israel
Together with BGU Israel we have worked on a possible affibody-based application of their idea for cancer therapy. Their system is delivered to mammalian cells with Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and triggers expression or knockout when two cancer-related promoters are simultaneously highly active. One method of the therapy could be to specifically target cancer cells with a toxin. Since affibody molecules can be engineered to bind almost any protein with high specificity and affinity, it might be possible to direct these toxins towards cells that express affibody molecules on their surface. To try this concept, we decided that"
Sorbonne_U_Paris,2018," soil-dwelling, non-pathogenic, naturally competent and nutritionally versatile organism especially known for its ability to degrade aromatic compounds. However, only a few tools are available for its gene manipulation. This year, we plan to expand the toolkit for A. baylyi ADP1 by making a synthetic promoter library along with codon optimized fluorescent reporter proteins to achieve better control over its expression rates. The codon table is not available for this organism. So we obtained sequence data of well-characterised proteins of this organism by filtering manually putative and hypothetical sequences and used this data to generate the codon table using CUTE - a tool of ChassiDex. The codon optimisation is done manually by replacing the less frequent codons with high-frequency codons based on the generated table. This can potentially open up various new exciting synthetic biology opportunities with this unexplored organism.

IIT Madras asked us for a collaboration to translate educational synthetic biology videos into our native languages. So we translated some of their video scripts to French, Italian and Persian. We also recorded the audio of some videos: the “DNA and RNA” video in French and Italian and the “introduction of synthetic biology” video in Persian. It was a real pleasure to help them in this fantastic initiative!

Stronger Together: An efficient, generalizable approach to design biosensors for small molecules
Abtract
Chemically induced dimerization (CID), in which two proteins dimerize only in the presence of a small molecule, has been widely used to control cell signaling, regulatory, and metabolic pathways, and used as logic gates for biological computation in living mammalian cells. However, few naturally occuring CID systems and their derivatives are currently available. Creating a CID system with desired affinity and specificity for any given small molecule remains an unsolved problem for computational design and other protein engineering approaches. To address this challenge, we have used a novel strategy to select CID binders from a vastly diverse combinatorial nanobody library. We have created new CID systems that can sense cholecalciferol and artemisinin. We are validating CID biosensors by"

Survey with ETH Zürich team
Despite being a small country, Switzerland has no less than four national languages. It also benefits from a large pool of cultures from all around the world. While probing the opinion of the public about synthetic biology and our project, it would have been a shame not to take advantage from this diversity. Luckily, the ETH Zürich team had the same interest in the public opinion as ours for their project. As we were about to hold a stand in Lausanne’s (French speaking part of Switzerland) street, our teams therefore developed together a survey integrating general questions as well as more specific questions relative to our projects. The survey was big success, so we decided to go one step further and organized another similar event in Basel (Swiss-German speaking part of Switzerland) with the ETH Zürich team. Doing so allowed us to gather the opinion of even more people and helped us investigating the difference between the populations of those two cities. Find more information about our results on the ETHZ wiki or on our Human Practices page.
Survey in Basel
Getting ready for the Giant Jamboree:  After the survey in Basel, the EHTZ team invited us to visit their lab. We performed a simulation of our presentations for Boston in order to get used to talking about our projects to other synthetic biologists, and of course to get rid of this stage fright!
Meeting in Bordeaux
The iGEM Bordeaux team invited us for a meetup in their city with the teams from Aix-Marseille , KU Leuven , Paris-Pasteur , Paris-Saclay and Toulouse . This was a great opportunity to share the experiences and challenges we had during iGEM and to learn from the other teams, as well as meet some friendly people before the Jamboree ! The main event was at the science museum Cap Sciencess where each team presented their project to the general public. This was not only an opportunity to inform the public about our project, but also to"

how to obtain funding by reaching out to various departments/student societies
Members from both of our teams also attended Western SynBio Symposium 3.0 on July 26th, 2018. After the conference, we met up and discussed ways to improve our teams. In particular, we conversed over how to:
how to lead/motivate a team, specially when experiements fail often
how to structure a team to have good leadership and team member involvement
how to obtain and maintain funding
oGEM (Ontario iGEM Meet Up)
On July 28th, 2018, we ventured to McMaster University for the annual oGEM meet up. We gathered with iGEM teams from all over Ontario, Canada. We each presented our projects, progress, and obstacles we were facing. We all provided/received feedback from one another.
One of our team members, Max Reed, who led our amyloid-related iGEM project last year talked to the McMaster iGEM team. They're doing an amyloid project this year. We discussed:
obtaining bacterial growth curves, and which medium to use for best results
amyloid protein overexpression and inclusion body formation
Public Engagement & Outreach
SynBio Postcards
We participated in Heinrich-Heine University, Duesseldorf's postcard collaboration along with several other iGEM teams from all over the world. We designed a postcard communicating our project visually. The purpose was to increase public awareness of synthetic biology and our projects. Here's our postcard:
Check out other teams' postcards !
Co-cultures video
Having collaborated with the Duesseldorf iGEM team, we learned more about their project and realized that both our projects aim to solve the same problem - but in different ways! We reached out to them and asked them to help us make a video explaining the importance of co-cultures. This video aims to engage and inform the general public on co-cultures and serve as an introduction to our projects.

Bálint, Shafi and Amy organized a Skype session with Albert, Billie, Nick and Jonathon from the Bristol team to find out more about how IDE could be useful for our project. We all agreed that it was a really smart idea, and signed up straight away. The instructions for how to use IDE were concise yet comprehensive and Jack, our computer-coding-wizard of a team mate made short work of understanding how the software operated.

We planned and enjoyed a meet-up with the high school team from Danziger High School in Israel. In the get-together, which took place at the technion in Haifa, we shared  our knowledge and experience as a high school team in the iGEM competition and held a workshop for the Danziger team about basic modeling designs and how to create mathematical models.
Here is a link to their wiki page:
Team Danzi-Kesh 8
As part of our human practice,  we organized an activity at the pre-academic center at the Technion for children in primary schools. We taught them about synthetic biology and all of us had a wonderful time. This activity we enjoyed hosting together with the Technion's collage team.

SCAU-China,2018," to be improved, such as how to remove the resistance of the plasmid after genetic transformation.
SCUT-China_A(2018)
Three heads are better than one. Fortunatly, we conducted in-depth communications with SCUT-China_A on our detailed experiments. When we were facing the difficulties of extracting the genome DNA of Gluconacetobacter xylinus ATCC 23767, SCUT-China_A helped us to improve our method and finally we succeeded. On the other hand, we also measured the yeast growth variations and activity for SCUT-China_A. The help and contributions from and to other iGEM teams are extremely helpful for us to realize the importance of communication and collaboration.
NEU_China_B(2018)
Our team conducted an exchange discussion with NEU_China_B in August 2018. This meeting is mainly to share the two team's projects main content and two teams each encountered in the experiment problem. The Q&A are as following.
NEU_China_B: How do you ensure that the integrative vector in transformants will not lose?
SCAU-China: The integrative vector we used is pFQ20 provided by the Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The homology arms in integrative vector for homologous recombination allows the target genes to be stably transferred into the genome of Microcoleus vaginatus. It has been verified through our experiment results.
SCAU-China: How to match the concentration of AI-2 expressed by the first plasmid pCFDuet-1 with the GFP concentration expressed by pet28a.
NEU_China_B: Our experiment was to release the AI-2 signal molecule after the PCFDUET-1 expression plasmid induction of lactic acid concentration, and AI-2 signal molecule can inhibit the lldr sequence on the second plasmid pet28a.
The LLDR sequence is capable of producing GFP-deterring proteins. In the experiment, we verified that two plasmid copies were more similar, and that the O1o2 sequence could be started normally when the lactic acid concentration was lower (less than 1m mol), and then the GFP gene could be produced fluorescent signal.
Therefore, the expression of two plasmids is more matched, and the experimental results are not affected in this project.
What’s more, we provided the yogurt produced by Guangdong SCAU Assets Management Co.Ltd. to NEU_China_B as their experiment materials for the LED project. They finally obtained positive results by using the"
Franconia,2017," to help and supported our idea.             What has been a workaround in the first place, turned out to be an improvement for our app and the Giant Jamboree. We had the possibility to introduce our app to the             other participants and at the conference the QR-codes will hopefully guide the attendees to the different posters.
But the QR-codes aren't the only way we want to bring the participants together. Our game ""Pathomon"" requires the direct interaction between the players, too.             To fight the so called giant outbreaks three ""scientists"" have to meet at the same place at the same time. To compare yourself with others you can have a look             at the leaderboard and see what university is the best in destroying viruses.             And if we really work together we even have the chance to eradicate all the viruses, at least at the Giant Jamboree.
German MeetUp
Dresden
We participated in the iGEM german-wide meetup from 30.06. to 02.07.2017 in Dresden    and had a great chance on getting to know nine other participating iGEM teams, their projects, people and the beautiful city of Dresden.
From 30.06. to 02.07.2017, three of our team members -- Hannah, Maximilian    and Benedikt --attended the iGEM German-wide meetup in Dresden. Overall ten teams    from Germany participated and introduced    their projects to each other while having an opportunity to find collaboration    partners and spent time together.     On Friday, we arrived in Dresden and the whole meetup started with    participating in several funny “ice breaking games”    as well as joining a local party of the TU Dresden.
The teams presented their individual talks on Saturday. This was a great    opportunity to present our project to other teams. We joined many interesting    talks about the several iGEM projects afterwards. Also, a guest talk was given    by a representative from PROMEGA. Hannah was lucky enough to win a special goody    bag for scientists.     After the talk session, we were going on a sightseeing tour with    the fantastic tour guides from the Dresden team. Getting to know the city    of Dresden was really great.
A great tortilla party at the Biological institute was organized by    the Dresden team, giving us a great time and many new connections to the other iGEM    teams. Afterwards we went playing pool billiard at local pubs with a reduced number    of members from different iGEM teams. It was great fun.
On Sunday, an interesting talk was given by Prof. Dr. Hans"

How iGEM UFSCAR-Brasil collaborated with iGEM Teams
Our Team collaborated with the national and international Times project, along with mentoring  two new Brazilian teams. We contributed online surveys of 4 teams and we think that this type of contact should be encouraged. Follow along as we share and collaborate with different teams:
Help Stockholm , Finland , iGEM_nankai and iGEM Korea_U_Seoul Teams by completing their survey forms. We also cooperate in filling the iGEM Global Cooperation, a form developed by several times, including Brasil-USP Team . The highlight was Team of Stockholm ,     which dealt with the negative results presented in Wikis, a point discussed in our weekly meetings. We Thank the three teams in question for their contact and hope that the answers have helped their respective Human Practice activities.
Aid the Stockholm and IISER iGEM Teams in the g-blocks design for the construction of the gene circuit for their project. Our idea was to contribute to and give instructions on how to design and provide the best results in their amplification experiments and construction of their gene circuits.
One of the great experiences we had as a team was the help we offered to future Brazilian teams  ( UNESP-Assis and Unifei-Itajubá ), who got to know the iGEM participation in Jamboré and 4Biotec events. To our excitement, those who are interested in setting up new teams are students inspired by projects such as Brazil-SP , represented     by members of our current staff. This shows the power iGEM presents and its growth potential in Brazil. As well as perform in-person contacts with students during the previously mentioned events, we are also assisting the assembly of teams via Skype. Below we list the main aspects that deal with competition and the challenges of creating a team in Brazil:
Set up a multidisciplinary team, organiz and present members interested in working with energy for synthetic biology
