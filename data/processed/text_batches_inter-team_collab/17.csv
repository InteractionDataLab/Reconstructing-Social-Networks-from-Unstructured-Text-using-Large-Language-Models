TUDelft,2017," 200 attendees from 9 different countries had the chance to get to know each other, engage in a debate about synthetic biology and its future prospects, and present and share their projects with all the other teams. Besides the fun experience, the presentations and synthetic biology discussions with the other teams inspired us to engage in several collaborations. We hope that the rest of the attending teams were also equally inspired to collaborate with each other!
TU Delft iGEM 2017 is happy to have collaborated with the teams of Munich , Wageningen UR , NTHU Taiwan and Hamburg as well as have contributed to the surveys of UNebraska-Lincoln , NTHU Taiwan and BU-Hardware .
NTHU Taiwan
After stumbling upon the description of our project, NTHU Taiwan initiated conversations with us via Facebook. Their project also consisted in a biosensor device, in this case featuring a series of overexpressed receptors and enzymes capable of both sensing and degrading EDC’s (Endocrine Disruptor Chemicals) on-site in sewage waters. A series of Skype meetings followed, in which the usefulness of the inclusion of any of our accomplished BioBricks into their project was discussed. Initially, vesicles and TDPs were deemed potentially interesting for NTHU Taiwan. However, after a closer study of our vesicles' BioBrick by Taiwan, they came back to us with a series of points (such as the variability in the content and size of vesicles) that made us aware of  the weaknesses of our approach for packing Cas13a and TDPs in our vesicles. Such a feedback resulted important for TU Delft iGEM 2017, as it made us aware of more aspects that should be addressed and optimised in our vesicles prior to their integration in our project.
However, the collaboration changed its direction when Taiwan reported difficulties in the transformation of their plasmids.
Figure 1: Snapgene overview of NTHU Taiwan’s construct.
TU Delft offered to revise their SnapGene files featuring their construct to discard a faulty design as the issue and shared a series of recommendations on how to make their design clearer in Snapgene and  achieve transformations with higher yields.
Finally, NTHU communicated TU Delft the accomplishment of their transformation! We wish all the best to our fellow iGEMers of NTHU Taiwan and look forward to meeting them at the Giant Jamboree!

HBUT-China,2018," of China iGEMer Community) was host in Shanghai. Our team was honored to be invited. More than 50 iGEM teams in China attend the meeting, and we had heated discussion about synthetic biology with each other. During the meeting, we demonstrated our project, from the design to the preliminary results. iGEMers from other teams put forward some constructive suggestions, and we also gained some collaborations opportunities from them. We were happy to make friends with some iGEMers and we stayed in contact with each other even after the meeting, which contributes to integrated collaboration. CCiC is really a big event for iGEMers in China. see more
3. OUC-China
In this year’s collaboration, the OUC-China team offered us a comic book about synthetic biology. The book exhibited the complex biology model and principle with funny comics, making it more easier for students to read and understand. So when we went to the Wuhan NO.20 high school classes to communicate with them, we brought the comic book with us, and hoped to bring the young students together to appreciate the fun of biological knowledge. Firstly we introduced in the form of comics, and brought them into the world of biology. We also used this comic book for attracting and recruiting new members for our next year’s competition.
During our voluntary project and introductory courses this comic book greatly assisted us to introduce synthetic biology to the public. In turn, we helped to make a detailed investigation and collect the reader’s opinions about this book, we really hope to make this comic book better to help more people appreciate the charm of synthetic biology.
4. HUBU-Wuhan
We established a close relationship with HUBU-Wuhan. It is the first time for them to participate in the iGEM competition. We have two formal meetings with HUBU, the first one on December 1, 2017, and the second one on July 13th, 2018. Besides, there are continuous communication along with the whole process of our iGEM project. In the second meeting, we went to their the conference room, listening to their weekly report. In addition, our PI, Jun Dai also gave valuable suggestions about how to improve their project. Our latest meeting was on 31th Aug, during the 5th CCiC in Shanghaitech University, we shared our latest process of the project, also appreciated each other’s posters as well.

Providing Wiki Creation Assisting Software: KELN to iGEM members
Our team has few members who can write HTML codes, making HTML tables for lab notebooks (experimentation results) a serious issue. This was the motivation for the creation of KELN, a software for easily making HTML codes for tables in lab notebook pages.
Software
KELN download
During the forums as listed above, we realized that many iGEM teams are having the same problems. Thus, we made this software open-sourced for usage by any iGEM teams. What follows are their feedback
Gifu
Positive traits: The user interface was very natural, and the time-consuming work of writing HTML codes were significantly shortened
Traits to improve: User manual was mostly about registration and protocols for Eclipse, and there were no instructions to the startup of KELN itself. Also, the table’s rows and column size were fixed, and they couldn’t be interchanged
Hokkaido-U
Positive traits: It was very easy to use.
Traits to improve: User interface: even though it was simple and easy to use, the output"

Chang Yanqi, team member of SYSU-CHINA, and Li Siqi, the former team member of SYSU-CHINA, were the mentors of team GDSYZX and GZHS-       United in this year's competition. Tao Kehan, team member of SYSU-CHINA, also provided help to GDSYZX and GZHS-United on the        construction of biological bricks.
Team GDSYZX is a high school teams of Guangdong Experimental High School, and team members of GZHS-United are from different high        schools in Guangzhou. Sun Yat-sen University and these high schools have had cooperation in students’ education for many years, some        of our team members even graduated from these high schools.
Invited by their PI professor Jin Honglei, some of our team members became student assistants in the synthetic biology course of        Guangzhou Experimental High School, instructing high school students in literature reading and experimental design. Our team members        also assisted team GDSYZX and GZHS-United in synthetic biology experimental skills training on weekends.
In addition, our team provided technical guidance and reagents for the construction of GZHS-United's biological brick BBa_K2840000        and GDSYZX's biological brick BBa_K2585000.

Another part of our collaborations included mentoring a new team from Notre Dame Collegiate high school in High River, Alberta, Canada. Though they did not participate in the iGEM competition this year, they began to work in the lab, develop project ideas, and plan to compete in future years.  We got the opportunity to travel with them to a workshop in Lethbridge, Alberta, and the aGEM (alberta iGEM) competition.  During this time we agreed to help them refine their lab and research skills. Mentoring a new team not only gives us a chance to help them learn and grow as a team, but also to solidify our own skills and share the experience we learnt through help from our own mentors of the years.
Taiwan
In early March of 2016 we were contacted by an iGEM team in Taiwan who also happened to be working on a project that involved the use of Keratinase. They requested biobricks of our parts KeratinaseA and KeratinaseUS. At the time we were nearing the end of our school year and did not yet have any functional biobricks.
The fact that a team that was so far away had reached out and asked for something we couldn’t provide made us even more determined to buckle down in the lab and in our research to create a functioning biobrick. Something we are still working on. Even though we weren’t able to give them the parts they needed we did in-fact exchange research and provide them with some research of our own to help them along with their project.  However, we did provide them with the sequences of DNA we had synthesized and are using in creating our parts, if case they were interested in also synthesizing them.
Surveys
Additionally, various members of the team were asked to participate in a variety of surveys from other teams.  Determined to boost response rates, we answered all we could find.  These included both a Virginia iGEM team and the Munich United iGEM team survey.
One survey was in regards to bio-containment. Since this season we have decided to try our hand at building a bioreactor for our bacteria, this was helpful in not only expressing our ideas to others, but solidifying our own plans.
The survey done by Munich United focused more on the business side of synthetic biology.
The questions asked were related to areas we hadn’t focused on or even considered before, from funding to founding a company.  Since our aim is to implement our construct industrially these kinds of questions are ones that we need to consider."

We attended the 88th Genetic Society of Japan and had a discussion with 4 other Japanese iGEM teams ( Gifu , Kyoto , Nagahama , and UT-tokyo ). We had a good opportunity to exchange information and to deepen our friendship. This was provided by Nagahama. It was very significant and stimulating discussing each other's project. We really appreciate the above teams, especially Nagahama , who acted to take the lead.
We answered a survey and questionnaire from METU HS Ankara and Kyoto . METU HS Ankara created protocols' database in every language. So we helped them to translate iGEM experiment protocols to Japanese. Kyoto made new software of notebook on wiki. We advised some points to be improved. We hope their plans go well.
with XMU-China
We introduced our team in the newsletter published by XMU-China this year. The newsletter is separated into two parts; “Part version” and “Team version”, composed of 5 topics; Introduction, Human Practice, Collaboration, Discussion and Survey.  Our article is included in “Team version”, and we introduced our daily activities, progress of the project, and what we have done for human practice. Including us, 41 teams from 21 countries and regions were involved in making these issues. It was not only interesting to know about other teams’ activities through these newsletters, but also it provided each team good opportunity for new collaborations.
with Heidelberg
We gained the assay protocol for circularized protein from iGEM Heidelberg team. This year we came up with an idea to utilize SAP for circularization of a protein, which is intended to gain thermostability and pH stability of enzymes. Team Heidelberg also worked on circularization project in 2014, with a different approach from ours. Therefore, it would be an interesting comparison if we use the same protocol"

iGEM Uppsala: Ethics webinar
iGEM team Uppsala organized a series of three online webinars where five iGEM teams discussed ethical topics live on YouTube. We collaborated by participating in the Online Ethics Discussion about ‘Social Responsibility‘ in relation to ethics. The following topics were discussed:
Responsible communication to the general public
Choice of target audience
Responsible choice of media to reach this target audience
We learned that although it is more profitable to show your project in a one-sided positive way, it is more important to be honest about the goal and means of your project. In this way, the end-user can develop a fairer opinion on your product and their trust in the study increases. Through consultation with experts on the technical and human aspects of your project, you can find out what matters most about your project, and adapt your communication to the problems and needs of your target audience. This results in a more effective end product.
The webinar can be watched on YouTube .

iGEM Cologne-Duesseldorf: Postcard campaign
We collaborated with iGEM Cologne-Duesseldorf in their postcard campaign. This is a worldwide campaign where iGEM teams designed their own postcards, which are then distributed by the organizing iGEM team all over the world. The ultimate goal was to promote synthetic biology to raise public awareness. We distributed the postcard both on Campus and at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). This way, both students, scientists, as well as children and their parents, got to take these interesting cards home.
Surveys
We helped other iGEM teams in improving their project by filling in surveys, covering a wide variety of fields. We filled in surveys from iGEM BIT , Munich , Sydney_Australia , Vilnius-Lithuania , Washington and Waterloo . We hoped this helped their project a step further into the right direction.

Have a look!
Collaboration is a must!
When it comes to research, it is essential to establish collaborations with other teams. In the iGEM competition, there are several ways to share, communicate and set up a network with the community.
Strategy
Our project includes two different strategies:
1st
The obtention of the genes that codify for the α and β chains of the HLA-DQ protein from a celiac patient.
View basic parts
2nd
The design of an expression system for the heterologous expression of the HLA-DQ in E. coli.
View composite parts
The first strategy implies using a DNA sample from a celiac patient. With this in mind, we considered testing the designed HLA gene extraction protocol using DNA samples of different patients.
This would demonstrate that the PCR protocol we have designed to obtain the personalized HLA-DQ of each patient could be applied to all the celiac users of the sensor.
Why?
It would help us to check whether our protocol is robust or not. In other words; if it could be used to extract the HLA-DQ genes from any celiac patient.
As explained in PCR standardization , the resulting genomic Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) between the primers designed and the HLA-DQ genes surprisingly resulted in a perfect alignment for sequences sharing CD-DQ haplotypes. This means, for primer regions, all DQ2-associated sequences match perfectly, and the same happens on DQ8. Moreover, for P2, P3, P1’ and P4’, primer region alignment is perfect, and so, there is no need to edit the standard primers.
To this aim:
The collaboration with the iGEM UPF team was essential. To make things easy, we provided them with a detailed and comprehensive PCR protocol. The 19 paged dossier includes all the information necessary to extract the genomic DNA from a patient's saliva and to set up the PCRs.
We invited them to ask for any celiac friend up to give them his/her DNA through a sample of saliva. In this context, the iGEM UPF team conducted two sets of PCRs, one using a DNA sample from a friend, and the other, using Roger's DNA as a control.
The results were promising
They successfully obtained the β chain from both, the DNA sample of their DQ2 fellow and Roger's.

In order to obtain first feedback for our DIY bioprinter kit, the iGEM Team from the TU Darmstadt agreed to become our beta-tester for the syringe pump that we had constructed for our bioprinter as well as for the whole Synbio community. Our syringe pump was proven to work well in our lab and it can be built with an investment of less than 50 USD provided an off-the-shelf 3D printer is available. For the beta test, the Darmstadt team received only the files for the 3D prints as well as all the parts (such as a stepper motor, few screws, some end-stop switches and the necessary wiring).
Here is their feedback from after they assembled our syringe pump:
""The pump is neat and stable. The idea of using buttons as end stops is, in principle, good. You took the necessary holes into account and we were able to assemble it according to the instructions. The click system for the syringe was well made and worked straightaway. The linear bearing could be used right away as well. We utilized a homemade 3D printer on highest gear for printing the parts. As you might know, this leads to relatively many ""aberrations"" and errors in the prints. They made the assembly difficult and we had to post-process several of them.
Media:Muc16_Collaboration_syringe_pump2.png
Your construction is designed quite closed, which renders it difficult for any passionate tinkerer to make adaptations after the printing. For instance, we noted that you had sent us a printed clutch though the stepper motor was not shortened and did not fit. Therefore, we drilled a hole in the front, enlarged the clutch and glued the parts together. In general, there are different stepper motors in use in the DIY community; hence, we suggest to conceptualize a more general clutch to ease this problem. Furthermore, the suspension device for the syringe could be improved, though the varying design of DIY printers makes finding a ""good"" solution rather difficult.""

BIT-China,2015,"imerization of lactic acid and RcfB. The other pathway basing on our assumption is that a proportion  of P170 can be activated directly.  Thus, the concentration of activated P170 promoter is described as:
Where km1 and km2 are integration parameters. As transcription and translation processes could enter steady state in a short period of time, here we directly considered steady state of mRNA, mRNA-rib and RFP, where
Finally, we calculated fluorescence:
The equation demonstrated the connection between fluorescence and lactic acid, thus, the concentration of lactic acid could be measured by fluorescence through the system. We set km1=10 and use promoter J23100, then results showed how these different substances changed with the lactic acid concentration. (Fig. 9)
Fig.9 Concentration of P170, mRNA, mRNA-rib and fluorescence change with the lactic acid.
Fine tuning:
As RcfB plays a key role in induction of P170 promoter, we firstly conducted constitutive promoter fine-tuning. Different constitutive promoters were constructed with downstream RcfB. We built up models to compare the function of these promoters (Fig.10). Results showed that J23100 had the highest effectiveness.

Basic circuits contain two subsystems: resistance subsystem and regulation subsystem. Models of these two subsystems were constructed separately.
Main processes include induction of the promoters, transcription and translation of function genes, catalysis of enzymes and acid or alkali production led by enzymes. ODE is used for modeling to describe concentration as function of time. Factors considered are production and degradation, combination and disaggregation and reversible reaction.
Resistance subsystem consists of constitutive promoter J23119, function genes glsA, NhaA and NhaB. J23119 is not influenced by environmental pH, and will lead enzymes production continuously.

On September 16th, we are invited to Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance Establishing Conference & Meet-up by UCAS-China . We presented our projects and discussed the current and future collaboration between member teams of this brand new Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance. In addition, we communicated with teachers from the Institute of Biophysics. After, each team presented a small souvenir as the symbol of their team, put it into the collection case UCAS-China prepared for this conference.
We hope the league would promote communication and cooperation between us.
With OUC
We help they characterize the effectiveness of their first system, miniToe, proving that their system has the same trend under other experimental conditions. As the figure shows, the orange line refers to the system which is induced while the blue line is the control group, The big difference in expression level between two line indicate that the system is working well as a switch.
Figure.1 Their minToe system worked well in our lab.
With XMU
With the same interest in KaiABC oscillator, we kept close contact with XMU at the very beginning. Apart from communication in design and modeling, we had shared our plasmids that respectively carried RpaA, SasA and CikA with them as soon as we heard their problem.
With TJU-China
We were glad to help them prepare the part backbone, pSB1C3 since they had too many biobricks to submit and the vector always run out.
They generously helped us measure the degradation of the origin with improved NanoLuc in 3 hours, proved our improved part could work effectively in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741.
Figure.2 The part they characterized for us.
With HUST-China
We were glad to help HUST-China contact with experts they required. In the course of project researching, they read a paper from Tianjin University and sought assistance from us. Our teacher answered their questions about the paper and made some new suggestions. In late August, their team's student, Cheng Long, came to communicate with their iGEMers in 2015 about their project which was focus on Shewanella as well. Moreover"
XMU-China,2017," They gave us positive solution feedbacks based on their T7 system design. Finally, FAFU and we established collaboration that they helped us test the formaldehyde promoter and T7 amplification system.
ShanghaiTech University
We have not had much experience in modeling before, while Shanghai Tech University iGEMers kindly provided us with useful advice and provided some relevant documents. Furthermore, we reached a consensus on improving our models with each other. We sincerely appreciate their help.
HFUT-China
We collaborated with iGEMers from HFUT-China to test their software, BiodDesigner Dolphin, including searching function and other design functions. We are interested in their cited reference searching function.

Collaborations with Team:USTC-Software
In this year, our IGEM team is in the need of a method to caculate the intensity of the green fluorescence produced by our device quantitatively. As it is convenient to communicate with the team in the same university as us, we consulted from USTC Software Team and applied their method to our data.
They provided us the code in Matlab and also explanation. We acquire the value of the intesity of green fluorescence in several steps: first, we reverse the contour figure, then, after we select only the bright part of the figure, we are able to caculate the average brightness of the illuinating area.
Figure 1. The Original Photo
Figure 2. Reverse the contour figure
Figure 3. Select only bright part of the figure and omit other parts
They helped us to convert the colours into the values that can compare with one another. We figured out ""The concentration of GFP - The temperature of heat shock standard curve"", so that we can predict the intensity of green fluorescence after giving a heat shock at a specific temperature for a period of time. Our    caculated results are consistent with the observed results well. Thanks to the USTC Software Team, we gained the satisfying results and came to the final conclusion we expected.

UESTC-China,2018,", they would like to obtain xylose produced via biological method. So they can integrate their system at the downstream of our system.
Through our collaboration, we can not only produce bioenergy, but have another powerful application in CO2 emission problem. NCKU-Tainan also provided us a valuable application way and helped us design a draft of device. Meanwhile, the xylose source from straw was really important to their E. coli CO2 utilization system which changed the positive carbon footprint into negative carbon footprint. This collaboration solved both the energy problem and environment problem. Click here to see them: https://2018.igem.org/Team:NCKU_Tainan/Collaborations
Click here to see details!
Through UESTC system, xylose will be produced in their fermentation broth as well as other three raw material. In order to calculate the amount of xylose production, we tested the ferulic acid which yield by gas chromatography (GC) after 12 hours. Basically, ferulic acid cover for 1.15% of straw. Then, the enzyme activity of ferulic acid degradation can be calculated. Next, they assume that the rate of xylan decomposition is the same as that of ferulic acid while 30% of xylan composed of straw. Finally, through derivation, we can get 0.0348 kg xylose from 1 kg straw. The detail progress of calculation was listed below.
Sample: 20ml, positive control and 0.3g corn straw was added, Abs600 was not certain because we had added straw.
-Ferulic acid by GC: 0.53 mg / L
-Ferulic acid in straw: 0.3g * 1.15% = 0.345 mg
-Ferulic acid degradation rate: (0.53 * 20*10^-3)/0.345 = 10.6%
-Xylose in 1kg straw: 1kg * 30% * 10.6% = 0.0348 kg
With NCKU system, E. coli consumed xylose to uptake CO2.
The xylose consumption was 23.864 kg to uptake 1kg of CO2. In conclusion, every 685 kg straw can be used to capture 1 kg CO2. In other words, capturing 1% annual CO2 emission of Small and medium enterprise, which is 20 tons CO2 require 16 tons straw.

University of Texas at Austin
With UT Austin iGEM, we worked closely seeing as our teams shared common goals focusing on the field of foundational advancement. This lead to a collaboration based on an exchange of ideas as well as constructs between our teams. In our collaboration, we organized various team Skype conferences, created a collaborative GroupMe, and met in person to exchange parts and ideas. We received promoter-containing constructs from the UT Austin iGEM team, which we then transformed, plated, and miniprepped. By testing these origins from their kit, we were able to provide an extra layer of scrutiny over the parts in their project.

Thessaloniki
With Thessaloniki iGEM, we participated in their interlab collaboration by providing calibration data and negative control measurement data following their fluorescent measurement protocol. The data generated assisted Thessaloniki in determining whether they have achieved plasmid copy number-independent expression of GFP, one of the main goals of their project.
LASA
With LASA iGEM, we helped their team develop ideas to improve the modeling portion of their project. Due to their limited resources and experience as a high school team, we hoped the LASA team could further their modeling skills, not only for this project, but also for projects in the future.
Cornell University
With Cornell iGEM, we aided one another through an exchange of ideas and feedback as we both worked toward a foundational advance. Although we were not able to meet in person, we maintained steady communication through email and conference calls. We received an education outreach learning kit from the Cornell team; we tested it by introducing synthetic biology to the general public using their kit. After these sessions we received feedback from the participants and forwarded it to Cornell, with additional comments from our team.

What we did for others
During the summer, we collaborated with other teams.
- The first exchange was with the UI_Indonesian Team. We sent to them our survey and they went to Indonesian streets to ask people about chewing gum and synthetic biology. We also did their survey. Ho a wild wiki appear!!!
- Our team participated to the “Meetup France”. In addition to our team, five IGEM teams went to Bordeaux: Paris Saclay, Paris Pasteur, Toulouse, EPFL from Switzerland and KU Leuven from Belgium. This meetup was organized by the team of Bordeaux. Catch them here!!
We participated at several activities:
A discussion about biosafety organized by the iGEM team from Paris Saclay. They suggested us to expose our biosafety methods.
A debate concerning plastic pollution organized by the iGEM team from Paris Pasteur.
- We initiated collaboration with a team from Brasil: the Brasil-USP. They worked on a similar project: the degradation of tyre (made of latex). We planned to exchange with them. In details, we wanted to test their enzyme on our polymers, which are their raw materials, and they did our enzymatic modelling. Unfortunately both teams had problems with enzyme purification. So bad luck, our collaboration did not work! There is a little wiki hiding right here!
- We also participated to the newsletter done by the Amoy iGEM team from China Here are our Chinese friends!
Here a group picture of the France meetup
What others did for us
We've set up a survey competition between all IGEM teams. According to the number of completed surveys, we've awarded medals:
- between 5 to 15 surveys, a bronze medal
- between 15 to 30 surveys, a silver medal
- more than 30 surveys, a gold medal!

Summary
The friendship between University of Science and Technology Beijing(USTB) and Tsinghua University began from the middle of last century. In 1952, Beijing iron and Steel Industry School (The predecessor of USTB) was found. It was under the support of the teachers and students in Tsinghua University that our academes could be able to set up and perfect gradually developed. Because of the deep friendship between two universities, we contacted the IGEM team of TSINGHUA University, Tsinghua-A. Thanks to the help of the members of Tsinghua-A for helping us solve some problem through our communication and learning with each other.
Project communication
We hoped to visit the laboratory TSINGHUA University, so being the host, they introduced their IGEM project to us firstly. Most members in their team are majored in automation, so we were not familiar with the Professional NOUNs like ‘noise reduction processing’ and information theory. But through a brief description, we could be able to get the point that they were interested in the problem of noise in the process of signal transmission, they hoping to methods of mathematical modeling to display how noise can have impacts on the process of signal transmission.
Considering most members in their team are not majored in biology, we used some simple words to explain our idea rather than biological professional nouns. We mainly introduced characteristics and application of traditional Chinese medicine, notoginseng. The idea that we use notoginseng as culture medium directly for fermenting E.coli caught their attention. Then we focused on explaining the process of our double plasmid system experiments, and talking about that the phenomena were contrary to our expectation. Their assistant were interested  in our experiments. He discussed about the feasibility of some experiments.

Modelling with SVCE
UK Meet-up
In August we co-hosted the annual UK iGEM meetup together with the University of Westminster and the University of Warwick . Meetups are the closest iGEM teams get to a Jamboree experience before November. With poster/ powerpoint presentations, interactive debates and lectures on current topics by SynBio experts, meetups are the perfect opportunity to hear about other iGEM teams’ projects and to form collaborations on similar topics.
Collaborating with  two other universities allowed us to span the meetup over days, giving the members of different teams more time to share iGEM experiences. We spent quite a bit of time setting up a schedule offering a variety of activities at various locations across London (University of Westminster Cavendish Campus; UCL main campus and Warwick Business School in the Shard).
Modelling with SVCE
Throughout the summer we had a bilateral collaboration with the iGEM SVCE 2017 team from India. Our collaboration started off with us sending each other useful sources and tutorials on how to approach modelling for cellular mechanisms, as neither team considered themselves an expert in the field. Once we both started forming the differential equations for our respective models, we sent each other documents with a summary of our ODEs and provided feedback to each other. SVCE helped us getting started with our LEGIT model . Both teams provided constructive feedback on how to present complex information in a simple manner to make it easy to understand for non-modellers, while at the same time we helped refine each other’s differential equations."

Chalmers team reached out to our team over Twitter and graciously offered to help build up our team’s past project database. Over the summer their team ended up adding in over 20 entries from the 2015 competition year, summarizing teams’ projects, tracks, numbers of team members, chassis used, research benchmarks, submitted parts and part links and descriptions, medal statuses, and any nominations and awards.
University of Exeter, UK
The Exeter team this year focused on characterizing the efficiency, fidelity, and robustness of common biobrick kill switches to address concerns surrounding the use of kill switches as bio-safety devices. As a side-project, our team sought to create an easily-searchable past-projects database. After several timezone-targeted Skype sessions, Twitter exchanges, and protocol discussions our teams fostered a collaboration to further both of these aims. Purdue would test the reliability our 2015 team’s previously uncharacterized kill switch, and Exeter would help log entries for our 2016 team’s past project database.
To that end, after following Exeter’s protocol for continuous culture with the anaerobically-triggered kill switch BBa_K9188020 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we tested for the kill switch’s fidelity by growing up liquid cultures in anaerobic conditions and measuring optical density at 0, 1, 5, and 24 hours. Across the pond Exeter’s team worked to enter almost 50 iGEM projects into our past project database.

University of Toronto Modeling Collaboration
The British_Columbia team collaborated with the University of Toronto iGEM team to test the CRISPR guide model our team developed. The University of Toronto desired to choose guides to target the AraC gene with CRISPR/dCas9 (catalytically inactive Cas9) in E.coli K12 MG1655 genome. Model execution determined their original guides sequences, AAACGAGTATCCCGGCAGCA and AACGAGTATCCCGGCAGCAG had a relatively low partition functions of 47.276 and 35.326 respectively, indicating that there would be many off target CRISPR/dCas9 matches on the genome. We provided their team the full list of guides sequences available for the AraC, ranked based on the partition function, and specified two guides that would be good choices for their project. Due to the use of CRISPR/dCas9, guides targeting near the beginning of the gene are desirable. The guides our model suggested were: TGGGCGTTAAACGAGTATCC, appearing on the bottom strand (with a PAM site at the 33rd nucleotide from the start), which has a partition function of 75.957; and TTAACGCCGATTGAGGCCAA appearing on the top strand (with a PAM site at the 86th nucleotide from the start), and has a partition function of 72.671. These guides should provide a more precise target for CRISPR/dCas9 while retaining the desired function of dCas9.
University of Calgary Newsletter Collaboration
This year, the University of Calgary’s iGEM team founded the first ever Canadian iGEM newsletter. Nine universities and two high schools from all across Canada became a part of this inaugural project, which shared the progress, challenges, and successes of the 2017 iGEM competition. The newsletter provides the opportunity to reach out for collaboration from fellow Canadian teams, and it led to our modelling collaboration with the University of Toronto. The Canadian iGEM Newsletter exemplifies iGEM’s promotion of inter-team and multidisciplinary collaboration, and we are honoured to have been a part of it.

Tübingen
Back in April, after receiving the designation kit from the iGEM HQ, we found out that we would need a couple of plasmids which have not been available at the iGEM HQ. So we contacted the Tübinger iGEM members from 2015 for a collaboration after exploring that they had what we needed.
This collaboration was about giving us 5 different yeast shuttle-vectors (pTum100, pTum104, pRS314, pRS315, pRS316), which were either used or produced by iGEM Tübingen 2015. We used these plasmids to test our construct consisting of the blue light switch and the red light switch in yeast.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to test our whole construct in yeast cells, but a part of the red lightswitch Bba_K1936002 .
Without these plasmids we would have had to produce the shuttle vectors ourselves, but luckily they still had glycerol stocks from last year and were so kind to share these with us.
European experience in Paris
On July the 2nd to July the 3rd 2016 we attended the European Experience iGEM meetup in Paris. Together with 29 other teams we listened to lectures of iGEM founder Randy Rettberg and other renowned scientists.
Randy Rettberg’s lecture was especially inspiring. He told us why iGEM was founded in the first place and what vision he had for the future. Every attending iGEM team had their own information stand and the opportunity to explain their projects to all other teams.
We learned new lab techniques and discussed problems and solutions of our and their projects. This was very helpful for making connections to other teams working in similar fields of synthetic biology as we do.
This initiated collaborations with other teams using optogenetics. We also got to know Victor Plet from iGEM-Team Ionis, who visited us for a few days in Germany too.
Our team had a lot of fun at parties and activities organized by the iGEM Teams from Paris.
Marburg Meetup
The first big iGEM meetup took place in Marburg on the fifth till seventh of august. All German and a Danish team were represented.
We arrived on early Friday afternoon at the campsite in Marburg where we stayed over the weekend. We were welcomed warmly by the local iGEM team and built up our tent"

Mike the Microbe
For human practices, in order to accomplish connections with other teams, we are using our own version of ""Flat Stanley"". Flat Stanley is a book written by Jeff Brown, where you connect with other people (teams) by sending out a paper ""Flat Stanley"" (microbe) across the world by mail (email). The team created our own version of ""Flat Stanley"", whom we named ""Mike the Microbe."" We sent Mike the Microbe to teams all across the globe in hopes that they would take a picture with Mike in their workspace or team meeting. We were overjoyed to receive many pictures with other teams on social media from across the world. Our goal to share information about our project was achieved, with the other teams really enjoying the opportunity to interact with us over social media about ETEC! We hope to meet these teams at the Jamboree to extend our thanks. Teams who participated: Grongingen, Hamburg,  KU Leuven, XMU-China, and KU Leuven!

Northwestern
One of the first teams we reached out to was Northwestern. We exchanged project information and provided each other with initial feedback. This acted as our first step toward collaboration with other teams!
Imperial London
For our team, the wiki has proved the most challenging aspect of the required iGEM components due to our lack of coding experience. Fortunately for us, London's Imperial Team came to the rescue! The Brits guided us on various wiki components and even offered their old website code for us to dissect and examine in order to implement on our website. We're extremely grateful and hope to meet them in Boston to express our thanks!
City of London School of Boys (CLSB)
CLSB was also very beneficial in wiki help. They assisted us with questions we had when coding the wiki and helped us troubleshoot some of our problems. We also helped to edit their iGEM High School Guide by providing suggestions for revision and other feedback.

iGEM offers the opportunity to hang around with teams from all over the world, get to know their cultures, share experiences, and, above all, work shoulder to shoulder towards the development of synthetic biology. During our time at iGEM, we seized this opportunity. From discussing our projects to characterizing a promoter, iGEM Tec-Chihuahua joined forces with our fellow iGEMers to build a tighter community through collaborations.
Characterization of Tec Monterrey’s inducible promoter
This year, team Tec-Monterrey is working in the development of a system that can store data in vivo of different stimuli by changing the promoter. In an effort to contribute to the achievement of their goals, team Tec-Chihuahua characterized the PyeaR promoter (Part BBa_K381001: PyeaR-GFP composite) by proving its sensitivity to different concentrations of nitrates.
The collaboration developed as follows: On April 14th we established the first contact through a video call in which we shared our projects, troubleshot some of our problems, and shared some advice regarding raise funding and collaborations. On May 28th, we defined the objective of the collaboration.  On June 10th team Tec-Monterrey sent us the protocols to follow. Finally, from June 14th to June 25th, we performed the required protocols to get the results. We are happy to mention that during the development of this characterization, we had the opportunity to know and work with one of the members of team Tec-Monterrey in our lab.
The complete protocol followed during the characterization, including the results, can be seen below.

The WORST gel electrophoresis
As all the teams are working on synthetic biology, gel electrophoresis is necessary for every team member because it         is an important way to judge whether the result is good enough. When our team was searching for collaborations, we         found the “Worst Gel Electrophresis Scrapbook” hosted by team UNebraska-Lincoln. It is an activity that collects         the worst gel electrophoresis images and make them a scrapbook. We also want to compete for the first winner(of course         we want the badge). Here are the images we picked:
Figure 1.This is a picture for plasmid extraction on August 18th. I had successfully transformed standardized         plasmids into Escherichia coli cells but the culture media was polluted by yeasts. So as you can see, there’s almost         no plasmid DNA in this piece of agarose gel. The only two bright strips are not the right size.
Figure 2.Always feel that the system of 50ul cut 1ug plasmids and then recover a lot of gel is very troublesome.         One day, I determined to do a big move, so I added 3ug plasmid to a system, I thought enzymes may not be enough,         and I believe more enzyme will contribute to more completely cut, so I added the enzyme of 4μl. Expectant preparation,         see a blurred strip only to know that the original enzyme overuse will lead to star reaction.
Figure 3.We want to connect two DNA fragments together by overlapping. When we completed all the procedures,         had one of our DNA gel electrophoresis run, when we irradiated our nucleic acid gel with ultraviolet rays, we unfortunately         found that our The strips are arranged evenly in the arithmetic progression, which really makes me laugh and makes         me sad.
Neighbor is the best
Firstly, there are two teams in Tianjin University, TJU_China and Tianjin. For the world wide competition, it is incredible         that two teams are in the same university. So, how can we miss the opportunity of collaborating with each other?!

As a community, cooperation and collaboration are inevitable in order to achieve better results. ITB_Indonesia took this chance to broaden our network and scope of works by collaborating with the following universities and institution.
Oxford
On the June, 13th, our team contacted Henry, member of the Oxford iGEM team. We had a brief  discussion and shared our project each other through skype video call. As the result, we agreed to exchange questionnaire as a form of human practice collaboration. The Oxford team questionnaires were distributed by ITB_Indonesia team at the Seminar and Meetup event on June, 27th. This was a great opportunity to distribute the questionnaire since the audiences came from many universities and backgrounds. The results of the questionnaire were summarized and sent to the Oxford team. On the other occassion, the Oxford team also distributed ITB team questionnaire and gave us the results. Oxford .
Universitas Indonesia and Universitas Brawijaya
On June, 27th, ITB_Indonesia hosted the first meetup where all of the Indonesia iGEM teams gathered together. We collaborated with UI_Indonesia and UB_Indonesia to conduct a seminar about synthetic biology and shared each of our team project to the public. Through this seminar, we promoted synthetic biology and iGEM to the audiences. We were very happy because we had a chance to have a skype video call with one of the iGEM HQ representative, Ana Sifuentes.

2nd Annual Mid-Atlantic Mini-Jamboree
July 22nd, 2016
In the summer of 2015, UMaryland iGEM founded the first Mid-Atlantic Meet-up and hosted four teams: UVA, William and Mary, Duke, and Rock Ridge High School. Each team gave a 25 minute presentation of their project followed by a Q&A with the audience. We were also fortunate enough to have Special Agent Edward You of the FBI and UMD Professor Raymond St. Leger as guest speakers.
This summer, we included more iGEM teams in the Mid Atlantic Area by hosting the University of Pittsburgh, the US Naval Academy, the College of Willam and Mary, and University of Virginia iGEM Teams. We shared ideas and received feedback about ours projects during our discussion session. We were joined by guest speakers Dr. Eli Groban and Dr. Ganesh Sriram with opening remarks by Dr. Edward Eisenstein, an iGEM judge, who spoke about the overall iGEM experience, what it takes to make an iGEM team successful and the importance of human practices. Closing remarks were made by Ana Sifuentes from iGEM headquarters.
The presentation portion allowed teams to practice their project explanations before the Giant Jamboree. We also included a long discussion section after presentations so teams could get feedback from each other and from faculty advisors. We set aside time for the University of Virginia team to survey the four other teams for their biocontainment outreach and to gather feedback about their material on biocontainment. Furthermore, William and Mary was able to gather more participants for their Pen Pal program

Korea_U_Seoul had collaborated with ‘ KoreaSonyeodul team from Hankuk Foreign Language High School. ‘KoreaSonyeodul’ is a team made up with 7 high school girls, and this year is their first time participating iGEM. We, Korea_U_Seoul team has participated iGEM since 2009, therefore our persistent experience on iGEM and synthetic biology-related activities could help them starting things up, through this collaboration.
The collaboration was mainly proceeded in two categories: mentoring new high school team , and experimental exchanges .
1. Mentoring a new high school team
After several contacts via e-mail, we could finally have a chance to meet KoreaSonyeodul. The first meet up was held in June, at Korea University. Since Korea_U_Seoul and KoreaSonyeodul are the only Korean team this year, it was in fact a quite meaningful session that all the Korean participants were gathering.
First part of the meet up was about introducing our own project. Korea_U_Seoul prepared a brief speech on who we are, what we have done in last 7 years with iGEM, and our plans for this year’s project.
Next was KoreaSonyeodul. They proposed what they had in mind, and it was a brilliant idea so we actively participated with bunch of questions and answers coming and going.
Besides contents of the project itself, collaboration session was meaningful enough in the means of giving a real help to difficulties most of iGEM newbies are facing.
We went through the realistic preparations on iGEM jamboree participation, such as registration, transportations and accommodation reservations together with advices of former participants from our team. Also, we together checked the important schedules with essential requirements such as team/personal registration, wiki freeze and part submission. Especially, since experiment schedules often require a long time with many variables occurring in real time, we could give advices on planning the overall project to KoreaSonyeodul which didn’t have much lab experiences before.
More than filling the requirements and essential preparations, we could deeply communicate about difficulties in running such a"

NUS 2017 - Modelling our biocontainment system
We came into contact with NUS 2017 as our biocontainment strategies shared many similarities and we thought it would be interesting to cooperate and achieve more together. We offered them the mini Tn7 kit , previously received by iGEM HQ and the pTNS2 plasmid, necessary for the genome integration of their biobricks. They confirmed to have received the plasmids and successfully integrated biobricks into the genome of their bacteria. NUS 2017 offered us their expertise in modelling and they simulated our biocontainment system. Our collaboration was of great help to us as NUS were able to pinpoint a few undesired responses and limitations of our design. To read more about our modelling, please click here .

CCiC
Conference of Central China iGEM Consortium
From September 2nd to 4th, Conference of Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) was held in SYSU, Guangzhou. Four members of our team attended the conference. Our instructor, Zhang Haoqian gave the keynote speech to 26 iGEM teams from different cities of China at the opening ceremony of CCiC. With the help of this platform for Chinese iGEM teams to communicate, all the teams got numerous feedbacks from others, including suggestions on the of experiments, heated discussions on circuit design, and reflections on safety and application. Peking performed well during the presentation and poster section and provided many useful suggestions for other iGEM teams during communication. Also, we recognized the limitations and inadequacy of our project which motivated us to make more effort.

In August, we invited three other iGEM teams to attend the meetup in the School of Life Sciences of Peking University, where we met and exchanged ideas with members from Tianjin, BIT-China and UCAS. We introduced our projects and built up mutual facilitation among teams. As one of the first teams in China to attend iGEM, Peking take the responsibility for guiding and helping other first-time contestants, such as UCAS. Additionally, we suggested the members of Tianjin use Golden Gate Assembly methods considering their low efficiency of assembling.

Edinburgh_UG,2018,"itor strain has now been transformed with all the parts necessary for operation of our DNA degrading switch. Maxicell induction will activate the kill switch due to expression of homing endonuclease I-SceI linearizing pImm. To perform DL2524 maxicell induction:
• Measure OD600 of overnight culture.
• Dilute culture at 0.025 OD600 in LB with 0.2 % glucose.
• Grow for 80 minutes at 37 °C.
• Dilute culture 10 times with 0.5% arabinose and LB.
• Incubate at 37 °C shaking gently.
3.6 Validation
In order to observe the DNA degradation as a result of our switches activation we propose to run gel electrophoresis periodically over the 24hours after maxicell induction. We would expect to see a number of small DNA fragments from the maxicells degraded chromosome and bands corresponding to our 2 constructs pImm and pCol. After degradation switch activation we would expect to observe the bands corresponding to our plasmid constructs dissapear as Colicin E2 degrades maxicell DNA. Due to our need to visualise potentially very small DNA fragments we propose to use SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain or some similar high sensitivity strain.
Meetups
iGEM teams meetups was some of the most useful collaborations we had. Constructive critique we got during meetups and new ideas ideas we heard from meetups attendees and organisers had a huge impact on our project.
Scottish iGEM Meetup
As our first meetup we attended Scottish iGEM Meetup which was held at The University of St Andrews and hosted by St Andrews iGEM 2018 team at 3rd of July. Hence, all three Scottish teams participated (St Andrews, Edinburgh_OG and us). We first presented our projects, had a discussion about them and as well we had some talks on useful topics as human practices, collaborations, etc. We were delighted to talk with Will Wright, Europen Ambassador of iGEM  community.
iGEM UK Meetup
We attended iGEM meetup UK which was organised by SynBioUK and hosted by University of Oxford iGEM team at 12th-13th July 2018. It was an amazing experience to meet almost all UK teams and talk with our collegues from the same field about projects, and getting very valuable feedback. Moreover, it was one of the first experience to present our project as well. We attended a number of workshops and talks of speakers,"
Consort_Alberta,2015,"actor is not connected to the main water line and is completely contained, contamination of water with E. coli would not be an issue. The proposed prototype also utilizes the current system and technologies used making it as easy as possible for implementation. Canmore has done an excellent job in looking at the practical portions of their project and with more research their project could do a lot of good in our world. (-Sam Davies)
Consort:
This year the iGem team from Consort is continuing with their ECOS project, bacteria designed to detect the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons in order to prevent any harm to the environment. Consort’s ongoing project is a great concept for many reasons. Firstly it is something that is a local problem in their community and especially hits home for some of the team members, which means that they devote themselves fully to the project. Secondly because the outcome of this project could be very helpful for surrounding communities and possibly could hold some wealth in it. Finally because this project could help save countless amounts of crops and livestock from what is a major threat to them.
The science behind the project is very intriguing as well. The indicator protein is atoned to xylene, which is a very volatile liquid hydrocarbon, which in itself is a good thing to find and remove but it is tied to other dangerous compounds. When these compounds are detected the proteins emit a color indication that would alert the user to the presence of said dangerous compounds. Whilst this all seems simple the biobrick is not, and they have spent years developing this to perfection to start with their prototypes.
The prototype and models of prototypes look to be a very effective method of using ECOS. I was able to see one of the prototypes and it looked good even though I was unable to see it in action, this shows great promise for the team in their upcoming endeavors. I can see much success in the future if this team especially if they have a working prototype at the giant Jamboree, I personally wish them the best (-Joshua Lamb)"

Judd High School
This year, three members of our team: Laulwa Al Salloum, Laurens Heling and Dan Brunkow, were able to work alongside Team Judd_UK in the InterLab study. They were able to use our lab and equipment to obtain the necessary readings for their InterLab while we mentored two of their members; Nikita Shukan and Mateo Hoare through the process, as well as aiding them in their managing of the different aspects of the study, such as: using the Gilson pipettes, using the plate reader, incubating the samples, etc. In return, they generously donated their InterLab DNA from Distribution kit plate 6 for us to transform as we were unsuccessful in transforming the DNA from our own kit into the E.coli DH5 alpha cells.
Being able to work alongside another iGEM team was incredibly useful in viewing the study from a different point of view as Judd_UK were experiencing all the lab work for the first time as they are a High School team. Being able to mentor them allowed us to work through the study step by step until it became second nature to perform all the readings.

Opentrons
Opentrons gave us a unit of their OT-2 pipetting robot to help us automate lab protocols and help them gather feedback for future releases. For all intents and purposes, we had a direct line into Opentrons to voice our opinions on their hardware and software solutions, as well as to troubleshoot any potential technical problems we’d encounter. Our relationship proved invaluable in the beginning of our time with the robot - we ended up on a Skype call with an Opentrons representative to help diagnose a protocol-breaking issue we were having with the robot. Additionally, we joined an exclusive Opentrons forum dedicated to feedback between other iGEM teams with Opentrons products - even making a few technical posts. On top of it all, we automated part of an Interlab protocol using the OT-2 robot and open-sourced every protocol we wrote to GitHub.

Cyanobacteria Protocol Exchange with NU Kazakhstan iGEM
We had a brief Skype call with NU Kazakhstan discussing our projects as we were both working with S. elongatus . Unfortunately, there was poor signal and other technical difficulties during the call, so it was difficult to hear one another. Nonetheless, we had an email thread and were able to exchange information on culturing and transforming conditions, recommended working antibiotic concentrations, and light intensity. However, we weren’t at the point of transforming yet. NU Kazakhstan offered advice on how to manage temperature in our incubator, which helped tremendously in fixing the issue.

Helping UChicago iGEM with Transformation
We had an email discussion with the UChicago GeneHackers Team, who worked with a cyanobacterial species very closely related to ours, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 . After learning about issues they had in transforming the DH5alpha cells for InterLab (specifically they were unable to gain colonies), we offered advice by giving them pointers originating from iGEM's single tube transformation protocol, namely to spin down the transformed cells, remove some of the supernatant, and then resuspend them. They were successful in this endeavor and passed these tips to Northwestern iGEM as well.

I will definitely arrive at the lab before 9 tomorcolumn! (Never)
Ruiling is a junior majoring in biology at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Devoted to iGEM for two years, she has got lots of training from lab work to project design. Besides, she really treasures the precious and memorable experience of working with all her teammates and instructors. About them, the future is still very long. To be short, she is the leader of the team this year.
“Deadline gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall have no breakfast, play no games, watch no films. I shall wear no ccolumnns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the alarm of the clock. I am the watcher for the schedule. I am the fire that burns against the laziness, the light that brings the energy, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the team of UCAS. I pledge my life and honor to the Deadline’s Watch, for this ddl and all the ddls to come.”
Apart from iGEM she is also a singer and a geek design aficionado. To her, the beat and melody have the magic power"

Collaborations
We believe that collaboration leads to development of the innovation and its full acceptance and use. Therefore, we collaborated with two other iGEM teams: TU Delft and Groningen . During this process, we learned a lot about their projects and helped each other out with experiments and ideas. The beauty of this is that we got some valuable input from both teams. Here you will find more details of these two collaborations!
Delft
The team of TU Delft has been working on the creation of a biolaser in the form of a a biosilica-covered cell expressing fluorescent proteins. The biosilica-layer traps some of the photons sent out by fluorescent proteins that can be used to excite other fluorescent proteins. This leads to increased overall fluorescence intensity in the cells. We measured some of their strains in our plate reader.
During our own project we have worked with the microplate reader extensively. We tested eight different constructs in a"

Collaborations
We were very happy to know people and collaborate with teams from all over the world this year! We collaborated with teams from Europe, Asia and America that helped us with modeling, research about laws and engineered probiotics and, of course, contributed to making a happy and fun iGEM season!
Modeling with ETH Zurich
This was the first time our team has ever tried to create a gene circuit’s mathematical modeling and simulate it with MATLAB. That means that we had to start from the very beginning, learning from genetic circuit modeling basics to MATLAB coding with no previous experience at all! After learning the basics of coding and creating our model, we still had many questions about it, and that’s when ETH Zurich Team arrived!
In our first Skype meeting, we talked about our genetic circuit modeling and simulation but also about our projects. After the meeting, the Zurich team reviewed our model and MATLAB code, sending us an useful material about stochastic modeling (that will help future attempts on modeling our circuit or future projects), a simpler and more elegant version of our coding (making it easier to edit), helpful modeling tips, with interesting advice on which parameter we should look at in order to best describe our circuit. In our last Skype meeting, we discussed last changes in the model.
This collaboration was incredibly helpful for building our model and simulation, and to discuss our results. Thanks a lot, ETH Zurich!
TecCEM
iGEM TecCEM had the amazing idea of creating a parody of “Girls Like You” and “Moves Like Jagger” by Maroon 5 called “Labs Like You” and “Moves Like iGEM”, which we agreed to participate for sure! Besides, we also got in touch to talk about our projects and did some research for each other. TecCEM’s project is about healing burns with biological materials, so we look into researches, data about burns and available treatments in Brazil and sent them. In exchange, they looked for data about engineered probiotics and regulation in Mexico.
Check the music video “Labs Like You” and “Moves Like iGEM”:
Engineered Probiotics Around the World
Our goal with this collaboration was to understand about the GMO legislation around the world and if there already is any regulations about engineered probiotics and if there are clinical trials or companies using engineered probiotics in these countries. This work was done"
St_Andrews,2018," modelling etc.). It was great to meet the Edinburgh students that we had been in contact with via email and hear their advice on how best to approach the medal requirements. They also informed us of mistakes that they have learned from in the past, such as the importance of accurately labelling DNA submissions for shipment. Each of the three iGEM teams (Edi UG, OG and St Andrews) gave 20 minute presentations on their projects. This included the progress so far in the wet lab and modelling, as well as future aims for the summer and areas still in consideration. Each presentation was followed by about half an hour of questioning from the audience, which helped the teams consider improvements and missing aspects of their current projects. In addition to these presentations, supervisors of each team gave talks on their specialties. For example, there was a large focus on the importance of integrated human practices, and how we could change an aspect of our project in response to meetings with stakeholders. We were also lucky enough to hear Will Wright, an after iGEM ambassador, speak about the giant jamboree, and how this is an exciting opportunity to present our projects and connect with like-minded people. The strong benefits of taking part in the iGEM competition were highlighted and we were encouraged to enjoy the experience.  Overall, we were extremely lucky to be able to reach out to a more experienced team who helped us better understand the requirements of iGEM and to make improvements on our project that we otherwise would not have considered."
USTC,2016," between the Kmlac and the Proportion of terminators turned off.
Figure 3：The relationship between Kmlac and the proportion of terminator turned off
To show aintuitionistic relationship between the the regulateability of Lac and Bxb1, we gave out a a holistic view of relationship of [GFP] and Kmlac.
Figure 4：The Relationship between Kmlac and kt and The Final Concentration of GFP
Asymmetric Conditions
We build the regulating circuits of FimE in the same way, but it is a pity that it is hardly to find any references about the parameters of the chemical kinetics constant of FimE, so we just assumed that 𝑘𝑇2=1e5, and vary 𝑘𝑇1. So the system is not symmetric any more. Then we find that the tendency of change of [GFP] is almost the same as the case in which 𝑘 and 𝑘𝑇2 remain the same and change together.
Figure 5：The Relationship between GFP and 𝑘𝑇1 in the first condition
Here, we fix 𝑘𝑇1𝑘𝑇2=1e7, and vary both of them. So the system is not symmetric any more. Then we find that the GFP output changes with 𝑘𝑇1 in the way of the previous figure. We can conclude that in the symmetric condition we can get the maximal GFP output.
Figure 6：The Relationship between GFP and 𝑘𝑇1 in the second condition
Summary of Modeling
We not only finished modeling for our own project, but also assisted BIT with their modeling task. We give a complete description of their gene circuits. We tried to change the value of the undetermined parameters to get the trend of the variation of GFP under these conditions. The effect of varying a single is almost identical to the result in the case that km(lac) and km(tet) varies together. However, unlike 𝑘𝑇1, km has a smaller effect on the final output of GFP. As shown in the left figure, when km(lac) increases for 100 folds, the GFP output remain at the same order of magnitude.

Calgary,2018," mammalian cells in culture. For Snip Equip Flip to be fully implemented within a PNC-based delivery system, the donor DNA and integrating plasmid would also need to be co-encapsulated. Although several ideas were discussed for implementing such functionality, the development of those designs was decided to be beyond the scope of respective projects.
After leaving the Kickoff with renewed excitement for the collaboration, the teams went forward to plan the scope and details of their collaboration. It was then decided that P22 PNCs would be most suitable, and work proceeded in Lethbridge to prepare the Cas9-P22 scaffold fusion and P22 capsid vectors. An sgRNA generator, customized with Calgary's Cas9 target sequence, was also assembled. After meeting again at aGEM in late September, the Lethbridge team worked tirelessly to send purified proteins to Calgary. While the results are not ready for presentation on the wiki, both the Calgary and Lethbridge teams are hopeful that results will be prepared for presentation at the jamboree. Stay tuned!
Queens Canada
As a fellow Canadian team, we hoped for an ongoing relationship with the Queens Canada iGEM team . Coincidentally, both members of the uCalgary team and the Queens team were also participating in a second research competition called the Canada Reduced Gravity Experiment (Can-RGX). Can-RGX is a nationwide competition wherein four collegiate teams were selected to prototype and test an experiment in micro-gravity through parabolic flight. Through Can-RGX, relationships were formed very early in the year between members of both teams, which continued to pay dividends for the remainder of the summer.
Cooperative planning and troubleshooting was performed throughout various meetings, both in person and over Skype. Topics such as the acquisition of funding, the ordering of complex DNA parts, and opportunities to take advantage of were shared and debated. The Queens Canada team alerted us to a promotion offered by Genscript which provided free DNA fragment synthesis, which proved integral to our project design. They also provided advice on re-designing DNA fragments which were too problematic to synthesize as single strands, aiding us in getting the ball rolling with our wet lab research. It was rewarding and refreshing to have a cooperative team with which we shared a running conversation and friendship, even for the simple ups and downs of undergraduate research.

Ecuador,2018," Printeria is able to automate the process of printing genetic circuits in bacteria and is as easy to operate as a common printer. It uses a system of digital microfluidics that creates small droplets that can be mixed and moved through predefined electrode trajectories. This box lab is combined with Golden Gate technology, sensors and low-cost electronics and an easy-to-use software application.
Just like that the user is able to assemble parts  of DNA domesticated in a one-step reaction and can control all biotechnological  steps, from the assembly of parts and transformation to cell culture, with high  precision.
The initial idea was to try the production of the fusion proteins and bacterial cellulose in Printeria. Can you imagen that hospital would produce his own bandages when they need it? But both teams have problems with the size of the parts, so we change plans and decided to evaluate the opinion of researchers, medicians and artist.

MEETUP LATIN AMERICA
The past July, we had the chance to attend online at the Latin American Meetup hosted by team TecCEM. There we heard about the other Latin American's projects, sharing experiences and learning from each other. We got the opportunity to present our project and received good questions from experts that had helped us to be prepared for the Giant Jamboree and gives us experience. The eight teams that participated in the meetup were: TecCEM, Tec-Chihuahua, Tec-Monterrey, TecMonterrey-GDL , UChile_Biotec, Ecuador, USP-EEL-Brazil, USP-Brazil.
The  feedback provided by the specialists was crucial for the proper development of  the projects, and beyond the scientific issues, we were able to get to know  each other, get along and create bonds of collaboration and support between the  teams.

Being the first team at the University of Stuttgart we were confrontated with a lot of starting problems.  But we were welcomed so friendly! Everone gave us good advice, shared their experiences with sponsors, iGEM itself or solving experimental problems.  We met a few german teams to exchange information and to just have a good time with each other. All in all it was a very valuable experience to us.  So – big thanks to all iGEM-Teams for the support and helpful hints. It made the start much more easier and we are happy to be part of that great iGEM-community now.
iGEM-Team Cologne-Duesseldorf
One of our big mentoring teams this year was the iGEM Team Köln/Düsseldorf 2017.  As they were the first iGEM Team of their University in 2016 they knew excactly what problems we faced.  Not only taking us by the hand and giving us great support and advices during the whole time, they also invited us to their SynBioDay in Düsseldorf.
Check out the project of iGEM-Team Cologne-Duesseldorf! See their wiki page
iGEM Team Heidelberg
The project of this year’s iGEM-team in Heidelberg is about accelerated evolution using phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE). This is a very fast method to insert a desired mutation into bacterial cells. In their case, they used the method to evolve three mutagenesis plasmids developing different antibiotic resistances in E. coli cells. We were asked to perform a mutagenesis plasmid activity assay to analyze their function and mutagenesis levels. In return they supported us developing our biosafety part.(see safety ).
All in all Team Heidelberg gave us continuous support and we are very thankful for that.

COLLABORATIONS
NU iGEM 2016 performed a variety of collaborative activities.
First and foremost, we collaborated with the University of New South Wales iGEM team. OMVs played a large role in both of our projects—we sought to use them as a delivery mechanism, and UNSW worked to standardize their generation, purification, and characterization for future projects such as ours. In order to standardize these procedures, UNSW needed to demonstrate that they can be replicated in other labs. To that end, NU iGEM 2016 provided UNSW with data collected after using their protocols to purify vesicles produced by our hypervesicular strain. We obtained data from a Bradford assay showing the total protein content in whole cells, periplasm, and OMVs using their purification protocol and sent them this data.
Our team also completed Munich United’s “Enabling Factors in Biotech” survey. Munich wanted to know what factors promoted or limited iGEM teams from creating startups. Our response was that we didn’t consider entrepreneurship because of inexperience with iGEM.
Finally, CRISPR Capsules also helped Purdue University’s team fund-raise their project, “Engineering E. coli to Treat Wastewater and Generate Electricity,” on the research crowdfunding platform Experiment. We donated to their project and promoted it on our social media.

Kobe,2017," suggested us that we also participate in this conference. Thankfully, they arranged so that we could make a poster session in the conference.
In Hyper Interdisciplinary Conference, we and Nagahama listened to each poster session and advised each other. We believed it was very helpful for both teams to demonstrate each project deeply by using poster and actively pointed out each weakness at an early stage. Besides, we had great experiences through this conference (Please see our human practice page for more information). We appreciate Team Nagahama offering us such great opportunities.
Moreover, we and Nagahama helped each other in terms of raising money. While we were struggling to raise money through crowdfunding, Nagahama actively and continuously spread our activity and information about crowdfunding. As our team was founded recently and not known well, we believed their help significantly contributed to our success of raising money. On the other hand, we also supported them while they were trying to raise money by spreading information and showing how we gathered money."

After 5th Asia Pacific iGEM Conference, we have contacted Taiwan teams online, and discussed further our projects.
6) Providing Wiki Creation Assisting Software: KELN to iGEM members
Last year, our team developed KELN, a software for easily making HTML codes for tables in lab notebook pages. It is highly useful when making HTML tables for lab notebooks (experimentation results), and we provided the software for Kobe iGEM team. They sent us feedback on the software, and we found some room for improvement. We are currently revising the software. We sincerely thank Kobe team for the pointers. The feedback was as follows:
-Feedback on KELN-
1. You kindly gave us a manual for KELN, and it helped us understand how to use it. However, we were a little bit confused which version we should install and how to change members’ name, because the manual was not for the latest version but for the original version.
2. We found that KELN was very helpful to write about routine work by using tables. However, we felt that the format is to some extent restricted. For example, we found it a little hard to put comments into a necessary space. It might be better to add some functions so that one can design pages as they want.
3. We tried to change some codes so that it would fit out aims. However, even though we installed Eclipse, we couldn’t even run the original code (probably we should construct some settings, because ‘import’ doesn’t work correctly). Of course, it came from the lack of our knowledge. But, we hope you will add some explanation so that other teams like us can change this tool easily."
RHIT,2018," presentation and answered questions about their project. Then, they went on a tour of the Michigan State University iGEM team’s lab and facilities. Through this meetup, we made connections with other teams and began our collaboration with the Michigan State team.
Trading Cards:
Every iGEM project is changing the world. We want to recognize the SUPER abilities of all the iGEM teams by creating a league of superheroes made up of superheroes designed by each team based on their project.  We gathered information on the name of the team, name of the superhero, the team’s contact info, the “home base” for the superhero, the superhero’s mission, and that Superhero's special powers. All superheroes were placed on a trading card, and each team will receive trading cards from all the teams that participated. Click to see the full card collection!
Postcard:
Our team participated in a creative collaboration opportunity with the Düsseldorf iGEM team at Heinrich-Heine University in Germany. The goal was to bring synthetic biology closer to the public by designing a postcard showing an image related to synthetic biology on the front and a small informational text on the back.  We will get to exchange our postcard with other participating teams so we can collect postcards from all over the world. We can also share the postcards with people in our community to raise awareness and understanding of synthetic biology.
Surveys:
Our team participated in a survey through the UNebraska-Lincoln team, located in Nebraska in the United States of America. Their survey tested our knowledge on different invasive species and native species, as their team is working on creating an effective bait for the Emerald Ash Borer Beetle, an invasive species to North America.
Our team also participated in a survey through the TecCEM iGEM team, located at Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education in the Campus Mexico State (Mexico City). They were organizing a survey to gather information about different treatments of burns around the world. They are looking to develop a new treatment for burned people that will reduce the time of hospitalization and help skin regeneration."

Shenzhen SFLS
At an attempt to strengthen communication and connection between existing few high School iGEM teams in China, Shenzhen_SFLS and us co-organized a high school igem conference on 8.19-8.20. We were honored to invite Dr. Haoqiang Zhang, the representative of iGEM in Asia, at the conference, at which he provided lots of precious and pragmatic suggestions for fledgling high school igemers. We were also honored to have experienced seniors from collegiate iGEM teams in China, including SUSTech_Shezhen, SZU-China and SCAU_China.

SMS Shenzhen
We sent team SMS Shenzhen some of our parts, including CAHS1, 2 and 3 since they intend to desiccate their product—a pesticide targeting Coccoidea for real life application that involves relatively long-term storage and transportation. Therefore they are able to achieve the difficulty faced in storing and transporting their kit, further increasing the practicability of their product. We transformed our parts into MG1655 before posting to them.
SUSTech Shenzhen
On 4th of July, we were invited to visit the campus of collegiate team SUSTech_Shenzhen. After informative presentation of both teams, the experienced senior iGEMers and our team members had a very inspiring and informative discussion on how to improve our project and presentation. We then had the opportunity to visit their lab and spectate the experimental procedures of microinjection used in their project with roundworms. The design of technical apparatus and precision of operation fascinated all our teammates and inevitably stimulated deeper curiosity in the field of synthetic biology."

* Roughly speaking, a process satisfies the Markov property if one can make predictions for the future of the process based solely on its present state just as well as one could knowing the process's full history, hence independently from such history.
Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment"

THE FIFTH CONFERENCE
OF CHINA IGEMER COMMUNITY
    “Among us, past, present and futuremeet. ”
    With excitement, the team members of the HUBU-Wuhan igem team boarded the train to Shanghai. For the reason of the experiment, we arrived at Shanghai Tech University  on the fourth day, the transparent glass appearance of the conference center, the delicious tea break time, the wonderful professional professors’ lectures all showed the organizer's intention.
    We walked into the classroom and listened to the presentation of TSINGHUA, iGEM Tianjin and other teams. We learned the application and development of synthetic biology in more fields which has broadened our thinking. In the evening， we came to shcool of life science and technology .We explained our projects to other teams. At the same time, in the process of communicating with other teams and answering questions, we also had new ideas for our projects. Sure enough, the communication collided with the spark of thought.
    By the next day, we started our own team’s presentation. Because it was the first team to show, it was a bit nervous a. At the Q&A session, students from other teams asked us questions about how to solve H2SO4 in the project. Our H2SO4 concentration is only 3% and is recycled. Next is the panel session hosted by Haotian Guo. Together with UESTC-China, Haotian Guo used his humor to successfully bring the atmosphere of the whole classroom, and joked that only 6 members of our team were a kind of newborn calf. The behavior is also a new idea.
    At noon lunch, we had dinner with HBUT.,communicated the projects of each team and HP progress, learned more forms of HP, and made iGEMers have a deeper friendship.
    This ccic trip, let us go out of the lab, get to know new partners, learn the advantages of other teams inpresentation, poster, etc., and appreciate the unique charm of synthetic biology, and let us have a new understanding about igem, about experiment, about personal growth . Goodbye to the fifth ccic,"
Elan_Vital_Korea,2015," the path in Korean. As the name suggests, they’re making a program that finds and constructs bio-chemical pathways.  The program, we were informed, is designed to find multiple possibilities only with reactants and final products.  The program comes up with a biological scoring system that is built on ATP, number of carbons, and NADP.  Using ‘Gil,’ you can search the most efficient pathway and/or build a de novo pathway that has higher possibilities, providing gene sequence information of the suggested pathways. The Korea University team also tried to test a pathway they found with ‘Gil’.  The Korea University team’s wetlab project is creating an agar utilizing the EFC.  The pathway they found began with agarose, then proceeds to galactose and, in the process NADH is produced, then oxidized by diaphorase, and produces electricity.  We were intrigued by the explanation, and we felt it a very interesting endeavor.  We also wanted to test our plasmids with Gil, when it becomes possible.
We learned a lot from them as a mentor team.  We were able to learn from their experience of attending the Grand Jamboree, college courses related to the synthetic biology, do’s and don’ts in the lab works, and the perspectives on the progress of the project from idea generation to actual lab works.
We became very close to the Korea University Team.  It was assuring that if we ever bump into unexpected hurdles during the lab works, there is somebody out there who can give advice and help us.  They were pursuing a project that is quite different from the task we attack, so the advice and help were of general nature. Still, their encouragement and attitudes toward facing an impasse helped us greatly.
HAFS iGEM Team
Two of our members are from HAFS, which made it easier to communicate with the HAFS team Without Soojung Lee and Hyunmin Park, it might have been difficult to talk to the HAFS iGEM team, not least because HAFS is a boarding school. They worked as a liaison, a link between us and the HAFS team.

HAFS team is engaged in a bio-fuel project: making a particular strand to transform cellulose to alcohol.  For this, they have conducted four stages of sequencing process.  Our work is not related to a bio-fuel, but we are familiar with E-coli engineering and sequencing.  When they had questions relating to their project or iGEM, they reached Sooj"

""When we knew about iGEM Today, we had the impulse to check its posts: we wanted to know about other iGEM teams! We found it was a great idea, because team were shown more personally than in the final wiki, and its reading motivated us. We could also discover projects and ... yeah, we had fun during the Skype interview, didn't we? ;) ""

“We are happy to have the chance to share the work of XMU-China on ""iGEM Today"". By this website, we made our team known by many iGEMers. Also it is an interesting travel to browse the website, reading other team's brilliant design and appreciating the wonderful scenery around the world. The faults which was made during the experiments presented on the website often made me laugh and showed me the real laboratory life.”
XMU China
""EPFL has a very interesting way of connecting iGEM teams. All the teams are presented in a catchy way, while the important information is not missed. It must be very time-consuming for someone to do it during the iGEM project, but it might ultimately grow into more efficient way of connecting iGEM teams and further inter-team collaboration.""
Slovenia
“We think that iGEM Today was a good idea to bring teams closer. Moreover, it was easier to read about different projects and help to know different teams. We think that this was a very good start of a platform that should be known by all the iGEM teams.""

“When we first got the message from the EPFL proposing to do an interview with us, we thought it would be an amazing opportunity to chat and meet other fellow iGEMers. But it was so much more than that. We enjoyed the conversation with them so much, they really seemed like a friendly and fun-loving duo (Marie and Remy, the two people from the EPFL team who skyped with us).
As for the site they created, IGEM Today, I think we all agree what an amazing idea that was. Not only did they make it look really professional, but we also found some"
Lund,2017,"holm
The Stockholm iGEM team was in many ways integral to the success of the early stages of our iGEM journey. As the first team from Lund participating in the iGEM competition, we found the process of organizing the initial juncture quite the challenge as we were uncertain of what to expect from the competition and how prosperously to structure the team organization. The Stockholm team kindly provided recommendations on these matters and in addition sent us some templates outlining the process of seeking funding.
São Paulo State University School of Pharmacy at Araraquara
As another recently established iGEM team, AQA UNESP were faced with a lot of similar challenges in the wet-lab as we had experienced. This ultimately lead to a rewarding video conference consisting of joint debugging of our protocols. In particular, the InterLab study was discussed at length and we were provided with several practical suggestions that, upon implementation, improved the outcome of our transformations.
University of Amsterdam
Early on in the project we had a dialogue with the University of Amsterdam team in which we  the optimal route to a successful project. As they professed some initial worry regarding the funding of their project, we provided them with the strategies we had used to successfully acquire funding in addition to a brochure we had created to trigger interest in potential sponsors.
Missouri University of Science and Technology
In the later stages of the iGEM project, we exchanged a rewarding video correspondence with the established Missouri S&T team. This provided us with the opportunity to reflect and review the decisions that were made during the course of the project together with a seasoned project group, leaving us with insightful suggestions as how to better organize the project for the years to come.
Video Conferences
During the passing year, we exchanged numerous video conferences with teams from all over the world discussing various facts of the iGEM competition and synthetic biology. Each and every one of the dialogues left us with some advice or suggestion that would prove to play a role in the molding of some aspects of our project. Thus, we would be remiss if we did not mention their impact and thank them accordingly. The teams were Amsterdam, AQA UNESP São Paulo, Chalmers, Chennai, AFCM Egypt, Linköping, Missouri S&T, Stockholm, Uppsala, Utrecht, York.

At the beginning of their wiki programming, team NFLS faced difficulties with the compatibility of our coding software and the official iGEM server. Experimented from Frontpage to Dreamweaver, they still found several bugs remained in our website. Luckily, we had coded part of their wiki, and helped them with the some of the specific sentences that were only used in iGEM server. As our collaboration proceeded, we shared a lot of coding tips and sentences, including light effects and multiple layers."
UESTC-China,2018,"asmid. Thereafter, they performed an enzymatic ligation of the operon with the vector plasmid fragment under the conditions of a 16 ℃ reaction for 5 to 6 hours. Then, they transformed the enzyme-ligated plasmid into E. coli top10 strain and observed its growth (the AMP resistance gene was carried on the vector plasmid to confer selectivity). The expected result is 1, 3, 4 groups of bacteria grow, but 2 groups do not. However, they conducted a number of tests and all ended in failure. So, they contacted us to discuss the reasons for the failure and the solution. Finally, we proposed to change the enzyme ligation conditions, and changed the enzyme ligation conditions to a 4 degree reaction for 22 hours (overnight reaction) for enzyme ligation, and proceeded to verify the work. They finally conducted the experiment using the solution provided by us. Sure enough, the experimental results are very good. After that, they were able to carry out the subsequent operations.
BUCT-China also helped us confirm the function of GroES & GroEL. After transforming the plasmid containing GroES & GroEL into DH5α strain, it was verified that the growth of the recombinant strain was better than that of the original strain at 1% butanol concentration. We invited BUCT-China to conduct repeated experiments to ensure the repeatability of the experiment. Through their data we found that we can come to the same conclusion. Under their verification, we confirmed that our GroESL in DH5α was correct. Click here for more: https://2018.igem.org/Team:BUCT-China/Collaborations
 UESTC-Software
We offered many helps in the construction of their project. At their ‘Preliminary investigation’ stage, UESTC-Software communicated with us and we told them our needs for a new biobrick database. When their project has formed into the internal test version, we gave them valuable feedback. Our feedback has become one of the basis for their further adjustment.
We also helped UESTC-Software validate the effects of their predictor. We provided them with the FRE sequence, then they predicted this sequence, and performed promoter optimization to remove unnecessary part. We constructed plasmids with predicted promoter, then transferred it to the host DH5α. The verification proves that the predicted promoter is very likely correct.  And they helped us by using their database BioMaster. We needed some statistics aiding our experiments, so they recommended their database and we found what"

Team Germany Aachen
A successful collaboration was established based on the fact that both our teams are aiming to employ yeast in order to design a biosensor. Our project is focussed on an effective methane sensor development through synthetic biology and metabolic modelling. Team Aachen had some queries regarding the significance of their project in terms of biosafety. The team was also concerned regarding the significance of melatonin in the study of the stability of DNA in neurodegenerative disorders. They enquired whether their facilitated measuring method of melatonin was helpful in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. We helped answer their questions with the help of Dr. Puneet Gandhi who was a part of the biosafety meeting that we had arranged on our campus.
Team Aachen also shared their project description with us, which revealed their use of Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) technique to develop a melatonin sensor which would sense the presence of melatonin from saliva samples. This helped us understand as to how a biosensor development is to be done.
The information we received from their team significantly helped us begin the process of model building. Mr. Jan suggested the use of SimBiology tools for model building to build a gene regulation model for a chassis organism using MATLAB. This turned out to be of great help for us as our metabolic modelling part of the project was initiated with help of team Aachen.  We helped spread the word about their project on the “iGEM Day” that we organized in our institute and the same was done by Team Aachen on their side. Video calls were held with their team to discuss both our projects’ applications and the possibility of marketization of our biosensing technology.
Team Bioilluminati IIT Kanpur
Our team had interactive sessions with the iGEM team from IIT Kanpur. Both our projects are in environmental track and thus we actively discussed and exchanged project ideas and their plausible effects. During these sessions, we discussed our methodology, upcoming strategies and helped troubleshoot each other's issues. Both of our teams worked together in human practices and outreach programs.

Both manuscripts were published on an online platform and on May 21st, 2016 all those who published manuscripts, as well as judges and editors, read, reviewed, and offered suggestions to improve the papers. We received a lot of very helpful feedback from other authors and judges. The feedback they offered made us work hard to find very specific answers to challenging questions, and some comments challenged the way we approached problems we were facing in the lab. After the conference we came back to our project with new perspectives, answers, ideas, and questions.
For our content and efforts in collaboration during the conference we were awarded badges in the following categories:

In late September we were contacted by the professionals in the synthetic biology field that we would be working with for editing of the papers.  The formatting and copy-editing process is underway, and the papers will both be published by late October.
Interviews
As an aspect of our collaborations with other teams, we participated in Rice University’s “Humans of SynBio” project. Based on the Humans of New York social media campaign, where pictures and stories of people are shared with the world.  This project allowed us to share our experiences in iGEM and as students participating in synthetic biology.  We talked to a member of their team over Skype and he asked questions about our experiences. Their team then posted a summary of our experiences as part of their campaign.
“I think the experience is not as much about the project as it is about personal development and about learning and getting to know the world of science and everything it involves.” - excerpt from article (Aug 28. 2016, Rice iGEM Facebook)
Along with being interviewed by the iGEM team at Rice University, members of our team were also interviewed by a Swiss university team out of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) that runs a website featuring iGEM news and interviews from iGEM teams and their members across the world.
The members interviewed were able to take an introspective look at the inner workings of the team, how far we’ve come, how we manage to work together and get along.  Two articles were written on the team: one based on the interview, and the second about the project more specifically.

Instead of boarding a plane, we loaded the car and went on a little road trip of 450 km through wind and rain. Luckily the weather got better and better the closer we came. Just after arriving at the camp site and setting everything up, the first official point of the program was already about to begin: bar tour, yeah! A long and noisy night followed ;) The next morning, the teams from literally all over Germany and extended Germany, also known as Denmark, assembled at the main event building and grabbed some awesome breakfast, including appropriate amounts of coffee, before being welcomed by our great hosts from iGEM Marburg . After introduction speeches by the sponsors of the event, the teams took the stage and presented their projects. As some time had passed since the Paris event, we got to see how the ideas had developed, and there were also some we had not seen before. Really awesome! After grabbing lunch, it was our turn to show what we had done and would still do in the lab.

The afternoon was dedicated to physical activity of a special kind, Bubble Soccer . Probably the most hilarious game ever, though it will drain all your energy. Luckily our hosts had anticipated this and provided us with a tasty BBQ. Though everyone was a bit tired, the day was far from over as there was the final party of the weekend. The next morning came way too quickly, but luckily it was a beautiful sunny morning. We had the chance to hike to the castle and enjoy the amazing view from the top before it was again time to say Goodbye for a while and hit the road back to the lab. Thanks again Marburg for having us, it was a pleasure!

This year's team of Highschool students from Ankara got in touch with us and asked for help for their clever idea of translating the standard iGEM lab protocols into different languages. This will hopefully help future teams from all around the globe to better understand them and apply them in the lab without being required to understand English perfectly. Especially other future Highschool teams should profit from this.
We are happy to be part such a great project and make iGEM even more international.

SDU-Denmark,2015," Danish and a Nordic Meetup.  The Danish Meetup was hosted by the DTU iGEM Team. This meetup took place the 24th to the 26th of april, where all of the other danish teams participated. The core of this meetup was a biobrick workshop, which took place in the DTU laboratory. This workshop was meant as an introduction for how to build a biobrick. A lot of the team members do nott have much experience with wet lab before iGEM, so this was also a general “how to”-guide for wet lab.  But the meetup also consisted of lectures about ‘How to do - Wiki’ and some cosy social games and a dinner.
The Nordic Jamboree was hosted by the Uppsala iGEM team in collaboration with the Stockholm iGEM Team. This took place at University of Uppsala from the 24th to the 26th of July and a lot of the nordic iGEM teams participated in this event. The main event of this meetup was the Nordic iGEM Jamboree competition, which was held on the 25th. The competition was meant as a chance to practise for the Giant Jamboree in Boston. The winning team of the Nordic Jamboree would receive The Golden Pipette. Other than this the event consisted of workshops, social events, and a dinner saturday evening with a following barcrawl.
After the Nordic Jamboree we were contacted by the Uppsala iGEM team. They needed help to find information on how many teams that had been using antibodies in their projects. This turned out to be a win-win situation, since we could use the data in our Business Plan ). We also helped the 2015 iGEM team from d'Aix Marseille Université by spreading their survey about chewing gum. We earned a silver medal for our efforts.

Meet Up Latinoamerica
Date:
July 10th and 11th, 2015
Objectives:
-Joining different teams from Latin America to share experiences, get to know each other and receive opinions about our projects.
-Invite experts to learn from their experiences in the field of science and receive feedback from them regarding our projects.
As an iGEM member, every team goes through a different development process: a route full of ups and downs. Latin America MeetUp was the perfect opportunity to share these experiences, learn from them and even to come up with great new ideas. Since we were hosts, GenetiX team was in charge of preparing activities that allowed not only the interchange of adventures and discoveries, but also learning new and useful things for the competition.
The event began with some getting-to-know-each-other activities. Inter team bonding is crucial when building cooperation. The next step was one of the most important ones: explain our projects, challenges and achievements, so that we could receive feedback from our peers and experts, who visited us as a part of the experience.
We were witnesses of different lectures with scientists from the “Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitación” (spanish for National Institute of Rehabilitation). We learned about their research projects and how professional laboratories work. This showed us that science in the outside world (as a job, more than leisure) is not so different from what we do. In addition, it fed our passion about what we love.
During these day, we also met experts that taught us crucial ideas for the complete development of science. One of them talked about mathematical models in biology  and the other, about science marketing. These both completed our work and oriented the teams in terms of fund-raising.
The MeetUp was one-in-a-million experience. We had fun and met new people, who were facing similar challenges as ours. We had the occasion to grow as a team as we learned about our project and receive feedback from people who knew the field. Most important, we finally established the bond between our region teams that had never been created before, opening the window for further cooperative projects.

Introduction
It’s essential for us to get accurate growth condition of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the natural environment to keep the concentration of toxin at a lethal level. But in fact, it is almost impossible to test concentration anywhere due to the lack of equipment and skills. Therefore, building the growth model can help determine the amount of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii they should use and when they need to add more. To build an accurate growth model, BNU-China team members who have much experience in the mathematics helped us to achieve it.
Contacting with data provided by wet laboratory, we can draw the diagram of variation trend of algae population. Then we can get the key point where rate of algae population increment meets the maximal value so that the results can guide to culture of algae in their wet part. To control quantity of aquatic larva of mosquito by applying expression of specific protein in algae. There is an impressive impact of establishing mathematic modeling in population of algae.
They helped us to establish a mathematic model to illustrate the whole temporal change of algae population. In general, it’s an original differential equations based on light intensity, mineral nutrient, organism and carbon dioxide, which are four main parameters in that. As for the temporal changing rate of population of algae growing in ideal conditions, there has been a lot of methods to solve this question. They referred to Huisman model and combined with practice factors. Then we got our deducted model. This model has a few parameters and it’s easy to get the solution.
We provided the data of wet laboratory for us, and they run the model to get result. Finally, these results can help us to complete experiment.
Hypothesis of model
The fundamental way that the algae grow is through photosynthesis, in which the inorganic carbon in the water (carbon dioxide) can be transformed into the organic carbon (carbohydrate). However, the photosynthesis of the algae, which is fixed in the water, is influenced and limited by lots of factor.

For the first meetups, IGEM Bordeaux went to Paris. Arriving Thursday night we spend a great night with our friends before going on Friday attend the meetup organized by the great team of igem pasteur! The Friday morning we arrived in front of the base camp, no i should say the fortress of the team pastor. We were escorting in front of a great breakfast to give us the strength we needed to pass all these teams and present our project. This breakfast was also an opportunity to go spy the other teams to give us more stress, in case we would not be enough stress in front of the pomp of the places where we were. After a morning of presentation, we were able to fill our bellies with a feast worthy of kings. And exchange a maximum of advice around a round table that was not really round. In the afternoon we had the chance learn from the knowledge of different teachers and researchers of the Pasteur Institute. Thanks to this moment animate by the school of the pitch of Paris we learned better to express ourselves in front of an audience and thus to be clearer in our exchange.
This led us to meet again the next day to visit the city with other courageous teams such as igem Toulouse and igem marseille, and to undertake the long and endless quest for the little chapel aka ""the secret chapel"" that we have end up finding after having suffered losses (igem marseille). Here some memories It was definitely a wonderful human experience !
Meetup of Marseille
For the second week of August, iGEM Bordeaux went to the Mediterranean meet-up organized by iGEM Aix-Marseille Université.  The first day of the meet-up was quite hard for our team as some of us arrived in a bus at 5am. However, it was with a great pleasure to begin this meet-up. After the breakfast, the host team starts the presentation. After that we had the chance to present our project. It was interesting to have so many questions about our organism, Caernorhabditis elegans. Most of the people didn’t know this organism or how it can be useful, for genetic study. After us, it was a girl from iGEM technion team to present."
Macquarie_Australia,2018," gRNA + enzyme + PCR product (further incubated for 1 hour at 37°C) and a deactivation step of 20 minutes at 80°C.
Three protein bands were observed in the pre-incubated samples (Lane 1 and 5 in Figures 2, 3). The dCas9 proteins were expected to be the highest bands, indicated as “Native protein”. Post incubation of the enzymes with the PCR product binding and gel shifting was observed, with little migration through the gel (Lane 2 and 5 in Figures 2, 3). After inactivation of the enzymes (Lanes 3 and 6 in Figures 2, 3) protein aggregation was observed at the top of the lanes. This indicates that the binding to the PCR was reversed.

iGEM Team TU Darmstadt
iGEM Team Aachen for iGEM Team TU Darmstadt
Our teams met for the first time at the German iGEM meetup in Marburg held in the beginning of August. As both our teams worked with the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAA) we exchanged our project ideas and experiences. From this basis a lively contact and a scientific collaboration evolved, that was of mutual benefit.
Here we describe our contribution to the exchange.
We are probing our DMNBS tRNA/synthetase variants with a fluorescence based, two plasmid screening system established by iGEM Team Austin Texas 2014. By using this system, fidelity and efficiency of ncAA incorporation can be determined. Though O-methyl-L-tyrosine (OMeY) is a well-known and frequently used tRNA/synthetase pair, it was not analysed before with the Austin screening system.
The OMeY tRNA/synthetase pair used by team Darmstadt was cloned into our pACYC derived backbone and transformed into E. coli BL21 cells, already containing the screening system. The cells underwent the same cultivation and screening routine as our DMNBS variants. For this, a microtiterplate was inoculated which was filled with medium of different OMeY concentrations (0-5 mM). The aim was to identify a sufficient concentration of ncAA to achieve high levels of fluorescence and growth rate to evaluate the incorporation efficiency.
Unfortunately, the measurement did not yield usable data, as the bacteria grew highly irregular and fluorescence signals were not comparable enough to evaluate. iGEM Team TU Darmstadt for iGEM Team Aachen
A few team members of Team Darmstadt have knowledge of protein modeling. So they offered to simulate and evaluate the exchange of tyrosine with O-(2-nitrobenzyl)-L-tyrosine (ONBY) in the linker peptide.  Thus we can value the effect the protection group of ONBY has on the structure of the protease.
This is pretty helpful because we can estimate if our approach can be successful at this site of the protein.
To elaborate the influence of ONBY on the structure of subtilisin E Team Darmstadt estimated parameters for the force field CHARMM27 in a similar way as they did it for ONBY. Afterwards they incorporated ONBY into the wildtype structure (PDB accession number: 3WHI ). The structure was subsequently energy minimized using GROMACS 5"

Healthy Recipes
   This year, we organized a collaboration project names ""Share your Healthy recipes."" We uploaded the following prompt on iGEM collaboration page and e-mailed more than sixty iGEM teams:
Greetings, iGEM-ers!
Do you enjoy cooking? Have you ever noticed the similarity between cooking and experimenting—tea spoons to pipettes, seasoning to buffers, and recipes to protocols? For those who enjoy both cooking and experimenting, you should keep your eyes open to this collaboration project.
This year, our team is working to create a probiotics based solution to diabetes. In doing so, we are teaching the male elderlies who can cook how to cook diabetes-friendly, healthy recipes. We are going to create a handbook that contains healthy recipes to give out to these elderlies. Granted, we wanted to collect recipes from iGEM teams all around the world, ranging from Asian cuisines to American dishes to any tasty food that you want to share! Our team will create and upload cooking videos for some of the best recipes.
If you want to participate, please send a one paragraph recipe with ingredients and instructions as well as the photo of the final products. The menu can vary from anything such as soup to probiotics yogurt recipe!
   As a response, many iGEM teams from all around the world shared their country's unique recipes that are both delicious and healthy. Namely, ICT-Mumbai and VIT Vellore from India, Nawi-GRAZ from Austria, TecCEM from Mexico, and Lambert GA from Atlanta generously donated their detailed recipes and photos. We gathered these recipes in a handbook titles ""iGEM protocols... for diabetes friendly recipes"" that showcase detailed methods and materials for some scrumptious meals. You can access to the recipe from the following pdf file:

According to Team US AFRL CarrollHS, this project is one of the various forms of “Flat Stanley.” ”Flat Stanley” is Jeff Brown’s book, that one can connect with others by sending a paper ""Flat Stanley"" (microbe) across the world. “Mike the Microbe” is Team US AFRL’s own version"
Baltimore_BioCrew,2018," that “they would love to read [our] report to know more about iGEM” while as others expressed their concerns with iGEM and that if they choose to pursue iGEM our report “could be useful”.
Some of the concerns they expressed are very much in line with the obstacles we have witnessed in the past, so we specifically focused on those issues in our report. The report includes a section explaining the iGEM competition, the basics on how to start a team, an attributions section, and an appendix. The appendix has detailed explanations on each part of starting and managing a team, including recruiting, training, timeline and more. Both the Baltimore BioCrew and iTesla team state what they have attempted in relation to each topic, what has worked and what has not worked. To conclude the topic, a section on advice/improvements is usually provided to give potential iGEM teams direction on where to start.
We plan on continuing to add more feedback as our experience with the iGEM competition progresses and hope to encourage more community laboratories to invite local high schoolers to compete in the iGEM competition using their lab space with our iGEM Guide.

Common parameters for martini were used for minimization and equilibration, and the model was setup to run for about 10 microseconds with berendsen temperature coupling and Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling. The system runs at 300 K and a pressure of 1 bar.
The building process is documented on the project’s github page . An in depth analysis was written and published on the Vilnius wiki .
Bordeaux
We decided to collaborate with the Bordeaux iGEM team because of the strong parallels between our projects. We were both trying to use cellulose to produce an industrially useful platform molecule (2,5-Furandicarboxyclic acid, in their case). With such strong similarities, we felt we would have a lot to discuss about the ethical considerations of our projects.
The collaboration began when David, from Bordeaux, sent our team a Facebook message. Over the next weeks we had skype sessions until it was eventually decided that we would visit them in Bordeaux in late August. They would present the extensive research they had done about the ethics of GMOs and the use of non-edible biomass. In return, we would use the expertise of the chemists on our team and university to improve their protocols and to teach them how to effectively use an HPLC machine.
The Groningen team took a plane to Bordeaux from Schiphol Amsterdam on Friday the 24th of August. Upon arrival we were picked up by David who drove us to the Chateau (Castle) d’Eck where two of us would be sleeping throughout our stay and the conference would take place. The two other members of our team would sleep with David at a typical French student residence. After dropping off our luggage, David took us to a restaurant where we met a few more members of the Bordeaux team. We got to know each other and discuss our projects more inform"

Public Outreach Survey
Introduction
Spreading awareness and interest for synthetic biology can be a difficult task due to the complexity of the field and the fast pace of development. Furthermore, the public scepticism towards genetic engineering and GMOs has been quite strong, at least in Sweden. To explore the awareness of some aspects of synthetic biology and their knowledge about it, our team conducted a survey covering the use of GMOs in household products. The survey also covered some basic concepts within biology, such as DNA and where it can be found. We also went a step further in the pursuit of understanding the public position, in our collaboration with the Istanbul Technical University iGEM team.
In our collaboration, we designed the layout and questions for our survey to be able to compare the differences in people's opinions and knowledge of GMO. The results could then be compared and an analysis of the differences can be used to device future strategies for informing the general public on the use of GMOs in both our countries.
The survey:
The survey consists of 15 questions in total with an initial part covering age, gender and education level to aid in analysis of the results. The questions were first written in English, discussed between two teams’ members. Teams made a joint decision about the questions and then translated to the native languages of each team country (Swedish and Turkish).
Chalmers Team’s Analysis about the Survey:
The participation on the survey was good, with 183 and 875 participants in Sweden and Turkey respectively. Demographically, the diversity was not optimal with over 80 percent of the participants having a university education which is not representative of the population as a whole in either Sweden or Turkey. Correction for this will of course have to be part of the analysis. Furthermore, it should be stated that conclusions drawn here are merely the thought and conclusions drawn by our team and are up for debate. After statistical analysis in"

The NEFU iGEM team created a survey regarding the ease and speed of creating the wiki.
Seoul, Korea: Survey
We participated in the survey produced by the iGEM team from Seoul. This survey was on open source information and is used to assist the team in developing their ""Gil"" software.
ATOMS Turkey, Turkey: YouTube Video
We were engaged with the ATOMS Turkey's video on their project and commented on the video with our thoughts and ideas.
Conclusion
Through our collaborative efforts we were involved in the projects of 20 other iGEM teams who hail from 15 different nations, as mapped out in the figure below. Collaboration is an important part of iGEM: Through the global iGEM community huge undertakings such as the parts registry and annual Jamboree are achieved. We were overjoyed by the positivity we found whenever we got in contact with another team, and we believe that by continuing to strive to make the iGEM community an inclusive and supporting one, this competition can continue to move from strength to strength in the future.
In the the distant future we look forward to continued cooperation with our friends from international institutions, but in the near future we are looking forward to meeting them all in person at the Jamboree!"

iGEM-Team Yale
We wrote an advertisement for the Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 strain. The team of the university of yale connected to us and we had a skype video conference in which we talked about our projects and our teams. After the video conference they sent us the Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 agar stab agars for our project. Unfortunately, the samples didn´t arrive at the expected time (before Wikifreeze) and so we were not able to use the samples, because of the shipping process. The Yale iGEM team informed us that shipping living cells can lead to a delivery delay.
For future teams, team Yale and our team strongly recommend, not to underestimate the importance of time management. We would like to thank team Yale for the collaboration!
European Meetup Munich
From July 20-22 we attended the European Meetup in Munich where we had our first contact with teams from other countries. We learned really much about other projects and also had interesting talks about synthetic biology. We would like to thank the Munich team for the great organization and hosting and also all the other teams which attended at the meetup."

Safety
While it is of vital significance to carry out experiments in the lab, we also need to step out to seek for collaborations with other iGEM teams which will certainly give us a better understanding of our project and make it more far-reaching. This year, collaborations with teams and conferences came out and take a look at our collaborations now!
Instructor of SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai
Both located in Shanghai and took part in the iGEM 2017 Championship, ECUST established contact with Shanghai Xiehe High School. Serving as the instructor, we held several discussions on experimental design and assisted them on the Interlab experiments. Working with other members and teams is a necessity in scientific field, and when it comes to iGEM, it is even more indispensable.

Collaborations with SJTU
Apart from Shanghai Xiehe High School, ECUST also had collaborations with Shanghai Jiaotong University. This summer, we invited the members from SJTU to take a Lab Visiting Day in our campus and exchange ideas on iGEM competition. On top of that, we two teams also carried out collaborations on experiments such as plasmid transformation and monoclonal screening. By communicating viewpoints, we gained many valuable suggestions which are useful to refine our project.

CCiC
This August, the 4th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) was held in Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University and some of our members attended the conference. There were many professors and scholars delivering speeches on synthetic biology and China iGEM teams sharing their projects. By communicating with professors and other teams, we gained a much deeper understanding of the principle and mechanism of Synbio.
Besides lectures and workshops, there was also time for social activities to know about other teams.
