Collaboration
iGEM NTHU
In this September, we received the invitation to have a collaboration with iGEM NTHU . NTHU detected environmentally hazardous substances while our project is focusing on the sensing of nitrate concentration. They try to give a broader aspect. However, we try to give a more detail sensing system. Thus, we had a profound discussion of both teams’ projects. Moreover, we also shared our fluorescence idea of 2016 and 2017 with them.
After mutual inspection and troubleshooting with both projects, we were enlightened to expand our sensing device to detect more substances like environmental hormone even heavy metal in the future, which would make our project more practical. Also, NTHU offered their investigation results of aquaculture questionnaire to us. These questionnaires strengthened our data integrity and made our project more fit to the market demand.
This collaboration combined both teams’ detecting projects. We exchanged our hardware design, principle, commercial value, and strategies, making both our projects more compatible.
Collaboration in Biosafety
Last year, we successfully constructed biobrick BBa_K1920006, an arabinose induced cell lysis complication biobrick (P_BAD-RBS-lysis-B0015), but it is not available in the distribution kit of 2017 competition. Before the meet-up with iGEM MDHS and iGEM CSMU (click here to see more), we got a information that Mingdao were interested in this brick and want to combine it into their project for biosafety design. Thus, it’s our honor to provide five Biobricks and PCR production of our construction and handed over to them in the meet-up."

Tec-Chihuahua
Collaboration
Collaborations with iGEM Tec-Chihuahua Team were full of difficult challenges, but hard work and effort from both parts gave good results. Our team helped Chihuahua with the nanoparticles that they will use in their project. They sent us their protocols, and we conducted additional research by contacting experts on the field. This lead to us proposing a new protocol to Chihuahua Team, which they accepted, involving the transformation and chemical encapsulation with chitosan to improve the efficiency output of the reaction, as well as the preservation of the nanocapsules.

Düsseldorf
Collaboration
For our collaboration with iGEM Düsseldorf Team, our mathematical model members came up with an appropriate system of differential equations, MATLAB code, and Python code that accurately described the complex Trinity system, which involves three codependent entities growing in the same medium. Although we got stuck a few times with grasping conceptually the functioning of the system, and some technical aspects of the python simulation, our results and ideas proved to be very useful to their team, leading to the determination of the correct ratio of nutrients needed in order for their organisms to grow into a stable system.

IIT-Madras
Collaboration
One of our team members helped iGEM team IIT Madras with their Language Project, which involved making educational Synthetic Biology videos in our native language. As part of the collaboration, we received a script in English from IIT Madras and proceeded to translate it completely into Spanish. After that, an audio file was recorded and thus concluded our brief collaboration!
Madrid-OLM
Collaboration
Thanks to their advancements in software and computational modeling of protein structures, Madrid-OLM team was able to produce adn give us 3 models and animations of proteins used in our project: Cas1, Cas2, and RT EC86. With this collaboration, we were able to get more information, and understand our project even at a molecular level.                         We held a Q&A session with iGEM Madrid-OLM Team, concerning important Wiki aspects, where our main developer cleared some doubts about font usage, iGEM skins, and templates. Overall, it was a very productive session"
HokkaidoU_Japan,2015," I think automatization of experiments is absolutely imperative. No matter how simplify operations of experiments by open source, if people who actually experiment don’t understand means or mechanisms of the operations, they can’t understand the whole context or may fail many times. If automatization of operations of experiments comes true, I think SynBio is put to practical use in a real sence.”
Conclusion
We had meaningful discussions about each topic and helped to enhance the contents of Human Practice of Tec_Guadalajara .
In addition, we had a meaningful opportunity to think of the regulations of GMO.
Answering questionnaires about modeling and experimentation of Aalto-Helsinki
Modeling plays a key role in our project and gives us useful predictions on whether our projects will work well. So in synthetic biology, we can say that modeling serves as a crucial link between the idea and realization of an engineered biological system.
In this year, Aalto-Helsinki team survey about modeling. So we, Hokkaido University team, help Aalto-Helsinki team by answering 10 questionnaires on below.
What team are you in?
What is your field of studies?
How long have you been studying?
Is your team doing any modeling? If yes, is there an assigned group for this task?
What kind of roles do you have in your project?
What were your expectations for combining modeling with biology? Was there something surprising?
What guided your model construction? (Your own prior knowledge, a team member's prior knowledge, your own research (research articles etc.), advisor's prior knowledge, other (please specify))
What challenges were there in terms of collaborating between fields?
How did you approach the collaboration challenges? Did you feel your approach worked? Why, why not?
What kind of communication was there between modeling and laboratory practitioners? Were there any challenges in this communication?
How did the modeling efforts have an effect on the wetlab work? If there was no effect, why not?
Do you think that your models depict the real phenomena, or do you treat them rather as mere mathematical tools?
Now that you know better, is there something you would have done differently?
Comments
Modeling is also important for us, so we not only helped to enhance the contents of Human Practice of Aalto-Helsinki team, but had a meaningful opportunity to think of the relationship between Modeling and Biology.

iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting(2017)
We were invited to Shenzhen University (SZU) to attend the  iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting. The meeting was divided into three parts: project presentation, Q&A and free discussion. We gathered together to discuss the feasibility of the project, checked whether the ideas were flawed,came up with many insightful and helpful suggestions.
In this meeting we met different teams from different universities, and established the foundation of collaborations and communications with other teams. It was the first time that our project was displayed when the chassis we choosed was Medicago sativa, and Sinorhizobium meliloti. It was a hard time that we could find no way out our project design.
The iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting brought us a lot, this period of exprience nearly changed the whole project design of our team.
Conference of China iGEMer Community(2017)
The Conference of China iGEMer Committee(CCiC) is an advanced academic conference of synthetic biology in China, aiming to promote the development of synthetic biology and improve the contact and communications of nationwide iGEM teams.
We attended the 2017CCiC  hosted by the FAFU-CHINA. It was a great opportunity for us to know more about other teams’ projects and learn from each other, such as TUST-China, they introduced their project to us, and we found that both of us chased the production optimization of bacterial cellulose, one of the difference between our projects was the chassis we choosed as bioreactor. We went on selecting suitable organisms to modify, and the new project design come into being.
We have well established the connections with some of the teams which bring us helpful collaborations and support for our CUIPD project. In addition, it was useful to talk to other teams to exchange experience on poster design, oral presentation"

This summer we collaborated with the iGEM team at Northwestern University on the InterLab project. They were experiencing difficulties successfully transforming the provided InterLab DNA into their competent DH5a cells. We helped them troubleshoot their issues by providing  the protocol we used to transform the DNA. We first rehydrated the provided iGEM DNA from Kit 7 with 10µL sterile water. We then transformed the DNA into JM109 competent cells and miniprepped the colonies to recover the DNA in greater concentrations. We then used this DNA in our InterLab transformations. The transformation procedure we provided the Northwestern iGEM team is as follows: 1. Add 1µL of the appropriate InterLab DNA into 1.5mL Eppendorf tube containing DH5a competent cells 2. Incubate competent cells on ice for 30 minutes 3. Tap gently every 10 minutes 4. Heat shock DH5a competent cells by placing in 42ºC water bath for 45 seconds 5. For recovery, place cells on ice for 2 minutes 6. Add 300µL of SOC media to rescue DH5a competent cells 7. Place cells in 37ºC incubator for 1 hour 8. Spin cells in microcentrifuge at 5K rpm for 2 minutes 9. Remove the upper 200µL of supernatant fluid 10. Resuspend cells in the remaining 100µL of SOC media 11. Plate 50µL of DH5a competent cells with InterLab DNA on LB + CAM plates 12. Incubate transformed DH5a competent cells in 37ºC incubator for 16 hours Using the procedure we provided, the Northwestern iGEM team was able to successfully transform their cells and complete the InterLab study."

Shanghai Jiao Tong University
SJU is experienced in iGEM competition, to better improve our project, we paid a visit to Shanghai Jiaotong University on 14th April 2017. On arrival, teacher Wang and students there greeted us warmly, and spared no effort to share us with their years’ experience, including the problem we might meet in visa, accommodation and tickets booking and they also advised us how to establish a spirit to unite teammates together. Then we presented our projects in turn and teacher Wang provided several valuable advice.
SJU also offered their help to our experiment by providing pBR322-dusk-mRFP2 and pBAD18-pFixK2 to us.
We would like to express our sincere appreciation to SJU’s constructive suggestions and plasmid, they did help us a lot.
Shenzhen University
Though it’s the first year that we’ve participated in iGEM, we tried to help other teams. We set a good relationship with Shenzhen University. We provided them with plasmid pP43NMK-PGA when they turned to us for help.
Our project didn’t go without difficulty, actually we failed several times in establishing the light-involved system. Knowing that, Huazhong Agricultural University has successfully transformed a related plasmid, we contacted with them immediately, fortunately they were warm-hearted, and send the plasmid to us without hesitation."

UNESP Brazil
We collaborated with iGEM UNESP Brazil is working on the subject of Engineered Probiotics Around the World.
The goal of the collaboration was to understand about the GMO legislation around the world and if there already is any regulations about engineered probiotics and if there are clinical trials or companies using engineered probiotics in these countries. This work was done in collaboration with teams Chalmers-Gothenburg, IIT Delhi, Jiangnan China, TecCEM and Lambert. We were grateful that they reached out to us. It was really interesting to learn about probiotics marketed in various countries, high tech startups working in the field of probiotics and recent clinical trials across the world that provide critical insight into a topic that has been of much importance recently. The data from the collaboration is given below,
China
In China, there is no regulation for genetically engineered probiotics, the present tests in the country approach pathogenic potential, and patronized standards for food evaluation. No companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.
India
In India, the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) in partnership with DBT (Department of Biotechnology), created an official guide to evaluate probiotics in the country, so any probiotic product needs to be on this guide´s pattern to be released in the market.
Before being approved and released, food is submitted to standardized tests for identification and characterization of its new chains, such as PCR, in vitro tests mimicking the gut environment, in vivo testing to check the effectiveness in live animals, safety assessment for human use, evaluation of efficacy in humans, also there are standards patterns that need to be followed for the process of food packing and management.
Currently, the probiotic market in India is dominated by multinationals, which mainly commercialize fermented food products. No companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.
Mexico
In Mexico, all food that has been processed or produced by genetically modified organisms are considered transgenic,"
Peshawar,2016,". Realizing the importance of public awareness and to promote the acceptance of genetic engineering as an alternative tool, we disseminated their survey that explained the dangers chemical pesticides pose to the health and environment, and their project that provides an ecofriendly alternative.
Support in surveying for Team Tec Chihuahua
Our collaboration with Tec Chihuahua from Mexico involved human practice activities. We offered our social media platforms to get responses on the surveys they were conducting. The survey was targeted at general public and centered around the concerns and issues relating to Synthetic Biology as perceived by common people.
IIT Kharagpur India
Our collaboration with IIT Kharagpur included Skype sessions where we shared construct designs, exchanged thoughts about improving them and insights about effective human practices. We disseminated their survey which sought to understand the perception of Synthetic Biology among the general public of our region. Given the current political situation between our two countries, our skype sessions, discussions, and idea sharing not only enabled us to bridge divides and share science across borders, but also laid the groundwork for long and lasting relationships for the future. We even listened to the 'Aman ki Asha'(The want of Peace) song together!
Team XMU China
XMU China is a team from Xiamen University. We were fascinated by their project idea that dealt with antibiotic resistance. Since a lack of public awareness plays a key role in exacerbating this problem, we helped them gather data about public knowledge and experiences related to antibiotic use.

Introduction
One of the silver medal requirements is to include a team collaboration in an significantly way. This is because on iGEM, you have the unique opportunity to work with like-minded people all around the world on a project. You can influence the work of others in many ways, starting with meet ups to discuss problems and ideas and ending with helping them to complete an important task in their project. Over the year, we had different collaborations listed below.
Carroll iGEM
In July, the Carroll iGEM Team introduced us to an opportunity to collaborate with them on Instagram. We made a picture with Mike the Microbe who visited us in our Chemistry Lab. Mike is a cartoon friendly bacteria and iGEM teams all over the world hosted him in their labs. We were very happy to had him in our lab.

German Meet Up During the German Meet Up in Marburg we talked with many German iGEM teams about their projects, comparing different approaches and meeting nice people from all around Germany.
European Meet Up The European Meet Up in Munich helped us to improve our presentation skills, exchanging experiences associated with the progress of our work and listening to intriguing talks.
Oslo In May, we had the opportunity to visit iGEM Oslo, since one of their members is an exchange student from Tübingen. We had very nice talks and an excellent workshop with the communications which lead to the development of plenty of good ideas, like the Ract! Festival or our public debate.
Bielefeld We visited iGEM Bielefeld during our attendance of the Hanovermesse, enjoying a tour of their laboratory and exchanging ideas.
HyperpodX The HyperpodX Team Oldenburg gave us insight in a very different approach of a big project.

As the inaugural iGEM team at Broad Run High School, and also as one of the first iGEM teams in the Loudoun County school district, our 2015 iGEM experience has been founded on multiple collaborations. Without these collaborations, we would not be at this place with our iGEM project; with a working part that met our design goals of removing undesired starch in industrial wastewater and attending the Jamboree so we could share and learn more about the complex wonders of synthetic biology!
Armstrong, Lancaster, PA
When we reached out to Armstrong as a potential sponsor, we began a partnership where first they learned more about what iGEM and synthetic biology can do to solve real world problems, and we learned of problems that plague industrial manufacturing as they adapt to become more environmentally responsible. With their sponsorship, we furthered our understanding of Armstrong's water problem; through skype meetings with our team including our mentors Dr. Schiefele and Dr. Burkett, emails exchanges and querries on their manufacturing plant and process, documentation, schematics, photos of the plant. We collaborated with Armstrong’s Mr. Paul Hough and Mr. Hoosier, the technical expert for the plant who took time away from his job to attended one of our skype meetings just so we could get a better handle of the starch problem in the water. We worked together during the design phase of our project with their input and feedback, crucial to our solution. During the testing phase of our project, we also worked with Armstrong for water samples. We have communicated our findings to them with images of our results and received positive feedback and support for future collaborative work to refine our synthetic biology approach leading to an implementable solution.
BUGSS, Baltimore Underground Science Space, Baltimore, MD
Even before we had formed a team, during that very early stage of trying to bring iGEM to our school, our school’s administration rightfully raised concerns about fulfilling the ethical and safety requirements for carrying out an iGEM project. Because of this and the fact that our school lab did not have the resources for an iGEM project, Marissa Sumathipala and Adriel"

Collaborations 1. Biosafety Biosafety education video in Chinese Biosafety is one of the most important issues everyone should be aware of before starting any biology related experiments.       However, the biosafety education in China is far behind the fast development of modern biological research. In       some places, students are not trained properly because of the outdated education material or the language barrier       that prevent them from reading biosafety guidelines written in English. We’ve participated in an intercollegiate collaborating project to produce a series of biosafety education movies,       all in Chinese. This video collection has been uploaded online and is freely available at our homepage on YouTube and Bilibili , a popular Chinese video-sharing website. Teams participated the production:

INSA Toulouse
Already in mid-June INSA Toulouse asked us to send a brick. From our own experience, we knew that ordering bricks from the registry could take some time. Therefore we helped out the team of INSA Toulouse by sending them the brick BBa_K145150 from the KU Leuven team of 2008.

Aachen,2016," of our protein had worked out and which parameters are needed to model the effects of the incoporation of our amino acid DMNB-serine.
The iGEM Team Technion did a lot of work when they tried to model our photocaged subtilisin E and to confirm the idea of inactivating our protease with the help of the unnatural amino acid DMNB-serine. In the beginning of their collaboration part the iGEM Team Technion met with Prof. Meytal Landau from the faculty of biology at the Technion. She gave them some useful information and hints about visualization software and how a protein could be modelled with the help of this software. Afterwards they tried to draw our photocaged aminio acid with the help of the software Chemdraw. Unfortunately they were not able to draw our amino acid because of its complex structure. So the iGEM Team Technion  contacted Einav Tayab-Fligelman with a request for assistance to draw our unnatural amino acid. In the next step the iGEM Team met with Dr. Fabian Glaser and asked him for assistance with the prediction of the final fold of the subtilisin and on how the folding process is influenced by our protease. He told the iGEM Team Technion, that it would be impossible to receive a credible result for the fold of our protease within the two months left in the iGEM project. Because of the time being the limiting factor, Dr. Glaser suggested to write a document, which describes the steps for an exhaustive computational work, including some insights from the comparison of the structures. The iGEM Team Technion sent us this document in the middle of September and because of this document we were able to assess the theoretical aspects of our project. Moreover members of the iGEM Team Technion created a 3D visualization of the subtilisin and the photocaged serine. In the document they included some scientific remarks of Dr. Fabian Glaser. In this context we want to thank the iGEM Team Technion, Prof. Meytal Landau and Dr. Glaser for all their support and their help in this collaboration. The document of the iGEM Team Technion and all their conversations with different experts from their university gave us a chance to confirm the theoretical idea of our project and recognize the influences of our photocaged amino acid in the folding process of subtilisin E. The counterpart of this collaboration can be seen on iGEM Technion Israel's wiki .

It was a pleasure to introduce them to the iGEM competition, help them with general lab questions, and talk about their project and research area. We also collaborated with the iGEM team Duesseldorf  in analyzing the sequence of a BioBrick. Throughout our project we had worldwide collaborations and met numerous teams. It was a pleasure to interact with so many people from various cities and countries and to talk about their and our experiences during iGEM and their projects as well as their and our lives at a university.
Highschool Team Rheda Bielefeld
The high school team Rheda Bielefeld is the first Bielefeld High School team which takes part in iGEM. As a first step in the iGEM competition, members of our team supervised and supported the team while participating in the InterLab study. We invited the team into our laboratory for three days and supervised them in the execution of the experiments. Unfortunately, the first time conducting the InterLab study resulted in unsatisfying results. Due to wrong results, we repeated the InterLab study experiments and ensured that they have matching results, which can be integrated in the overall result of the world wide InterLab study. Besides supporting the team in the InterLab study, we organized a workshop, introducing them to the basics of CSS and HTML as a preparation for a successful wiki.

Collaboration with Purdue Biomakers
Mentor-Mentee Relationship
To see the full feedback that we provided for the Purdue Biomakers, please visit Purdue's team Wiki!
Premise
The Iowa iGEM and Purdue Biomakers teams entered into a mentor-mentee relationship. In July 2017, we Skype called Purdue's iGEM team to discuss possible collaborations, seeking at first to find overlap between our projects. At the end of this Skype call, we quickly realized that the thing we needed help with most was actually getting some of our logistical targets off the ground. For example, we had no idea how to structure our organization (should we register as a student organization?) and we also were unfamiliar with the best training methods. How, in the start of the summer, could we bring all of our students up to speed? If we chose to create a formal course, what would be the best method to do so? Discussing these points proved crucial in navigating our first year as a team, and Purdue's shared materials and discussions helped us greatly.
Materials Received
After the initial Skype call, Purdue iGEM shared the following materials with us:
Purdue Constitution: details how Purdue's iGEM organization is structured and how roles are divided. Includes information on President, Vice President, Treasurer, Director of Club, Director of Science, Director of iGEM Team and Alumni Advisors, as well as their respective roles within the organization.
iGEM Internship Application: application form that interested members use to apply for the summer team. Includes detailed information on student eligibility requirements, time commitments, and what the internship provides. In return, it asks a series of questions that cover the applicant's interest in synthetic biology research, what sorts of projects they would propose, and what they hope to take away from the experience.
Learning Objectives for the Course: Purdue informed us that their faculty mentors offer an official synthetic biology course, while the students provide a sort of unofficial course, for new members. These are the learning objectives for the courses, which cover a High School Biology Review, How to conduct a review, Registry, team structure, systems biology, ethics, circuit design, plasmids and standard parts, genome modification, and common assays.

Berlin_diagnostX,2017," PCR reagents to the lab of iGEM IIT but it turned out that multinational companies like NEB, ThermoFisher and QIAGEN are unable to send a bill to Germany and to deliver the products to India. At this point iGEM IIT helped and bought the kits for Berlin diagnostX from a local reseller.
Jointly established RNA isolation pipeline at IIT:
After visiting physicians and villages in the area of Varanasi and meeting people affected by T. solium, Dimi and Henrik went to IIT Delhi to establish RNA isolation in the lab of iGEM IIT Delhi. Having the option to perform RNA isolation was crucial for diagnostX because the laboratories in Varanasi did not have the proper equipment for RNA isolation. The chances were high that isolation of RNA was necessary for export. The team from Delhi organised a student dorm for Henrik and Dimi to stay in and thus allowing them to work day and night on improving an RNA isolation protocol that ultimately yielded high quality RNA.
Championing international trade and safety regulations:
Once Dr. Mishra of the Heritage Institute for Medical Sciences received a tapeworm sample containing eggs from Taenia Solium and processed them, the Berlin Team had to transport the RNA-sample from India to Germany for sequencing. Due to a change in the Indian trade policy in June 2015, no company, hospital or physician could send samples abroad without obtaining an “Import Export Code”. Obtaining this code is bureaucratic and complicates taxation. For this reason, despite having the sample and a carrier with expertise in the field (World Courier, an AmerisourceBergen company), diagnostX was unable to transfer the sample to Germany. At this point iGEM IIT Delhi supported the Berlin team again by shipping the sample to IIT and subsequently exporting it with permission of the IIT. This shipping procedure took over two months and the joint effort of the Berlin and Delhi iGEM teams to complete but it was a key step to the transcriptome data and the sensor described by iGEM Berlin diagnostX.
The team TU Darmstadt contacted the team Berlin diagnostX in search of background information on wound care and healing for their project. Since the body of the team Berlin is made up of medical students it was delighted to help.
During an initial Skype meeting both teams talked about their ideas and plans for the iGEM competition and gave each other helpful feedback. When the conversation fell on wound care and  healing the Team Berlin reinforced its willingness to share knowledge gained in medical school and to consult experts to answer the special questions"

This year we worked with the prestigious Korean University. Collaborations are an important part of fulfilling the IGEM mission: “to cultivate, support, and grow the community of passionate students, professors and advisors who have participated in the iGEM competition. By building upon the international base of the iGEM competition, the community connects participants and alumni across the world, to engage in dialogue and collaboration.” This affiliation allowed us to fulfil this mission.
Their project consists of using a microbe as a disease testing machine. It would allow the one taking the pill to know if they have a disease such as colon cancer by showing fluorescents in human excrement. It has the potential to save time, energy, and even lives.
We held meetings through skype and kept in contact constantly since our first meeting that took place August 14th. We discussed project scheduling, wiki management, part submission and some other fulfilments for medal criteria. Throughout this time, we were able to provide them with __as they were very generous to provide us with their expertise in the subject since they are a much more experienced team.
Their assistance and advice had a strong impact on our project. We are thankful for this opportunity.

University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM Team
We have been working with the University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM Team on the curriculum development aspects involved in both of our projects. Their project focuses on producing a cell-free system that would be used as a teaching tool in high schools. As both of our teams need research completed on curriculum development, collaboration is the perfect idea. Research done by both teams was shared with each other. For example, a team member from the Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM Team interviewed a group of science teachers from Winston Churchill High School for further opinions and suggestions on integrating another scientific component to the curriculum. This interview expanded to include a member from our team as well. Members of our team also reviewed the education modules that they developed. Another aspect in this collaboration includes having our team act as a practice audience for a project presentation from the collegiate team, to evaluate our level of understanding of their project. Their team also attended meetings of ours to provide feedback on our presentation prior to two competitions this season. In addition to this, members of their team have been mentoring us in lab work, and coding, and have also provided general guidance during team meetings as advisers to the team.  Their team also tested our melanin construct (BBa_ K281401) using the PURExpress system to see if it could be successfully produced. This helped provide further characterization of the part. As the collegiate iGEM Team's project focuses on creating a cell-free system, their system should be able to produce pigment as well.

German Meetup
As this years Marburg iGEM Team 2018 had the honor to continue the tradition of our predecessors to host the german iGEM Meetup. The meeting was established to exchange experiences earned while participating in the competition as well as getting feedback about our projects from people with a fresh perspective.
People discussing at posters
Marburg is not only at the heart of Germany, but also a very charming city with a rich academic tradition while balancing at the cutting edge of Science.    On Friday the 22th, the teams started arriving in Marburg, where our city's campground had been booked for the meetup. Quickly, the tents were set up and everyone settled in. After giving out some welcome gifts, a tour of the old town was undertaken. Small groups of iGEMees were led by a member of Marburg’s team to discover some hidden gems in the narrow alleyways between the medieval buildings.
The Marburg iGEM Team proudly presenting the meetups schedule
The next day, Saturday, started with a breakfast buffet at the great auditorium, followed by speakers from the German association of synthetic biology (GASB), crystals first, a startup, and Rüdiger Trojok, a well-known member of Germanys growing biohacker scene.   To sharpen our presentation skills as well as getting fresh impulses and new directions beyond the current state of the projects, the participating teams brought posters with an outline of their work and preliminary results. All teams decided on interesting projects covering a wide range of topics, and presented those convincingly, resulting in a very stimulating atmosphere for all iGEMees.   We want to thank all the people who came to our little town and made this weekend the great experience it was. We want to thank the teams from Bielefeld , Düsseldorf , Hamburg , Erlangen , Darmstadt , Würzburg , Aachen , Hamm Lippstadt , München , Tübingen , Stuttgart , Göttingen and our visitor from Taiwan for attending!

This summer, we met TAS_Taipei when we were participating the Asia Pacific iGEM conference raised by NCTU_Formosa. we are currently working on an improvement of the reprocessed paper manufacturing process. we had found the process “flotation” could cause severe paper fiber lost, which is a big problem for preserving paper fibers. After we saw TAS_Taipei presentation of how biofilm could attract nano gold particles, they were excited about whether the biofilm could absorb ink particles. Their idea might give the potential of replacing current flotation process which would cause paper fiber lost and chemical pollution. We had discuss for collaboration of improving the process. They had test the biofilm absorption of ink particles provided by our project built up protocols.
To sum up, our experiment shows the potential of attracting ink particles. That is, in future imagination, biofilm could be the candidate material for replacing the current method.
We helped TAS_Taipei independently verify that overexpression of OmpR234 (BBa_K2229200) produces more biofilms than control (BBa_K342003)
(caption) Figure 3-19: A) Our experiment results showed that E. coli overexpressing OmpR234(BBa_K2229200) is producing more biofilm than a control which does not overexpress OmpR234(BBa_K342003). B) CGU_Taiwan independently tested our constructs using crystal violet, a dye commonly used to quantify biofilm formation. BBa_K2229200 showed higher absorbance compared to the control BBa_K342003, reflecting a the formation of more biofilm, which matches our results."

iGEM Collaboration
This year, Cornell iGEM has collaborated with Yale iGEM by engaging in the team’s discussion about utilizing non-model organisms as part of projects and research.  This dialogue was to address the increasing amount of iGEM projects that have centered around these non-model organisms rather than Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Yale iGEM identified our project team as one that was using a non-model organism as part of our project, and have thus asked us to share our experiences working with our non-model organism.  We were more than happy to discuss our experiences of working with Flavobacterium psychrophilum , our bacteria of interest that we were trying to tackle with fishPHARM.
We discussed with Yale iGEM the troubles we had in terms of finding necessary information from scientific journals.  Another primary obstacle we discussed was growth rate - F. psychrophilum required a much longer incubation time (48-72 hours) before it could be usable in testing[1].  Furthermore, since F. psychrophilum is most active at 16℃ and below, both as a pathogen and in growth, it was necessary to work under these conditions for optimal activity[1].  Luckily, we were able to collaborate with a professor on Cornell campus who had worked with F. psychrophilum and was able to provide us much needed insight into the organism.  In collaborating with Yale iGEM, we share their sentiments in the hopes that future iGEM teams will be able to utilize a greater variety of non-model organisms for their projects based off of the challenges we encountered.

Manchester,2017," plan to start your business, does not have additional restrictions. You should contact the competent authority operating in your country before you commit any capital.
Prior to any use of a GMM, a business must first obtain a licence from the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator. This process involves providing detailed information about the host, donor, transferred DNA, properties of the GMM and where it will be grown. A formal risk assessment is then carried out by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator who then make a decision as to whether a licence will be granted.
In order to use a GMM in your business, one needs to fulfill numerous requirements. The development of any GMM must be monitored by the CTNBio and the regulatory agencies. If your company is going to start working with GMM, the first step is getting the Certified of Biosafety by CTNBio and create an internal committee of biosafety. Then, you need the approval by the regulatory agency (e.g. Anvisa for human purposes and the MAPA for agriculture purposes). You are going to need to fulfill a lot of requirements in order to get the registry and the permission to develop your research in your lab.
For agriculture purposes, once you have finished your research inside the lab, the CTNBio will evaluate it and emit a position paper that will allow you to do a planned and controlled release. To do that, you are going to need to fulfill the requirements of the Normative Resolution n. 6 of November 6th, 2008.
For medical purposes, once you finished your research inside the lab, you are going to need to ask Anvisa for a registry of biological medication and you are going to need to fulfill all of the requirements stared in the Resolution n. 55 of December 16th, 2010.
Once your product is registered and approved by CTNBio and MAPA or Anvisa, you will be able to release and/or commercialise it.
It is forbidden to commercialise GMOs, the only way to establish a business with them is to export seeds. This is only allowed once an environmental impact study regulated by the National Service of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) has been undertaken.
Approval process for commercial release of GMOs:
1. Initially, the company developing the GMOs undertakes several biosafety assessments including, environmental, food, and feed safety assessments in containment.
2. This is followed by Bio-safety Research Trials which require prior approval of the regulators, the GEAC and the RCGM.

Lambert_GA,2017," teams to grasp the overall purpose of each other’s projects.  Lambert used this ethics conference as a springboard for their own investigations into ethics.  As a result the team developed a simple flowchart for the synthetic biologists to use when considering the ethics of their own projects. Members of the team also attended a Business Ethics Experience held by the University of North Georgia.
Lambert High School: Engineering and MSA
The Chrome-Q prototypes designed by the team were 3-D printed by the Lambert High School Engineering department. The final Chrome-Q prototype was ordered from Shapeways.  The engineering department printed the 3-D fuge designs obtained from the Prakash Lab from their Paperfuge project. An engineering student at Lambert High School, Sahil Jain, modified one of the 3-D fuge designs to improve ease of usability. This final model was used to process cells for the final data collection.
iGEM Twitter Group
Thanks to Twitter, iGEM teams from all over the world are in a group chat where they can easily communicate and ask questions about iGEM, Jamboree, wiki, and much more! iGEM teams have easy access to other teams and can ask questions about their projects, send out surveys, or promote their apps/programs through this platform. A great and fun way to collaborate!
Chrome-Q
Lambert iGEM will continue to use the Chrome-Q instead of an expensive plate readers. Regardless of the project, the team will use chromoproteins as a reporter of the genetic sequences. As Lambert iGEM develops future projects, the team will improve the structure of the Chrome-Q. To add, the software will be further developed to be able to distinguish more color variations. To summarize, Lambert iGEM will expand the use of the Chrome-Q and app to accommodate the future projects.
Future Collaborations
The Lambert iGEM will continue to improve the 2017 project. They will collaborate with microbiologists at Emory and CDC, so the team can improve the genetic constructs that were not able to function. To add, they will continue to talk with Gibson Ridge Software to finish the app. Lastly, it is a goal of the Lambert iGEM team to send out the Chrome-Q to numerous labs. Dr. Dana Boyd Barr has shown interest in using the hardware for her labs in Thailand, Rwanda, and Peru."

Lambert High School
On July 14th, our iGEM team hosted a collaboration on Georgia Tech’s campus with the Lambert High School iGEM team. In the morning, the Lambert High School students presented their project to us. Afterwards, we had a discussion about their project and gave them a lot of suggestions about how to proceed with the final few weeks before their fall semester began again.
To summarize their project, they wanted to develop a product that could be used to detect early stages of bacterial infections in farmers’ crops by employing a fluorescent green fluorescent protein (GFP) indicator tag. Their project consisted of three components. First, they wanted to use a CRISPR/Cas 9 system to detect the infectious bacteria. The system would involve a strand of guide RNA (gRNA), complementary to a gene unique to the bacteria, so it would be able to identify the presence of the bacteria and signal the CRISPR to cut the DNA of the bacteria. During the subsequent DNA repair stage, a GFP indicator gene would be incorporated  through a “knocked-in”. The second part of their project addressed the characterization of the GFP-labeled crops. They wanted to visualize of the fluorescent indicators from the GFP knock-in using a modified version of Foldscope microscopy, a more affordable imaging technique that would be accessible to high school students. The third part of their project involved expressing chitosan deacetylase (CDA) in E. coli. Since CDA is toxic to E. coli, they designed a plasmid with promoters, RBSs, GFP, Pelb, and CDA genes on ApE software and asked for our suggestions before they order the gene from IDT.
After listening to their project proposal, We also suggested that they focus the next 8 weeks of their project on only the CDA system, since the CRISPR/Cas 9 system is more difficult to work with. As shown below, we proposed three different constructs for the CDA vector that would express both the CDA and Pelb genes.
Our suggested constructs are as follows:
An bicistronic system with ORFs going in the same direction
A fusion protein headed for the periplasm
A bidirectional system with 2 ORFs that would go in opposite directions"

Collaborate with BIT-China
This year we communicated with team BIT-China, helping each other at several aspects.
BNU-CHINA for BIT-China
1.  We assisted BIT-China with their modeling
It's our pleasure to assist team BIT-China with their modeling part. We mainly help them to establish a model of substance changes during the pH regulation stage. Specifically, we build a model to link six chemical reactions together, all of which are controlled by pH switch. There is only one chemical reaction with a specific pH, and with the pH changing, the chemical reaction will change subsequently, which makes the pH range from 5 to 7 smoothly. They prove us the conditions and equations of each chemical reaction stage, and we are responsible for the realization of the procedure during the entire process.
The difficulty that BIT-China meets is how to connect the six groups of chemical reactions together with the pH switch to find out the reaction time and the results of each chemical reaction, in order to draw a image to reflect the pH variation trend with time. Because some of our team members are majoring in physics, math, computer science and chemistry, we have plenty experience in the solution of differential equations, application of MATLAB and design of procedure. With these resources, we have helped them solve their problems successfully.
The differential reaction equations of the chemical reactions are as follows:

Cell Culturing Microfluidic | July - September 2017 | Harvard iGEM
This collaboration between the BostonU Hardware Team and the Harvard iGEM team was based around engineering a microfluidic system to culture cell and measure the resulting cell growth.   Each team was responsible for separate parts of the system.  The BostonU Hardware Team primarily worked on the design, manufacturing, and testing of the microfluidic device. The Harvard iGEM team primarily worked on an optical density sensor which was aimed to measure cell growth. Even though each team focused on individual parts of the system collaboration was imperative to test and develop each teams work.
Stage 1
The initial stage of the collaboration focused on outlining the goals we wanted to achieve from the collaboration. This meeting occurred over the summer after initial interest was sparked after hearing about each other's work at a local conference. The Harvard iGEM team had initially wanted to design the chip in order to do culture fiber producing cells.  After looking over the initial designs that the Harvard team produced, both teams agreed that more literature review was needed to redesign a new microfluidic chip.
Stage 2
After reviewing different cell culturing microfluidics devices, we had come across a microfluidic chemostat and turbidostat which matched the same functionality that both teams were looking to achieve. The teams agreed that this design was able to be manufactured and suitable for performing the cell culturing experiment.
The two main challenges that were involved with replicating the microfluidic chip were designing the microfluidic device and manufacturing the PDMS membrane with the proper thickness. An initial chip was designed by the BostonU Hardware team using circular chambers. After performing several tests, it was determined that the paper’s original design would be more suitable. The next step was to obtain the proper PDMS. The PDMS membrane needed to be extremely thin (75um thickness) in order to be actuated the full depth of the chamber. This prompted the BostonU Hardware team to learn how to spin coat PDMS in order to obtain the precise thickness. There was varied success in the beginning, but eventually we were able to get a consistent result."

""Should We Edit the Genome?"" Forum Collaboration with Duke University
The Building With Biology tools and information have been utilized by many for its unique approach to teaching and spreading information about Synthetic Biology.
We reached out to Duke University iGem and together, we organized a forum using tools from Building With Biology. At the forum, we discussed a rather relevant and hotly-debated subject: Should We Edit the Genome? When, Why, and How Much? .
CRISPR refers to gene editing techniques that can cut and edit DNA at precise locations. With these systems, researchers can permanently modify cells and in the future, may be able to correct mutations in the human genome to treat different diseases. CRISPR uses the Cas9 enzyme to cut DNA strands, and can be matched with ""guide"" RNA (or gRNA) strands that can lead them to the target sections of DNA.
Although our project does not specifically utilize CRISPR technologies, we understood the significance of this new technology and its applications. Through this forum, we were able to gain a more complete understanding of CRISPR technology and the ethical and societal implications of its use.
The program for this forum was as follows:
- 10 minutes: Introduction and welcome from Duke University professor about CRISPR technologies.
- 10 minutes: Background Information
- “What is CRISPR”? 90 second video by Carl Zimmerman.
- 50 minutes: Read through and discuss applications of CRISPR technologies, and ultimately decide whether or not to implement the application, and restrictions on the application.
We were delighted to facilitate this discussion and hear the opinions of the public on the societal and ethical impacts of using CRISPR technologies. A common opinion that was voiced throughout the forum was that at this time, gene editing should not be used for clinical reproductive purposes, especially because the risk cannot be justified by the possible benefits. Many countries have passed legislation banning the genetic modification of the hunan genome, but in 2016, the United Kingdom licensed the use of CRISPR on embryos. When we touched on this, the general consensus was that this decision could push science to uncharted territories, including ""designer babies"". This opened up some discussion about the ethically gray areas that are expanding with every advancement made in science.
Topics relating CRISPR we discussed at the forum included the difference between therapy"

Northeastern iGEM Team Meetup (NEGEM)
In collaboration with the BostonU Hardware team, BostonU hosted the Northeastern iGEM Team Meetup, or NEGEM, on July 6th at Boston University. The five teams in attendance (BostonU, BostonU Hardware, MIT, Harvard, and UConn) all made Jamboree-style presentations, with 20 minutes to present and 10 minute question and answer sessions. In addition, all teams received feedback forms from every individual in attendance for teams to see how well their audience understood their project and how they could improve. NEGEM was insightful for old and new teams alike. For instance, we provided substantial feedback and guidance for UConn, a new iGEM team. Overall, NEGEM was successful in giving teams feedback at the third of the way point of the competition. After our meetup, we collected responses from the teams to gain insight on how the meetup could have been run more efficiently or been more effective for participating teams. Although improvements could be made (for instance, lunch arrived late which slightly set us back in our planned schedule), we believe that NEGEM ran smoothly. We hope that future BostonU teams continue to host NEGEM and will use the feedback we received.
Take a look at the feedback forms that the audience filled out for each team's presentation!
Nair Lab at Tufts University
We aimed to incorporate our two light inducible systems, LOV2 and PhiReX, into the xylose isomerase pathway to produce ethanol from cellulose. Our plan to accomplish this was to toggle between growth (high fitness, low ethanol production) and production phases (low fitness, high ethanol production) with the use of our light inducible systems to efficiently convert cellulose into biofuel. Venkatesh Gopinarayanan at the Nair Lab at Tufts University kindly gave us a high XYL-REG strain and DNA. His strain allows for high fitness on xylose, which would have been a prime strain to integrate our promoter systems into. Unfortunately, we did not have the time to use the XYL-REG strain with our systems, but we hope to do so in the future!

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,". Thus, verification of the function of our orthogonal peroxisomal protein import machinery was feasible. We therefore accomplished to transfer our artificial Pex5 ‘artico’-receptor including our modified binding pocket region recognizing our modelled PTS1 peptide (PTS1*). When fused to the fluorescent marker protein mTurquoise, our artificial Pex5 facilitates peroxisomal import of the mTurquoise-PTS1* fusion protein indicated by 3D-Sim microscopy.
In return to the help we received from team Aachen we were able to provide them with different plasmids to significantly improve their final project. In the beginning of our collaboration with team Aachen we heard about their problems with building optimized yeast plasmids. For that reason, we introduced them to the yeast toolbox we used which enables the possibility to simplify the process of engineering yeast by creating completely designed plasmids facilitating optimal gene expression and translation for particular purposes in S. cerevisiae. With our golden gate cloning assembly, we designed four different plasmids enabling testing of different promoter strengths for a chloride channel from Arabidopsis thaliana (ATCLCc). We successfully built three yeast optimized plasmids containing the ATCLCc gene with different promotors (Gal1, Sac6, RPL18B) and a fourth plasmid for genome integration containing URA 3’ and 5’ homologies. Correctness of each plasmid was verified by performing restriction digests and sanger sequencing, respectively.
Once we finished the cloning and verification of each plasmid we gave them to team Aachen, allowing them to improve their project results significantly by providing the availability of another vacuolar anion transporter. Thanks to our effort, iGEM Aachen was able to utilize this chloride channel in their yeast based system used for water preparation properly.
Optogenetics seminar
Optogenetics offers high spatiotemporal control of well defined events within living cells and therefore qualifies for a broad range of synthetic biological applications. Duesseldorf's last team successfully used optogenetics to induce apoptosis in cancer cells and given that experience, we decided to arrange an optogenetics seminar to share our knowledge with other teams. With that, we hope to reach as many iGEM teams as possible in order to provide essentials in performance of optogenetic experiments. Additionally, we wanted to extend our iGEM teams “toolbox” with one more tool of control.
Our offer found international approval by the teams of Darmstadt , Heidelberg , Paris and Taiwan . Since the teams of Paris and Taiwan could not attend the seminar"

Providing us with our dual host vector - as parts for cyanobacteria are rather limited in the registry we turned to one of the Imperial labs for help with the vector for this transformation. We were pointed in the direction of Pauli Kallio from the University of Turku, Finland (their collaborator), who gave us permission to use their vector. The Imperial team then promptly provided us with it.
Blue box for gel examination - given our struggles with our own electrophoresis kit(our dye was not specific enough), the Imperial team lent us their spare BlueBox so that we could start using SybrSafe dye, producing far better results and allowing our project to move forwards.
Competent cells - as a school we have no access to a freezer where we could keep chemically competent cells, but thankfully the Imperial team very kindly shared theirs as well as their facilities for us to perform transformations. They also taught us about safely transporting microbial plates across town.
GoCulture Game - we have been testing Imperial team's computer game, both within our team and with younger pupils. We met up with them in order for them to see some students playing the game and for us to give them the feedback that they needed.

Finally, NYMU has been extremely supportive in our modeling efforts. They taught us how to search for literature values for our diffusion, bandage, and ACT inhibition models. Furthermore, they also helped debug our models after we completed them.
TAS -> NYMU
In addition to NYMU’s help on our project, we also collaborated with NYMU
In return of their collaboration efforts, we provided NYMU with the LuxR part which is essential for their oscillator to function. They utilize LuxR in their oscillator to report an alternating current as a signal for the detection of a malicious spore species.
In addition to providing them with the LuxR part, we were also able to help run their initial experiments for the microbial fuel cell prototype (image on right). The initial test results from their prototype helped determine the correct soil to water to bacteria ratios for optimum performance (August 2015).
Last but not least, three members from TAS (Alvin, Fiona and Huiru) are members on both NYMU and TAS teams. They learned the cloning cycle from TAS and helped run experiments for NYMU during the summer. In Boston, they will also help NYMU present their project at the Giant Jamboree!"

Collaboration with AHUT-China
This year, our iGEM team developed cooperative relationship with the AHUT-China team, the iGEM team from Anhui University of Technology. We have reached an agreement to help each other check the model.
We first checked the feasibility of the models and analyzed their feasibility. Then, we improved these models. The AHUT-China team helped us test our translation software to identify any bug and provided us helpful suggestions. See more details (AHUT-China) .
Collaboration with UESTC-China
Our iGEM team also developed cooperation with the UESTC-China team, the iGEM team from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. We have reached an agreement of helping examine the effectiveness of DNA carriers.
First, we cloned EGFP cDNA from pEGFPN2 vector using primers containing NheI and BamHI. Second, we used EcoRI and NheI to cut pesc-trp plasmid, and then inserted the EGFP coding region and the FUS1 promoter into pesc-trp plasmid to construct pFUS1-EGFP carrier. UESTC-China used EcoRI and NheI to digest the pFUS1-EGFP carrier, and helped us to verify the DNA sequence of this plasmid. And we also help them verify the validity of the plasmid containing GroES gene. We digested the plasmid with BamH I-Vsp I and Bcu I-Vsp I to verify the validity of the plasmid. After digestion, the results they wanted to see were obtained"

Collaboration with iGEM Toulouse
We met the  iGEM Toulouse Team during an “iGEM France” meeting. We were intrigued by their project aim of functionalizing cellulose and, assisted by the short transit time between cities, decided to spark a collaboration. The first meeting was in Montpellier in July where we had a brainstorming session followed by an exchange of war stories of difficult first steps in the lab.
Some of their team members had prior experience and helped lead us to useful software programs or general project organizational strategies. Throughout the summer we maintained an open pipeline of communication, sharing experimental difficulties and insights between teams.
Over the course of our brainstorming sessions, we realized that there were two interesting, mutually beneficial potential collaborations between our two projects. The first idea focused on using LL-37, one of the peptides with which we were working, as a functionalizable target for Cerberus, the multi-functionalizable cellulose-binding motif of the iGEM Toulouse team. The second idea was to test the biological activity of scygonadine, on the vaginal flora, as the iGEM Toulouse team was investigating its use in a potential anti-toxic shock tampon.
The goal of the first one is to fix a LL-37 a peptide used in iGEM Montpellier project to Cerberus the protein synthesize by iGEM Toulouse (Figure 1). The goal is to prove the versatility of the Cerberus protein and to integrated in the “filter” project to prevent dissemination.
Figure 1: Cerberus protein binded to LL-37 peptide.
The goal of the second experiment is to prove the biological activity of scygonadine on the vaginal flora as a concept of this part of the project was to design an anti toxic shock tampon.
Toulouse team was supposed to focus on the first experiment and our team on the second (Figure 2). Some experiments begun but time was missing for the completion of the two collaborative projects.

Finally, we put an effort to create a joint fundraising project for"
UCAS,2017,"100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

NUS_Singapore-A,2018," In fact, we were all so excited about the meet-up that we planned an engaging day of activities for our fellow iGEM-ers!
Firstly, we invited them to the BioMakerSpace, which is where our NUSGEM team carries out most of our experiments. At the BioMakerSpace, we brought them on a lab tour, which culminated in a fruitful sharing session on our projects, where we even exchanged solutions on the problems we faced. After the laboratory tour, we brought them on a NUS campus tour, visiting the various libraries (there are more than 6!) in our school, as well as the biofoundry in SynCTI (Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation).
The two teams had a great time interacting with each other and we can’t wait to see each other again in the Jamboree!

OTHER INTERACTIONS!
Other potential collaborations were discussed over Skype sessions with Team Michigan State, Team US AFRL CarrollHS, Team Newcastle, Team TUDelft, as well as Team Uppsala. We shared and discussed ideas about genetic circuit designs, modelling, human practices, fund-raising. We were happy to chat and make friends all over the world, and we were so happy to finally see one another at the Giant Jamboree!

HEAR OUR STORY
We’re using synthetic biology to change the way the world thinks and functions.
We’re a little disruptive, dangerous and maybe a tad too bold. But the world needs some shaking up every now and then, and we think we’re just the right people for that.
Together we’re going to engineer biology and create something awesome.

University of Aachen
We worked with the University of Aachen, Germany on a collaboration that was focused mainly on human practices. Their project, similar to ours, centers around the depleting access of clean drinking water to people around the world. Unlike our project, which focused on lead contamination, Team Aachen focused on salt contamination in drinking water. Our collaboration was sparked due to mutual interest in how our project inspirations affected other countries around the world. In our collaboration, Team WPI researched salt contamination in the United States. We explored where and why salt contamination was a problem along with how it impacts citizens of the United States. In exchange, Team Aachen researched and translated information on lead contamination in Germany. From this information, we learned about the political policies that have lead to the country's overall lack of lead contamination in their drinking water. This information further helped us develop the Human Practices component of our project by giving us a global picture and broader understanding of what causes lead contamination in water as well as a system to look toward when developing a set of policies to lessen contamination.
Boston University: Hardware
We worked with Boston University Hardware to begin developing a microfluidic chip that could be used to increase the accuracy and efficiency of our gold-nanoparticle lead detection assay. Boston University’s project is focused on improving the ease and ability of developing and building microfluidic chips without the need of a middle man. Our project’s Lead Assay had several components that BU’s Hardware Team was hoping to improve in microfluidic chips. It was an ideal collaboration because making the lead assay automated would improve its accuracy, and it would challenge BU’s team.
Over the course of the collaboration, members of WPI iGEM traveled to BU Hardware iGEM’s lab in order to test the reproducibility of our lead assay with a different set of equipment. This experiment allowed both teams to understand what aspects of the assay are susceptible to change and should therefore be optimized in the final product. Our team ended up realizing that the assay was not appropriate for our project, but we still worked with BU’s Hardware Team to see if it could be automated.
The BU Team"
British_Columbia,2016," this was a great year for hearing the experiences the international iGEM community. We heard a lot of interesting stories and a lot of great experiences are and really hoping that others in them iGEM community were able to hear ours. We hope to see those of you that collaborated with us at the Giant Jamboree and are able to build lasting networks between iGEM and the international community.

This year is the first time for Jiangnan team to participate in the iGEM competition. Therefore, we know the importance of cooperation and communication with the external world. We have established cooperation with the outside world in many ways, including academic exchange, biosafety disscussion, industrial production, and human practice. These interactions are of great significance to the smooth progression of our projects.
Academic collaboration
Collaboration with UESTC-China
This year, UESTC-China aims at using a biofunctional enzyme, xyn10D-fae1A, to directly break down the lignin-polysaccharide crosslink between straws and convert them into useful chemical materials.
They introduced a group of cellulases (cex, cenA, xyl3A) to convert the cellulose produced by straw degradation into glucose, and then designed two pathways to ferment glucose to produce butanol and hydrogen, respectively.
However, there is a problem that when the conventional Escherichia coli BW25113 is used as a chassis organism for butanol fermentation, the yield is very low, so they hope to replace the chassis cells to try to increase the yield of butanol.
Through the discussions between our two teams, we offered UESTC-China our Escherichia coli B0016-050 from our laboratory as a new chassis cell and we hope that it could help them further increase the yield of butanol.

Dundee team
We worked side by side with the Dundee collegiate team on our respective projects over the summer holidays. They were an incredible help, and by working on separate yet similar projects at the same time, we have all achieved much more than we ever could have alone; every step of the way we have been providing each other feedback and advice in order to develop wikis, presentations, surveys, graphic design and our projects as a whole. This was invaluable for both teams as it meant things were constantly being approached from multiple angles and viewpoints, allowing us to very quickly develop and move forward with our projects.
iGEM Northern UK Meet-up
We met up with the Edinburgh UG, Edinburgh OG, Glasgow, Dundee and Newcastle teams in Edinburgh for the day, where we presented our project. This was an excellent opportunity as it provided us with lots of fantastic feedback, as well as the chance to meet and chat with all the teams from Scotland (as well as one from England).
iGEM UK Meet-up
As part of our collaboration with many UK iGEM teams, we attended a meet-up hosted by the University of Westminster team in London. This meet-up allowed us to prepare ourselves and see what the Jamboree would be like as we had a poster session and a presentation slot. We received feedback on both, which allowed us to further improve on them. We were also asked some questions like “How are you going to make the RNA specific to the target bacterium?” which we were able to further elaborate on. Doing the presentation also allowed us to gain confidence because of the large audience, a big help for when Boston comes around.

Inspiring the Public at World Maker Faire with ColumbiaNYC iGEM
On September 23rd and 24th, our iGEM Team was able to host a booth at the NYC World Maker Faire, a family-festival/science-fair where the public was invited to learn more and interact with the future of science and engineering. We invited Columbia NYC iGEM to our booth to present their project alongside ours and assist in our Fruit DNA Extraction activity. Children became “scientists,” using household chemicals to visualize clumps of fruit DNA and learning how to pipette their DNA solution into microcentrifuge tubes, which they brought home as a necklace or bracelet. For this activity, we asked Columbia iGEM to bring some supplies, such as additional fruit and sandwich bags, as well as manpower (the kids tended to come in packs).

Controls of E. coli wild type (A) and LB media (H) were used to detect background fluorescence. The data shows that all the expression systems we created (B-E) show higher levels of fluorescence than the controls. This indicates that an expression of GFP.

Incubation time was extended: E. coli BL21 wild type (A), sample 2 (B), sample 5 (C), sample 7 (D), sample 15 (E), LB medium (F).Controls of E. coli Wildtype (A) and LB medium (F) were taken to detect the background fluorescence. The data shows that all expression systems we created (B-E) show higher values for fluorescence than the controls. This indicates that GFP is expressed.
After the successful detection of a fluorescence signal, we wanted to determine the position of the Tar receptor by studying the localizaion of the GFP protein. Under the fluorescence microscope we compared one negative control of untransformed E. coli BL21 cells and the samples with the strongest fluorescence measured in the Tecan Plate Reader. The difference between these samples was also visible with this device. Moreover, the fluorescence could be localized in the poles of the E. coli cells in some cases via the microscope. That means that our expression system worked and the proteins are functional. But there were also many colonies that did not have the fluorescence signal at the poles, which could be either caused by a misfolded Tar receptor or just due to statistical variation.

For example, their use of genetic engineering techniques are not skilled, so we helped them in the field we familiar such as selecting the clone and assembling the plasmid.
What’s more, we helped them about the adaption between mediawiki platforms with html. We pointed an important mistake for them, which made them avoid adding a wrong part and told us many things about the part shipping. They completed the part submission form with our assistance. We helped to choose the suitable Part ID and told them how to fill in the Registry.

The collaboration with SZU
What SZU-iGEM have done this year was to create an anti-bladder-cancer-cell system which is regulated by an AND GATE. What we had promoted was to put the effector gene Renilla Luciferase to replace Firefly Luciferase in the third plasmid which has the strong constitutive promoter SV40. The remould was supposed to increase the security of the AND GATE and the expression degree of the system, and together the influence of the orthogonal system to the project system.
1. Security testing
After transforming the three plasmids system into T24 cells for many times, the result of expression examination showed the system had a nice security degree. Compared to the two plasmid system in Hela cervical cancer cells, the expression of the three plasmid system in the control group without Ack has the same level. While the expression of the three plasmid system is expected to improve the expression of the project system when the Ask exists, the examination showed that our remould has no effect on the security of the system.
2. Effect testing
2.1. Examining by Rlu
Comparing with the expression of the group without Ack, adding Ack has reached more than 7 times. It shows that the effect of orthogonal system on the whole system has been improved. In addition, the average expression of adding Ack experimental group has reached 790.5, and in others successful transfection experiments, the highest number of test results have reached 1000. All the data indicated that expression amount of the system has enhanced a lot after the remould.

1. Hold the 5th iGEM Central China Regional Conference
From July 10th to 11th, 2018, the iGEM HUST-China team successfully held the 5th iGEM Central China Regional Conference. The event aimed at promoting the understanding of each team in their competition projects, improving the project content, and giving opportunities for communication and mutual learning between different teams. The teams invited to participate in the conference were the 2018 iGEM team HZAU-China, NCTU-Formosa, WHU-China, NCHU and HUST-China. At the meeting on July 11th, each team will make a 20-minute English presentation time to introduce the project content and current progress of their competition projects, while other teams listened cand raised questions and shared their opinions. Each team presented a number of constructive issues related to project feasibility, safety, experimental protocols, modeling methods, economic costs and application prospects. During the period, delegates also had a lively and in-depth discussion on some of these issues. Many of the questions and suggestions raised in the conference have effectively pointed out the possible disappointments of the project and provided feasible solutions to these problems. We exchanged thoughts and built a sincere friendship in this meeting which laid a foundation for the communication and cooperation. Besides, we helped WHU-China and HZAU-China to cryodesiccate the samples with 96-well plates and send them to Nanjing together when we were submitting the parts.
2. Participating in CCIC
The CCiC Conference is an academic conference launched by Chinese iGEMers. Its purpose is to promote the development of synthetic biology in China. In the 5th CCiC, our team worked as an organizer in the initial preparation of CCiC. During the meeting, we invited professors major in synthetic biology to communicate with iGEMers. We listened to lectures from top scholars in synthetic biology and gained a clearer understanding of the meaning of synthetic biology and its practical applications. In addition, we also introduced our project to other iG"
Toulouse,2015,"ehives by Varroa destructor was reported, resulting in a critical danger for the colonies and economical damage for the beekeepers. The Turk beekeepers seem to be more affected on an economical level than French beekeepers, but they are unanimous on the fact that the preventive measures they can use are of a limited efficiency and that even the chemical treatments are sometimes not sufficient to eradicate the parasite.
It is clear from this survey in both countries that beekepers are in deep need of a solution that is more ecological and respectful of the bees.
TU Eindhoven team - Cloning guide
To help out future iGEM teams, the Eindhoven team decided to create a cloning guide where each current technique would be explained by an iGEM team. We chose to deal with the In-Fusion cloning technique because one of us, Alexandre, used this technique several times during a previous internship. Moreover, we used this technique to clone together genes used to express the light sensor for the circadian cycle.

The survey was translated into six version of questionnaire,Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, French, Portuguese, German, English, the iGEM teams has help us to collect the data from their place to live.We are Organizer of this survey.
  From the question, food product is the most us unacceptable for people to be choose. The reason may cause by the unknown of risk that genetically modified food bright out. The unclear messages make people afraid of this kind of product. Thus, we need to tell them the widen usage nowadays. There is nothing to be scare because it already became part of our life. Of course, after understanding it, it’s their choices to have GMO as food or not. But before that, it’s our duty to make sure people know how synthetic biology has gradually changed our lives.
Also, from the survey we found out that the problem of not knowing oral cancer well enough is worldwide.
The best therapy of cancer isn’t medical treatments but prevention. How can people prevent it from happening, since they don’t know much about oral cancer? Therefore, our project included health education to raise the awareness and desire to change the circumstance.
There are people enjoy chewing betel nuts, but do they fully understand the risks of doing so? We doubt it. So the future of oral cancer health education we would like to go directly them and show them the potential problem so that they can decide whether to quite it or not.
This large scale survey told us how people think about synthetic biology and oral cancer. We can see our project in worldwide angle and start to change the world little by little.

Collaborations
Here at the UCLA iGEM Team, we firmly believe that the basis of all progress is teamwork and collaboration. This year, we have formed a number of collaborations with not only local California teams, but teams across the world. We hope through our collaborations that our impact and influence on the iGEM and synthetic biology community worldwide will lead to great advancements and success in the field of science.
Second Annual Southern California iGEM Meetup
The UCLA iGEM Team was proud to host the Second Annual Southern California iGEM Meetup at UCLA on July 20, 2016. Team members and advisors from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), University of La Verne, Alverno High School, and the University of Marburg attended the meet-up at the Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA. Each team was able to discuss their ongoing projects and receive feedback and advice on aspects such as experimental design, while learning about what other teams in the iGEM community was working on with the potential to form new collaborations. We also discussed pertinent issues for all iGEM teams in terms of logistics, team organization, fundraising, and project design. Additionally, we discussed the current state of iGEM and synthetic biology as a rapidly emerging biotechnology field in the United States, especially in the context of developing scientific communications to combat rising negative publicity and misinformation toward the use and safety of genetically modified organisms. Through our meet up, we hope to spur not only a collaborative experience in local teams to work together in solving synthetic biology problems, but also a space where teams can discuss the maintenance and sustained success of an iGEM team. Through our meet-up, we hope to facilitate greater collaborations among Southern California teams as well as foster the general iGEM and synthetic biology community.

This year IGEM Bordeaux Team would like to find an alternative to an entire segment of the traditional petrobased chemistry by a new green biobased chemistry. Indeed, we would like to focus on the biocatalysis of the hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Don’t worry, it is not as complicated as it appears. HMF is a by-product of the lignocellulosic biomass treatment. Its toxicity toward microorganisms leads to big issue for many companies which want to use these microorganisms to produce molecules of interest from lignocellulosic biomass. Our project consists in HMF detoxification by using it as a substrate to produce FDCA through bacteria .FDCA was identify as one of most promising biobased molecules which"

We were able to fully understand and appreciate each other’s projects which also allowed us to predict possible queries and questions that could be raised to our teams at the Giant Jamboree.Since, our team has previous experience competing at the Giant Jamboree, we were also able to give IIT Kanpur an insight about the judging criteria, the poster and the final presentation, which we hope would have been helpful for Team IIT Kanpur.Our interaction with Team Kanpur gave us confidence in our project and prepared us better for the Giant Jamboree.We hope to have a great time with IIT Kanpur at the Giant Jamboree :)
Knowledge and happiness multiply when shared - VIT Vellore
For the year 2018,VIT Vellore has pulled up it’s sleeves and is working on solving a pressing issue that threatens the very existence of humanity,Ocean Acidification.Their project TogglepH, will definitely have a huge impact in the years to come.
Our interaction with VIT Vellore, started with a WhatsApp text followed by a series of emails,chat over the phone, exchange of MATLAB Scripts.VIT Vellore, communicated to us the difficulties they were facing with the mathematical modelling of their genetic circuits.Since, our team members had a lot of experience with modelling genetic circuits we jumped to the occasion and lended our help to our brothers and sisters in Vellore.We helped them in figuring what simulations could be done and sticked with them until they were successful in finishing  the modelling of their genetic circuits.We hope to meet up and have great fun with VIT Vellore at the Giant Jamboree :)
A beacon of light in the dark-IIT Madras
For this year’s iGEM Project, Team IIT Madras is working to help synthetic biologists in generating codon usage with their free online tool CUTE (codon usage table enumerator),they have also built a synthetic promoter library for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1.When the coders in out team got stuck on a particular model we were working on, we realized that we needed the insight of someone with technical background,our first response was “IIT”. They were happy to help to offer their insight in evolving our algorithm and soon we were back on track!We look forward to meeting up with IIT Madras and thanking them in person at the Giant Jamboree!

The European Experience
The Evry and Ionis teams organized on the 1st and 2nd of July, a huge meeting that gathered     more than 11 European teams. In different rooms, each team had a space to hang its poster     and set up flyers and communication supports. We explained our project and discussed with     other iGEM members. Some helped us on different aspects like modeling and confinement     of our bacteria. When we were not on our stand, we walked around the rooms and learnt     more about other brilliant projects. We met a lot of nice people from different teams and     we sympathized a lot with every French team.
The organizers arranged two lectures during the weekend. First it dealt with the challenges     and the risks of synthetic biology and the second talked about a new economic world.     Different people, like CEOs of company, trainees, young workers, or research scientists     animated these round tables. One of our best memories was to meet the founder of iGEM: Randy Rettberg. It was an honor for us to speak with this person and to explain our project.
We thank very much the organizing teams for these amazing days in Paris! It was for us an     enjoyable experience of what the Giant Jamboree will be in October.
Meeting with Itzel from TEC Monterrey team
One day, on our Facebook page, we received a message from Itzel Guzman, iGEM TEC     Monterrey team member. She was in Toulouse for a semester and she asked us to meet us,     the iGEM Toulouse team. We discussed a long time on our project over a drink and we     sympathized a lot!     We decided to collaborate together on the protocol videos (view more).

Freiburg,2016," binding of our anti-GFP nanobody we followed different approaches. Another idea to test this binding was provided by this year’s iGEM team of Bielefeld, which are also working with nanobodies. They send us a GFP-split-CFP on pSB1C3 vector and anti-GFP nanobody-split-CFP on pSB1K3 vector to verify the binding of our nanobody.  Unfortunately, we were not able to test with the split proteins we received from team Bielefeld due to time constraints.

""Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."" - Helen Keller
A hallmark of this year’s iGEM experience has been fostering interest in young scientists and helping grow another generation of iGEMers. We had the opportunity of working with students from Austin ISD’s Liberal Arts and Science Academy (LASA), a team of 15 motivated high school scientists, also competing in this fall’s International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition LASATX Collaboration . The LASA team is working on carbon monoxide-sensing mechanism in bacteria that emits a wintergreen fragrance when carbon monoxide is detected. We believe that promoting STEM education and banding together can foster creativity, commitment, and collaboration. Specifically, the students has weekly meetings with our research educator, Dr. Dennis Mishler, and had open dialogue with our iGEM team on the Registry, BioBrick assembly, and synthetic biology. Through meetings, tours of our lab, and breaking down scientific literature, we were able to communicate our knowledge to the LASA team so they can start building their own iGEM project. In the Spring, they assisted us in creating fluorescent bacteria for our “painting with E. coli” booth at Austin’s premier SXSW Create conference. We worked with them during our SXSW Outreach in which we painted with bacteria that contained genetic devices (biobricks) that we created as part of our Breaking is Bad project and which were submitted to the registry. They also helped us run the booth, engage local participants, and start verbal surveys on public opinions and misconceptions on the benefits and advance in synthetic biology. Additionally, they helped test our newly created plasmids for the caffeine study by growing the different strains we had engineered. We also helped them in creating biobricks to submit to the registry and they helped demonstrate the utility of our redesigned pDCAF plasmids.

Fudan
Although we are from the same school, we chose totally different projects and tracks, and worked in different labs. In wet lab, Fudan and Fudan_China discussed about experiments and debugging methods almost everyday! There was frequent reagent exchange between us, like competent cells, enzymes and antibiotics. For example, team Fudan received Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol from us, while we obtained DH5alpha competent cells from team Fudan. Also, we borrow experiment equipments in each other's lab when needed. In dry lab, Fudan helped us to meet the professor of biophysics, and get some enlightenment of the diffusion model. In the meantime, we taught Fudan how to make an interactive animation of their models on their wiki.
ShanghaiTech
We submitted our parts to the part library built by the team ShanghaiTech. We discussed the problem with team Shanghaitech and they helped us figure out an available algorithm in August. And we talked about the possibilities of dividing our circuit into smaller parts that can be delivered by their multilayer signal processing system, so that the load in each cells may be decreased.
We also worked together in dry lab work. There was an approximate process in the origin integrase model, the rapid equilibrium, which causes the difficulties in infinitesimal method for simulation.
Peking
We had a phone call with team Peking in late August. Due to the similarity of our system, we discussed about the integrase experiment details. Peking answered our questions carefully. It was helpful for us to modify our experiment on integrases.

NEU-China Visit their wiki
The cooperation with Northeastern University has begun since the summer vocation. We helped them complete a receptor and Working as a very kind and helpful team, they asked helping us in verifying one fuctional protein expression.
We helped NEU-China construct an olfactory receptor Rho-OR1A1.  The 64th base pair from the initiation codon of OR1A1 contains an illegal enzyme site (EcoRI), which didn't meet up RFC10 standard. So we designed the primer with synonymous codon and successfully mutated the GAA to GAG.(Figure 1.)
Figure 1. standardized Rho-OR1A1.
In our project, we need various functional vectors for dsRNA production，but the gene sequence complementarity will cause secondary structure, which is impossible to synthsize gene for one time. The task of constructing vectors is heavy.
So NEU-China students helped us construct a hpRNA producing vector ecrL, which speeded up our vectors construction progress. (Figure 2.)
Figure 2. PstI, EcoRI double enzyme digestion.
Really appreciate their support.
BIT-China Visit their wiki
After we meet up through vedio conference with BIT-China, We exchanged ideas and confirmed our collaboration relationship.
In the light of helping each other, we assisted them to build a new type of promoter.      At the same time, they helped us verify one functional protein expression.(Figure 1.)
BIT-China project requires mRFP to characterize the size of the sweetness. Different sweeteners have different gradients of sweetness, they need to get mutations of the inducible promoter Pfus and change its strength.
Figure 1. Mutant gene Pfus.
So we helped them  build a mutant gene of Pfus to make their project more responsive.
In our project,  pectinase and celluse play an important role in  downstream circuits and we want to combine functional dsRNA with these two proteins and let them work together, which will make great sense to our subsequent appllication"

Project Description
In Software Track’s requirements of Gold Medal, we noticed that we should address a problem that we would like to co-develop with a wet-lab team. That’s to say, this should be a collaboration where the wet-lab team posts a problem they are having and we should address the issue by creating an online software solution.
This year, 2015 USTC team selected Hardware Track. In their project, they try to send their knights composed of CACCI, SPRING and ROSE to detect those molecules which mean many antibiotic substances emitted directly into environment and endangered in human being’s health. (You could get more information about their project from here .) In detail, SPRING, as a partner of CACCI, is responsible for taking photos by Michelson Interferometer and analyzing the data from the photos, especially getting the physical quantity from the fringes produced by the interferometer.
Achievement
When the wet-lab team provides a picture took by CCD based on Michelson Interferometer, we could analyze fringes number and distance between two points selected by user, in the meanwhile, we also could assure the fringe series of the initial point.
Website for our software tool: fringe.herokuapp.com. How to use: here .
Techniques
Image Processing
Denoise the grayscale:
Choose an appropriate Gauss radius, and use Gauss filter to remove high-frequency noise.
Strengthen the fringes. Pixels of fringes are black, other pixels are white.
Remove more noise by the connectivity of pixels. We examine the 8 pixels surrounding a pixel, and we change this pixel into black if 4 or more of 8 are black. In this way, we can reduce black noise and avoid errors in calculation.
Fringe Counting
Get the line’s function by the coordinates of starting pixel and ending pixel.
List all pixels that the line crosses.
Set fringe threshold and non-fringe threshold and read the coordinates of pixels in 2.We regard it as a fringe if the number of continuous black pixels is larger than threshold and not a fringe if else. Each change from black to white represents a fringe.
Hence, we get the fringe number.

BNU-CHINA,2015,". Then we tried normal SDS-PAGE of the homogenate and supernatant and the result came out as Fig.2 has shown.
Fig. 1.2 Normal SDS-PAGE of NhaA and NhaB
Lane 1, molecular weight standards (kDa); Lane 2-4, the homogenate of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB; Lane 5, 6 and 8, the supernatant of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB, Bacteria transformed with plasmid pSB1C3 as a negative control.
The bands this time were clearer to see, whereas still there was no significant difference between the empty vector plasmid and the transformed ones.
After two times of unsuccessful attempts, we searched the internet and reviewed some literatures of a reliable protocol for membrane extraction and detection. With the protocols collected we processed the experiment the third time.
Fig. 1.3 SDS-PAGE of extracted membrane proteins
Lane 1, molecular weight standards (kDa); lane 2-4, the sediment of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB after centrifuging for the second time; Lane 5-7, the supernatant of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB after centrifuging for the second time; Lane 8-10, the supernatant of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB after centrifuging for the first time. Bacteria transformed with plasmid pSB1C3 as a negative control.
From this result we can conclude that there were some differences between the bands of controlled plasmid and the experimental ones, whereas it seemed these differences had nothing to do with our objective product. So it came out that we failed another time.
Relevant agent formula:

Tris-HCl (pH=8.0)
Sucrose
β-mercaptoethanol
85 mL
25.67 g
15 mL
Membrane solution buffer
Protein lysis buffer : urea solution (8M) = 4 : 1 (volume ratio ))
Therefore, it’s a pity that we failed to detect those two proteins, but we were able to give some opinions to BIT-China about this detection through our experience:
Changing the expression strain specially for overexpressing of NhaA and NhaB according to the literature [1] , the details are in the table 2.
Doing western blot if possible.

We found these activities to be an excellent starting points for the many dialogs we had with parents and some students about genomes and how we now have the capability to change those genomes, and what the implications of that would be. In these dialogs, we strived to get across the point that they, as much as scientists and policy makers and regulators can be and need to be participants in shaping the genetic engineering technology developed.
With regards to mathematical modeling, John Marken from the William and Mary iGEM has helped us greatly with Matlab, which we were using for our mathematical model. We were having difficulty writing Matlab code to extract model parameters. Through many emails, John gave us invaluable advice on how to approach the optimization, constraints, and gave us code segments to write the iterative routine for the optimization. We are very grateful to John for his assistance.
University of Virginia iGEM
We contacted UVA iGEM in June and had a phone call meeting. At that meeting with Madeline Stone, we talked of ways we could help each other out. UVA iGEM was creating an E.coli  kill switch for their project and we were doing our own research for a yeast kill switch. Even though the two designs were going to be very different, they gave us some very useful tips and feedback on how to approach a kill switch design. We completed a survey on biocontainment that University of Virginia sent out to iGEM teams.

TUDelft,2017," in order corroborate our results and help us find the cause of such an unexpected finding. As observed in Figure 1, the same unexpected trend is described when Munich’s Cas13a is dried with our CAHS 94205 , hence verifying our CAHS+Cas13a results.
Figure 4: Cas13a activity with CAHS 94205 in RNase Alert Assay by Munich. Fluorescence intensities over time triggered by RNase activity of Cas13a after drying with the TDP CAHS 94205, with and without crRNA and target RNA. Data from iGEM  Munich 2017.
Not only did their results help us discard a problem in our Cas13a or an experimental error as the issue, but also proved a similar behaviour of the TDPs in combination with our  Cas13a’s (which were actually based on the sequences of different organisms and purified according to different protocols) and therefore further substantiated the use of TDPs for the preservation of Cas13a.
Drylab Collaboration iGEM Munich
Both the iGEM TU Delft and iGEM LMU-TUM Munich teams realized that optimal crRNA is a prerequisite in utilizing Cas13a for their respective detection purposes. In addition to sensitively detecting a sequence of interest, modeling the off-target effects of a chosen crRNA is important in assessing the reliability of the system, as it provides information about the probability of a false positive output. Both teams took a different approach: we employed a kinetic model ( Klein et al. 2017 ) while iGEM LMU-TUM Munich applied an alignment algorithm. Please find the full model here .
Biophysical modeling has the advantage of providing a unified targeting framework that is able to take into account tiny (local) off-target effects that together may add to affect the reliability of the system. However, it is computationally intensive as compared to homology search and requires the development of the software, which is already available from NCBI for homology search.
We ran 4 off-target simulations for 2 different crRNAs spacer sequences (crRNA1-3 and crRNA4) designed by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA of two different bacterial species (E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis). The on and off-target activities are modeled for sequences on all possible frames on the genome (Figure 4). From the simulation results, we deduce that the crRNAs specifically target the different bacterial species.
Figure 4: On and off-target effects of Munich"
TUST_China,2017,"! If that doesn't happen, don't worry! You are also lucky because you can chase your own interests now! If you think about why iGEM wants undergraduate students to be involved majorly rather than postgraduate or Ph.D. That is because college student has the advantage of boldness and imagination. Only in this case can the team come up with a novel idea. Innovation is the key!
Persuade the University
The reason why iGEM is having survival issue in many universities is that it is literally a jamboree of the rich, a competition that burns money, with registration fee+ entrance fee more than 100,000 yuan. In this case, places like International communication center, teacher’s affair office or office of your college is your best shot to raise funds. If you can get your professor to help, you will be much more persuasive than on your own. That is the exact reason why you want a nice professor. The biggest cost comes from the funds the experiment needs. If your professor is willing to offer his own lab's funds, things will be easier. If that is still not sufficient enough, you might need to talk to more faculty members or started applying some projects that provide funds.
Tips: the funds from cooperation is also a good alternative
Training and project initiation(This is serious)
A good project is fundamental for everything.                             (I am not suggesting our project is the best actually I deem it not good enough).                             It helps your persuasion with the university,                             the professors and supports the sustainable development of iGEM in your university.                             You need to show your potential of winning the awards and                             makes your project looks like a good investment to the school's faculty.                             Even with the fact that there aren't many universi-ties opening courses of synthetic biology,                             you shouldn't be discouraged and former years' wiki is a good start. Gradually,                             you will find yourself capable of reading paper which is the basis of brainstorming.                             Communication is the key and you need to trust your team. When encountered with problems,                             stop hesitating to ask. Here I recommend a qq group created by Zhang Haoqian---iGEM China&Syn Bio.                             It is a great platform with many friendly pro-fessors or experienced researchers willing to answer academic question.
Tips Read a book called ""molecular biology lab work handbook"" before you start your lab work. Don't ask me why, just read it.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017," Practice collaboration of Valencia UPV .
They made a worldwide study about the situation regarding transgenics, including various topics like the legislation of transgenic consumption in different countries. Each participating team wrote an essay explaining various aspects of this topic. Different questions were posed such as the social perception of transgenic consumption as well as the viability of growing transgenic plants at home or public spaces. We were glad to participate in this Human Practice collaboration because we think that this is a great way of joining forces to tackle problems like the oftentimes negative social perception of transgenic organisms.
Translation collaboration of Team Franconia
Many teams met at the Germany iGEM meet-up in Dresden. For this meet up iGEM team Dresden organized a Collaboration speeddating. This gave us the opportunity to get in touch with iGEM team Franconia , who were developing a card game. To extend the range of this game, the game was supposed to be translated into many different languages. Our team gladly took part in the effort and translated the  game and its instructions to 5 languages: hindu, greek, french, german and portuguese."

Cellulose Processing & CBDs
Testing the feasibility of microbial cellulose-based biosensors
The University of Edinburgh iGEM 2015 team is creating a paper-based biosensor to detect purity of and contaminants in illicit drugs. In an effort to increase the applications of the proof-of-concept biosensor, the team wanted to incorporate microbial cellulose as an alternative to paper. This could decrease the cost of the biosensor as well as making the disposal easier.
For the collaboration, the Edinburg IGEM 2015 used the BBa_K321357, which is an sfGFP fused to the cellulose binding domain CBDcex transcriptionally activated by Lacl. Since the CBDcex is attached to a fluorescence, sfGFP, the strength of the binding affinity is correlated with the absorbance level. The y-axis measures the absorbance in relative fluorescent unit while the x-axis is the time incubation. Although there is large error bar, there is a distinguishable difference between the binding affinity of the CBD onto the cellulose unprocessed and processed sheet. The high absorbance for the processed sheet indicates that the CBD binds more effectively than the unprocessed sheet. This experiment will be repeated in the near future.
By using microbial cellulose that our team provided, the University of Edinburgh team was able to check the binding affinities of a cellulose binding domain (CBD) to the cellulose to see whether microbial cellulose-based biosensors are feasible. Our bioHYDRA project involved testing processed and unprocessed cellulose, and we sent the Edinburgh team a sample of each. This allowed the Edinburgh team to see if there is an advantage to the processing for their applications, and, since our future work includes expressing CBDs on spore coats, the processed sheets will be better for our applications as well. The CBD they tested was BBa_K1321357, which is sfGFP fused to CBDcex and driven by LacI. They chose this BioBrick because it was in the distribution kit and"

Collaboration with Tongji-Software
In our simulation of metabolism with and without phase separation, we inevitably need the kinetic parameters of enzymes used in our pathway to produce β-carotene. Only if we have relatively accurate enzyme kinetic data, can we make tenable predictions based on our models. On hearing Tongji-Software ’s software on finding the most efficient pathway of production together with the pertinent kinetic parameters, we proposed to collaborate with them. Their software sufficed our need and we provided them with another plausible application.
Collaboration with BJRS_CHINA & BNU-China
We offered a suitable plate reader to help BJRS_China and BNU-China with their interlab study about fluorescence and absorbance measurement.
Collaboration with BIT-China
We met team BIT-China in the symposium we held. We kept communication with them since about both our projects since then. What's more we helped BIT-China test the expression of their fluorescent protein with flow cytometer.
Summit meeting of International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition at Nankai University
On July 6th, we gladly accepted the invitation from NKU_CHINA and took part in the summit meeting of International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition hosted by NKU_CHINA in Tianjin with eight other universities.
While it was just the beginning of summer vacation and most teams did not have many experimental results yet, we exchanged our ideas about the total design, modelling and human practice. A short afternoon as it may be, we nevertheless obtained valuable ideas on polishing the slides, taking more variables into consideration and optimizing the experimental design.
We were a little nervous when we made the presentation, partly because it was the first time for us to do it. However, we learned that practice makes perfect and the better acquainted we became with our system, the more confident we will be. Since then, we worked ever harder and gradually had our own taste of doing scientific research.
Communicating with DLUT_China
On July 14th, we communicated with two iGEM teams from DLUT_China at Peking University."
Amsterdam,2017," that is the most carbon efficient. As calculated by team Amsterdam, this will most likely be the Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria convert CO 2 directly into fumarate, fuelled by sunlight. For E. Coli , on the contrary, you needs to grow sugar crops, harvest them, and extract the glucose as a carbon source to grow. Taking the whole process into consideration, cyanobacteria will yield more fumarate per CO 2 . Exploring other options such as these could provide an efficient and possibly cost-effective way to produce the fumarate that would lower methane emissions in cattle.
Conclusions
From this pleasant collaboration, we can conclude that adding fumarate to cattle feed remains a promising strategy to reduce methane emissions, although some hurdles have yet to be taken. Some studies report conflicting results about the effect of the addition of fumarate to cattle feed on methane production. Thereby, the absence of oxygen in cattle rumen opposes challenges for the growth of photoautotrophic organisms and oxidative growth of heterotrophic organisms.
On top of that, the exact yields of the strains developed by iGEM team Amsterdam and the proposed E. Coli mutant in this paper have yet to be defined. Nevertheless, as shown by the UNL iGEM team, methane emissions pose an enormous problem to our world, that need interdisciplinary teams to come up with out of the box-solutions such as these.

Introduction
As participants in the iGEM Competition, we have come to accept the ability to modify genes as an obvious fact, one that does not require much reflection on our end. At the same time, whilst we understand such possibility is granted to us by law, not many realise the extent to which law may incentivise, guide, shape and, at times, limit our efforts. It originates from politics, creates institutional procedures, gives life to new businesses, dictates the pace of scientific progress, and affects consumer choices. In this, law reflects the perceptions of its creators while its creators reflect diversity of the country’s citizens. In this, law is diverse.
In this collaboration, we aimed at creating a document that would illustrate that very depth and diversity of law. For this reason, the first issue we discussed is law-related politics, the second its bureaucracy, third law’s impact on business, fourth on science and finally on consumer behaviour. Willing to gain an even deeper understanding of GMM legislations, we have invited 15 teams from different countries to participate in these collaborative efforts. In the end, the final document has been created by 127 iGEMers from 10 teams, 10 countries, 7 different iGEM tracks and 5 continents. Have a look at the fruits of the 3 months-long interactions, discussions and meet-ups.
Summaries
1. What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?
The institutional bodies that enforce the laws regarding the use of GMMs differ a lot across the world. In many countries in Asia (Japan, Indonesia, and Korea) and Canada, ministries and departments are responsible for enforcing the laws of GMMs. The kinds of"

Science is rarely a one (wo)man job and usually requires people with different backgrounds to work together to solve the challenges encountered. iGEM is no different. To encompass this spirit the iGEM 2017 Groningen team strives to work together with multiple teams on different aspect of our project and hopefully further strengthen connections within the iGEM community.
Scientific collaborations
To further develop and establish L. lactis as a chassis in iGEM we collaborated with the IGEM team of Sao Paulo. We  sent them protocols since we have a lot of in house experience with working on lactis.
To help the Nottingham team we tested their E.coli RFP fluorescence in our lab to provide an external control. They sent us a protocol along with their cells, and we did the testing and sent them our results.
NAWI-Graz: Our friends from Austria are developing a bioelectronic interface controlled by bacterial GFP-expression. They have developed a software to validate part of their experiments. iGEM Groningen has worked together with them to design mazes and therefore improve the functionality and identify flaws in the design.
Human practices
Virtual meet up Vilnius-Lithuania, Abu Dhabi (with follow up discussion) We presented our project designs to each other and critically debated their feasibility as well as implementation of the final product. This helped us gain insight into possible experimental flaws. Abu Dhabi is also working on designing a cartridge, so their engineering advice was appreciated and contributed to improving our cartridge. We held a follow-up discussion to update on the progress achieved and get advice on the challenges met. We had a few issues with cloning and got some help that enabled us to get our construct from team Vilnius. We hoped our input also improved on their design.
Virtual meet up – ethics, Oslo, Graz, Zurich, Lund, Uppsala. Team Uppsala moderated a discussion together with Oslo, Graz, Zurich, and Lund about the ethical implications of our projects. The whole conversation was live streamed and can be found here . We tried to respond to the following questions:

French Meetup
During the last weekend of August (29-30th), Bordeaux hosted the french meetup with the help of Capsciences (Scientific Museum in Bordeaux specialized in scientific popularization). We invited all french and francophone teams. Unfortunately, some teams couldnt assist but iGEM KU_Leuven (Belgium) , iGEM EPLF-Lausanne (Swizerland), iGEM Paris-Saclay , iGEM Paris Pasteur , iGEM Aix Marseille and iGEM Toulouse (France) came and enjoyed that moment with us.
On Saturday morning, iGEM Bordeaux organized a scavenger hunt in the city. The objective was to answer questions about synthetic biology and other iGEM projects to find clues for the next location they needed to go to. Divided into three teams, we were able to visit the beautiful city of Bordeaux which ended in a picnic at the Cap Science Museum!
There, teams presented their projects in front of other teams and general public at Capsciences and  we talked about the inconvenient and advantages of each project. Each team had to make their presentation understandable for everyone. We also were lucky to have a theatre expert who gave us constructive feedback on the best way to present our projects at Boston and to a non-scientific public. You can see the French presentations down below! When every team finished their French presentation, each team made a very quick presentation of their project in English without a powerpoint, and then again, the public gave some advice for each team. You can see our English presentation following the link down below! After a long day of walk and talk, we went into a restaurant and went home to have a well-deserved rest to be ready for the Sunday activities.
On Sunday, we all met at the Parc Bordelais to do some activities proposed by other teams. Paris Saclay organized a debate about biosafety, and prepared a short video for each iGEM team presentation. This encouraged all teams to think about safety considerations in their project and allowed us to discuss general safety issues such as containing genetically modified organisms and ensuring that they do not become out of our control.

FLIM experiments with Oxford iGEM
The Oxford iGEM team wanted to test their copper chelators using Fluorescence Lifetime IMaging (FLIM), previous research by Hötzer et al (2011) had shown that GFP lifetime was modified in a copper concentration dependent manner. Therefore, it was hypothesised that if the chelators where functional then the lifetime of the fused GFP's would drop. The Cardiff Bioimaging facility possesses a confocal laser scanning microscope with FLIM module so we offered to test their samples.
Oxford sent us three cultures containing constructs that we grew overnight in the presence of 5uM copper sulphate -/+ 2mM Arabinose (which induced expression using the pBAD promotor).
These constructs were:
1. A constitutive GFP
2. Inducible CG:GFP copper chelator protein ( BBa_K1980001 )
3. Inducible MG:GFP copper chelator protein( BBa_K1980003 )
With help of Dr Anthony Hayes in the Cardiff Biomaging facility we obtained the following FLIM data for their constructs. This has helped with their characterisation as described on their Wiki

Tables shows triplicate (i.e. 3 regions per cover-slipped area) values of the peak lifetimes resulting from measurements using Excitation=483nm, Emission=500-550nm.

UCAS,2017," voltage around 2.0v, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Later, we and UAlberta exchanged information about modelling gas vesicles — our experience with modeling gas vesicle dynamics in the diffusive regime proved to be helpful to their model while they provided us with a visual simulation of gas vesicle flotation in Java.
Database Contribution: IIT Madras
As part of Team IIT Madras' initiative to collect protocols and information about different chassis organisms used in synthetic biology, they reached out to us during the iGEM 2017 All-India Meet-Up to request information from us.
IIT Madras' database of chassis organisms includes our entries for Saccharomyces cerevesiae and Pichia pastoris
Over the summer, we had worked on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris for eukaryotic recombinant protein synthesis, and had protocols and data available, which we promptly submitted to IIT Madras' database as a contribution of two chassis organisms. Kartik from their team commented on our submission: ""The data looks amazing! Thanks a lot!"""
Duesseldorf,2018," our attention, as during our initial brainstorming sessions at iGEM, we thought about a similar project. However, we encountered many difficulties when thinking about possible challenges and therefore did not decide to chose that topic. However, all those brainstorming sessions about these challenges allowed us to help team Eindhoven and advice them to think about upcoming problems. They were really glad that we supported them with those thoughts and we stayed in touch throughout the iGEM session.
NU_Kazakhstan
They work with S. elongatus as well so we decided to get in touch and talk about this organism. Team Kazakhstan had some troubles transforming their cyanobacteria so we took a look at their transformation protocol to find possible adjustments and also included some of our working protocols.
Toulouse-INSA-UPS
Team Toulouse came up with the iGEM teams worldwide Instagram account where every interested iGEM team was able to post for a week to show everyone their project and team. We took initiative and posted pictures for one week.
US_AFRL_CarrollHS
The team US AFRL Carroll HS created a “Flat Stanley” called Mike the Microbe that was sent to us as a social media outreach platform. He visited us in our lab and we took pictures with him in our lab.
FAU Erlangen
The iGEM team FAU Erlangen wants to enlighten the world about their project through a short video. They asked us to help translate this video to Italian so the video can reach more people around the world.
Waterloo
During our project we sadly came to the realization that a lot of people are uninformed about co-cultures and the many benefits they offer.
This fact did not only present itself to us, but also to the iGEM team of Waterloo, whose  project is dealing with co-cultures as well. This is why both of our teams decided to join forces in creating an educational video about microbial consortia. We included a lot of analogies and examples to make it easily understandable for people without a scientific background. Due to their creative skills following video was produced. Have a look!
iGEM Surveys
Surveys are a great method to collect a lot of data on the opinions or knowledge of society about a certain topic. We have designed our own survey and are very pleased with the advantages of this method. For this reason, it was very important to us to participate in and share the surveys of other iGEM teams to help them.

They shall also prepare an off-site emergency plan. The District Level Committee shall regularly submit its report to the SBCC/ GEAC.
On a case-by-case basis, it is regulated by a specific non-ministry government institution The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety on 5 different fields: foods, plants, animals, fishes, and microorganisms. They review all the required technical documents and inform whether or not it is needed to do a follow-up laboratory test and so on.
In Japan, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, and Ministry of the Environment regulate the use of GMMs on research and development. Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment regulate the use of GMMs that are agricultural produce. Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and Ministry of the Environment regulate the use of GMMs that are pharmaceuticals for human body.
Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology regulates the gene recombination experiments. Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry regulates the use of GMMs on a production of enzymes for industrial use. Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries regulates the use of GMMs on a production or sale of experimental animals.
The committee of the Biosafety is the umbrella body for other GMO supervising ministries. With the help of the Korea Biosafety Clearing House (KBCH), which is the information center, each Ministry takes care of case falling under their supervision. For instance, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning is in charge of the academical usages of GMOs.
3. What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?
The legal requirements in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and India are very similar. All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production. The exact procedures related to obtaining permissions to use GMOs in the production vary, however, according to the target use of the final products or the way the GMOs are handled in the production process. As a general rule, products related to human health as well as those used as food or feed have to follow stricter GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labelling your final products in a predescribed manner. Environmental release of GMOs is also"

Tel-Hai shared their ideas on the publicity of synthetic biology with us. They are trying to explain what synthetic biology is in a fresh and more attractive way. That is to put together a trivia game, set of questions from groups doing multiple things. The questions potentially could be shared with local students not involved with the competition but who wish to learn more about synthetic biology and entrepreneurship in the field of biotechnology. To spread the game better and further and to make up the shortcoming that they cannot get the information about what we are doing before October, they need to collaborate with other teams. Once we received their email, we made effort to make a plan to show our understanding about our project and synthetic biology. Then considering Tel Hai’s advice, we finally collected the fun relevant stories and turned them into a range of questions, including the creative ideas in the experiment design, mistakes that should to be avoided. All the contents are collected to educate those who want to enter the stronghold of synthetic biology. Furthermore, we had a deeper understanding towards synthetic biology, which was helpful for us to dig deeper in our project through the collaboration.
What’s more, we sent them a photo where there is a rose. They were collecting 65 roses to make a picture serving their project. Attracted by their creativity, we decided to join their project in such an interesting way.

Troubleshooting -- Wiki course
     On August 23th, we prepared a wiki course for NTHU_Formosa, helping them to troubleshoot on their difficulties of writing their wiki. First of all, we taught them the concept and process of designing a website as an introduction.  Second, we introduced how to use HTML, CSS, as well as  JavaScript. Third, we helped them to build up a simple RWD website step by step to make them more familiar with the web languages. Finally, we gave them some tips and advices on editing their wiki. We’re really happy about having such a chance to share our knowledge with other iGEM teams! Hope the course could help them in a meaningful way. We’re looking forward"

Jianzhao Yang from Peking came to Fudan University this July and had a friendly academic exchange with members of Fudan-CHINA. These two teams previously had little, but they became acquaintance after borrowing rainbow beats from one another. They scheduled an exchange on one project afterward in Shanghai. We introduces our programs to each other and took Yang to the lab and research platform where IGEM is at our school. Yang told us the method of connecting simultaneous multi-segments used by Peking University currently.

Tongji-Software
In September, we received an invitation from Tongji-Software and went to Tongji University who owns all kinds of delicate buildings. During this meetup, we realized cross-track communication. The model Tongji-Software used also included Probability Theory, sharing similarities with the Markov chain used in our main model. Inspired by them, we made some changes in terms of the probability parameters of the model, introducing some probability distribution conclusions in biochemical reactions, making the model more persuasive. After introducing the project to each other, we learned that Tongji-Software encountered some difficulties in the process of making a Wiki page. Our team member who is the computer master guided them on how to use templates, how to upload files, how to edit Web page code, and also reminded them of all the files and the external source code that needed to be uploaded to the iGEM server.

Comic: Funniest Failure Experience in your experiment
We decided to collect some interesting reasons for experiment failures and choose some of them to design a comic brochure, to add some amusement and at the same time remind everyone in the lab to be really careful and not to make mistakes during operation. Also we will distribute this brochure in our school and Giant Jamboree to get more researchers' attention in a humorous way. Luckily, we got response from iGEMers all over the world. Some of them are really miserable though bring us a lot of joy. We consider those stories lively but meaningful to all of us. Thus, thanks to our great talented drawer Hao"
