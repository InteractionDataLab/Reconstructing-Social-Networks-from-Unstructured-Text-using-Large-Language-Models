Pitt iGEM - University of Pittsburgh
We collaborated with the Pitt iGEM team to characterize osmolarity sensitive promoters. Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) require high salt and low oxygen conditions to grow. Therefore genetically engineering a strain of bacteria that can report osmolarity in environments such as oil pipelines and then activate a remediation circuit would be beneficial.
Firstly the promoter was tested by making a sensor with a fluorescent protein reporter. The sensor will induce expression of RFP when osmolarity is high. The sensor can be utilized to measure salt concentrations to determine if SRB can survive. The promoter can then be used to produce Dispersin B enzyme to degrade the biofilm where SRB  can accumulate and ultimately, corrode the pipes. With the deadlines approaching, we shared the sequences for the osmolarity sensors with Pitt iGEM.
The two versions of the sensor, which were designed, include the native wild-type promoter sequence of Escherichia coli proU operon (REF) and the optimized Consensus promoter sequence (Lucht and Bremer, 1990), which is a synthetic sequence with mutations previously discovered to increase expression of the operon that codes for a binding protein-dependent transport system.
In this collaboration, Pitt iGEM team cloned the constructs and transformed them into MACH1-T1 cells with the help from Dr. Telmer , who is our PI. Then they proceeded to test growth of the cells in LB media with varying concentrations of sodium chloride. Finally, RFP fluorescence levels of these different cultures were measured to determine osmolarity regulated RFP expression in cells with WT and the Consensus promoters compared to the negative control.
CMUQ will transform these constructs into DH5a to account for differential expression over different bacterial strains. These studies show that promoter activity increased in conditions of high osmolarity and salt. The next step is to have the proU promoter drive Dispersin B expression to degrade the biofilms. If the cells can be concentrated at areas of high SRB growth this will be more efficient.
Since the Pitt iGEM’s project works with optical control of bacteria movement,"

Collaboration with University of Calgary iGEM - Wet Lab Collaboration
Overview
This summer, Calgary iGEM reached out to us expressing interest over our project and about beginning a collaboration between our teams. Their goal is to develop a process for bioplastic production on a Mars settlement. This is a novel method that couples waste management in space with the high cost of shipping materials to a Mars mission crew. Calgary iGEM has been working hard in engineering E. coli to produce bioplastics from human waste feedstock. The bioplastic of interest is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), which can be synthesized with their engineered bacteria using volatile fatty acids (VFA), compounds that are present in human waste. Calgary’s interest in our team stemmed from the need for a fast and effective E. coli detector to incorporate into their bioplastics synthesis system on a Mars colony. Our DNAzyme would serve as part of their containment system, and quickly alert crew to leakage from the synthesis system. Our team was very interested in this potential application of our DNAzyme and decided to mail a quantity of it over for pilot testing from Calgary iGEM.
Experiment
A small amount of DNAzyme was shipped to Calgary for testing its specificity in the presence of E. coli, and confirming lack of cleavage activity in the presence of other bacteria. The following outlines the procedure followed by Calgary iGEM and their results.
Overnight cultures of E. coli DH5α and Bacillus subtilis WB800 were prepared in liquid M9 media and diluted to a concentration of 106 cells/mL. Quadrants were drawn on agar plates with M9 media and labelled as either E. coli or B. subtilis, DNAzyme, and two negative controls (Figure 1).
On the quadrants labelled as bacteria, 30 µL of the overnight E. coli or B. subtilis were spread and left to grow for 36 hours. Calgary encountered a lack of bacterial growth following this incubation step. They decided to use a thicker agar plate and plate a higher concentration of cells (108 cells/mL), which resulted in colony growth (Figure"

Brothers from other Mothers-ICT- Mumbai
In the present edition of iGEM ,Team ICT-Mumbai is venturing into an adventurous task of engineering a chassis bacteria:Bacillus Subtilis to detect the particular plant ,being grown, in response to fthe extudades They worked on mainlty fours types of crops namely Rice,Wheat,Soybean and Tomato.Since, our institute is located in the heart of the Northern plains of India, ICT-Mumbai wanted us to gather information about the types of crops grown,amount of fertilizers used and diseases widespread in the lush farms in and around the Haryana-Punjab region.
Our project kept us in regular touch with the farmers of our community,therefore, we were easily able to get access to the above information.We also were able to understand the amount of knowledge of Phosphate Solubilizing bacteria in the Farmer’s Community.On being questioned about Plant dieseases in their farms, a majoirty of the Farmer’s assusred us that “Weeds” were a biigger concern for them than Plant Diseases.This information allowed us not only provide valuable facts and figures for ICT -Mumbai but alos helped us understand other reasons for harvest losses faced by our farmers, which strengthened our will to succeed in our project.All in all we were more than happy to interact and share this information with our fellow scientists in Mumbai.We hope to see them again at the Giant Jamboree :)
A friend in need is a friend indeed-IIT Kanpur

iGEM Kyoto
On March 10th, we interacted with iGEM Kyoto team in University of Kyoto. Both teams gave presentations and had an exchange of opinions. So, we could sophisticate our projects each other. Furthermore, We shared ideas about not only projects of experiments but also activities of teams, to name a few, how to manage a team, chances of practicing presentations and how to educate new students. We could get a lot of instructive views for our teams. The meeting with them was very meaningful.
University of Kyoto developed the software to complete experiment data in Wiki and provided it to us. When you input experiment date like experimenter’s names, date and the amount of chemicals, this software translate the information into HTML. It enabled us to make wiki easily and quickly. In fact, we used this software and edited the page of experiment. Moreover, we felt it’s very useful for the team that are not familiar with engineering and for creating wiki simplify. We cooperated with improvement of it by providing feedback.
iGEM East Japan Meetup 2018
On August 8th, we met up with iGEM Tokyo_Tech, iGEM Gifu team, KAIT Japan and ASIJ iGEM team. Each team gave a presentation followed by a Q&A in English and exchanged feedback. Also, we discussed project ideas, funding issues, how to drive a team and so on. This meetup helped to improve our presentation skill and team-managing skill, and to get hints that can have a good effect on our experiment.

Human Practices Handbook
Overview
Our team recognizes that the progress of synthetic biology and of science doesn't just come from one source. Interdisciplinary work and collaborations play a huge part in the advancement of our field. We formed partnerships with other iGEM teams to utilize different resources and gain insights that simply cannot be done by a single team. We gained an understanding of the perception of synthetic biology in different geographic locations through a joint human practices effort. Furthermore, we also mentored other teams and helped contribute to a human practices handbook.
Public Perceptions Survey
Synthetic biology is more powerful when we work together. For our collaboration, we worked with Stony Brook iGEM to understand people’s attitudes about synthetic biology in different parts of New York. Together, we wrote a survey to administer near our respective universities - us, in Ithaca and upstate New York, and them, in Long Island and New York City. We held weekly meetings over Skype to discuss where we wanted to go with our collaboration, focusing on using the strengths of both of our teams. We also developed skills in survey writing and distribution. We learned to ask questions that would improve the knowledge-base of our teams, and researched what we could uniquely investigate that could not be found online.
Through reflection, reviewing literature, and thoughtful dialogue, we chose to focus on the comparison of perceptions of synthetic biology in different geographic locations. As student researchers from STEM backgrounds, we recognized the bubble we could potentially be in. Conducting this survey helped us pop that bubble. Together, both of our teams went through several iterations of survey drafts which we constructed together. We tested our surveys on small sample populations, and brought back feedback to clarify or rephrase our questions. When the questions were finalized, both teams went out to collect responses.
Cornell iGEM visited the Ithaca Farmers’ Market as well as the Ithaca Commons during our annual Apple Harvest Festival to collect survey responses."
Stockholm,2015," affinity, it might be possible to direct these toxins towards cells that express affibody molecules on their surface. To try this concept, we decided that our team would design a membrane-bound affibody that BGU Israel would then attempt to express on the surface of mammalian cells using their AAV vectors.
Our design utilized a system of Glycosylphosphatidylinisotol (GPI)-anchoring that is common in membrane proteins of mammalian cells. We based our design on a human protein Decay accelerating factor (DAF), encoded by the CD55 gene. A 34-amino-acid-long signal peptide at the N-terminus precedes the actual protein, which is then followed by a second 28-amino-acid-long signal peptide at the C-terminus. The N-terminus signal directs the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the C-terminus signal is removed in the ER and then replaced with a GPI anchor. In addition, a DAF-derived signal has been shown to lead to GPI anchoring of fusion proteins.
Subsequently, we have also added a short linker sequence and a FLAG-tag on the N-terminus of the affibody. On the C-terminus, we have also added a linker that ended with serine, which is the site of cleavage for the signal peptide. This gene was then synthesized as a gBlock by IDT. The construct was expressed by the BGU Israel team. While expression of the Affibody was confirmed, it did not appear to be localized to the membrane. More results are available on the BGU Israel 2015 wiki .
CGU Taiwan
The CGU Taiwan team was referred to us by the Delft University of Technology team. They needed help with the modeling part of their project. They had to knock out a gene in the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway, which in normal circumstances would be active. We introduced them to Matlab and SimBiology as well and helped them model the GPCR pathway with the eliminated gene. They were also interested in projecting the boundary condition for liquid-liquid interphase diffusion, using partial differential equations. We offered to research their reactions and to try to find kinetic parameters of the processes present in the CGU’s current project. We suggested utilization of Newmann no-flux partial differential equation useful as a boundary condition for this type of diffusion, previously used also by ETH Zürich iGEM team 2012.

Overview
RDFZ-China is an active, collaborative team within the iGEM community in China. We share our resources and ideas aiming to create positive impacts on other iGEM teams we collaborated with.
Tsinghua
We provided team Tsinghua with IPTG assay with Ptac plasmid backbone in Tsinghua’s IPTG induction devices in their NEON system.Also we provided AHL for their Lux system.Tsinghua was generous to provide us some lab space and equipments to work on our projects. We worked close, both physically and intellectually, to create maximum impacts on our team projects.
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
This year, we provided SJTU-BioX-Shanghai with plasmids expressing acoustic reporter genes arg1 and arg2. They were applied to report the location of cancer foci combining with ultrasound in their project “E.Coli for Colon Health Observation”. We also shared protocols and equipments regarding non-invasive bacteria monitoring in our section of gas vesicles.
Great Bay China
Zeyu Tang from the team, RDFZ-China, kindly provided help on modeling for team GBC. To be specific, Zeyu gave them one document about previous work he has done on the fermentor model, which contains deterministic ODEs for predicting the productivity of engineered bacteria in the fermentor. In addition, Zeyu wrote another document which illustrates the deduction of Hill equation, helping them create their model simulation.
Knowing GreatBay was constructing a constitutive expressing GFP into the bacterial genome, we enquired for it and used it as a capacity monitor for characterizing the expression burden. Greatbay kindly gave it to us as a gift.
BFSUICC-China
Our team leader in 2017, Bowen Xiao, did a report on strategies preparing the iGEM competition; then the two teams shared resources and had a conversation on the biggest problems encounter during iGEM. Team BFSUICC-China in September met with us to discuss project updates and Jamboree preparation.

Toulouse,2015," discovered during the summer that the team from METU High School in Ankara was working on the same subject as us, the fight against Varroa destructor. We had a Skype conversation with them about the way we could help each other out.
Skype conversation with the Ankara team. Even if the connection was poor, we exchanged a lot of ideas and the discussion was fruitful.
Based on their idea we decided to create a survey to be launched in Turkey and France in order to have a better idea of the extent of beehives’ infestation by varroas. The results of this survey are presented below.
From France
We wish to underline the fact that in France there are few professional beekeepers, most of them are amateurs and own only a few hives. Thus there is no unity between these beekeepers, nor any syndicate. Hence the beekeepers that answered our survey were already interested in our project and aware of the problem caused by Varroa. We would like to kindly thank them for their participation and their help:
Matthieu Bourgeois,  Michel Rives, François Sénéchal, Daniel Goubert, Lauras, Sébastien Bernard, Henri Martin, Marie Nadau, Michel Muller, Charlotte Bompard, Bruno Frémont, Gérard Corvée, Jean Rouquet.
As said previously, all beekeepers having answered the survey know about varroa and other ailments of the bees, such as American/European foulbrood,  varroosis (caused by varroa), mycosis, chronic paralysis, nosema, sacced or chalk brood, deformed wings virus, colony collapse syndrome, acariosis or other dangers like the Asian hornet (a predator), pesticides or mold.
Impacts of Varroa’s presence:
Varroa itself acts both as a parasite feeding itself of the bee’s hemolymph, which weakens it, but also as a vector of pathogens like viruses that spread in an already weakened colony.  A beehive’s infestation by varroa is visible through:
The presence of bees with deformed or atrophied wings
The decrease of honey yield
The weakening of the colony
In the most serious cases, the death of the queen and total loss of the colony
Beekeepers observed an exponential growth of varroa population in the colonies during summer. Infestation stays at a bearable level during the summer, and it increases tremendously at the end of it, leading to the death of the colonies during fall or winter.
Needless to say, this infestation has"

Mid-Atlantic Meetup
On July 13th, we participated in the 2018 Mid-Atlantic Meetup hosted by the UMaryland iGEM team. It was a great experience of presenting and exchanging ideas with other iGEM teams, including UMaryland, William and Mary, Virginia, Georgia State and Richard Montgomery. We got good feedback from those teams, and their interest in our project and our presentation animations really motivated us. From listening to their presentations, we obtained some helpful tips in delivering a presentation. Moreover, thanks to this opportunity, we were able to meet the William and Mary team, which led to more discussion and the collaboration between us.
      
William and Mary
After realizing the advantages of 3G assembly developed by William and Mary, we were excited to test their procedure and prove the feasibility of their assembly method.
3G assembly uses Golden Gate and Gibson assembly to construct a variety of multi-part circuits. Compared to traditional DNA assembly methods, 3G is quicker and less expensive; circuits with multiple parts in it can be constructed in a day. More information on 3G assembly can be found here
After connecting with the William and Mary team at the Mid-Atlantic Meetup, we received a clearly written protocol and a 3G assembly kit with a very nice greeting. It was a very simple procedure, and by following the protocol, we were able to successfully assemble the parts using this method.
      
As seen in the Golden Gate gel extraction images, multiple parts were assembled together, forming transcriptional units of the correct length.
Experiment 1: Construction of 5 Single Transcriptional Unit Circuits
Experiment 2: Construction of 4 Circuits with 2 Transcriptional Units Each
We would like to thank the William and Mary team for sharing this assembly method with us!

Madrid-OLM,2018," could enjoy a pleasant evening of board games and conversations with the rest of the teams. At night a meeting was also organized in a pub to end a day where we had met many new people.
The second (and last day) had two interesting activities. The first was the meetings with different experts from the university, which privately asked each team about controversial issues. To see if these issues had been taken into account and the possible solutions and consequences were debated.
To close the event, a poster presentation session was held, which was very enriching to know how to present our project in Boston.
One of the things that were achieved in this meet up was the agreement with the UPF-CRG-Barcelona group to organize an activity in their meet up. An activity that is going to be explained in the following session (and that gave rise to a greater collaboration).
Barcelona
Spanish Meet Up (Barcelona)
This meet up took place between Saturday 18 and Monday 20 August in the city of Barcelona and was organized by one of the two teams of this same city, the UPF-CRG-Barcelona. In it, all the teams from Spain were called, which all but the Valencia team attended. To this meet up they were representing the whole team: Laura, Iván and Francisco. The meet up took place in the Biomedical Research Park of Barcelona (PRBB), the centre where the host team operates and where they started with a welcome activity. This activity consisted of a game where each one of the assistants of each team presented themselves so that the subsequent environment was much more relaxed.
The next activity was the one organized by our team. In this activity, we proposed to carry out a collaborative guide in which each group would give the main ideas on how they have solved the main problems that have arisen in iGEM. The structure we proposed was followed. We collected these ideas and wrote a complete guide. We explain this collaboration in a later section of the collaborations. After this, some playful activities were carried out on the beach, including volleyball games.
During the morning of the second day, a more detailed presentation of each team's project was made. There were 30 minutes to expose each project in detail. This activity was very useful because the rest of the teams, besides getting to know the details of each project well, could intervene to give advice on how to make the presentations. Each team took a series of points in which they could be reinforced in the face of the presentation of the Giant Jamboree.
In the afternoon the time was taken to take a tour of the tourist centre of the city and ended up having"

ABOUT KELN
We worked in collaboration with Kyoto to improve KELN. Kyoto developed KELN, a software for supporting to easily make HTML table, and they kindly offered it to other teams. We actually used KELN to create wiki like Achievement , Protocol , Calendar , and InterLab . In that process, we realized some points to be improved and new potential to apply it to wider work area, so we gave Kyoto team feedbacks.
It't a really helpful software in saving times to create wiki for the small teams like us, so we wish this KELN to be more useful and help more iGEMers.
KELN is now available on https://github.com/iGEMKyoto/KELN/releases .
Discussions with members of UST_Beijing
One of our teammate visited University of Science and Technology Beijing. We had two purposes. One was to compare the rules that applied to the experiment of each country, and discuss its validity. The other was to deepen exchanges between teams by exchanging our opinions.
He received explanation about UST_Beijing’s project, the absorption rate of improvement of oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine there. He observed the animal experiment, too. In addition, he discussed the safety and the law relating to the gene recombination experiments with members of UST_Beijing. For preventing genetically modified organisms escape from laboratory, we picked up an accident which happened in Nagoya University last year, and exchanged opinions that could help each other with either research"
Tianjin,2016,". Almost all the seats were occupied by listeners. Since the iGEM competition is almost a band new term for most students in TUST, many of them showed great interests and talk with us enthusiastically. We gave them a plenty of suggestions according to the experience of our project, and offered encouragement to the students there. We continued our communication online by using a popular Chinese social network Wechat. They will recruit members this semester and decided to register a team next year.
3.QUESTIONNAIRE COLLABORATION
We team Tianjin contacted Team Pasteur , Team Pittsburgh , Team Valencia UPV , Team Virginia and Team NTU about the collaboration in July. Then we established and led a survey union with the support of them. We asked each team submit two or three questions about their own project and one question about synthetic biology or iGEM, and integrated the questions to the final version questionnaire.
Then, we posted it on twitter and facebook, many iGEMers participated in it and many iGEM teams reposted it on their homepage. We are very delighted to see their enthusiasm which encourages us a lot!

4.COMMUNICATION WITH PKU
Six representatives of Tianjin University iGEM 2016 Team arrived Peiking University on a rainy afternoon of 19th August and  had a long lovely dicussion meeting with three other teams, Beijing Institute of Technology(Team BIT-China),University of Chinese Academy of Science(Team UCAS) and the ebullient host, Peiking University iGEM team. On the very beginning of the meeting, each team leader gave a brief introduction on their projects. And team Tianjin's project attracted great interests in the environment problem of PET-degradation. After each team's presentation, we started to share our new ideas and problems we crossed with during the experiment, which was a very helpful and encouraging session where we help each other fix the experimental problems. In a nutshell, this short trip to Beijing is a win-win collaboration.

Beta Testing Initiative
This year Michigan Software focused on beta testing as a form of collaboration. We sent out a call to all iGEM teams through several mediums, and received responses from the iGEM teams of MSU, Carroll High School, IIT Madras, Westminster University, the University of Florida, and our sister team Michigan Synthetic Biology. The teams followed instructions to upload a protocol and viewed several of the key features of our site, and were then asked to provide feedback. For example, they were asked what information might also be useful to have when searching for protocols. The complete survey guiding the testing can be found here (https://goo.gl/forms/TJOCenKrEzsICL2g1) (embed this later).
Through this collaboration, we gained quite valuable feedback and insight into how scientists and science students not only use our software, but how they see it and what improvements they believe we should implement. As a software team comprised mainly of computer science students, this feedback is essential to the further development of our software. It helps us determine whether or not our project is useful to the target community. In exchange for their feedback, we provided assistance to the teams with their wikis. If they encountered issues while formatting or styling their wikis, we helped them with the HTML and web design aspects, areas of software where we have expertise.

Bi-directional collaboration
Our software focus on search and design which highly relies on users’ feedbacks. We asked HKUST to use the our software and got a positive feedback. They said they struggled a lot when they brain-stormed at first and found it’s hard to find the synthetic biology work with similar topic straightly and connectively, which is also why they want us to build a visualization tool for them, actually for the whole community. Besides, since the programmer in their team has a strong background in Computer Science, whom win the Gold Medal of International Olympiad in Informatics(IOI), we also discussed a lot on the backend and algorithm of our project, which turned out to be quite helpful for both of us. Besides, we also visit their lab and got some advice on the experiments implementation.

Ideas of standardization and other engineering principles have been fully understood and applied by each team in the process of wet lab implementation. However, we also talked about the phenomena on regulation leaking and other unpredictable aspects in biology experiments where we encouraged each other for further research and study.
SYSU-CHINA
We collaborated with SYSU-CHINA for holding the Annual Biology Festival on our campus and exchanged our ideas on Synthetic Biology and iGEM frequently. Besides, they also give us some practical advice on Interlab Study and the validation experiment while our knowledge on modeling and data processing also advised them on their modeling construction part. Also check on SYSU-CHINA's wikipage

AFCM-Egypt,2017," The most innovative team we ever met. As usual we started our calls by explaining our projects. Then we discussed the modeling part as we offered them help with blinder program for protein modeling. We also helped them translating their card game that was originally made in German into Arabic. And we have to confess this card game was adorable
We have helped some other iGEM teams such as ""Cologne-Duesseldorf, Cardiff Wales, Amazonas_Brazil, BIT china, UNebraska-Lincoln, Greece""   through filling in their surveys helping them get better results and exchange knowledge.

Project: Magneto-bacter vinelandii Magnetosome-forming Azotobacter vinelandii with Downstream Applications  
In our collaboration work with the Chinese University of Hong Kong iGEM team, we were given the task to assist them with their project by doing a simulation that look into the interaction between GFP-nanobody to different concentrations of GFP. It is our honor to be able to collaborate and participate in their project. A wonderful experience we have gained through.
Background
The project of the CUHK iGEM team is to explore the use of magnetosome together with GFP-specific nanobody for immunoprecipitation. Magnetosome is an organelle with a magnetic iron crystal surrounded by a lipid bilayer. It is derived from magnetotactic bacteria which is used for navigation through sensing the Earth magnetic field. Biomolecules such as antibodies can be immobilized on magnetosomes for various scientific applications. One such applications is using magnetosomes together with nanobodies for immunoprecipitation reactions. To make the experiment measurable, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-specific nanobody was used (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Schematic diagram of a magnetosome (adsorbed with GFP-specific nanobodies) interacting with GFPs
Task
Simulate the binding dynamics of a fixed concentration of magnetosome with GFP specific nanobody expressed on its surface in different initial concentrations of antigens (GFP). 
Calculation
Software - SimBiology
SimBiology is a toolbox in Matlab that enable us to model and simulate the dynamics of the association and dissociation between molecules. Most of the function can be utilized through its GUI (Graphical User Interface).
Once the model is constructed (i.e. the mathematic relationships between molecules are set up, parameters such as association constant, molarity of reagent, etc. are provided), we can simulate the reaction or even scan through one or more variables. The “scan” function enables us to simulate the dynamics of the system when some parameters, such as the initial concentration of the reagent, are at different values.
Assumptions
1). All nanobodies are bound on the surface of a magnetosome, i.e. no free"

 NEFU_China
We have established a partnership with NEFU_China and reached an agreement of helping examine the effectiveness of carrier. First, they cloned EGFP cDNA from pEGFPN2 vectors using NheI and BamHI. Second, they used EcoRI and NheI to cut pesc-trp plasmid, and then they inserted the EGFP sequence and pFUS1 into pesc-trp plasmid to complete the construction of pFUS1-EGFP carrier.We used EcoRI and BamHI to cut the pFUS1-EGFP carrier, we helped them to verify the correctness of pFUS1-EGFP carrier.
And what we constructed is a plasmid containing GroES gene and GroEL gene. GroES / GroEL belongs to the chaperonin family of molecular chaperones and they can enhance the correct folding efficiency of proteins. NEFU_China was digested with BamH I-Vsp I and Bcu I-Vsp I to verify the validity of the plasmid. Click here to see them: https://2018.igem.org/Team:NEFU_China/Collaborations
 BNU-China
We collaborate with BNU-China to optimize the project each other. During our experiment we found that the adhE gene which leads to the production of ethanol is competitive to butanol production in their synthetic pathway. So BNU-China give us their assistance in knocking out the adhE gene with their project. This year they are making effort in applying synthetic biology methods, constructing a novel pathway to screen mutants by giving target strains growth advantages. Therefore, they provides us their technical guidance for crisper cas9 and plasmids we need, as well as helping us design primers. At the same time we help them with their repeating experiment in detecting optimal concentration and optimal induction time of salicylic acid-induced expression.

 BUCT-China
One of the keys to experiment of BUCT-China was the construction of plasmid. Linking the operon they construct to the vector plasmid is the key to this step. The ends of the operon are BglII and XhoI digested ends, respectively, which are complementary to the vector plasmid. Thereafter, they performed an enzymatic ligation of the operon with the vector plasmid fragment under the conditions of a "

．NTHU Collaborate Memo :
In the beginning, we were interested in the 2016 iGEM NCKU project which is about the signal detection on urine samples by single frequency laser reflection. After discussing the whole progress and detail, it inspires us to engage in the UV excitation fluorescence to detect our sample. In addition to mutual inspection and troubleshooting with both projects, we also presented our detector design to iGEM NCKU and shared different experimental strategies. During the last meeting, we learned that we had an identical commercial value in aquaculture. As a result, we offered our investigation results of Aquaculture questionnaire to them to strengthen their data integrity by the information of market demand and consumer’s ideas. Furthermore, we looked for other teams who were also participating in pollution detection and trying to combine all the detectors in our demo-board. Nitrate detector from iGEM NCKU offers us a great opportunity to strengthen this idea. On the other hand, they also developed a special boat combining several extra functions other than nitrate sensor, like GPS, radio, motor etc., which is also an independent and integral equipment ready for adding other sensors like our IoT system. Thus, we are also happy to offer them our blueprint of EDCs sensor which might also offer them a chance to broaden their sensing target!
[ Figure. 1.4-1 ] Cross section of EDCs sensor based on fluorescence.
． NCKU Collaborate Memo :
In this September, we received the invitation to have a collaboration with NTHU. NTHU detected environmentally hazardous substances while our project is focusing on the sensing of nitrate concentration. They try to give a broader aspect. However, we try to give a more detail sensing system. Thus, we had a profound discussion of both teams’ projects. Moreover, we also shared our fluorescence idea of 2016 and 2017 with them.
After mutual inspection and troubleshooting with both projects, we were enlightened to expand our sensing device to detect more substances like environmental hormone even heavy metal in the future, which would make our project more practical. Also, NTHU offered their investigation results of aquaculture questionnaire to us. These questionnaires strengthened"
Genspace,2015," this is found to be in the linear range, then all the other samples will be as well.
Our device required a 200 ul sample, so we found that a 100X dilution (i.e., 2 ul cell extracts re-suspended in 198 ul PIPES buffer) was within the linear range).
Determining the linear range can be done with serial dilutions (e.g., 10, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, and 10^5 dilutions).
Our measurement device is a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (96 well) and we use the Gen5 software.

Our model should focus on the following points:
Binding/dissociation of Cas12a protein with DNA.
Activity of gRNA in complex with Cas12a bound to DNA.
Anything to do with molecular signal? Does it affect gRNA activity/ Cas12a activity?”
How would iGEM CMUQ team collaborate and benefit the TecCEM team ?
We would characterize their plasmid. The plasmids sent would already be cloned in the backbone of pSB1C3. We would have to transform the pSB1C3 plasmids in E. coli strains and characterize the protein expressed. The TecCEM team would provide us with the size of the proteins. The type of column that would be used in the characterization would be Ni column (if available). The team would send their linearized plasmids to CMU-P then CMU-P would send the linearized plasmids to  CMU-Q. This would hopefully shorten the time taken for the plasmids to arrive.
How can TecCEM team benefit iGEM CMUQ team ?
Saliva samples from the local people would be sent and analyzed using the fluorescent device. In the project description,  “In middle eastern populations many carriers are unaware of the mutations that they can pass on to their children and the risk that their offspring are born with the disease.” . TecCEM team can help us test different ethics and populations of the world by sending saliva samples from Mexican people that are carriers of the disease.
TecCEM team would characterize the Cas12 protein. We would send the sequence cloned in pSB31C plasmid to them and they would characterize the Cas12 protein.
We Would like to thank our sponsors"

This summer, as the UCL iGEM team, we really knew that the sky was the limit! And we knew that to do so, one must aim high and far, and that involves working with people outside your own geographic area and discipline. Not only that, one of the criteria for GOLD is the collaborations with other universities participating in iGEM competition. We did aim to make this project as multidisciplinary as possible, involving people with a variety of background and skills. Our collaboration took multiple forms, from the development of new standards for Parts Registry and user-friendly Parts, to the ethics aspect by filling out surveys of other iGEM teams.
Art & Design Institutes
From the beginning, we have been working very closely with students from both Slade school of Arts and Central Saint Martin's College of Art & Design. They have been an integral part of all the design and artistic aspects of our project from that of the poster, to the wiki page and T-shirts etc. It has been a great challenge to bring individuals from outside are discipline, and introduce them to our work and enable them to understand the prime elements of what we are doing so that they can then grasp this and be able to put it in some sort of artistic form.  For a sneak preview of their work, visit their page Designs
Cambridge Part Development

Freiburg,2016," and founded an information exchange platform named Newsletter. This year 46 teams from 21 countries and regions joined them! This issue consists of the following five main elements: introduction, human practice, collaboration, discussion and survey and of course we took our part in it and contributed our project to raise awareness of Ulcerative colitis. Read this interesting Newsletter here (our part starts on page 40!). Check out their project here.
Virginia 2016 iGEM team
This year’s iGEM team of Virginia conducted a survey about biocontainment in which we gladly participated. We learnt a lot about this important topic and are happy we could help. Check out their project here.
Evry 2016 iGEM team
Thanks to the Evry team we were educated in the field of polylactic acid (PLA) as an interesting molecule for biodegradable plastic. By partaking their survey we supported their idea. Check out their project here.
Tel- Hai Israel 2016 iGEM team
The Tel- Hai iGEM team aims for a new way of targeting the CRISPR components to access and fix a specific mutation to take a step forward to successfully treat Cystic fibrosis. To arouse awareness they collected pictures of people holding roses for their #sixtyfiveroses campaign. To support their honorable goal, we posed for a good cause.  Another great idea from their team was to set up a trivia game, to unite different iGEM teams and their projects. This game is a perfect opportunity to excite people for the field of synthetic biology and easy way to learn about novel topics.

Overview
Our collaborations this year have proved to be really successful and fruitful for us. This year, we collaborated with iGEM Berlin, iGEM Manchester and iGEM Glasgow. Not only did we collaborate with other iGEM teams to improve our project, we were also involved in mentoring iGEM IISER Mohali team this year around. It was hugely fulfilling for us to work with all these teams despite being so distant from each other. We would sincerely like to thank iGEM for giving all of us synthetic biology enthusiasts a platform to interact with so many like-minded people. Hoping for many more such fruitful collaborations in the future.

The IIT Delhi iGEM team whole-heartedly collaborated with Berlin team. Berlin team was working on the affordable, practical and effective diagnostic of the widespread third world parasitic disease -Tapeworm Infection. Since India is one of the countries where millions of people are infected by this parasite, IIT Delhi directed Berlin team to a suitable site. Here is the link to the detailed description of the complete journey:

As a student-led start-up team we decided to approach the Taiwanese teams NTCU and NYMU, who had gone through multiple rounds of iGEM competitions in the past years, to receive some tips and tricks of the competition process and team system development.
NTCU Formosa team
Both teams in Taiwan are working on pesticides that are targeted to a specific agricultural epidemic that has caused great loss in Taiwanese farmlands. These teams emphasised raising  awareness for the implementation of safe biotechnology into daily use, to elevate the quality of human lives , and the environment. The NTCU Formosa team kindly presented their work to us, as well as sharing details of their past iGEM projects and meet-ups, to give us more of an idea how the iGEM competition works. They elaborated on their human practise projects, which included working closely  with the Ministry of Agriculture in Taiwan, and showed their dedication on making the agriculture sector a more biotech/engineering- friendly place. We shared with them the different policies and regulations of New Zealand regarding to GMO products as New Zealand turn out to have stricter regulations on this matter.
NYMU iGEM Team
It was lovely meeting up with NYMU iGEM Team team leaders. The team showed absolute dedication and passion on both the lab and human practise. Finding that both teams shared the same vision of bringing positivity into our communities by utilising our bioengineering knowledge, it was not hard at all to fit into this passionate team. The team leaders showed us around their lab area and kindly shared their detailed and well planned perspective on their human practice project which most definitely broaden our horizon as a start-up team on how extensively an iGEM can affect and influence the community. We exchanged with them our experience as a start-up team on what challenge we faced just to get the team together as we are all interested to know what would be the different kind of administrative barriers from a team that have a developed system and a newly set-up. We concluded that the main difference would be the focus that shifted from the system development of the sub-teams and relationship building with the University to inter-team communication and interaction within team members. This is discovery will assist with both teams sustainability in iGEM competition in the future to come.

Queen's Canada iGEM team was very excited to collaborate with various other iGEM teams this past summer. Together, we were able to build a stronger iGEM community, and progress in our respective projects - the insight of others providing great advancement.
This year, QGEM collaborated with the Ontario Genetically Engineered Machine (oGEM) Collective, which is composed of iGEM teams from the universities of Toronto, Guelph (new this year), Waterloo, McMaster, and Ottawa. With oGEM, we meet several times during the year to discuss ways to promote iGEM in Ontario, funding strategies, project troubleshooting, and new ways to collaborate for wet lab, dry lab, and policy and practice departments.
One of the oGEM collaborations featured this year was promoting iGEM to new potential teams, and creating a detailed database of helpful tips and tricks for wiki development - a task most teams noticeably struggle with. Through web conferencing, email, and simply communicating ideas in person at the oGEM meetings, these valuable tidbits and thoughts were shared. The ability to discuss QGEM's wiki struggles with others, and gain insight into possible methods of remediation, was extremely valuable to QGEM.
Canadian iGEM Newsletter
This summer, the University of Calgary initiated a Canadian iGEM Newsletter - a fantastic opportunity QGEM was eager to participate in. As each participating iGEM team shared monthly recaps (pertaining to all aspects of their respective projects), QGEM was able to easily learn what other iGEM teams were up to. Thus, allowing faster communication between teams given a deeper understanding of each other's work, and therefore, stronger collaborations. QGEM has participated in all Canadian iGEM Newsletters to date (two volumes).
Participation in the Canadian iGEM Newsletter allowed QGEM to realize the parallels existing between QGEM's project, and Waterloo's. Ultimately resulting in communicating the idea of a collaboration between the two teams.

Lab Collaboration
When building a colony, cells communicate with one another through different methods, exchanging all sorts of molecules and therefore information, enabling them to coexist and grow as a whole. Inter teams’ collaborations in iGEM play a very similar role in its community. The teams interact with the community, telling them what they need. A team, as a singular cell, communicates how they can offer knowledge, experience and even gear to others that seek it. Once a beneficiary connection has been established, the teams share detailed information regarding their project and explain how the other team can help them accomplish it. This year, our team collaborated with the Köln / Düsseldorf iGEM Team.
Our task was to create a S. cerevisiae cell which lacked both PEX7 and PEX5 genes. We had the choice of either deleting PEX7 in a dPEX5 strain or deleting PEX5 in a dPEX7 strain. Knocking PEX5 could damage genes PRP28 (upstream) and MNN10 (downstream), having consequences we would not oversee. Therefore, our team decided to knock out PEX7 in the dPEX5 strain. Because of our experience performing different gene knock outs in our project, this process was much easier for us.

We have established the collaborative relationship with Jilin_China NEFU_China XJTLU_CHINA and FAFU-CHINA during the competition. However, we thought that the universities mentioned above have helped us a lot more than we had returned because of our first time to participate that contest and lacking of experience.
HIEPING SECTION
NEFU-China for NEU-China
We have invited some predecessors coming from the Northeast Forestry University to                                 introduce iGEM competition to us. It was a very cherish chance for us to know iGEM                                 closely and to understand diverse ideas proposed by the teams coming from all over the word,                                 which made us very excited. So, students who were from Northeast Forestry University gave                                 us the first lesson about the competition and they guided us to solve some troubles we                                 met at the beginning of registration such as registering on the web, remitting by wire                                 transfer, filling in the form correctly and so on. So, we are very appreciated for                                 their selfless help and efficient guides.
NEU-China for XJTLU_CHINA and JLU_China
In addition, our team was also ready to help others and glad to communicate with other                                 teams. We has provided some essential reagents and plasmid to other team after                                 verifying them right. We provided LUDOX - an interlab reagent to XJTLU_CHINA as soon as                                 they asked. Since we didn’t join in the plan of interlab experiment, we thought that                                 there might be some requirements of interlab reagents or plasmid. So, we pronounced                                 the case that we could provided our materials in the social communication platform. With the                                 competition going on, JLU_China had asked us for some materials and then we send                                 them the Test Device 3: J23117.B0034.E0040.B0015 in pSB1C3 and the FITC Standard.                                 We were pleasure to gave them a hand when they need help and that interaction led a                                 more closely communication between us. We have often exchange some experience and                                 experimental skills up to now.

XMU-China,2018," force, and a flow meter that filters and encapsulates cell droplets. These devices greatly improve the precision of the entire device.
XMU-China also made a relevant introduction about the design of microfluidic chips. What's more, our team additionally answered questions about how to control liquid flow in the centrifugal force-driven microfluidic chip.
Figure 1：The design of microfluidic chips of SUSTech iGEM(left) and XMU-China(right).
In terms of the project, we believe SUSTech iGEM team's using chips to study the interaction between cells is very innovative. From our professional perspective, we gave some advice on cell signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions, and recommended several related articles to them, hoping to help them. Based on our project, they raised some questions about whether our cell-free system belongs to the field of synthetic biology. We put forward our views, and the two parties had a futher discussion. We believe that synthetic biology is not a simple use of biobrick to construct gene loops. Instead, it should be a broader definition. We think that standard components are like building blocks, but it is up to people to decide what items should be joint together, rather than building blocks themselves. Therefore, biobrick can be used to build systems outside the genetic loop.
In addition, both of us exchanged ideas on the Art&Design. We carried out visual design communications with SUStech on aspects involving poster, Wiki and PPT. We showed them our methods and ideas in visual designing, including drawing graphics of experimental process and other details.

At CCiC, we are very delighted to find that BIT projects have a lot of intersections with us. We have similar representations.Therefore, our team communicated with them in the following three aspects.
The first is the exchange of ideas on the subject. We have had a two-hour telephone conversation with them. On the phone, we exchanged the purpose of the project and some detailed designs, introduced our own project to them and proposed some questions for each other.
Secondly, we asked the BIT team about a difficulty in the experimental program. I am very happy that they are effective. We proved that our aptamers and complementary chains are combined. We gave the results back to them and gave them suggestions of improvement. In addition, we also exchanged some experimental methods and protocol.
Finally, in order to prove the feasibility of their respective experimental designs, we mailed some materials to each other and successfully verified the effectiveness of the other's combination, which is also a very effective part of our cooperation.

SVCE Indian iGEM meet
The SVCE Indian iGEM meet was held on 23rd July, 2016 at SVCE, Chennai, India.The morning session consisted of presentations by the IIT-Madras, IISc Bangalore and SVCE, each followed by a round of questions from an audience that consisted of SVCE faculty, students and, members of the iGEM teams. The question session highlighted some problems in our idea, helped explore possible offshoots of our idea and also told us about how our idea was perceived by a heterogeneous group of individuals who are biotechnology literate. Some of the issues raised during the meet about our idea are summarized below:
a. (Problem) Is the diauxic media composition required for cellfifuge compatible with the complex media used in industrial scale applications? How will modifying the existing media so as to make cellfifuge applicable affect cost of manufacturing?
< b. (Problem) What level of contamination by Ag43 is expected after downstream processing?
c. (Problem) How does the addition of an extra step in downstream processing, i.e., removing Ag43 by using metal affinity chromatography affect the net cost of protein production using the cellfifuge sysem?

Mingdao,2016," Pcons-RBS-LO-AOX/pSB1C3, BBa_K1991009) in the LB media supplemented with Chloramphenicol. And we prepared another one as the control which didn’t have any plasmid. The next day, we centrifuged 1mL of bacteria expressing LO-AOX enzyme followed by being suspended in PBS. The control group was adjusted to the OD values at the same level of the LO-AOX group. After mixing bacterial samples with ethanol, TMB was added as a substrate of HRP and incubated in the dark for 3 min. The color of solution was significantly changed to blue at an OD650 of 1.51 compared to 1.21 in the control group, clearly demonstrating the ethanol was oxidized by AOX. As a result, we proved the function of their BioBrick by testing the AOX enzyme activity.”
This year, our project was inspired by the Blood Glucose Meter (BGM). To develop a Blood Alcohol Meter (BAM) used in the sobriety test, we looked for a help from a biotech company, BIONIME corp. and its spin-off Zensor R&D corp, who are experts in designing and creating electrochemical analyzers.
On august 25th, the executive vice president of Bionime, Dr. Wiley Chung (Shie-Shiun Jung), came to our lab and taught us the electrochemistry and principles behind BGM. He also shared his successful story of creating an innovative BGM and gave valuable advices for us to design a blood alcohol meter.
Zensor Simulator & Zensor test strips
The data of cyclic voltammetry and amperometry
On that day, Dr. Wiley brought an electrochemical simulator designed and created by his research team and himself in Zensor R&D corp. He helped us to examine the chemical properties of AOX enzyme we prepared in our lab. By doing experiments in cyclic voltammetry and amperometry, we obtained data for a calibration curve based on alcohol concentrations. In the end, according to the experimental results, he told us that our products (enzymes) are functional and ready to apply in blood alcohol meter.
It’s definitely a big hit for us to collaborate with a biotech company, BIONIME. By the modeling experiments, we proved that the Alcohol Oxidase we created is functional and the design is practical. With the help of Dr. Wiley, we witnessed the whole process of developing a brand new product. The valuable collaboration not only gave us directions to improve our product, but also let us believe"

iGEM WLC aims to detect E. coli in water while our team’s goal is to detect the EDCs in water. Because we both focus on water quality, we’ve planned to achieve multiple detection integrations that have the ability to detect various pollution, like a Swiss Knife with many functions! However, it would be very struggling for them to build up a detecting equipment and a 3D model because of a lack of an engineering expert in their team. Fortunately, our team has suggested some software resources that may be useful for them, which have given them an orientation to demonstrate their brilliant work. For the 3D modelling, we had gone through the software composition and made our own model. Based on experience, we could also associate them to learn the original model construction method.

Our another partner was NEU-China,whose teammates had a leisure talk about projects with us in our laboratory in the end of the July.We later had collaborated in fluorescence detection tests.They used Microplate Reader to detect the EGFP expression in the hyphae of T.atroviride. Erenow we only observed the fluorescence by fluorescence microscope, the data they provided us were more quantitatively and measurable which proved that we have succeed in expressing heterogenous gene in our aiming chassis.
At the same time, We helped NEU-China to make a luminescence detection by stimulation of forskolin. Forskolin is a kind of adenylate cyclase activator widely used in improving the cAMP level in the cell.We found the fluorescence intensity of the sample added this substance was higher than control group, demonstrating that the reporter gene is available to respond to the activation of the cAMP pathway.

UCAS,2017," for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the"

Amsterdam,2017," the E. Coli physiology, the glyoxylate shunt genes are already present, but repressed by a repressor encoded by the iclR gene (Waegeman et al. , 2011). Deleting this gene will make it possible to have an increased flux through the TCA cycle. Using this knockout with minimal mutations, we receive an E. Coli which follows the same metabolic engineering principles as the Synechocystis strain proposed by iGEM team Amsterdam, and is therefore expected to be stable in terms of production (Fig. 2).
This strain is previously made by Song et al. , (2013) and produced 1.45g/L fumaric acid from 15g/L glucose in 24h in flask culture under aerobic conditions. This strain can be further optimized for higher fumaric acid yields; however, this always comes at the risk of impairing other functions.
Figure 2. Central central metabolic pathways in E. coli after engineering E. coli for fumarate production. Thick arrows indicate increased flux by the overexpression of the corresponding gene. The X indicates that the deletion of the corresponding gene. Enzymes encoded by the genes shown are: fumA,  aerobic Class I fumaric acid hydratase; fumB, anaerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase; fumC, fumaric acid hydratase (fumarase C); iclR, isocitrate lyase repressor. (Adapted from Song et al. (2013))
Fumarates effect on the microbiome of cattle
In theory, fumarate has the potential to decrease methane synthesis in cattle, as it can redirect the available hydrogen into propionate rather than into methane (Fig 3). Fumarate has been proven to reduce methane emission in both in vitro and in vivo studies (Mcginn et al. , 2004). However, a recent in vivo study found no effect of adding fumarate to cattle feed on methane emission. This finding contradicts earlier findings. It is possible that a higher level of supplementation than that used in the recent study would be needed to alter methane production in vivo. It is estimated that the level of supplementation in the recent study provided about 15 mM of fumaric acid (assuming a ruminal volume of 40 L; 116.07 g/mol), although these calculations do not account for fluid dilution rate and passage of fumaric acid from the rumen, which are in vivo factors that do not occur in vitro."

Exeter,2016," BabbleBrick (20$^{th}$) has positions 96 to 100. A scaler $\alpha$ has been included to     increase the range of results. To ensure multiplications don’t result in a null result     the value of each base had a value of 1 added to it. The first checkemethod of one     BabbleBlock can be defined as:
$M_1 = \sum_{n=1}^{bp}(bp_n + 1) . \alpha . bp$ $M_1$: Frequency of CheckMethod 1
$\alpha$: Scaler ($\alpha = 5$ in this example)
Fig. 3. The frequency of checkmethod 1 for all possible bits of information in a babbleBlock system containing two BabbleBricks.
Fig. 4. The frequency of checkmethod 1 for all possible bits of information in a babbleBlock system containing three BabbleBricks.
This method results in Fig.3 and Fig.4 for a 2 and 3 BabbleBlock system respectively,     which shows a large improvement over the original checksum method. The maximum frequency    of a single checksum has been significantly decreased whichwill lower the probability of    a flase positive occuring; this is largely due to the large range of results available to    the method. However, there is still room for improvement as the shaded area of the graph    indicates that on a smaller scale the frequency of checkmethod 1 varies between high and low    values. Eliminating this fluctuation would allow for the data to be spread out more evenly.    To improve this     method a second layer of multiplication will be implamented, each digit will     now be multiplied by a constant depending on its relative position in the BabbleBrick.

Lab Pats First Interlab Meeting (10/05/2017)
The Cadets2Vets team had a Skype call with Dallas McDonald from the Lab Pats (AFRL) team. Our teams had Skype’d previously during the summer and we wanted to talk a little more about the Interlab Measurement Study.
We are sharing the results from our Interlab Study and wanted to see if Lab Pats had measured data that was similar to ours. Cadets2Vets had graphed the fluorescence values from the 6 Devices and positive and negative controls, and found that the Devices all had variable performance, although there were a few Devices that had very low GFP fluorescence. We also found that some Devices performed at or below the LB+Chloramphenicol blank, which means that the previously known autofluorescence of LB was being picked up by the plate reader. The Devices that performed worse than LB+Chloramphenicol are promoter/RBS sites that we would want to avoid in the future when trying to express GFP, because the amount of GFP expressed was unable to rise higher than the background autofluorescence under the given experimental conditions.
Cadets2Vets will work with Dallas to establish a collaboration where Cadets2Vets will send Dallas the plasmids we have created so that he can help us characterize the GFP fluorescence. We will base the assay off the InterLab study and we will consider these questions:
Do our plasmids produce GFP as they are expected to?
How does our plasmid compare to the Interlab positive and negative controls?

FOURTH INTER-TEAM MEETING (10/05/2017)
Members of the Cadets2Vets team had a teleconference with Yoshi Goto from the UW-Seattle iGEM team. The Washington team has a really interesting and complex project that involves the creation of a bioreactor and manipulation and development of a violacein reporter system to monitor metabolite production from chemical reactions made by bacteria or yeast.
The violacein pigment is produced through a series of 5 different genes and altering the synthetic pathway can produce different"

Unmask Our Shores
We organized a beach clean-up 17 th June, 2018 at the Marina Beach, near the light house, to                     create awareness about Ocean Acidification to the general public. We asked if the REC                     Chennai iGEM Team and IIT Madras iGEM Team would like to collaborate with us to do the                     beach clean-up. They were very enthusiastic and accepted our proposal.
We, along with the other teams assembled at the location at 6 am, and we bought gloves and                     bags to collect all the garbage. All of us worked diligently for one and a half hours. At the                     same time, we talked about iGEM and our project to all the interested people at the beach                     distributed pamphlets to them too.
After the hard work, we celebrated the birthday of one of the REC Chennai team members                     and went out to a hotel for breakfast as one big iGEM Team!!
The Nutty Bitter Gourd Salad
The Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies, who are working on creating probiotic based                     solutions to diabetes, asked teams to share a healthy recipe that they could put together to                     make a handbook to give out to elderly people. In collaboration with their team, we came up                     with a recipe that was healthy, tasty and super fun to make.
All-India iGEM Conference
The iGEM VIT team attended the All India iGEM meetup hosted by the iGEM IISc team.             The All India meet-up included almost all the participating teams from the country including             the teams from the hosting college, IISER Kolkata, IISER Bhopal, REC Chennai, IIT-             Madras, and ICT Mumbai.
Hosted over a period of 3 days from the 27th of July, 2018 to the 30th of July, 2018, the             meet-up provided a platform for all teams to present their project ideas and concepts without             fear of criticism. The meet-up gave us the opportunity to get both positive as well as negative             feedback on the project idea we presented to our peers which greatly helped us develop and             incorporate these suggestions into the project.
This also gave us the opportunity to get various problems troubleshooted and get a whole             new perspective from iGEMers who are facing the same problems"

Gibson Ridge Software
Mr. Gibson meeting with our hardware committee.
Mr. Gibson, the CEO and Founder of Gibson Ridge Software, worked with the Lambert High School iGEM team, specifically with the Hardware/Software committee to provide advice and feedback on the Chrome-Q. He met with the team during each iteration of the design and helped troubleshoot the electronic circuit.  He also gave direction and feedback for developing the software.
University of Georgia
Gaurav working with the plate reader at UGA.
By collaborating with the University of Georgia’s iGEM team, Lambert iGEM was able to complete the interlab measurement experiments.  These were a series of detailed protocols involving the use of a plate reader to ensure accuracy within the fluorescence data. This allowed both teams to compare their data and openly discuss any unusual results that could have caused issues in the data analysis and interpretation.  Specific errors were discovered and both teams were able to improve upon the technique demonstrating inter-laboratory studies to create a similar, comparable method of GFP measurement.
TAS Taipei
Lambert iGEM team in a conference call with TAS Taipei
Lambert iGEM sent Chrome-Q design files to TAS Taipei early in the design process.  A video conference call was held and subsequent communications took place to offer help and receive feedback. Specifically TAS Taipei gave Lambert some tips on integrating human practices. Lambert was able to share information about working in underfunded labs.
Emory iGEM Team: Ethics Collaboration
Lambert iGEM team with the Emory iGEM team
The Lambert iGEM team was able to collaborate with the Emory iGEM team to discuss the ethics about CRISPR Cas9 along with a group of other Emory students and professors. Through this discussion, they were able to gain knowledge about the different perspectives of genetic modification and to what extent people are willing to justify experiments as ethical. Also, the Emory iGEM team led a tour of their labs to demonstrate their daily lab workings, allowing both teams to grasp the overall purpose of each other’s projects.  Lambert used this ethics conference as a springboard for their own investigations into ethics. "

Vice versa, they assisted us on the interLab , especially on the plate reader.
With common interests, Team:NAU-CHINA
As Team:NAU-CHINA in Nanjing found out that we had parts Part:BBa_K2549061 , Part:BBa_K2549062 that they could use to build their genetic circuits. They reached out to us, and we gladly provided them with these plasmids with detailed sequence information and instructions on how to use them. The parts we provided were ultimately very effective in constructing and testing their signal transduction system. The parts and the plasmids containing them are listed below:
Part:BBa_K2549061 LaG16 with mNotch1 extented core region and tTA, which we have tested and characterized in 2017 .
Part:BBa_K2549062 : surface EGFP (surEGFP), which we used as one of our antigens against the SynNotch receptor. We have also characterized surEGFP in 2017 .
☺ Manufacturing and distributing, Team:OUC-China
Sharing a similar idea on how to promote basic science, Team:OUC-China and we, Team:Fudan , both wanted to provide a visual and entertaining way for people to understand synthetic biology. We took different approaches toward this mutual goal. They created a comic book on theories and technologies of synthetic biology . And we helped promote synthetic biology by hosting a Bio-Art display and propagating our ENABLE project and synthetic biology at the school fair, in both of which we distributed and displayed their book to grab the interest of the audience.
Surprise visits, Team:USTC
When our teammates went to USTC to visit their high school friends who studies there in July, they contacted the USTC iGEM team at impromptu. Received with enthusiasm, our teammates happily shared our ENABLE project design with them. The USTC iGEM team gave us a thorough introduction on their lab and project. Later in August, one of their team member also surprised us with his presence in Shanghai, so we delightfully gave him a campus and lab tour in return. We also had an in-depth project communication at CCiC.

UIUC Illinois 2018 iGEM Midwest Meet Up w/ Washington University in St. Louis
On August 17th, a couple of team members from Washington University in St. Louis iGEM team came to our Midwest meet up. We listened to Dr. Ting Lu give a presentation on his work in the field of synthetic biology. Both teams gave presentations to each other about our projects and the work we were conducting. We talked about problems we were facing and gave each other advice on how to overcome these problems. The WashU iGEM team was having some trouble with their PCR, so we gave them advice by explaining how we successfully completed ours. They provided us with resources needed to obtain important materials for our research for free such as competent cells. We had a great time learning and getting to know each other.
University of Nebraska-Lincoln Collaboration
Additionally, we collaborated with the University of Nebraska- Lincoln on their new safety project: A ""Safety Case"". A Safety Case is:""a proactive technique used to visualize the safety of a synthetic biology project and its end goal."" One can use this program to visualize any possible safety concerns with your current project. We input our data in and saw that we should consider adding a kill switch to our Yeast and LAB strains in case they ever were ever introduced into nature.
Collaboration with Imperial College of London
We helped  Imperial College of London on their ""Lets talk about this"" project. This project allow colleagues to better communicate and solve internal social conflicts. This could create a better work environment and a more efficient work space

Meeting with Nanjing Agricultural University:
https://2017.igem.org/Team:NAU-CHINA/Collaborations
In the process of talking with team leaders and the students in charge of each module, we had a brief understanding of the content of their project, and put forward a lot of practical and useful suggestions for the problems they are facing.
Below is a brief summary of our proposal:
1.Human Practice:
We both have expressed great interest in the Best integrated Human Practise Prize. Therefore we shared our HP content with each other and worked together to study the award criteria for the gold medal and decided that we will improve our activities.
2. Project:
Members in Nanjing Agricultural University did a survey among farmers in rural areas, but the results are not pleasant enough. We made some relative constructive suggestions.
Question 1: At present, there are far too few studies on yeast. And there is no accurate data on the sequence of yeast promoter gene.
Answer:
1. Find a relevant company to help the sequencing;
2. There is a mentor doing yeast-related research in Tsinghua University. Contact him for help;
3. Contact other teams who has similar needs and apply for the iGEM authorities for publication of relevant information.
 Question 2: The government did not publish the data of the amount of vomit toxin in wheat products in the market.
Answer:
1. Apply for checking the official information from the China Food and Drug Administration;
2 Go to the market get sampling by buying wheat products, and then carry out vomit toxin test.
Question 3: The yeast is eucaryote. Compared with the Escherichia coli, the experiment of competent cell culture and plasmid importation are more difficult and time-consuming, so that the project progress will be slow.
Answer:
1.Optimize the yeast. Screen more suitable yeast to act as a chassis organism through related experiments;
2.It is recommended that the project be completed in steps. For example, do wheat vomit toxin research this year and rice related pathogenic toxin research next year. In this way, the research of main crop can be completed.
Question 4: The sustainability of the project needs to be improved. Answer: Apply for Entrepreneurship Project in NAU and industrialize this project"

rPeking University
    On July 14, 2018, we came to Peking University for a collaboration and exchanged ideas with Peking University's IGEM team.
    After the self-introduction, we introduced each other's projects and proposed suggestions on the project. The project of Peking University's IGEM team is to design a protein scaffold to increase the enzymatic reaction rate and yield, and hope to be applied to industrial production. In the exchange, we raised our confusion and exchanged experimental design.
    Later, we introduced our own projects, and Peking University students also made opinions for the improvement of our projects. In addition to considering whether urate oxidase can be expressed and correctly modified in E. coli nissle, we should also consider whether UOX can pass through the intestinal wall cells from the intestinal tract into the blood, rather than being ""absorbed"" by the intestinal wall cells. In addition, due to the existence of certain immunological rejection of human uric acid oxidase, the immune response of UOX in the blood is also a problem that I must think about and solve.
    During the collaboration and exchange with Peking University's IGEM team, we saw each other's bright spots and re-examined our projects from a new perspective. In such exchanges and thoughts, we believe that we will find problems in our thinking, improve our projects, and make progress together to showcase the charm of Chinese students on the international stage of IGEM.
After that ,Peking University offers us the pSB plasmid.
rNorheastern University
    In August 2018, we came to Shenyang, China, and exchanged ideas with two iGEM teams at Northeastern University, and further explored the next step of cooperation.
    First, we introduced the iGEM project and provided comments on each other's projects. Since our team currently lacks a lethal system, in this exchange, we worked with NEU_China_A to jointly verify and optimize the cold"

· If using a cuvette larger than 1mm then the voltage used should be recalculated to be greater than the voltage allowed for the electroporation apparatus. · While the purpose of the washes are to remove the salt from the cells, washing this many times may run a risk where the pallet may degrade, which reduces the amount of cells required for electroporation. · The time after electroporating and transferring into MRS media for recovery is crucial in making sure that the cells have a chance to be viable.
Collaboration with iGEM Franconia · QR Code · Game app—Pathomon · Getting rid of virus One of the main goals of the International Genetically Engineered Machine foundation is to encourage collaboration between iGEM teams across the world. This year, we had the honor to collaborate with the iGEM Franconia team to help them further develop their game application, Pathomon, by placing a QR code on our poster. The moral of the game is to alleviate a virtual pathogen that has contaminated a large population of participants attending the Giant Jamboree. This game promotes direct social interaction between members to work together to eliminate the outbreak. By having a QR code on our poster, we are supporting iGEM’s goal of team collaboration and communication. To learn more about the Franconia collaboration, click here.

We provided E. coli strains, IPTG and plasmids for NYU-Shanghai to support their experiment. two kinds of functional plasmids were synthesized by us. One was the plasmid of FwYellow chromoprotein, noted for BBa _K1033910. The other was that of Aeblue chromoprotein, noted for BBa_K864401. We also supplied 5ml of BL21 competent cell for them to create new type of E. coli. For inducing the expression of chromoproteins, we gave them IPTG as inducer. All these biology materials were packaged hermetically and Victor Zhou sent them to teammates in NYU-Shanghai in person in order to prevent any separation during the transport. They wanted to use arabinose to induce transcription but no colors showed up, we suggested them that use different concentration of arabinose to find the best concentration to show the color. Because they used arabinose to stimulate transcription, we suggested that IPTG might be a better choice. At that time, we were using IPTG inducible plasmid pET21a respectively with blue chrom"

Discussing the road to Mars
Stanford-Brown-RISD
The supervisor of the Stanford-Brown-RISD (SBR) team, Lynn J. Rothschild, approached us back in the early days of the team with a project that quickly got everyone's attention: Using the mycelium of fungi to help NASA with building a base on Mars. Her own team was also participating in this, but they decided to concentrate on providing the substrate for the fungal materials by using cyanobacteria. Therefore, we have been meeting multiple times over the course of the project, discussing in the beginning what was needed to accomplish the result and which ideas we each had. Furthermore, any problems we had and potential solutions were also brought up.
Fig. 2a - Lynn visited us at DTU.
Lynn Rothschild visited us a couple of times, where she was very helpful in guiding us through what the SBR team was doing and giving us suggestions on what we should be focusing on.
Fig. 2a - The DTU team having a skype meeting with three members of the Stanford Brown team. Fig. 2b - Kyle standing with Lynn and three members of the Stanford team.
Both of our projects rely on the idea of using fungal bricks, and without consulting each other, we discovered that we each had been testing on which substrate to grow it on. We then agreed to send DTU grown bricks to the US, so that they could verify their results on our bricks. The delivery of bricks happened when our supervisor Kyle visited their team.
The importance of modeling the project was also a focus of both our teams. Both teams have created models that describe different stages of the project. Our models can be linked together to describe the whole process from growing the mycelium from a single spore to figuring out how the biomass develops, from how long it takes for a fungus to fill out a form to describe the mechanical properties of the fungus needed to design the final structure on Mars. The illustration below shows the connection between our models.

Cornell,2017,". It is likely that those who align with conservative policies are less likely to reply out of perception that manipulation of genomic information is associated with more liberal policies.
Despite this, we believe that the responses received in Ithaca and other regions of upstate New York are a fair representation of the general New York State population. We carefully designed our survey to avoid misleading questions as well.
Compiling a Human Practices Handbook
Stockholm’s iGEM team created a human practices handbook to help provide iGEM teams guidelines about how to effectively engage in human practices activities of all types. Our team did well with our past projects particularly in the areas of integrating user feedback and understanding the larger context of the technology we were developing. We provided the Stockholm team our insights regarding timeline, focus, team delegation, goals, and interviewing strategy - all with particular focus to our past year’s tackling bovine mastitis with bacteriocins: Legendairy. We believe that passing on the knowledge we have gained through our past experiences in human practices is valuable to the entire iGEM community to develop advancements in synthetic biology with applications in mind."
Berlin_diagnostX,2017," conversation fell on wound care and  healing the Team Berlin reinforced its willingness to share knowledge gained in medical school and to consult experts to answer the special questions the team TU Darmstadt had.
In the following weeks an active email exchange took place in which the team TU Darmstadt shared the questions they had and the areas they were most interested in. The following Skype webinar was based on those questions and covered many different areas regarding wound healing. The topic that were discussed involved different types of wounds ranging from stab wounds to burn wounds, wound microenvironments and of course the application and clinical role of wound hydrogels.
During an initial Skype meeting both realised that they were working on replicating the same algorithm to score possible sensor candidates and rank them by likelyhood of success prior to the in vitro screening. In the following email exchange both teams provided each other insight into their understanding of the methods described in the extended methods of this (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.002) paper. In addition the team EPFL iGEM shared the information they gathered from a meeting with one of the authors of the aforementioned paper. Those efforts combined led to the development of the toehold designer software in each team.
Since both teams also worked with cell free expression they exchanged protocols with insights gathered from previous experiments. The team EPFL iGEM shared their protocol of how to produce an own cell lysate. The team diagnostX on the other hand shared protocols for freeze-drying cell free expression systems and rehydrating them.
Due to the close proximity of Berlin and Potsdam collaboration between team Potsdam and team Berlin diagnostX was a breeze. The first contact happened in June and both teams soon exchanged information regarding the projects and the challenges of being a first time contender in the iGEM competition. The electronic contact was soon followed by a personal meeting playing a couple of rounds of volleyball in the heart of Berlin. Some members of team Potsdam also participated in a workshop organised by team diagnostX and the Boston Consulting Group to learn how to acquire new sponsors and advisors. On the other hand team Potsdam provided the vector pSB1C3 when team diagnostX had difficulties with their vector."

We participated at the University of Maryland's (UMD) meet, thanks to this event were were able to meet other iGEM teams and collaborate with them
University of Maryland
The University of Maryland iGEM team really helped point out the weakness of our initial design and they gave us suggestions based on their experience and research. Our initial project or device had 3 different proteins controlled by one promoter and they helped us redesign it so each gene is now controlled by its own promoter. From the beginning everytime we needed help they were readily available and responded quickly.
University of Virginia
Our first project was based on a previous project from the University of Virginia iGEM team, we were very glad to have met their team at the UMD's Meet. Through email we were able to collaborate, specially with our measurement study, they helped us navigate the different types of vectors the devices were in and what we can do to optimize our transformation to get better results. We would like to specially thank Rena for being a bridge between the two teams
Loudoun Lyme
Because of our project we were able to collaborate with Loudoun Lyme, an oganization dedicated to the spread of information and awareness in our region about Lyme disease.  This collaboration also gave us great exposure in our community and the iGEM program, we were glad to meet a fellow igemer from a past Duke University iGEM team. We were able to talk about Lyme disease, explain strategies on how to have a safe nature experience and show case our project. We distributed flyers with information, our booth was very popular, so much that we got the attention of NatCapLyme (National Capital Lyame Disease Association). A natinal organization dedicated to the treatment of Lyme disease. We are really looking to collaborate with NatCapLyme this coming year .

Collaborations
This year, we attached much importance to communication and collaborating with other teams.                     Our collaboration could be divided into two parts, collaborating with other iGEM teams and biology companies.
Other iGEM Teams
Through two iGEMer conferences, the Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) and the 5th iGEM Asia Conference,                       we got to know a lot of iGEM teams in Asia, through friendly communication, we reached some effective collaboration.
University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)
USTC-Software is one iGEM team which also concentrated on developing useful software for bio-brick researchers.                                          The similar interest and purpose helped us two teams to work together. During the collaboration,                                          it was their members’ experience that made us realize we should make improvements.                                          They identified the problem that some data in bio-bricks database was inaccurate and these parts should be removed.                                          We have not noticed it before, and we removed some inaccurate bio-bricks from the database according to their suggestions.                                         If not removed, these bio-bricks may cause wrong search results.                                          Moreover, we tested their software Biohub 2.0 and gave some useful suggestions on safety and design.                                          The cooperation between two teams made a “win-win” situation which we were both delighted to see.
SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai
To strength communications between collegiate teams and high school teams, we had a in-depth conversation with Shanghai United International School. We exchanged constructive and meaningful opinions on many topics, like the the future tendency on high school level’s development of biotechnology, how to attract more high school to attend iGEM, what can be done to improve cooperation between high schools and colleges and the some problems high school teams are faced with etc.. We concluded that the most serious problems hat most high school teams faced is lacking experience of doing practical bioengineering and necessary professional scientific knowledge,. We came up the idea to build a well-spread network among high school teams to increase the efficiency of information exchange to promote the communication and cooperation. This will also provide the platform and opportunities for collegiate teams to contact and help high school team. What’s more, they have a project"
Lethbridge_HS,2016," be used on humans(http://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-hydrogel-made-from-snake-venom-stops-bleeding-in-seconds). Finding out about the different ways snake venom has been applied to prevent excessive bleeding allowed our imaginations to run wild with possibilities that our project could take.
As we had hoped, collaborating has allowed a new connection to form between our two teams and has helped our team out immensely.
Lethbridge Collegiate Team
The Lethbridge Collegiate team assisted our team with tips and advice on lab work. For this, we repaid them with some help with the coding of their wiki."
Stuttgart,2018,"1: OD600 of V. natriegens after 0 and 3 h incubation in LB + v2 + 2 µg/mL Chloramphenicol.
Figure 2: Fluorescence (Excitation 485 nm, Emission 528 nm) of V. natriegens after 0 and 3 h incubation in LB + v2 + 2 µg/mL chloramphenicol.
In figure 2 the increase of the fluorescence after 3 h incubation is shown in all devices. The devices 1, 4 and 5 are clearly more fluorescent, so the expression of the fluorescent protein is higher. This might be caused by a stronger promotor activity in these devices compared to the positive control and the other devices.
The results of the Vibrigens InterLab Study are comparable with the results of the iGEM InterLab .
iGEM Team TU Darmstadt
Very much in line with the iGEM philosophy we utilized an existing BioBrick (developed by TU Darmstadt 2017 ChiTUcare ) as starting point for our novel approach. Thus we utilized the chitin synthase (NodC, BBa_K2380002 )  and two different chitin deacetylases (NodB, BBa_K2380041 and COD, BBa_2380043 ). We were happy to build on their experience and vision, applying chitosan as an antimicrobial coating, similar to their implementation of it in their hydrogel for the use of wound healing patches. In agreement with last years team members from Darmstadt, we have received the relevant BioBricks as plasmid DNA from team TU Darmstadt 2018 ( combimer ).
In several chats via e-mail and personal communication at the European Meetup in Munich they provided us useful information concerning the expression and purification especially of the deacetylase NodB. This particular enzyme poses some difficulties on the purification process as it is produced in inclusion bodies. Therefore, we concentrated on COD as chitin deacetylase.
Thanks to iGEM Darmstadt we saved a lot of time on the construction of the initial basic parts for our chitosan subteam. Furthermore, we are glad to share our parts and experience with team Darmstadt for further development of a chitosan producing genetically engineered machine."

Collaborations with OUC-China
With the ambition to make a better software tool for Synthetic Biology, we collaborate with OUC-China team to make our product truly helpful.
For the simulator, OUC-China is interested in a automative simulation tool to test their design, and we collaborate in BioDesigner Simulator. OUC-China provided us a complete explanation about the process and method they used in modeling. They also provided us their modeling results. By comparing those information with BioDesigner simulator, problems can be found and corrected.
For the recommendation in BioDesigner, the most important thing is to make sure our recommendations are truly helpful to Synthetic Biologist in their works. OUC-China provides us their gene circuit design, which can be used in the test of recommendation.
For a software, user experience is always of great value. OUC-China joined the alpha test and give us lots of valuable suggestions which is important in improving our product."

Ontario iGEM (oGEM)
Seven iGEM teams from Ontario (uOttawa, McMaster , Toronto , Queen's , Western, Guelph , and Waterloo ) continued an initiative to create a larger Canadian presence in synthetic biology and iGEM. This initiative, Ontario iGEM (or oGEM), helps each team to solidify their projects throughout the summer. oGEM also has crucial connections with all of its affiliated universities, industry, and the Ontario Genomics Institute, which helps with finding resources to fund each team. Through oGEM we were able to give and receive assistance with regards to the design of our sgRNA networks from other senior teams. Furthermore, we collaborated with the University of Toronto by participating in their synthetic biology podcast.
Canadian iGEM Newsletter
We collaborated along iGEM teams across Canada in an initiative led by iGEM Calgary to create a Canadian iGEM Newsletter. This newsletter allows various iGEM teams to stay connected with what their fellow teams in Canada are up to, fostering a national synbio community while increasing public awareness.
Survey Collaboration with Nebraska
Nebraska completed a survey we designed to gather information on gauge public knowledge about what genetic engineering and opinions regarding the importance of genetic engineering research. We reciprocally participated in a survey run by Nebraska. For details, please click the badge."
SDU-Denmark,2017," sun. This concluded in a visit to the roof terrace of the campus dormitory, followed by dinner. It was requested, by our fellow Danish teams, to make the SDU meetup an iGEM tradition.
Attending Meetups
Besides hosting our own meetup, we also attended several meetups during our iGEM experience. The first of which, was the 5th Annual Biobrick Workshop in March, hosted by the Technical University of Denmark, DTU-Denmark. This meetup not only gave us our first experience with Biobricks, but also worked as a foundation for friendships across different teams.
Our second meetup, the Nordic iGEM Conference was hosted by the University of Copenhagen, UCopenhagen, and took place in June. The main focus of this meetup was the traditional mini Jamboree. Participating in this  meetup gave us useful feedback from both the judges as well as from our fellow iGEM teams. This helped us greatly to shape and develop our project for the better.
To celebrate the beginning of our iGEM summer, we went on a road trip to attend the European Meetup, hosted by the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Here we discussed ideas regarding our project at a poster session, and learned about all the other great iGEM projects. We also made new friends from all over Europe.
Further Collaboration
In regard to our project, we have been in contact with the iGEM teams from Bielefeld and Imperial College, who helped us by sending crucial parts, relevant to the execution of our project.
As our project revolves around global warming and green sustainable energy, we were thrilled to hear about the iGEM Goes Green initiative made by the TU Dresden iGEM team. Following their guidelines, we have calculated the carbon footprint of our laboratory work and travelling. We have, in part, tried to make up for our carbon footprint, by changing our travelling and eating habits in our everyday lives. Furthermore, we have reduced our daily electricity consumption, our wiki became CO2 neutral, and we made an effort to sort our waste. The full report can be scrutinised here. Due to our team being the most green dream team, TU-Dresden asked us to lead the iGEM Goes Green project in year 2018.
We sought expertise from the Macquarie Australia iGEM team, who has worked with the implementation of photosynthesis in E. coli since 2013. We had an interesting Skype call with their team, where we discussed the particular challenges their previous teams had experienced throughout their projects.
We were also able to help"

By using the digestion protocol from Linearized Plasmid Backbones but substituting 4 ul of linearized plasmid backbone this part can be obtained and will now to referenced as E2. Having obtained E2 this needs to be inserted into plasmid pSB1T3 from the iGEM distribution kit again using the digestion protocol and now the ligation protocol from here
3.3 Transforming pImm
pImm needs to be transformed into strain DL2524 allowing Imm2 to build up in cells before transformation of pCol and production of DNase Colicin E2.
• Add 8ul of pImm to 50 uL of competent DL2524 culture.
• Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
• Heat shock for 60 seconds in 45 °C water bath.
• Incubate on ice for 2 minutes.
• Incubate at 37 °C for 1 hour.
• Plate on agar supplemented with 25 µg/ml ampicillin and add to 37 °C incubator.
3.4 Transforming pCol
Having allowed Immunity Protein Imm2 to build up in cells overnight it is now possible to transform pCol into cells which will have an immunity to DNase activity due to build up of Imm2. Firstly we need to pick colonies that have been transformed with pImm previously and add to LB prepared with 0.5% glucose. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 hour. We can now follow the same transformation protocol as previously.
• Add 8 µl of pCol to 50 µl of DL2524 culture.
• Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
• Heat shock for 60 seconds in 45 °C water bath.
• Incubate on ice for 2 minutes.
• Incubate at 37 °C for 1 hour.
• Plate on agar supplemented with 25 µg/ml Tetracycline and 25 µg/ml Ampicillin and add to the 37 °C incubator. Having grown overnight pick colonies once again and prepare 1.5 ml overnight culture in LB with 25 µg/ml Tetracycline 25 µg/mL Ampicillin and 0.5% glucose in falcon tube shaking in 37 °C water bath.

Collaborations
Our team believes that collaboration makes a better project, so we have taken every opportunity to communicate with other teams. On the one hand, by responding to other teams’ questionnaires, we could extend our advantages and help other teams in completing their projects. On the other hand, we are able to learn and get helps from other teams so that we can improve our abilities to complete our own projects.
1.With BIT-China
1.With BIT-China
We’ve constructed a good collaboration with BIT-China since last year, and this year we further improved it. We have collaborated in two aspects. First, the two teams worked together on modeling building for BIT-China, and the whole process lasted for nearly two months. In this case, our team mainly finished the job to optimize the model and tried our best to solve the equations. The detailed information of the model could be seen in the wiki of BIT-China.
1.With BIT-China
In addition to building model, we also cooperated in experiments. We need to insure that our constructs could express apoptin in Bifidobacterium longum. But the apoptin will be digested by restriction enzymes in Biofidobacterium longum, we need to transfer the device into E.coli to make the apoptin methylated. So our constructs were sent to BIT-China for the confirmatory experiments in E.coli. BIT-China helped us transform the plasmids into cells, and the cells were digested and centrifuged to collect the expression products of the bacteria, and the proteins of the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The result was shown in the figure. The construct, J23117, which was used in the InterLab experiments, was also sent from BIT-China as a gift to us, and we used it to finish our experiments. And in this summer, one of our members visited BIT-China in Beijing, and discussed a lot about our project with them.
2.With UESTC_China

Munich,2017,"insically Disordered Proteins(TDPs) to test them with our purified Cas13a, to check its activity and stability when used together with TDPs. From our team, Dawa did the characterization of the TDPs that were sent by the team TU Delft.  Both our teams were using Cas13a but from different strains. Our team mostly used Leptrotricia buccalis and Leptrotricia wadei Cas13a for our experiments. We did also tried the Leptrotricia shahi but we could not purify it properly for our experiments. Team TU Delft used the Leptroticia shahi Cas13a for their experiments.
During the characterization of the TDPs, Team TU Delft found that whenever their Cas13a was dried in combination with a TDP of the type CAHS, the resuspended Cas13a would start cleaving RNA even in absence of the target RNA, hence losing its specificity.  We therefore did the characterization of the TDPs they provided with our Cas13a (Lbu) and repeated the exact same drying experiment with the CAHS protein, in order to corroborate our results and to find the cause of such an unexpected outcome. As observed in figure 1, we also got the same unexpected results when Cas13a was dried with CAHS TDP.

iGEM BOKU Vienna
Michael and Julian from the iGEM BOKU Vienna Team came to our lab to run some experiments on 4th and 5th of October. Their iGEM project is called D.I.V.E.R.T. (Directed in vivo evolution via reverse transcription) and they are trying out new strategies for in vivo evolution which shows potential advantages over classical in vitro methods. For this they used yeast and E.coli to demonstrate their concept. They used the flow cytometer in our lab to better characterize their constructs from E.coli and S. cerevisiae. One of our lab members explained them how to use the flow cytometer and also provided them the necessary help. It was a long day work for them but at the end they collected positive results. We also had a small gathering in the evening before they left together with the last year´s iGEMers who came to meet us. We were very happy to have them in our lab and to get to know each other's team.

SJTU-Software
We have always maintained a good relationship with SJTU. We met at Taiwan and shared our thoughts about the development of Biohub with them. They think highly of the feature of experiment record.
""Your experiment recording provides a simple and quick method for routine experiment. It could save a lot of time for us experimenters. They create the template of the experiment process which could record each experiment clearly and show the experiment to others easily. It is very convenient to sharing the ideas of experiment and communicate with each other. However, there are also some things which need to be improved. Some experiments may do two or more things in the same time, for example, when experimenters centrifuge something and they need to operate supernatant and precipitate separately so that it may be better to improve the function at these situations. Also, you could add visualization function in the editor which makes the showing process more clearly.""
We really appreciate their suggestions and now we are doing our best to improve our project.
UESTC-Software
We invited UESTC to experience Biohub and they gave us useful feedback. ""Biohub’s UI is awesome and has a sense of science and technology. Also, Biohub can respond fast and smoothly. However, there are also some places need to be improved. For example, there is no introduction to the function of Biohub at its homepage. Besides, it would be better to add the user guide to editor which could be very important for green hands.""
We have got a lot from their feedback and now we have improved our function and made our project better.
Team USTC
We had communicated with Team USTC frequently and realized that writing the experiment reports may be a difficult and duplicated thing. We got the inspiration from them and decided to develop our project now. During the process of developing, they helped us to build a professional and easy-to-use editor and a powerful search engine to help experimenters work effectively. They provide the knowledge we need and experience the functions and help us improving our project."
BNU-China,2018,"). According to our knowledge, most of the transporter proteins do not possess such a high transporting efficiency, which means this hypothesis is valid in a larger degree.
2. The hypothesis on the relationship between NcrB concentration and the copy number of the recombinant vector.
Since each of the recombinant vector contains only one copy of the target gene, we can assume that the vectors have the same ability of expressing NcrB. Furthermore, it’s reasonable to assume that the final concentration of NcrB is proportional to the copy number of the recombinant vector.
3. The hypothesis on the concentration of NcrB during the process in which Ni and pncrA bind with NcrB competitively
There are three subtypes of NcrB in the cell: the free state NcrB, the NcrB binding with pncrA and the NcrB binding with Ni2+. We assume that the concentration of total NcrB is not influenced by the expression of NcrB gene or its degradation process, because the speed of these two processes is relatively low compared with the competitively binding process. More importantly, based on this hypothesis, we can further assume that the concentration of free state NcrB remains constant during the process of competitive binding. This is because the kinetics feature of the process is similar to enzymatic reactions.

2. The transcription of LuxCDABE conducted by NcrB
Since the concentration of the free state NcrB remains constant, and the concentration of total NcrB is a function of the copy number of the plasmid, we can present the following equations:
Furthermore, we know that there is an equilibrium in the process of NcrB"
Aalto-Helsinki,2018," a 3-day BioHackathon Aalto-Helsinki team has developed a web application Finder. It is an online search engine for the lab items so as to help the lab workers easier and faster find the needed reagents and other items. This came out from our own personal experience while working in a new lab during the summer. We believe this would increase the efficiency of lab workers, especially it would be helpful for those working for a short-term so as to onboard in a fast and intuitive way. Finally, this would be really helpful in a new type of labs- community labs where fast onboarding is essential. One of the community labs is just emerging at the moment at Aalto University where we join in the early development of it.
Teams that took part in the collaboration come from Lund, Groningen, Vilnius, and Helsinki.

Other Conferences
During the summer we got the chance to meet other iGEM teams and network with them in four different occasions: besides the already mentioned BioHackathon in Vilnius and the collaboration on public engagement we had with the Tartu team, we attended both the Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund and the European meetup in Munich. The conferences were a great opportunity to present our project and receive valuable feedback on it, as well as a way to get to know what other iGEM teams were working on. In this way we identified some of the teams with which we could potentially have a collaboration, such as the Toulouse team.

Yale University and University of La Verne
As iGEM grows, the interest in non-model organisms (organisms other than ""E. coli"") has started to increase. Since our team decided to work with ""Lactococcus lactis"" this year, we were one of a few teams that were working with a non-model organism. Because of this, Yale and ULV reached out to us to find out about our experiences with this particular organism, as they wanted to create a handbook for other teams interested in these organisms. In conjunction with Yale, University of La Verne, Concordia University, Cornell University, Northeastern University, and University of British Columbia, a guidebook has been created (courtesy of the Yale and ULV teams) that contains a set of considerations for those teams that are interested in working with non-model organisms. As a team, we felt that it was really important for other teams to have this resource, thus this collaboration should be very beneficial for the iGEM community. Check out the guidebook here!
Stanford-Brown
Members of our team were asked for advice from the 2015 Stanford-Brown iGEM team because of our reputation working with bioplastics, specifically polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Fortunately, we were able to arrange an in-person meeting with their team over the summer. We provided help by answering questions regarding the feasibility of their project, troubleshooting issues with low yields of bioplastic, as well as proposing routes to take in order to achieve their goals. The Stanford-Brown students were very receptive and went one step further by inquiring about our project, bringing up key points that allowed us to see an outside perspective on how our project would be received. This meeting proved to be mutually beneficial and we look forward to seeing how their project has progressed at the Jamboree!

Heidelberg,2015,"-hand side, the state with no kanamycin bound is depicted. The toehold-switch is inactive as the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) is hidden in a strong stem. Upon binding of kanamycin, the regulatory construct that is fused to the aptamer and that keeps the toehold-switch in its inactive conformation (by not allowing base pairing between the regulatory construct and the toehold-switch) changes secondary structure. Thereby a previously existing strong stem unfolds and reveals a sequence complementary to the toehold-switch. As soon as this happens, the conformation on the right-hand side is formed and the RBS can be accessed.
Supporting iGEM Team Aachen
Back then when it was still summer, Michael Osthege from iGEM Team Aachen visited us. As a verteran of iGEM 2014, he already knew that one of the most important parts of every successfull project is sample management. Talking with him we got to know of other teams struggling to locate their samples. Their plan was, to get further information about the impact of this problem. Michael has had already prepared a draft for the survey which we then discussed. Of course in the following weeks we participated in the final version of the survery.
Not only did he bring a beta-survey, but also an already functional beta-version of a very promising software: tubefront . It's a mobile-optimized webservice which keeps track of all your samples, assigns IDs which can be written on the tubes and tells you where you can find them.
As of now the software is fully functional and availiable for free for other teams. They also developed a MediaWiki plugin which can be confortably implemented into any wiki.
Though we really loved tubefront with heavy heart we decided not to use tubefront ourselves, as we had already established a sample management system. We recommend any team to check it out though, as it has proven to work for various teams and future generations of teams could really benefit from it.
Supporting iGEM Team Paris Bettencourt
iGEM Paris Bettencourt has set up a visual databse that should help various iGEM teams collaborate and find common ground. In that database all teams can enter techniques, keywords, organism and many more thev are knowdledgeable in or have been working on. As common dots are connected automatically, it's easy so see, whom to ask for a collaboration.
Though we came a little late to the party, we really loved the idea and hoped, that the database has helped various teams!

As part of the troubleshoot meet-up with the other London iGEM teams,                              we also invited graphic design students from the University of Arts London Central                              St Martins to run a graphic design workshop in which they explained some of the foundational                              concepts of graphic design. Using previous iGEM wikis as examples, they showed us                              what makes a good wiki functional and easy to use. Furthermore, they advised all the teams                              individually on how to improve our wiki and poster designs. We would like to thank the                              students, Audrey, Michelle and Andrea for joining us at our troubleshooting event and running                              the graphic design workshop to help us improve our design skills.
Web design consultation
For our wiki we worked closely with Virginia Ma, a graphic design student                              from University of Arts London Central St Martins, who helped us in many aspects of the design of our wiki,                             from picking the colour scheme to laying out the pages and                              providing illustrations for us. Thank you Virginia for all your help!

Madrid-OLM,2018," there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
Activities
The event began on Friday the 14th in the afternoon with the main course. In it, after the reception of the attendees, we gave way to a series of very interesting expert presentations. We were able to count on the attendance of the following personalities:
Victor de Lorenzo
He is one of the Spanish most relevant researchers in the Synthetic Biology field. He works in the National Biotechnology Center (CNB) a part of the Superior Council of Scientific Investigations (CSIC). His laboratory is specialized in solving environmental issues using genetically engineered Pseudomonas putida. He gave us an interesting talk about ""Synthetic Biology in the rescue of the planet Earth"".
Saul Ares
He is a researcher of the CNB too. His work is central in the mathematical modelling of Synthetic Biology systems. He has also collaborated with previous iGEM teams. His presentation talked about ""How do cyanobacteria count to ten"".
Krzysztof Wabnik
He is a Young Investigator Researcher of the Center for Biotechnology and Plant Genomics (CBGP) at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). The group he is leading uses multilevel computer model simulations, synthetic biology experiments and microfluidics. The name of his presentation was: ""Combining computational and synthetic biology approaches to understand the dynamics of plant hormone signalling circuits"".
After the presentation of the three speakers, we had a space of time in which attendees could discuss and exchange points of view with them on how the field of synthetic biology would evolve.
After the talks a social event was held in which the attending teams could relax having dinner in the centre of Madrid with one of the most typical activities here: go out for tapas.
The second day was inaugurated with a visit to the university to show the facilities where our team works. Also it was explained which procedures are used in each of the sections that were visited.
Subsequently, the presentations of the projects were made. A simulation of the presentation was carried out as it should be done in Boston, to learn how to take the time and try to correct the excesses or lack of time in each section that was exposed.
In the afternoon there was a tour around Madrid, where the most iconic places in the city were shown. And although there were activities scheduled for the next day, this was the activity that closed the meet up, since the attending teams had organized to return to their cities after this tour.

Freiburg iGEM Team
This year the iGEM Team Freiburg tackled the problem of targeted drug delivery in the human body.
As both iGEM Team Freiburg and our team are working with Bacillus subtilis to reach our goals, we decided to support each other.
We were able to provide them with our protocol for competent cells and, thankfully, they could assist us with a transformation protocol for B. subtilis.
After trying out multiple protocols we decided to write a guide ""How to Bacillus subtilis"" including the protocols that worked best for us.
This should help future iGEM teams speed up their work with the organism.

Leiden,2018," was scheduled for           the end of October. Therefore, we were inspired to organise an informal meet-up opportunity during the summer. Laboratory work would be in full swing for all teams and we thought it would be a nice moment to get together and share our           experiences. We were are happy that all Dutch teams were represented during our Meet-up!
The Meet-up kicked off with some snacks and drinks during which the teams could relax and get to know each other in a more personal way. After this, the BBQ was fired up.           The teams could enjoy delicious food prepared by our own chef, Chiel van Amstel . Serving halal meat, vegan and vegetarian options, we made sure everyone was provided quality food.
Next, we hosted a pub quiz to stimulate conversation about all teams’ respective projects. To our pleasant surprise we saw that the teams are well versed in the other Dutch iGEM projects. The absolute winners of the Pub Quiz were iGEM           teams Groningen and Eindhoven!
In short, the Dutch Meet-up and BBQ was a wonderful event where plans for collaborations were furthered and ideas for next meet-ups were exchanged. We would like to thank all teams for a lovely evening.

Instagram Challenge
This year we took the opportunity to participate in the “Instagram Challenge For July” by iGEM Stony Brook .           This allowed us to enlighten our social network about our project, the people behind it and to give them a glance in the life of an iGEM’er. We love initiatives like this which enable participating teams to promote iGEM worldwide, showcase           team diversity and dedication!
Music Video
Near the end of our time in the lab, we were approached by iGEM TEC CEM for a music video collaboration. Their idea was to get as many iGEM teams together           as possible to participate in a music video for the song: “Labs Like you”, which           was rewritten from “Girls Like You” by Maroon 5. We were very excited to participate, and fortunately - and unsurprisingly - so were many other iGEM teams! There we so many interested teams that iGEM TEC CEM decided to write a second song           to, “Moves Like iGEM”, based on “Moves Like Jagger” by Maroon 5. We took this fun opportunity and recorded a short piece for the music video, which iGEM TEC"

oGEM - Ontario iGEM Collective
This year, QGEM collaborated with the Ontario Genetically Engineered Machine Collective, which is composed of iGEM teams from the universities of Toronto, Ryerson (new this year), Waterloo, McMaster, and Ottawa. With oGEM, we meet several times during the year to discuss ways to promote iGEM in Ontario, funding strategies, project troubleshooting, and new ways to collaborate for wet lab, dry lab, and policy and practice departments.
One of the oGEM collaborations featured this year was promoting iGEM at the 66th annual conference for the Canadian Society of Microbiologists (CSM) venue at Toronto in June. It was an overall wonderful opportunity to promote synthetic biology awareness amongst the conference delegates while also telling professionals about our research within each of our individual iGEM team projects. At the end of the conference, each of the oGEM teams had an opportunity to present their 2016 projects to professionals in the field of microbiology, specifically focusing on the societal applications of our projects in the fields of medicine and technology.
XMU-China iGEM Newsletter
One of the collaborations we did this summer was with Team XMU-China, who featured QGEM and our 2016 project on nonribosomal peptide synthetases in their September 2016 iGEM Newsletter. In the newsletter, 46 different iGEM teams from around the world are featured alongside their 2016 project, all carefully put together by a talented Team XMU-China. Queen's was one of the 46 teams who contributed to the development of the newsletter, and we would like to thank XMU-China for their tireless efforts towards leading this collaborative project!

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018," was fascinating to see a completely different team dynamic and research area. It was a pleasure to help them working on their own exciting iGEM project and we learned a lot on considering different working conditions. It was such a great experience mentoring an iGEM team, which has as much interest and fun in synthetic biology as we do, and we hope the iGEM friendship between Hamm-Lippstadt and Bielefeld will continue between the future teams of our universities. Thank you guys!

iGEM Team Duesseldorf
After participating in the March for Science in Cologne, we had a skype meeting with the iGEM team Duesseldorf and they invited us to a team meetup. Thus, on the 4th of May, we went to Duesseldorf . It was an inspiring day with the iGEM team Duesseldorf and we had so much fun together. We discussed critical aspects of both our projects and we compared the difficulties both teams had to overcome. It was really helpful for us to practice presenting our project to another team. Back in Bielefeld we asked the iGEM team Duesseldorf to test the promoter part (BBa_J23111) of the distribution plate 2018, because we had trouble cloning it. Therefore, we requested the team Duesseldorf to clone and sequence this part as an independent validation of our sequencing results. In contrary to us, they were able to validate the sequence of this part. We were greatly happy that the team Duesseldorf followed our invitation to our dual use panel discussion and provided us with a lot of input, which we could perfectly include in our work in this field. We are extremely happy to celebrate the third year of a friendship between both our teams!
Networking
Beside the collaborations with the teams of Hamm-Lippstadt, Duesseldorf and Rheda Bielefeld our team got in contact with many people from all over the world throughout the year. We would like to give a short impression on how we became part of the world-wide science community.
Postcards
Like in the last years, team Duesseldorf organized a campaign to promote synthetic biology by inviting other iGEM teams to design interesting postcards on the topic of synthetic biology. We were enthusiastic about this idea and started designing our own postcard. This year we decided to recreate a famous picture„Lunch atop a Skyscraper“ in a biological way and complement it with our team.

Postcards
As we all know iGEM is not only about experiments and lab work but also about bringing the topic “synthetic biology” closer to the public. In order to do so the previous iGEM teams of the Heinrich Heine University of Düsseldorf created a postcard exchange project to promote synthetic biology in public using self-designed postcards. Each year a bunch of iGEM teams decided to join which is why the campaign was a huge success with a lot of beautiful and funny postcards as a result.
Of course we wanted to continue this tradition.
How does this postcard exchange work? Every participating team has to design a postcard which shows an image related to synthetic biology or their topic on the front and a small informational text on the back.
Postcard criteria:
Image related to your project or (synthetic) biology in general on the front
Small informational text on the back
Standard postcard format (A6; 14.8 cm x 10.5 cm)
We reached a lot of iGEM teams by showing off postcards from the previous years on Instagram and other social media accounts and were also the first ones to post on the Collaboration page of iGEM 2018.  A lot of iGEM teams responded who wanted to channel their inner creativity and design their own postcard about their project or synthetic biology in general. We had 37 participating teams in total.  In addition to that we also collaborated with iGEM TU Delft who introduced our postcard project on their Eurasian meetup in Shenzhen, China. A lot of iG"

We were visited by Ana Sifuentes, Manager of iGEM’s Teams for Latin America. Her visit was very enriching because permitted us to meet with other Chilean iGEM Teams (High School) and we could know what facts are important to have a good iGEM experience. She talked about her experience in iGEM like manager and as a past member of a team. Her contribution for our team was clear and effective; it allowed us having a know how for each activity in iGEM Jamboree and Boston. Also, it allowed improving our project image face to institutional sponsors.
Also, the High School teams visited the laboratory installation of CeBiB to work a week in their projects.

This team invited us to participate in a survey as a part of his human practice. They developed an online software that allows synthetic biologists to design their own biological device or path. They usually based their work in wet laboratory, but this year participated under the ‘Software tract’ being a huge challenge. Team Korea U Seoul believes that open data, open source software, and open access will definitely help researchers in the fields of biological sciences and we think it too.

USMA-West_Point,2018," independently probe the intended submission plasmid, restriction digest reactions were performed. The sequence information provided for the bio-brick insert showed that it contained two KpnI sites, whereas the iGEM pSB1C3 plasmid lacks a KpnI site (Figure 2A). If the bio-brick insert was present, then products of ~3.7 and 0.3kb were expected (Figure 2A). By contrast, two bands were observed at ~2500 and ~1500bp (Figure 2C). The second digest used EcoRI and MscI enzymes. This digest was expected to generate products 2.7, 0.7 and 0.6kb (Figure 2B). By contrast, we only observed bands at just below 1500bp and at ~700bp (Figure 2C). We believe that the ~700bp band corresponds fragment generated by the MscI and EcoRI sites present in the pSB1C3 backbone. The possibility that this apparent single band is actually the anticipated 0.6kb band unresolved from the 0.7kb band is unlikely because, as the ladder shows, products of those sizes are well resolved on this gel (restriction digest reactions were analyzed on an 0.8% agarose gel in 1XTAE for approximately 40min at 100V).
Figure 2
Due to the inconsistencies in the PCR product sizes between the reactions with the control (pYTK) and iGEM (pSB1C3) plasmids, in addition to the discrepancies in the expected and observed restriction digest products, we cannot conclude that iGEM submission plasmid is constructed as intended.

Duke,2018," a future collaborative forum run by Duke iGEM, the East Chapel Hill iGEM team, and the Museum of Life and Science there are several key components: members of the public and trained scientists, collaborative discussion, and a topic closely related to genomic editing. The Museum of Life and Science has, over the many years it has been open, built a substantial network with the community and local scientists and thus can be an important asset in attracting a diversity of opinion to the forum. Duke, likewise, has a network with many biotechnology firms which can not only bring a unique business perspective of genomic editing, but also draw new community members (especially Duke students) more interested in hearing about the latest developments on the technologies. Combining our resources, we should be able to attract a diverse crowd and create a successful discussion.

Aix-Marseille Université (France), proposed a collaboration. They needed to collect a lot of information about chewing-gum and GMOs around the world.                  They prepared a small survey, and we went to the streets and interviewed random people.                 It was a fun challenge. We received a gold badge for our help.
Aix-Marseille project idea:
""Nowadays, chewing gum is the second urban pollutant after cigarette butts. To clean chewing gum, specific engines are used but they are heavy and expensive. The time required for its use is long and they need a large quantity of water. Besides economical aspects, chewing gums have an environmental impact. They are dangerous for the wildlife such as birds. Indeed, believing that it is bread, they eat chewing gums and choke. Regarding these alarming facts, we have decided to create a new environmentally- responsible way to sanitize our streets.""

This year, Tongji_China use the Type III secretion system (T3SS) to deliver neoantigens of colorectal cancer into immune system to active the immune response. When it comes into application, they try to make their engineered attenuated bacteria into capsules. Since our team also prepared to put our engineered E.coli into capsules, we helped each other make the products. Tongji_China offered us the enteric capsules while our team engineered the bacteria into dry powder and then wrap the powder into capsules on the lab bench. In addition, in order to learn more about the medicine industry to help us make a better product, we visit Roche, the world’s largest biotech company and also the global leader in cancer treatments. We talked about the colon cancer and how to choose a suitable pharmaceutical preparation. Visit their website

McMasterU,2017," oGEM meeting took place. Bringing together all of the post-secondary iGEM teams, the day allowed for discussion of our projects, our future, our strengths, and our weaknesses. While they were not at the center of the talk, surely but slowly common worries were brought forth, none of them relating to our projects at all but to our own selves: how do we even begin an iGEM team? How do we manage one that exists? How do we continue one that graduating students leave to us?
Throughout the years, this running theme of looking at our iGEM teams not through the lens of our projects and work but through the very essence of them, which is to say the people who make up iGEM in the first place, is something that has oft been pushed back and neglected. At the meeting that day, we realized that surprisingly, none of us were in the same stage of development in our growth as iGEM teams. Two teams just started that year; others had come back after some years of hiatus or had only been established for a number of years. Then, there were the teams that had been established as the forefront of oGEM, having been constants for years in this field. Yet, we all had our concerns about how to manage, grow, and develop our teams to be better. Despite our differences in experiences and years, or perhaps because of that, we came to realize that we could help each other build better, more solid foundations by exchanging the knowledge we had accumulated over the years. Thus, this manual came to be, out of a desire to be able to share and pass down that knowledge to all of us, and to you.
This manual will always remain open to edits, revisions, suggestions, comments, and questions. It is in our hopes that this manual grows as our teams will, and that what we have learned through this amazing journey in camaraderie and synthetic biology will always be available for those who need or want it.
Thank you, and good luck with your endeavours in iGEM. You’ll be amazing.
The Ontario iGEM chapters collaborating on this venture jointly by McMasterU, are: U of Guelph , Toronto , with entry contributions from Waterloo . The finished manual will then be distributed both in print and online to any chapters interested across Ontario and Canada.
Below is a list of the topics covered in the oGEM Manual, compiled by our Human Practices member Aline-Claire Huynh.
