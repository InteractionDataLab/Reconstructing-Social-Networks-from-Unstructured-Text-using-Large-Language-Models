Yale,2018," optimize their production of palm oil. We found it incredibly cool that even though both of us were interested in utilizing the unique metabolic pathways found in A. baylyi ADP1, we were utilizing the same organism is wildly different ways. This really showed us the promise that synthetic biology holds for solving real world problems by creatively taking advantage and modifying biological systems already found in nature.
We also spent quite a bit of time talking about how each of our teams were structured. We were especially interested in hearing about how the NAWI Graz team had members specialized for web design, outreach, fundraising, etc… Since every student member of the Yale iGEM team conducts research, we do not have specialized team members working on specific aspects of the iGEM competition. We discussed with the NAWI Graz team the benefits and drawbacks of our differing team structures and were inspired to potentially try out their team structure in the future (i.e. having specialized team members for various aspects of the iGEM competition other than lab research). This would help take the load off the rest of our team so that they could focus on the lab research components without worrying about everything else.
Lastly, we talked a bit about how our teams were funded. Although both of our teams are heavily supported by our respective institutions, we both discussed the challenges of raising enough money to register for the competition, travelling to the Giant Jamboree, registering for the Giant Jamboree, and also covering research costs for the summer. We were especially impressed by the NAWI Graz team’s efforts in reaching out to companies about getting corporate sponsors.
Overall, we really enjoyed finally meeting a team outside the United States to see how iGEM is truly a competition that brings together students from all around the world. After meeting, the NAWI Graz team was kind enough to add us to their WhatsApp group message full of European iGEM teams who are attending the Giant Jamboree and are coordinating a meet-up. We look forward to meeting them all in-person and getting to know them more at the Giant Jamboree."
Amsterdam,2015," using their biobricks that enable rapid immobilization of organisms via nanowires, together with the ability to accurately print these in the form of biofilms, one could create coatings that would be easy to produce and ideally suited for bio-composite leaves. A coating of cyanobacteria could simply be printed on a piece of porous paper and placed in the gas-phase of a photobioreactor for a steady supply of CO2, where it would function much in the way as described by Bernal et al. [2014]. Further leveraging Amsterdam’s consortium design, a layer of cyanobacteria would be printed on top of a layer of chemotrophic cell-factories like E. coli, who would use the constant supply of carbon provided by the cyanobacteria to produce end-products like biofuels, which would be transported to an extraction chamber where the product would be isolated.
Previous method based on extrusive coating method described by Bernal et al. (2014). .
Together, the work of team Amsterdam and TU Delft shows how combining separate iGEM projects can unlock new solutions to existing problems that could lead to new innovations. Indeed, the sustainable product formation enabled by Amsterdam’s consortium and the ease of printing biofilms with immobilizing nanowires developed by TU Delft could turn the type of biocomposite devices described by Bernal et al. into the cheap, versatile biofactory of the future."

Pasteur_Paris,2016," company and study rooms! You can feel that the place is filled with creativity, and its occupants are constantly in contact with each other, sharing common spaces (kitchen, living room…). What was the most impressive feature in the lab section of La Paillasse is that they didn’t buy any of the lab  equipment, they collected all of it from labs or hospitals that had no use for it anymore (sometimes in working order, sometimes not), and they repaired it all in order to set up a fully-functional laboratory. The three lawyers from our team (Claudia, Victoire and Victor) went to La Paillasse to meet Mr. Jonathan Keller, who is their “in-house lawyer“. Those discussions highlighted the interesting axes to build on in order to write our report about intellectual property in the framework of iGEM. Mr. Keller was the perfect interlocutor to go to because he and his teams work very closely on Open science problematics, on the proposal of a new legal Framework for Open Source Hardware. At the same time, he works closely with the Evry iGEM team, which regularly conducts experiments at La Paillasse. Mr. Keller's input was very enriching and allowed us to get a better grasp of the Open science  problematics in the domain of synthetic biology, which will be developed in our IP report. He kindly agreed to take part in the Parisian meet-up that we organized. If you want to find out more about this place, you can visit their website here"
TU_Dresden,2017," manage and organize the scheduling, food costs, designs and logos, accommodation, etc. Sponsors had to be found and boxes had to be checked to make sure that nothing can go wrong for such a large occasion. Vier Vogel Pils sponsored the beer for the event, while Promega hosted a seminar on RT-qPCR. We had planned everything that by the time the conference came around, we were prepared.
Schedule
The German-wide Meetup was hosted for the first time by the TU Dresden iGEM team. In a 3-day affair, 60 students from 11 universities attended with the aim to practice their presentation demeanor, setup future collaborations and most of all, make new friends ahead of the Giant Jamboree and have fun.
On Friday there were arrivals of our participants and their check-in in hostels, followed by exploring the city of Dresden and getting a chance to meet the fellow iGEM teams. Each participant received a name badge and a brochure containing the schedule of the event as well as some Promega giveaways.
Saturday started off with a few introductory talks, as well as the presentation of “iGEM Goes Green”; part of the project of our iGEM team to push sustainability and environmentally-friendly lab work. Next, each attending team was given the chance to present their own project ideas; with the intent of promoting inter-lab collaborations.
Among the Sunday events there were two workshops, held in smaller groups. The participants chose between the option to take part in speed datings for the last-minute collaboration agreements or an introduction workshop of iGEM goes green with interactive tasks on how to calculate the greenhouse gas emission of their projects and exploring ideas for more sustainable lab work.
Schedule Meetup
Presentations and Workshops during the Meetup
The teams had 15 minutes to present their project and 5 minutes for Q&A. Other teams challenged the presenters with tough questions, much like the judges will at the Giant Jamboree, preparing the teams to be clear and concise for future presentations.
During the pauses, coffee, fruits and vegetables were provided to keep the teams energized and focused for the long days. Beer was provided as well, courtesy of local brewery, Vier Vogel Pils. After a day filled with amazing talks, the teams were invited for a tour through Dresden, seeing the major sites and afterwards we had a Tortilla party and we played different national drinking games. It was a great bonding session and a good way to start the evening before going to the bars in the town.

Northwestern
The iGEM team at Northwestern worked on OMVs as part of their project, and we had a Skype meeting with them to discuss their applications of OMVs and how these can be used with our system.
EPFL
We met the EPFL iGEM team at the Open Plant Forum where we learned that they were also working towards using a cell-free system. Instead of working in a living system like we did, EPFL worked directly with cell-free lysates for their project, so were willing to have a meeting with us to discuss how they made their lysates and used them giving us a better understanding about how to apply cell-free lysates to our own system.
McMaster II
The McMaster II iGEM team ran molecular dynamic simulations of our system. They simulated the SpyTag/SpyCatcher (ST/SC) interaction in a 300 ns all-atom MD simulation and calculated the root mean square deviation (RMSD) for all residues; this information allowed us to determine the stability of the ST/SC interaction. As we were unable to test the ST/SC interaction in vivo, McMaster’s collaboration was invaluable in helping us assess the functionality of our composite OMV circuit. Please refer to our Design page for the RMSD graph and last few ns of the simulation.
In return, we gave the McMaster advice on how to create a MATLAB scripts for kinetic modeling.

Twitter
Similar to Facebook, twitter was a great platform for discussing our project and communicating the advantages of synthetic biology. Majority of our followers on twitter were other iGEM teams. This was incredibly enjoyable as we were able to talk to other teams from across the world, see how they were going, and offer suport, opinions, and advice - as they did for us. Indeed, skpye calls with the iGEM teams from Oxford, Warwick, Exeter, Manchester-Graz, Heidelburg, and Danciger were the direct result of twitter interactions. We would like to thank all the iGEM teams and the iGEM HQ that communicated with us over twitter, shared jokes, memes, images, and progress - it certainly made this international competiton feel a lot more personal and social.
Below are some of our most successful tweets:

Collaboration
Aiming to respond to the requirements of the official, we help the team FAFU-CHINA with some modeling work.
The introduction of FAFU-CHINA’s Project
We use the method of RNA interference to suppress the replication of CSBV and to prevent CSBV infecting larvae. The methods of rearing honeybee larvae and viral inoculation under lab conditions were established. CSBV homologous specific dsRNAs (dsRdRP) were synthesized using T7 RiboMAXTM Express RNAi System Kit. The daRNAs and CSBV were added into the food, dsGFP as control. The second instar larvae were first fed with food containing dsRNAs. Twelve hours later, the larvae were then fed with food containing CSBV. The mRNA level of CSBV were detected by RT-qPCR in dsRNAs treated larvae. In order to apply RNA interference technology to production practice RdRP gene cloned into the L4440 vector, and transformed into E.coli strain HT115 to express dsRdRP. Bacteria containing dsRdRP were fed to CSBV-infected colonies for studying its effect on the prevention and treatment of CSBV.
Modeling Work
In FAFU’s project, it is difficult to measure the quantitative data and determine the amount of dsRNAs which is fed to the larvae. So in the modeling part, we devoted to establishing an accurate mathematical model to simulate the dsRNA expression according to the mechanism of T7 promoter. After the model is built, we can determine the relationship between the concentration of IPTG and the production of dsRNA . Then we can control  the amount of dsRNAs which if fed to the larvae by controlling the concentration of IPTG easily.
We know that T7 promoter is a kind of inducible promoter. Hill equation can be used to simulate the effect of T7 promoter. In T7 strength model, the independent variable is the concentration of IPTG, and the"

    Thirdly, we fight together. University’s Biotechnology Building has seen the two teams spend entire summer vacation in the lab for their project and force their ways out towards light and truth together. A day usually started with two teams’ early morning greetings at the building hall and ended up with “good bye” in the evening. The way back to dorm listened the bitter and sweet they shared with each other. What a great scene we created. What a goal we have been always chasing after.

    During the two-day-long discussion, we thoroughly exchanged our perspectives on almost every aspects on preparation for iGEM. We shared the ideas of our projects this year first. We then had a share in the experience of team construction, project design, human practice, cultivating new teammates and source obtainment. We gained a lot of practical advice on overcoming the difficulties of these terms, which we had met and we would meet. Team Fudan provided us with literature concerning cell sensing and response behavior they came across before, which they thought might help us. Also, we were inspired to visit a video game company, for example, to ask the professional for advice, which did motivate us to adjust our game to be more fascinating.

Collaboration with TMMU-China
This year, TMMU-CHINA aimed to build a quorum sensing tool kit based on the Agr system from the Gram-positive bacteria-- Staphylococcus aureus. However, they were not able to synthesize the genes agrC and agrA in plasmids,                 and therefore, the experiments were not able to conduct. Fortunately, we had the similar construction and                 provided them with our group I Staphylococcus aureus’ s agrC and agrA genes. The plasmid we sent them is shown below.
And, thanks to TMMU-CHINA for willing to help us to test the efficiency of antimicrobial peptides LL-37, GF-17, Grammistin-Pp1,                 and DRGN-1 on Staphylococcus aureus with our own protocols.

In September, we received an invitation from Lanzhou iGEM team for a video interview on the dilemmas and issues our team                 had encountered and how we dealt with them. We conducted a video communication on 30th and exchanged ideas                 about the current situations of project development in our respective universities. Furthermore, the management                 of the iGEM team was also discussed in this conversation.
On balance, this conversation benefited both of our teams a lot. Through helping Lanzhou with their human practice investigation,                 we gained much experience on team operation and learned how to resolve the unforeseen issues.

This year, we collaborated with Harvard Biodesign to determine if our most promising antifreeze proteins were effective in a different biofilm-forming strain of E. coli.
Here is the Biofilm Assay Protocol used by both teams participating in this collaboration!
WPI
We completed the biofilm assay linked above with strains of E. coli with modified pili created by the Harvard team. The strains we tested were JW4283, a fim H knockout and negative control for biofilm formation, and C2M+C5 and C9-3+C5, which express modified pili when induced by arabinose and rhamnose. Upon receiving agar stabs from the Harvard team, we streaked plates and incubated them at 37C for 24 hours. Afterwards, we placed the plates in the refrigerator until we received the arabinose and rhamnose needed to induce pili formation in the experimental strains. Once we had all necessary materials, we grew 5mL liquid cultures of each of the 3 strains in LB in accordance with the protocol. The JW4283 culture was not supplemented with antibiotics or inducers, but the C2M+C5 and C9-3+C5 cultures were supplemented with 5 μL of chloramphenicol, 5 μL of ampicillin, 0.01% arabinose, and 0.5% rhamnose. We prepared the 1:100 dilutions in LB broth and M9 minimal media, which we found to support biofilm formation while designing our biofilm assay. The remainder of the protocol was left unchanged. Below are the results of the assay.

Pittsburgh CSL
The Pittsburgh CSL team is the first high school iGEM team from Pittsburgh. The team members represent a variety of backgrounds from the Homewood neighborhood of Pittsburgh. As high school students, they didn’t have much science or biology experience, so during the 2018 iGEM season, we acted as mentors to guide them through this exciting journey of research.
The Pittsburgh iGEM connection with Pittsburgh CSL iGEM began in Fall 2017 when two members from the 2017 Pittsburgh team visited the Citizen Science Lab. The members gave a presentation on the previous year’s research project, played a game they created called the Plasmid Game, and provided insight on what to expect from the competition.
In winter of 2018, one of our current members worked with the CSL team on completing a collaboration with the CMUQ team. The 2017 CMUQ team worked on creating a salt sensor, and the CSL team wanted to further characterize the part Consensus proU-RBS-RFP (BBa_K2467002), an optimized synthetic proU, strong RBS and mRFP1 osmolarity sensor. During the experiments for the characterization, our team member was able to guide the high schoolers through performing transformations, calculating molarities and dilutions, creating stock solutions, and graphing data. After assisting the Pittsburgh CSL team, the CSL team was able to find optimal salt concentration for growth of E. coli.
During the summer, we started by working on the safety form to make sure they knew the basic safety rules in lab, and we asked them to describe their project so that they fully understood the goals and methods. Instead of answering each question on the safety form, we led them to think about the risks and considerations by themselves. It was worthwhile to ask small questions to provide clues to lead to the answers.
Another big part of our mentoring was helping with their Wiki page. Starting the Wiki can be difficult, so we began by going through and talking about each page, letting them know the basic construct and what content should be included. Also, we helped them to create a fundamental template, including clearing the unnecessary code, introducing general style, and creating navigation bar.

ZJU-China
On August 19, 2018, we jointly organized the “ShengXi” Science and Technology Festival with Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Science and Technology Association in Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum. Zhejiang University was the organizer. We jointly planned this activity. The theme of the activity was Popularizing synthetic biology and stimulating primary school students' interests in biology. Hundreds of people including children and their parents attended this activity. The activity was comprised of three links—— playing small games, giving small speeches and asking questions. In these processes, many children showed their strong interests and enthusiasm. We also prepared gifts as rewards for the children who answered the questions correctly.       We worked with Zhejiang University and we overcame many difficulties together. Thanks to Zhejiang University for creating such a wonderful experience with us. We gained a lot and had fun in this activity!
NAU-CHINA
In June, we established an online discussion group with NAU-CHINA, hoping to collaborate on editing wiki and modeling. And we kept a long-term communication. We actively discussed the problems encountered in the wiki editing process, such as how to modify the original wiki to make it meet the award requirements, how to set some effects to make wiki more beautiful and so on. Finally, we would like to thank NAU-CHINA again for your help!
CCiC
This summer, the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community(CCiC) was held at ShanghaiTech University. More than 60 iGEM teams shared their projects in Shanghai. We shared our project with other teams and discussed with them the problems we encountered in our project. Many of the suggestions we received from other teams were very valuable. So thank you very much for all who have helped us. And we would like to thank everyone from team ShanghaiTech again for their contributions to this meet-up. This was a great meet-up!

This summer, we contacted with iGEM team SCAU-China and had a meeting with them. In the meeting, the members of SCAU-China shared us some experience about team building, doing experiments, building models and making wiki.   And we learnt about that in their project, rice was used as the material to produce astaxanthin, which was supposed to be an economic way to produce astaxanthin. They wanted to know what will be the cost of the astaxanthin and we also had an interest on this, so we proposed to make a comparison of the costs for astaxanthin productions in different method. Finally, we could find that rice could be a great kind of material to produce astaxanthin because it could lower the price of astaxanthin greatly and made astaxanthin more accessible to the public."

UC_Davis,2016," host PY79. This strain has all it's seven associated proteases knocked out and is free from antibiotic resistance or integrated plasmids. This strain does produce spores however.
We have also shared the B. subtilis PY79 - BGSC Accession # 1A747, which is the wildtype strain of the K07 protease knockout. We are selecting this strain so we have a control for comparison. 
A third strain which our team has shared is the B. subtilus spo0A3 - BGSC Accession # 1S1. This strain comprises spo0A mutants, therefore they do not produce alkaline or neutral proteases. They also do not sporulate. The two most abundant secreted proteases are the alkaline protease (AprE) and the neutral protease (NprE) and are produced in the early stationary phase in normal bacillus. This mutant does not produce these proteases, however wall-associated proteases are still present. This strain is the result of mutations in the Spo0A locus and have normal antibiotic sensitivities. Note that Spo0A have reduced genetic competence, so it may be advisable to use electroporation to transform them.
We also ordered and shared the following strains, which became available during the summer:
KO8 - Protease-free strain knocked out in the BsuM restriction endonuclease (which will help with plasmid transformations) retaining wild-type levels of genetic competence (available by July 4th or earlier)
KO9 - Protease-free strain knocked out in the sigF gene which will be blocked at an early stage of sporulation and retains wild-type levels of genetic competence (available by July 4th or earlier)

On 13rd, August, 2015.We attended CCiC which was hosted by Peking University. By taking this opportunity, we made communications with other teams.
NJU-China which is from M3 lab Nanjing University offered valuable advice about CRISPR and expression vector. Before we made a study of safety, we thought that E.Coli vector would bring potential safety problems. Therefore we planned to express dsRNA in saccharomyces cerevisiae. Meanwhile, we planned to integrate the target gene to genome to avoid the lose of plasmids. But Doctor.ChenXi pointed that efficiency of prokaryotic expression system was better than eukaryotic expressing system. And there would be several problems which we couldn’t predict, and because of it. We would not be able to complete the project in time.
After conversation, we had to face the question that what we should do in the future. Therefore we restudied the safety problems. Luckily, we found information that honey could restrain the growth of bacteria. Therefore we decided to choose HT115 as an expression vector.
Meanwhile, we visited Beijing Normal University after CCiC. BNU-China Team is a year-old team, they also met several problems about the establishment of the team. How to attract new team members has been becoming one of the most important things. In their views, we could hold academic lecture to attract students to join us. And holding science communication event would be a good choice for us to attract popularity. What’s more, we agreed that standard training and criterion would be essential for the construction of teams."

Collaborations
Through our project this year, we had many wonderful opportunities to work with other iGEM teams. These teams included UW Seattle, Oxford, East Chapel Hill High School, Gaston Day School, and many more. One of our major collaborations was with Gaston Day School where we helped give guidance to a high school team. In other collaborations, we made a YouTube Channel where other teams were guest speakers. While all of these were important we also wanted to make sure that we gave back the iGEM community at large; so we created a Reddit Page where all iGEMers can discuss ideas with each other and specifically talk about ideas that can be deemed controversial or taboo by the general public. Click on each of the links to learn more about each of our different Collaboration Projects!
Gaston Day School
For the second year in a row our iGEM team has worked with the Gaston Day School. This year, we continued our mentorship role that we began last year and attempted to help the high school team with troubleshooting protocols, providing fresh lines of cells, and thinking about how to test their project.

Overview
We collaborated with University of Washington on a number of fronts: One of their members, Ed van Bruggen, attended a Poster Fair presented at Stanford University. There we presented our iGEM poster to him, we talked through each other’s projects, and we started figuring out how to expand collaboration between our projects. This collaboration took place primarily with troubleshooting. We gave University of Washington our single-chain antibody fusions to model, as a way to test the limits of their modeling method. The modeling failed, but the experience gave them useful information about the constraints of their model. We also took it upon ourselves to test run their wiki tutorial, giving feedback to make it more accessible to other teams. We look forward to future collaborations with University of Washington iGEM!

Special Thanks
We have to mention a special group that help us a lot. That is the whole family of iGEM-China. Chinese students are now making up a significant fraction in iGEM competition. However, due to time zone, and the language differences , we faced many challenges throughout the process. So we established a social media group to help each other. Each and every one of us benefited from this group. It is the greatest cooperation that can ever come to our doors.
We also want to thank the team from NCKU. They organized a wonderful conference to give the teams in the Asia-pacific area a chance to discuss their projects together. We received the warmest welcome from the hospitable team members of NCKU and had a great time during the conferences. It was a valuable opportunity to practice our presentation, and, most importantly, make new friends.

We focused on the current collaboration and communication like many iGEM teams. While we did further work concerning sustainability of iGEM teams and succession for iGEMers of next generation, which made us outstanding.
Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance Establishing Conference & Meet-up
Many iGEMers are thinking about a question, also are many iGEMers are experiencing one dilemma. When new blood flows in an iGEM team and old ones leave for the broader world, except from experience on experiment and knowledge about this field, what can we do for the followers? How to unite more teams to expand our influence on the whole society? How to prevent a meaningful Human Practice activity from vanishing as soon as its initiator leave the iGEM teams?
To better pass on the conventions and spirits of iGEM, also to promote the communication and collaboration between iGEM teams from Beijing and Tianjin, we UCAS-China team brought up the idea of establishing the Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance. Gladly, our idea was responded positively. TUST_China cooperated with us to contacted other 4 teams, including BNU-China , NKU_CHINA , Tianjin ,  and Tsinghua who was invited to join our meet-up as guest team. On Sep 16th, we UCAS-China team invited other 5 iGEM teams to Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) and held a meet-up, also to discuss the current and future collaboration between member teams of this brand new Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance.
Firstly, we have"
TUDelft,2017," or had no colonies at all. Furthermore, after performing Wageningen's  protocol, TU Delft shared a list of suggestions for its improvement as certain steps (such as scraping the dried kaolin containing the bacteria or counting the colonies in plates with kaolin) were both laborious and difficult to reproduce accurately.
Munich
A few months before our European Symposium had taken place, TU Delft shared a project description on Facebook featuring a summary of all the science behind our project. Shortly after, the team of Munich contacted us indicating that, coincidentally enough, our two teams were to make use of the protein Cas13a in our projects. Because of this, TU Delft and Munich saw a great window of opportunity opening, as the possibility of collaborations that could substantially help both projects was there.
Wet lab Collaboration iGEM Munich 2017
Both TU Delft and Munich's project had a common goal: the realisation of a detection device featuring Cas13a. Consequently, the stability of their Cas13a in their device was also one of the challenges in their design, as it would determine the shelf life and storability of their final product. As a part of this year’s project, TU Delft was also researching and developing an alternative stabilization method by making use of the tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). Therefore, TU Delft shipped a purified batch of TDPs to iGEM Munich, so that they could also assay and evaluate these; and, perhaps, eventually integrate them into their project.
TDPs in Munich!
However, the collaboration with Munich evolved after TU Delft had realised the first experiments with their purified Cas13a and TDPs and had observed that whenever our Cas13a was dried in combination with the TDP CAHS 94205, the resuspended Cas13a+TDP solution would start cleaving RNA  with and without target RNA at a similar rate, thus losing its specificity (see Figure 1).

We asked  Munich to assist us by repeating a similar drying experiment with the same CAHS protein and their Cas13a, in order corroborate our results and help us find the cause of such an unexpected finding. As observed in Figure 1, the same unexpected trend is"

    In this year, we co-expressed Cry and Cyt proteins by 2A-peptide expression system. Considering the effect of amino acids residues to the toxicity after cleavage, SCU-China team helped us to predict the potential effect by Swiss-Model. If you are interested in the details, you can visit this link: https://2016.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Model/Protein_Structure
Collaborations with BNU-China team
It's essential for us to get accurate growth condition of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the natural environment to keep the concentration of toxin at a lethal level. But in fact, it is almost impossible to test concentration anywhere due to the lack of equipment and skills. Therefore, building the growth model can help determine the amount of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii they should use and when they need to add more. To build an accurate growth model, BNU-China team members who have much experience in the mathematics helped us to achieve it. 
Moreover, BNU- China team wanted to detect paclitaxel by utilizing microtubule which expressed in E. Coli. Microtubule is assembled by α-subunit and β-subunit in eukaryotes. But E. Coli is a genus of prokaryote. So it is essential to justify whether microtubule assembled successfully or not in E. Coli. If microtubule assembled successfully, α-subunit and β-subunit will have interaction in E. Coli. To prove it, we used Co-Immunoprecipitation (CoIp) to confirm their interaction. If you are interested in the details, you can visit this link: https://2016.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Experiments

First Inter-Team Meeting (07/14/2017)
In an attempt to learn the methods used by other iGEM teams we participated in an inter-team Skype call. We chose to meet with the other teams sponsored by the United States Armed forces, because we share many of the same challenges. These teams are Lab Pats Carroll High School and the US Naval Academy.
Our team took many notes over the course of the hour-plus long Skype call that helped us to prepare for the upcoming challenges that iGEM poses.
iTesla-soundbio team meeting (09/28/2017)
Cadets2Vets Adviser Judy Nguyen and Cadets2Vets Collaborator from Center for Urban Waters Joel Baker had a conference call with two team members from iTesla-SoundBio: Anna Vasyura and Advisor Zach Mueller. They shared information about each others’ projects and the status of their experiments.
Anna and Zach are looking for help regarding the analysis of the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Joel had previously collaborated with a lab that performed this type of research and had a lot of valuable information to share. One of the significant bits of advice was to pivot the analysis from PCBs to PCEs (tetrachloroethene).
PCBs take a really long time to degrade and the analysis is not fast or easy to do. PCEs degrade a little quicker and make more sense to measure for the iGEM timeline. Joel will meet face to face with"

Since this is our university's first participation in iGEM, we asked many experienced iGEM teams for advice before we started. We got really helpful replies by the teams Frankfurt, Goettingen and Bielefeld.
Moreover we got visited by some members of the iGEM team TU Darmstadt, which told us about their project and listened to our project ideas, so that we could exchange views on these subjects. They also raised our awareness for a healthy atmosphere in the team, which is why we focused also on team building measures during our project.
We thank our sponsors:"

Conclusion
Future interlab studies should make use of cell-free
Our mini-interlab experiment indicated that cell-free systems can be considered reliable when optimized and could give reproducible results upon following standardized protocols. However, we would propose that more teams participate in this experiment as it is in the case of iGEM-interlab. This would confirm the efficiency of cell-free expression system and the technical variability when executed via various teams with good reproducibility.
Collaboration with iGEM Tübingen 2018 team
In order to test deimmunization tool BERT in the context of a meaningful application, > iGEM Tübingen 2018 team < collaborated with us. Their project focused on the usage of antimicrobial peptides fused together with self-assembling scaffolding proteins as a potential alternative to classical antibiotic treatment.
Dissecting Science
As a pilot team we were honored to collaborate with Marc Santolini in his project “Dissecting Science”. In this project, he aims to study the making and the learning of Science in situ by using the iGEM scientific competition as a model. iGEM presents a unique opportunity to bring together groups of scientific thinkers in a competitive, collaborative, and scientifically rich way. The participating teams share their project and their lab book in open wiki websites.
The study of these wikis has allowed to pinpoint the role of student interactions in the success of teams. Yet, the dynamic nature of these interactions in the lab has remained elusive. How do students collaborate? How are subgroups formed? What is the frequency of interactions with mentors/PIs? How do these interactions lead to better learning (skill spreading), productivity (BioBricks/project size), creativity (project uniqueness) and success in the competition (medals and prizes)? To answer these questions, his team investigated for the first time the interactions in the lab for the our team as a pilot, with the end goal to reach out to a large number of teams. Such interaction was mapped by: 1) using MIT Rhythm badges in collaboration with Oren Lederman and Jordan Reedie from MIT Media Lab; 2) analysis of team interaction through the Gmail, Slack and self-report survey.

Unesp Brazil
The iGEM team Unesp Brazil works on a new framework to engineer and test probiotics. To analyze their circuit, they use modelling. A major concern was the production of insulin in the absence of glucose. We helped them to improve their model       and supported them throughout the develpment of their model. Our contribution in particular:
We helped to improve their ODE model by adding additional equations and restrictions to their model. Compare Figure 1 and Figure 2 to see how this influenced their model output. As you can see we were able to adjust their model so that it           predicts           reasonable concentrations. In Figure 1.2 the KD for sRNA/DNA binding is depcited and shows how important it is to optimize this paramter for their model in order to obtain the desired output.
We developed guidlines for the team to guide thier parameter estimation and helped them with the literature research for the parametres of their models.
The Unesp Brazil team is working on a booklet on modelling for further iGEM teams at their university. This booklet is meant to guide subsequent teams on their modelling approaches. We were happy to contribute by providing the Tips & Tricks section in this booklet.
We provided lecture material for stochastic modelling.

Utrecht
This year, the iGEM team from Utrecht is also working on modifying and improving the Tar receptor of E. coli. In their project they are evolving the natural receptor so that it can reliably detect pollutants in water. Furthermore, they are         planning to modify the receptor to increase the range of detectable molecules, making it more applicable in real life.          During the European iGEM Meetup in July, we realized that both of our teams were working on chemotaxis-based biosensors. Although our projects are"
Marburg,2018," tries the teams would have been able to complete this step, but it would have taken precious time away from their projects.
Fast growth
Some teams were so used to good ol’ E. coli they weren’t prepared for Vibrio natriegens. The fast growth of V. natriegens surprised them and threw off their lab routine. In some cases they ended up overgrown plates. We think that we can solve this problem in the future by simply spreading the word on Vibrio natriegens. If people are confident that the organism will deliver on its promises and grow fast, they can plan their workflow accordingly.
Not storable in the fridge
In the beginning of our project we realized that Vibrio natriegens had problems surviving in the fridge. If left outside in room temperature the plates became overgrown. We are working on a strain that is able to survive cold temperatures to solve this problem. We want to insert a KatG catalase into our VibriClone strain, but we haven’t completed this experiment as of now.
InterLab promotors in Vibrio natriegens
First, we conducted the Vibrigens InterLab (Fig. 4) ourselves and established what promoters were the strongest for us. We plotted a graph to show how strong the promoters were in relation to each other by comparing the data gathered after 3h of growth time.
The strongest fluorescence was emitted by device 5. Device 4 and 2 were very similar, but had a much weaker fluorescence than 5. Devices 1, 3 and 6 had incredibly low GFP values.
Also, we plotted a graph to show how strong the promoters were in relation to each other by combining the data gathered after 3h of growth time from all participating teams.

We calculated the mean emission of each device for each team and the strongest fluorescence was emitted by device 5.  Device 1 and 4 were very similar and came in at about half the fluorescence signal as 5. Devices 2 and 6 had a quite low emission and device 3 almost no signal.

Overview
Because of the specialty of our project, we mainly serve iGEMers and synthetic biologists. Via BioMaster, they may find the information they need in an easier way and save more time on the searching for information. We collaborated some iGEM teams and sent our database to them. Some teams indeed need a more convenient way to search and they gave us their feedback to help us further improve our project.
UESTC-China
(University of Electronic Science and Technology of China)
UESTC-China offered many helps in the construction of our project. At our ‘Preliminary investigation’ stage, we communicated with them and they told us their needs for a new biobrick database. When our project has formed into the internal test version, they gave us valuable feedback. Their feedback has become one of the basis for our further adjustment.
We also worked with USETC-China to validate the effects of our predictor. They provided us with the FRE sequence, then we predicted this sequence, and performed promoter optimization to remove unnecessary part. They constructed plasmids with predicted promoter, then transferred it to the host DH5α. The verification proves that the predicted promoter is very likely correct. What’s more, we helped UESTC-China by using our database BioMaster. UESTC-China needed some statistics aiding their experiments, so we recommended our database and they found what they need.

BroadRun-Baltimore,2016," that many non-native English speaking iGEM teams face, our team offered to help Heifei’s iGEM team with writing and editing their wiki content, designing the poster and presentation, presenting their project to the judges, and answering questions. Through the summer, we stayed in contact with Heifei iGEM. We gave their team a layout to follow as they worked on writing wiki content (see below), in addition to tips and advice based on our experiences. As they worked on the wiki, we edited and proofread their wiki content to clarify main points and make it easier for readers to understand.
Through September, Heifei iGEM and us further discussed and worked together on their wiki, and began to talk through the poster and presentation. We gave tips and advice on how to plan out the poster and presentation. We sent Heifei a poster template we created, with explanations of how best to layout content in the poster. We also sent a document with explanations of laying out the presentation-Background and Introduction, Objectives, Methods, Results, Conclusions, and Future Work-and what content should be in each section(see below).
In October, we had two Skype calls with Heifei iGEM. In the first, we discussed edits to be made to the wiki content, the design of the poster, and the design of the presentation. We walked their team through the process of laying out the sections of a poster and a presentation, explaining how to organize their content in a way that is concise and clear. Their team practiced parts of their presentation that they had, and we practiced how to answer questions from the judges. In our second call, they continued to practice talking through their presentation. We had created a list of questions for Heifei iGEM that the judges may have for them, and helped them practice answering those questions to be better prepared and to help overcome nervousness.
William and Mary iGEM
Last year, William and Mary iGEM created a synthetic biology teacher curriculum, with a range of hands on activities for kids of all ages, from elementary school to high school. In all four of our extensive public outreach events, we used activities from William and Mary’s curriculum. At all of the events, the activities were extremely popular, kids and adults alike learned a lot, asked great questions, and had fun with the hands on activities.

The experimental results are shown in the figure below. Well 1: Aptamers, Well 2: Complementary chains, Well 3: Aptamers + Complementary chains. As can be seen from the figure, the electrophoresis speed of the combined DNA is slower than that of the aptamer and the complementary strand, and it is indeed combined.
Collaborations-NAU-CHINA
NAU-CHINA
On July 31, 2018, at the 6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference hosted by National Chung Hsing University, Taichung，we met with NAU-CHINA team and established a deep friendship. Since then, our two teams have exchanged and discussed ""how to build a team.""
The professor affirmed the feasibility of our project and gave us some invaluable advice. Under the suggestion of Professor Zhu Zhi, we chose EpCAM and aptamer SYL3C. In addition, we are very grateful to Professor Zhu for her support on many instruments and materials provided during our experiments.
First we discussed ""what kind of team should we build?"" The International Genetic Engineering Machine Competition is a creative synthetic biology event and an interdisciplinary competition involving cross-disciplinary fields in mathematics, computers, statistics and so on. So our team should be a creative, comprehensive synthetic biology team. Our team members should be creative and comprehensive students. Most students of our two teams have multiple roles in the team.
Second, we discussed ""how to find new partners."" After we know what kind of team we want to build, we could find the companions we need. First, we have presentations, exhibitions, lab activities, etc. to make students realize that, what kind of the team they will join in and what is the team building for? what role they will be in the team, and what should be done by themselves? In order to join this team and make this team better, how should them prepare and learn? Then we divide the interviewers into different groups according to different division of labor and their wishes. Different groups determine the way of assessment according to the division of labor. For example, the number module is tested by some models, and the art team performs preliminary selection through some art production tasks... We will give priority to students with multiple skills.
Third, we communicated on how to train the new team members in the early stages of team formation. First of all, we will introduce our team and International Genetic Engineering Machine Competition through"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,"orfs postcard initiative to spread knowledge on synthetic biology where we submitted our own design.
They also invited us to the NRW- day where we had a stall and hold a presentation on our project. What was special about this was that the presentation was open to the public so we had to find a way to simplify our project to an extend that everybody would be able to understand what we were doing. Get a more detailed look here .
Freiburg
At the iGEM Meet Up Germany in Marburg in August where all German iGEM teams participated and presented their projects we gained great insight into their topics. Since we found out that the iGEM team Freiburg 2016 works with Nanobodies, too, we began to exchange experiences. Shortly after our first get together we had a skype call to discuss further details about our projects and possibilities for supporting each other.
Considering the proximity of these aspects of our projects, it was only natural that we shared similar problems. For example, the correct folding of the chosen binding proteins in E. coli. As disulfide bounds are not well built in the cytoplasm and Nanobodies are possessing these when not specifically designed to avoid, we thought about utilizing a bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( BIFC ) as a control for correct protein folding. While further formulating this issue in our calls (click here for our Skype protocol) it crystallized that team Freiburg could make good use of our control system, too. After all we decided to give them the two plasmids necessary for the BIFC in order to have a control.
Lethbridge
We were thrilled after realising that this year’s project from Lethbridge University was similar to our project. They also wanted to screen a library of nanobodies using a bacterial two-hybrid system. After initiating the contact we had several skype meetings ( see here for a complete skype diary ) where we exchanged ideas and talked about each other’s approaches towards the experiments. After a intensive discussion about bacterial two-hybrid systems, we realized that Lethbridge has no positive controls for their two-hybrid system. Therefore we sent them our positive controls: the HA4-Abl SH2 binding pair including the different mutants of HA4 . In this way,we hope to give iGEM Lethbridge the tools to validate their two-hybrid system.
In exchange, Lethbridge provided us with the NS1 peptide from influenza A virus. We wanted to try this peptide as a potential target for our Evobodies. Therefore we could generate Evobodies against the important pathogen"
Lethbridge,2017," the opportunity to collaborate with them. We have helped each other through continued mentorship and project guidance via video conference calls. FSU was also able to mail us two of their constructs BBa_K2367009 And BBa_K2367010 so that we could in vitro transcribe them in our transcription and translation system. We quickly learned from our first failed attempt at transcribing their constructs that their promoter was not compatible with our system. This helped us to realize a flaw in both our transcription and translation system as well as commercially available systems. After talking with FSU we decide that to better address the needs of synthetic biologist and make our system more dynamic we should look to incorporate native E.coli RNA polymerase into our system in the future.  Throughout our reiterative talks, we have both benefited immensely in being able to constantly design and refine our projects and goals."

Because we considered it to be helpful for other teams as well, we decided to offer help for all other iGEM teams: our First Aid Service for PCR Problems . Happily we could help some teams overcoming their PCR problem.
Helping iGEM Hamburg with their PCR problems
Since the beginning of their project the iGEM team Hamburg experienced difficulties performing gene amplifications. After tedious trial and error using different gradient-PCRs, experimenting with GC-enhancer solutions and DMSO concentrations we figured out a way to amplify eleven out of their twelve genes and gene fragments. The only one that did not work despite their efforts was the AraC family transcriptional regulator. They noticed our PCR First Aid Service and after a skype call in which Hamburg described their problems and attempts we gave them valuable tips. Our ideas were a raise of the annealing temperature to 72 °C, adding 0.5 M betaine, try adding DMSO in 3 %, 5 % or even 10 % concentration or a combination of both DMSO and betaine. Hamburg gave a try to all these suggestions, unfortunately without having a hit.   We discussed the result with the iGEM Team Hamburg becuase we did not want to give up an gave additional tips to try. Our next suggestion was to design new primes, as ours had a very high GC content in the middle part and were therefore prone to the formation of secondary structures. Also, the new primer pairs should be designed to anneal at 72 °C. They offered to design to take over the design for us. These were the original primers: Fw: CATTATGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGA Rv: GATAATCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTA

After understanding of protein composition required for fire retardant effectiveness, we would like to find a novel protein candiate with fire retardant properties. We decided to use protein data mining approach in bioinformatics for our purpose.
 
We contacted and asked iGEM team, NCTU-Formosa for collaboration with data mining and programming. Chao-Di Chang, who is an advisor of team NCTU-Formosa  in 2014, taught us a lot in the field of bioinformatics and protein databases such as NCBI, UniProtKB and dbPTM. The super advisor, Prof. Wen-Liang Chen gave us many great advices and shared experiences in the previous iGEM projects and Jamboree.
 
This year, the members of NCTU-Formosa helped us finding out the fire retardant target in the protein data bank. And Yi-Ru Liu of team Mingdao wrote a programming code (see here) and NCTU-Formosa gave us a lot of comments on the code. With the thanks of NCTU-Formosa, we found the ideal target with high serine and arginine contents in protein composition from Uniprot database (see the result).

ETH_Zurich,2015," the rather extensive experience in mammalian cell culture and bacterial-mammalian coculture our team had gathered in the course of our project. Since the team of Stockholm did not have the opportunity to test their system in such a real-life system, we decided to validate their system by combining their engineered E. coli cells with their actual targets: HER2-positive breast cancer cells.
Validation of ABBBA binding to cancer cells
We characterized the system of Stockholm regarding the binding of their bacteria to HER2-positive breast cancer cells. The affibody-based system explored by the Stockholm iGEM team is designed to make engineered E. coli cells bind to cancer cells expressing the targeted surface marker. In the tested case of HER2-positive breast cancer, the team came up with three chimeric receptors, targeting different epitopes of the HER2 extracellular domain. We tested the binding of ABBBA E. coli expressing the respective constructs to HER2+ SK-BR-3 cells.
For better observation of colocalization of the bacteria and the mammalian cells we tried to introduce a second plasmid carrying a constitutively expressed fluorophore into the bacterial strains that we received from Stockholm. Unfortunately, all attempts to this failed. As an alternative, we tried transforming the plasimds carrying their test constructs into E. coli expressing GFP from their genome. It seems that cells are not quite happy accepting the plasmids of interest, which was surprising since we never had any severe problems with our transformations. Nevertheless, we were determined to give our best in this cause and went on to characterize the interaction of bacteria and mammalian cells after aplying a spheroblast protocol (removing the outer membrane) and inducing the bacteria with IPTG for expression of the LacI-regulated constructs by microscopy. The spheroplast protocol is necessary since the affibody construct is localized in the inner membrane of E. coli and has to be revealed by removal of the outer membrane.
Results
Unfortunately, the lack of a way to clearly identify the ABBBA bacteria via a marker made it very hard to differentiate between bound bacteria and bumps in the surface of mammalian cells. We tried to visualize an interaction but we have to say that with the methods available to us non of our attempts yielded conclusive results.
Figure 1. We tested three different constructs for their binding to HER2-positive SK-BR-3 cells. The comparison of induced and non-induced spheroblasts did not yield conclusive results.

Over the summer, our team traveled to the campus of the University of Maryland for the 2018 Mid-Atlantic Meetup. This meet-up was a great opportunity to talk to the other teams from the region and get feedback for our project. Two teams present were particularly interested in the 3G portion of our project: University of Virginia and University of Pittsburgh. We quickly began a correspondence and, to demonstrate the accessibility and ease of 3G assembly, we sent them the supplies and instructions to perform a 3G assembly at their own lab. The package consisted of a parts kit, a transcriptional unit assembly protocol, a Gibson protocol and calculator, 100mM IPTG, and 200ug/ml ATC. The parts kit included a small subset of our own 3G assembly library, normalized to 30nM, as well as 50nM UNS adapters, and 10uM primers for amplification. The parts are listed below.

The Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team are creating a therapeutic probiotic for the treatment of phenylketonuria, similar to our therapeutic for Wilson's disease. We have maintained contact with the team for much of the duration of our project, through Skype and email. The main part of our collaboration with them has been to sort out the modelling for the team.
We agreed to have the modelling of the Vilnius team outsourced to our dry lab team. We created models to simulate their team project, which is to convert phenylalanine into trans-cinnamic acid (TCA) using a recombinant enzyme PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase) in vivo. The purpose of the model is to define the efficiency of the system and the limits of its performance in order to show the liability of the approach.
The phenylalanine ammonia lyase reaction
In the initial modelling before the experiment, our model simulated the transport of phenylalanine into the cell and the conversion rate into TCA. Under lack of information on the concentration function of PAL and the transporter protein PheP, we provided simulations for a range of concentration conditions for the two proteins. In later models, we incorporated the PAL expression function gained from experimental data to create a more accurate version of the model. From experimental data of the production of TCA, we were able to predict the concentration of PheP in the cell membrane.
Using MATLAB for simulation, we have provided the Vilnius team with graphs, equations, and information of the model to help them create their dry lab wiki page. Below are some examples of the graphs we have provided:

Collaboration: SCU China iGEM team 2016
In order to gain a better global understanding of intellectual property rights in emerging markets. Our team lead, Dawson, was in Chengdu, Sichuan, China in July to visit family relatives. While in China, he couldn’t help but seize the opportunity to meet with SCU-China iGEM team in person to exchange ideas. This eventually lead to a knowledge exchange where both teams researched on copyright, patent and trademark laws in the respective countries. In the end, we exchanged our information to compare and contrast the nuances in regards to IP rights within each country.
We realized that both respective countries had their differences in IP laws due to cultural differences, and we devised a mock business plan in order to accommodate for the differences in intellectual property laws to ensure our venture is successful in an emerging global marketplace.
Outreach: St. Elizabeth Seton Junior High with UrbanTundra_Edmonton iGEM Team
Team member Mirat Sojitra presenting the concept of synthetic biology to junior high students at St. Elizabeth Seton Junior High, Edmonton, Alberta.
As part of our efforts to reach out to the community, our team collaborated with the local high school iGEM team. To celebrate this, we organized an event at a local junior high school, St. Elizabeth Seton, and introduced the concept of synthetic biology.
The children were not fully aware of how the properties of everyday items can be used to create scientific reactions. A protocol using household belongings, designed by the high school iGEM team, showed how it is possible to extract DNA from strawberry. This was very successful, with the junior high school students receiving hands-on experience. We were thrilled to collaborate with the high school team and also inspire the next generation of students by introducing them to iGEM and synthetic biology."

During our own project we have worked with the microplate reader extensively. We tested eight different constructs in a microplate reader: three different BioBricks for expression of various fluorescent proteins and five different devices for the expression of GFP, each with a different promoter. The protocol used for this experiment can be found here .
Figure 1. We grew and tested 8 different strains from Delft. The figures they made with our data can be found in Figure 1 on their Collaborations page .
On top of that, the Delft team performed an experiment for us. An essential part of our in vitro toxicity assay were vesicles made from the gut membrane of Varroa mites. We were hoping for a picture showing the presence of these vesicles. The TU Delft team helped us with this by making pictures of our vesicles using an transmission electron microscopy!The pictures as shown in Figure 2. In short, we are content with the results we got and the practice we had through this collaboration.

Groningen
For the Groningen iGEM team, we tested and improved their system ""CryptoGERM"". CryptoGERM was developed to encrypt messages in the DNA of Bacillus subtilis spores, that can only be decoded using a key that is also in a spore.  We received a message to decrypt from the Groningen team. As we tested the system in an early stage, when it was not fully developed, we used a translator webpage instead of spores containing the key.
The procedure is as follows:
Grow spores.
PCR the encoded message.
Sequence the PCR product.
Unfortunately, the first attempts of PCR amplifying the message failed. We tried to perform colony PCR and tested different adjustments of the protocol:
Longer initial denaturation time.
Less DNA as template.
Addition of DMSO.
However, we could not obtain the correct PCR fragment. Subsequently, we tried to isolate the genomic sequence of the bacteria first. After doing this we obtained a nice PCR product that was sent for sequencing. Thus, we proposed to change the protocol from colony PCR to PCR from isolated and purified genomic DNA.

The WashU-PSU iGEM team collaborated with a few teams over the summer and early fall. Listed below are each team we collaborated with and how we helped each other out.
Cardiff University iGEM :
In order to validate our measurements for our ATP constructs, we sent them our ATP producing plasmid constructs (pck and pgk) to be tested in their state of the art technology, the Biospace Lab PhotonIMAGER.
See their data on our results page
Vilnius iGEM :
Vilnius recreated our characterization of HSP BBa_K873002 and confirmed our results. We gave them our protocol and helped them through the procedure.
UNL iGEM :
We were mentors this summer to the  first iGEM team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. UNL iGEM's project involved engineering bacteria to denitrify water. This goal compliments our project, so the relationship was a good fit.
We...
Provided them with water from the Mississippi river to test for nitrates
Helped them find funding sources by putting them in contact with Monsanto and our other sponsors
Met up at the Heartland iGEM Meetup and exchanged presentation and project tips
Gave them many HP resources and contacts, like the Iowa Soybean Association and St. Louis Waterworks
Helped each other through the wiki freeze crunch time
We were so happy to have worked with them throughout the summer and are in awe of how hard they worked and what they accomplished!

Collaborations
During the later half of the iGEM season, our team was fortunate enough to be able to collaborate with the UMaryland iGEM team. Together, we helped improve each other’s presentations and gave feedback on each other’s projects.
On October 7th, our team presented to the public for Baltimore Innovation Week at our community lab, the Baltimore UnderGround Science Space (BUGSS). The UMaryland team came to watch us present, and gave us valuable feedback. While they were at BUGSS, they were also able to conduct outreach with the people that were there for Baltimore Innovation Week.
On October 21st, the UMaryland team came and showed us their presentation. We were able to learn more about presenting well, and they were able to get feedback on their presentation.
Using the allergen screening protocol that we wrote (learn more about it here ), our team also helped the UMaryland team characterize their biobricks.
For the biobrick Part:BBa_K2477003 , there was a 28.7% of identity match and 47.1% similarity match to major latex allergen Hev b 4 from Hevea brasiliensis, in the allergen database. This means that the biobrick part is NOT of potential allergen status. In 80 amino acid alignments by FASTA window, no matches found that are greater than 35% for this biobrick. This also means that there is not of potential allergen status.
For the biobrick Part:BBa_K2477006 , there were several matches. The top two matches were at 63.4% of identity match and 83.4% similarity match to Thaumatin-like protein PWIR2 and 55.5% of identity match and 79.1% similarity match to Pathogenesis-related protein precur. This means that the biobrick part IS of potential allergen status. People using this part should consider the risk when using this in lab, for production, or in the environment. In 80 amino acid alignments by FASTA window, there were 33  matches found that are greater than 35% for this biobrick. This also means that this part is of potential allergen status. The majority of the matches are bannana"

Collaboration with NCTU_Formosa
Since we are a fairly new iGEM team, we are not familiar with the details about iGEM competition. Therefore we turned to NCTU_Formosa, who hosted this meetup on Aug 24th, during which we took turns presented our project, gave each other feedbacks             and suggestions. NCTU_Formosa is especially very helpful on our wiki page. As almost all of our team members are in biology background, building wiki page is truly a huge challenge for us. In this meeting, NCTU_Formosa spent a lot of time teaching and troubleshooting our problem on building wiki pages (Fig. 1), for which they prepared a 2-hour-course containing content list below. This is truly a very successful and helpful collaboration. After the meetup, NCTU_Formosa stayed in contac with us by messenger to further assist us with constructing wiki page.
Team NCTU_Formosa gave us a tutorial about html. During the tutorial, we learned:
1. Basic tags and elements for html
2. Image scale and website format adjustment
3. Styling html with CSS and JavaScript
4. Conversion of websites in PC and mobile version
Fig. 1. NCTU_Formosa taught us building wiki pages.
Thanks to NCTU­_Formosa’s guide, discussion and their generosity to assist our problems through messages after the meetup. We both learned a lot from each other.
Fig. 2. Members of NCTU_Formosa and NTHU_Formosa.
Since NCTU_Formosa is very interested in our project and we both would like to enhance our collaboration, we validated each other’s parts using in the experiments. NCTU-Formosa validated the DNA constructs we expressed in 293T cells in our experiments (Fig. 3).

Moreover, he visited our laboratory and power generation equipment. We hope it could bring them support more or less. had an opportunity to , visit their laboratory and power generation equipment.
They showed great interest in our picture book children, considering it a meaningful thought which could help children know more about synthetic biology. Thus, they made some creative advice about the stories to help us polish the writing.

With PKU
All experiments were conducted at Peking University with team PKU. Team members from Peking University provided us many beneficial suggestions on experiment designing, inspiring us to solve problems. Without their help, we would not be able to complete all of our experiments with the same efficiency.
With UCAS
We lent the lab shaker to team UCAS since our campuses are very close to each other.
With SHSBNU_China
We shared our unique E. coli strain, E. coli Nissle 1917, with team SHSBNU_China, enabling them to realize their test in human gut.
Special Thanks
There are many institutes and people that helped us overcome many obstacles.
The microbiology technology company, Bluepha, has provided us technical support. Especially Haoqian Zhang, Bluepha’s CTO, leads us to a more mature circuit design as well as a logical presentation. He also lent us a HPLC though we did not use it to measure the final result.
National Institute of Metrology lent us the Amino Acid Analyzer that allowed us to measure the concentration of GABA. Their instructions enabled us to measure GABA with higher precision and efficiency.
Mr. Kai Sheng Hee from NUS Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation (SynCTI) shared us E. coli Nissle 1917, which is our main chassis.
Yan Wang from Maryland University helped us with illustrating icons.
Tsing Hua University Laboratory of Structural Biology helped us with our induction, ultrasound bacteria lysis, protein purification, SDS-PAGE and most of the protein-related process.
Our instructors, Miss Xiaoling Yao, Dr. David Brackett, Dr. Ruoting Tao, and Mr. Yihao Zhang have given us many great suggestions on project design. Mr. Zhang helped us specially on experiment conduction and problem solving. Dr. Brackett proofed read all of our wiki contents and helped us with academic writing. Miss Yao and Dr. Tao gave us many suggestions on our presentation.
We are also thankful for School TV Station and Imaginist, the school magazine for facilitating us promoting iGEM and our team.

Human practice collaborations
Amoy
Last year the iGEM team from Xiamen University together with the team from Paris Bettencourt University founded the Newsletter platform. Through this, iGEM teams from all over the world could share information about their project and discuss issues concerning it and synthetic biology in general. For this year’s version of the Newsletter iGEM Amoy contacted iGEM Stockholm to include us in the 2015 issue. We contributed with five articles concerning setting-up a team , germline modifications , a description of our project , an update on our progress and a controversial comment on impact factors in science.
Global collaboration on human practice surveys
CGU Taiwan involved the Stockolm team into a broader collaboration, evaluating public recognition of iGEM projects. Except for CGU Taiwan and Stockholm iGEM teams, the following teams collaborated on this:
Technische Universität Berlin (Berlin)
Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)
University of São Paulo (Brasil_USP)
The Chinese University of Hong Kong
University of Leicester
Tianjin University (Tianjin)
Université de Toulouse (Toulouse)
University College London (UCL)
Our role was to come up with questions for a survey and coordinate the technical work on the survey. In a related collaboration, we also hosted a survey on our servers for iGEM Nankai and provided them with technical support.
Aalto-Helsinki and Institut Pasteur
In the Stockholm team, several members expressed their will not to use Facebook for communication. The reasons ranged from personal to the fact that Facebook lacks key functions for streamlined collaboration and possibilities to customize it. Discussions regarding other means of communication started and the idea of the Hub arose as a common place for teams to discuss and collaborate both within the team and with other teams.
Aalto-Helsinki assumed these concerns were not limited to Stockholm and Alto-Helsinki decided to find out what other teams thought. Discussions between Stockholm, Alto-Helsinki and Institut Pasteur led to the setting up of a network using an open source platform called HumHub. This platform could potentially be used by all iGEM teams to streamline collaboration and communication within iGEM.

Introduction
This year, SZU-China has in-depth collaboration with three university teams: FAFU-CHINA, SUSTech_Shenzhen, SYSU-CHINA and two high school teams: BGIC_China and SMS_Shenzhen. The communication and cooperation with each team is shown as followings.
Our team began collaboration on June 17th, 2016 at SynBioBeta Activate, an international conference held in Shenzhen. Famous synthetic biologists all over the world gathered at the conference to share their latest discoveries in particular focuses. Some other iGEM teams from southern China also attended the conference. There, we encountered and communicated with the members of FAFU-CHINA, SUSTech_Shenzhen, SYSU-CHINA and XMU-China. After the conference, the members of the five teams had a professional and academic communication in Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). As the discussion went really well, we decided to have further and deeper cooperation with each other in the future.
On the second day, June 18th, 2016, we SZU-China invited members from FAFU-CHINA，SYSU-CHINA and XMU-China to Shenzhen University to deepen our collaboration. During the conference, each of the four teams presented their projects and raised questions on others’ projects to identify the problems. At the end of the conference, we agreed to offer help as possible as we could if any of the four teams encountered difficulties. It will be a promising, continuous collaboration among us.

TX-TL is a cell-free, in vitro, transcription/translation system that allows for inexpensive and rapid prototyping of biological circuits. This is desirable, as the usual method of prototyping and debugging circuits requires DNA parts to be cloned into cells, which can be time-consuming and laborious. With TX-TL, once all the DNA parts have been obtained, the circuit can be tested immediately, and so several circuit iterations can be tested in the time it takes to successfully clone even one circuit iteration into cells. Caltech generously loaned us a plate reader to enable us to use this method.
We were able to successfully perform TX-TL for a series of William and Mary parts.
We offered TX-TL William and Mary’s Team’s plasmids in order to see how their results would vary with this different construct. William and Mary’s Team gave us suggestions and also offered us some plasmid and backbone which is iGEM standard plasmid.
Below is a graph of our results:
This chart shows the fluorescence in the plasmids (each labeled by their RBS part number  followed by their iGEM part number) measured in Arbitrary Fluorescence Units using TX-TL.
This graph shows the fluorescence of the plasmids, over a period of 12 and a half hours, in the plate reader.

Aachen,2018," solution for a specific problem,     then it is probably time to ask the community. Sharing and collaborating is the policy of iGEM.     People who step back show maturity, because they understand where their limits are and choose to rely on other people to overcome them.
In the first months of our project, we were contacted by the iGEM team of Kyoto which was working     on a project similar to the predecessor iGEM team Aachen Salt Vault Their project consists in genetically modifing yeast S. cerevisiae to take up sodium as well as chloride ions      to desalinate water and therefore recover fields which have been floated by the sea. Because one of our team mates has been part of the previous iGEM team Aachen, we decided to advice them.
We shared expertise, results and modelling information in order to help them as much as possible and make their first iGEM experience as a team both as enjoyable and       smoothly as possible.
Bhopal
Mentoring and liaising of contact
We had the pleasure to work with iGEM IISER Bhopal from India.     They also work on a cell based biosensor, but to measure the methane concentration of the air.      It was interesting to talk with them about our different approaches to this topic and to give each other thought-provoking impulses. For example sharing our approach of how to do a cell free biosensor via LSPR gave them an idea on how to make a biosensor more practical.      Our Engineer Jan Swetschinski instructed this Indian team on how to do the modeling for their project.      He recommended them a modeling program and showed them how to use it to feed the information into the programme.
We also exchanged our human practices experiences and ideas with each other and iGEM Bhopal gave us the opportunity      to ask some questions to Dr. Puneet Ghandi, an Indian professor in Medical Biotechnology.      As she researched on DNA instability in neurodegenerative disorders, we asked if she had come across the correlation      of an imbalanced melatonin production and neurodegenerative disorders in her studies.      She investigated Hurler's Syndrome and Huntington's Chorea and told us that the role of melatonin was more studied in these diseases recently.      Based on her current work on CNS tumors, Dr. Ghandi thought it would be useful to measure the concentration of melatonin in these disorders.      Through this contact, we were reassured that a malfunction of melatonin production is a worldwide important topic      in medical research, therefore a simplification of the measuring"

OLS Canmore
To increase a feeling of unity and to create connections between communities in Alberta, our team decided to collaborate with the OLS Canmore high school team.
After first reaching out to their team, we arranged a Skype conference to discuss areas that we could potentially collaborate in. We eventually decided that our team could help out with Canmore’s lab work on their construct to test out a part they have had troubles with. More specifically, we will be helping to confirm that the cells contain the correct part by performing some gene sequencing. Our team will also be searching for enzyme production.
While our team does this, Canmore agreed to send out the survey that we mentioned before, in order to gain a wider range of responses from it. They will also be looking into the ethical and moral side of bacteria entering the body for us.
As a way to work together on our projects, we decided to create a Google doc between the two teams where we give each other feedback and ask questions about the two projects.  Learning from this advice and critique, and applying it will allow both teams to further their projects in a better way. For example, Canmore’s team asked for more specific details on how our team plans to administer the snake venom in our project. This question made us realize that when explaining our project, we need to specifically address the exact way that the venom will be applied in our construct in order for people outside of our team to understand. Their team also wondered whether snake venom had been used previously in a clinical setting for blood coagulation. Their curiosity for this led our team to research more into this matter. Ultimately, we found out that a team of researchers at Rice University in the US have created a new hydrogel infused with snake venom that is used for blood coagulation, but still has to go through years of testing before it will be approved to be used on humans(http://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-hydrogel-made-from-snake-venom-stops-bleeding-in-"
UCLA,2016," the summer for advice on their current project. We had a great time chatting with their team via Google Hangouts about the details of our previous project and discussing the various issues and problems we ran into, as well as how we overcame them. Their project sounds really awesome, and we're excited to see their presentation at this year's Jamboree!
Collaboration with UCSC iGEM on Human Practices
Members of the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) iGEM Team reached out to us over the summer asking if we would be able to help them with their Human Practices project by providing an interview with them. The project focused on the discussion of the recent movement in ""Do-It-Yourself Synthetic Biology.""  We had a great time as a team discussing our thoughts and ideas about the movement; many of us were unfamiliar with it and it was awesome to be able to learn about it while helping another team with their project! We all love synthetic biology and are huge advocates for expanding the influence of synbio throughout our world and community. Our video interview can be viewed here."
BioIQS-Barcelona,2018," challenges. Presenting all the information about the project and identifying the strengths and the weaknesses of it help establishing collabortions between teams and receiving feedback and help. In fact, during the time for questions, we received multiple ideas to incorporate to our project. One of the greatest ideas was given by Oscar from UPF-CRG Barcelona, which said that designing a mobile app to read the result of the sensor and connecting to the cloud to send the information about this analysis (restaurant, dish, date and result) could create a very useful network/database for the users of the sensor.
In addition, we presented to the other teams the opportunity to collaborate with us by replicating our PCR standardization process with the saliva of another celiac person. The iGEM UPF-CRG Barcelona team accepted to collaborate with us, as both teams are from the same city, which facilitates the communication and material exchange between us.
We also discussed how we could integrate our sensor with the sensor designed by OLM-Madrid. The experimental part of our project has been focused on the sensing element of the gluten sensor (finding a way to express the HLA-DQ protein of each user), whereas the focus of the OLM-Madrid project has been the design of a hardware platform for another sensor. Therefore, both projects complement. For this reason, both teams discussed how to combine the HLA-DQ protein obtained following our method with the hardware platform designed by their team. Basically, the protein should incorporate a sulfur group in the desired region in order to attach it to the conductive gold layer of the sensor.
This should be done in a way that the region which interacts with the gliadin peptide is exposed to gliadin molecules and not blocked by the surface of the sensor. The sensor would detect the binding of the peptide due to the change of potential experimented by the surface of the conductive gold layer. However, there are certain points which should still be checked experimentally, like the need for rinsing steps between two different usages of the sensor. Overall, we discussed an alternative to the gold nanoparticle visual detection method we designed and proposed here .
One of the most stimulating points of the Spanish MeetUp was hearing the presentation of other teams’ projects and getting new synthetic biology ideas from there. All the teams which participated in the Spanish MeetUp did a project of a very different topic. Hence, it was very interesting to see other applications of synthetic biology and how the iGEM competition is a perfect fit for very different kind of projects. The experts’ presentations were absolutely amazing. With them, we discussed important topics in synthetic biology like the"

    SdiA is a homolog of LuxR that is able to partially activate AHL promoters in E. coli. LuxR and some types of AHL promoters are used in our project. LacI is used in our project, too. Therefore, to eliminate these the influence of these two intrinsic genes on experiments, we need to knock out sdiA and lacI in MG1655, which is used to do test in experiments. However, we do not know how to knock them out. Therefore, we turned to Team NPU-China for help and they succeed to knock them out. MG1655 they provide performed very well during our experiments.
III Tsinghua
    Back in Tsinghua, we formed a tight relationship with our brother team, Team Tsinghua, based on members’ friendship and productive team-team interaction, which results in the two teams’ frequently doing things together.
    First, we think together. At the brainstorming stage, we shared our inspiration and sparks and mutually received thought-provoking advice from the other. We discussed a wide range of problems including the project’s applicability, molecular tools in gene editing, plans of human practice and so on.
    Second, we act together. Several teams outside Tsinghua (BNU-China, SZU-China, XMU-China) have expressed their willingness to pay a visit to our university and teams. We thus held several seminars together with Team Tsinghua under the efficient coordination of Han Jianing from Tsinghua and Wang Chenghao from Tsinghua-A. During the open talk other teams’ creative thought struck us from time to time. Some of them even kindly pointed out our team’s flaw which we later payed heavy attention to (the problem of applicability and its limit in human practice). Here we want to deliver our sincere appreciation to Team Tsinghua and all those team involved. It is your wisdom, openness and passion that makes the seminar successfully achieved what was far beyond our expectation.
    Thirdly, we fight together. University’s Biotechnology Building has seen the two teams spend entire"
SCU-China,2016," activities. Because of the lack of the PDB structure of template Cry11Aa, the homologous model of Cry11Aa-2A is not reliable. Then we used threading method to predict the structure of Cry11Aa-2A. The result shows that we have three reliable model (two homologous model for Cry4Aa-2A and Cry10Aa-2A, and one hidden Markov model for Cry11Aa-2A) to predict their functions.
1) Cry4Aa-2A Homologous Model
Fig.1. 3D homologous model of Cry4Aa-2A
Fig.2. The results of homologous model are reliable because of GMQE and QMEAN.
Fig.3. Local quality estimate of Cry4Aa-2A
Fig.4. GMQE is between 0 and 1, and |Z|score <4, so this homologous model is reliable.
2) Cry11Aa-2A Hidden Markov Model

These results proved our hypothesis, and drove FAFU-China to find a new way to realize their purpose.
2. SCUT-China_A (In Wet Lab Experiment)
This year, team SCUT-China_A constructed a pathway for high efficient degradation of organic sulfur in soil in the bacteria, which leads to the odor problem of the sulfur-containing organic component. Similar to our goal about our insole, they also need a proper odor-itself-reduced E. coli strain In the project for the industrialized production. Based on this point, they requested for the tnaA knockout gene E. coli JM109 strain in our project for the optimization in their project.
3. IngenuityLab_Canada (In Human Practice)
This year, team IngenuityLab_Canada explored attaching Photosystem II (PSII) protein to the DNA nanowire to generate a usable current and act as a nanoscale battery. Similar with our goal about our insole, their final goal is to put their nanoscale battery on the market, even on the international market. When it comes to international entrepreneurship, the difference of copyrights and intellectual property between different countries really deserves our considerations.
Based on this point, our international collaboration is a mutual exchange of knowledge and understanding of the policies regarding commercialization of science between China and"
HUST-China,2017," from the silicon net after the bacteria is captured, and so on. Afterwards we mentioned the use of silicon net in the group meeting, and eventually we think that the use of silicon board makes it easier for our bacteria to collect.

We collaborated with the University of Chicago and University of Illinois teams in the creation of an Outreach kit to be used by future iGEM teams. Interestingly enough, we were first contacted by UChicago through our blog! Although mainly used as a tool for communication within our own team, it has also provided us with the opportunities to work with other teams. Further details regarding our outreach kits can be found HERE .
AiF MEET-UPS: ALBERTA & LETHBRIDGE
We also had a chance to work with the University of Alberta and University of Lethbridge teams during our regional team meet-ups.  At the Lethbridge Presentation Skills and Wiki workshop, we were able to spend a couple hours helping each other with various Wiki issues.  The Lethbridge team for example, had a problem with using images as links, and Mandy was able to help them correct the code for this. Both Alberta and Lethbridge teams were able to help us figure out some issues with our CSS coding. The meet ups were also a chance for teams to critique each others' projects and presentations, which was very beneficial in the shaping of our final projects. For more information on the Alberta regional team meetups, visit our overview HERE .
ETHICS SURVEYS & OTHER PARTS: VALENCIA, TUDELFT, & UNIPV-PAVIA
We also helped a few teams with their ethical surveys.  Our whole team participated in the Valencia Synthetic Biology Ethics survey, becoming the largest team to have all members complete it. A few of our team members also helped out the TUDelft team by completing their Ethics survey. For more details on the Valencia team survey in particular, please click HERE .
Finally, we helped out the UNIPV-Pavia team by sending them plasmid of one of the parts that we sequenced last year (Bbapart #) as they were having problems with the DNA from the Registry.

FAU_Erlangen,2018," Marburg and Team Bielefeld 2017. We lacked nothing and had a great time in Marburg.
The European meetup in Munich
Since our experiences in Marburg were so overwhelmingly postitive, between the 20th and 22th of July, our members David, Sven, Franzi, Flo, Verena Lena and Selina also participated in the European iGEM Meetup hosted by the iGEM Team of LMU/TU Munich. After arriving on Friday, we were invited to witness talks of both domestic and international scientists in the field of synthetic biology and bioengineering.
Following up the very informative talks we joined the poster session, where we could both introduce members of other teams to our project, and also listen to them explaining their respective ideas. Thereby it was possible to exchange ideas and valuable advice regarding the course of the projects. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of iGEM, the variety of different topics we could discuss about with our peers was simply overwhelming. For example, we could exchange knowledge about our Markov-chain simulations with computer scientists, and also discuss the characteristics of our used S-Layer proteins with fellow structural biologists.
The evening of the first day offered another opportunity to get in touch with the other teams, and to establish first contacts with peers from all around Europe. Here we want to remark the teams of TU Eindhoven, LMU/TU Munich, Graz and Hamm-Lippstadt in particular, with which we had great conversations and also resonated beautifully on a personal level.
The second day saw more enlightening talks and another poster session, with the additional introduction of workshops, where iGEMers could improve their soft skills in diverse research-related fields such as finance or project management, predominantly hosted by other teams.
The European meetup left us with an overwhelming impression. It gave our team members a first taste of what it means to be a scientist, to meet up with peers at conferences and to have constructive discussions about fascinating scientific topics. We want to wholeheartedly thank the iGEM Team Munich for the great organization of the event and even more so for their sincere, welcoming attitude towards their guests. The meetup will surely remain as an experience our attending team members will not forget too soon.

1. HOW WE HELP OTHERS
Sincere assistance to the software of HFUT-China 2016
This year, HFUT-China designed a software named BioDesigner Coral, the purpose of which is to recommend biobricks to those exhausted by the countless literature. It is convenient to acquire the relationship between genes or parts and related diseases through visualization. Their project excited the attention of us and we had a close collaboration with them in various ways.
Once after their preliminary design, we were the initial users to test how the software worked, using our sequences and some detailed data on probation. Based on the results, we firstly concluded a meticulous report to feedback not only for parameter choice but also the literature analysis. Then we also suggested expanding the databases to a wealth of non-standard parts and collecting experimental data of more parts for more optimal protocols. Receiving our feedback, they debugged the system again, which has perfected their software to a broad use.
What's more, for better user interface design, we offered sincere opinions about the software we had employed in daily researches, such as Primer Premier 5, SnapGene, MEGA6, etc. Our feedback advanced their optimization about user design and therefore the software became more user-friendly.

ASIJ_Tokyo
The faculty advisor of the ASIJ_Tokyo team visited our lab, and we began a collaboration process, since they were a new team this year, we were able to help them in a mentorship role. Throughout the year our team leaders were in contact with ASIJ_Tokyo’s team leaders, and discussed strategies on how to best run team meetings, track project progress, and set up a lab notebook. They also helped us by testing our nanoparticle calculator, and providing us with user feedback.
NYMU_Taipei
We have continued and strengthened our long standing partnership with National Yang Ming University (NYMU_Taipei). This year three members from TAS (Justin, Catherine and Yvonne) are members on both NYMU and TAS teams. They learned the cloning cycle from TAS and helped run experiments for NYMU throughout the year. In Boston, they will also help NYMU present their project at the Giant Jamboree.
NYMU-Taipei also hosted a summer camp for our team members, where they taught us about different aspects of iGEM and synthetic biology. In return, we helped them increase the efficiency of their models using equations from their literature research and ran simulations using their experimental data"
Technion_Israel,2016," our project. When we took our very first steps with protein modeling using Rosetta we quickly               discovered numerous problems and difficulties that occupied us for weeks before we even started using the software.
During our work, we realized how fast the process could have been if there was a guide detailing the               necessary resources and steps needed for a complete beginner in Rosetta. We figured that this might               be one of the reasons why so few iGEM teams have used Rosetta in the past despite its vast capabilities.
After getting great results from the software, we decided to share our experience and write this guide               ourselves so that future iGEM teams can have a better starting point. We were delighted to find that               we are not the only team using Rosetta this year and so we contacted iGEM Eindhoven and asked for               their help with the guide. Their work on the guide – writing, sharing their protocols and experience               was a valuable contribution that made the guide much more informative and comprehensive than we initially expected.

BGU - Prediction of chemoreceptor-ligand interactions
We processed potential variants of chemoreceptors for iGEM BGU using the Rosetta software.
We have used the Rosetta software in order to predict protein structure and to check for ligand-protein interactions.               Running the software and processing both the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the Tar chemoreceptor and               BGU's substances of interest - Protocatechuic acid and Ethylene glycol, yielded dozens of LBD variants.
After the filtering process, a library of variants which should theoretically serve as attractant chemoreceptors, was obtained.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017," for Science in Bonn. We answered this call and met with other iGEM teams from the region to stand up for the importance of science and reliable facts in our modern society. It was a great event and we had a lot of fun and got to know the team Cologne Duesseldorf , with which we held close contact throughout the whole year.

13.05, 15.07 - Meetings with Team Cologne Duesseldorf
After participating in the March for Science in Bonn, the iGEM team Cologne Duesseldorf invited us to a team meet-up. Thus, on the 13th of May, some of our team members drove to Dusseldorf and had a very fun and exciting day in this beautiful city. We also wanted to offer the team Cologne Duesseldorf the opportunity to visit us in Bielefeld in return. Some team members visited us at the 15th of July and we had a delicious BBQ and showed them the city, the CeBiTec, and our lab.

30.06 - German Meet-up in Dresden
On the 30th of June, we participated in the German Meet-up in Dresden and represented our team and our project. It was the first time we presented our project to the public which is why the presentation was very exciting for our speaker Chris. It was also interesting to see what other teams planned to work on over the year and we are very curious to see what they and we will achieve until the Giant Jamboree in November.

From the 6th to the 8th of July, six of our team members drove to the beautiful city of Delft to participate in the European iGEM meet-up organized by the TU Delft team . We were astonished by the very interesting presentations from a lot of speakers at the faculty of aerospace engineering at the TU Delft and were very excited about our first poster session. It was great to meet people from all over Europe and especially our friends from Munich and the Team Unifi with whom we started the mentoring partnership. After the"

Danielle Tullman Ercek, Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University: Discussed the way synthetic biology becomes part of a living system and redefines life. Also talked about the scope of synthetic biology, what it can achieve, and the applications and goals of the field.
Connor McFadden, UNC - Chapel Hill : Discussed the formal definition of synthetic biology, and the subfields and components of contemporary synthetic biology.
Emma Miles, Duke iGEM : Discussed the ethical implications of synthetic biology related to its applications (human advancement), distribution (biofuel production), and procedure (status of living machines). Also illustrated the importance of bridging the disconnect which makes it hard for the public to accept synthetic biology projects due to lack of communication and education from the scientists in charge of implementation.
There were also many fun and lighthearted activities for all of us to partake in. For example, the Duke iGEM team conducted an interview asking us questions like “Why do you love science?”, “What is your favorite piece of lab equipment and why?”, “If you could say something to any microorganism what would it be?”, etc. We socialized over a dinner consisting of pasta and salad from Olive Garden, ice cream, and a movie to kick off the night.

Building with Bio Revamp
At the Southeastern Mini Convention, we got the chance to discuss potential collaborations in the Human Practices division with Gaston Day School and Duke. Since Duke’s project relates to developing an accessible and easy to use test for Zika in its primary stages, we all thought it would be a good idea to collaborate with Duke and work on revamping the Building with Bio kit for Malaria since it was a little outdated and not pertinent to the more pressing issue at hand: the Zika virus. For those who are unfamiliar with Building with Biology, it is a company that develops innovative resources designed to engage the public with a wide array of activities relating to the STEM field. The kits are assembled by a team of science educators, researchers, and scientists who"

The Tübingen iGEM team had an amazing idea of collaborating with teams from around the world to produce synthetic biology tutorial videos, spreading scientific knowledge to the community on each country's national language! We also had produced our own videos, so we didn’t even hesitate and embraced this idea and shared the four videos we had made for our “Synthetic Biology 101” project. Other teams, like Aalto-Helsinki, are involved, and we are proud to be a part of this beautiful gesture of information dissemination.

GDSYZX
At the very beginning of the summer vocation, we received our experimental skills training courses together with team GDSYZX. After the courses, we still had frequent communication with each other.
Our team helped them amplify their PCS1 and HMA2 plasmids, which they used in their project about solving the contamination of heavy metal. They also helped us transfer plasmids p7NS1-GFP into E.coli Dh5αfor the amplification of the plasmids.
In September and October, we presented our project to each other, we give comments on each others’ PPT. For instance, our team pointed out that their ppt should be more succinct. And we also learn from their ppt that it is a good idea to use the animation effect to illustrate some actions in our project design. We also helped each other team to prepare for the presentation by asking questions. We found it useful because viewing our project from another prospective would usually remind us of some issues that we don’t pay much attention to. For example, their questions about the safety issue of our product actually pushed us to do more research and add some new information into our presentation
SCAU-China
We had long-term collaboration with team SCAU-China.
As a high school team, we lacked some of the experimental equipment necessary to complete interlab, and SCAU-China accidentally damaged their Silica Beads, we have an opportunity to establish a good interaction with the undergraduate team SCAU-China.We provided Silica Beads to SCAU-China and they loaned us their microplate reader and helped us to use it. With the help of each other, we finally successfully completed the interlab measurement task.
Based on friendly relations, this summer, SCAU-China  offered us a 7-day-crouse about the basic skill of art design, which helps us to finish our wiki and poster.
What’s more, we also  regularly hold meetings to exchange information on the project and they gave us some advice which advance the progress of our project. For example, we tried several methods to extract the genome of Bt.i such as high temperature and ultrasonic, but we failed. They suggested us to extract"

Tec-Chihuahua
We had several Skype calls with Tec-Chihuahua and one of their team members, Alejandra Ogaz Ramoz, visited us 26.7.2017 at Aalto University, Finland. Since Alejandra is a law student, we discussed about the European Union’s strict GMO legislation in hopes that it would help team Tec-Chihuahua to create transgenic food legislation ideas for Mexico. We also provided the Mexican team with useful links from the EU’s websites and the Tec-Chihuahua team’s law students helped us to investigate the legal issues on patents for the usage of the antimicrobial peptide dermcidin especially for skin care. Tec-Chihuahua researched the regulation of the European Union patents, as well as their durations and effects.
During the visit in Finland we put Alejandra and three of our own team members (a Finn, a Pole and a Turk) to a Finnish sauna in order to get sweat samples from different nationalities to see if there might be some differences in the dermcidin levels. We did a BCA assay of the samples that showed that there were proteins in the samples and their amount matched the amounts in literature, but could not dig deeper since we only had a very small amount of the expensive, synthetic dermcidin to use as a standard and had to therefore decide between ELISA and antimicrobial activity assay. Thus, we could not measure DCD from sweat since we deemed it to be the less important of the two.
Collecting sweat samples from Alejandra
The most interesting observation from our sauna evening with Tec-Chihuahua member Alejandra from Mexico is that the Finnish sauna is simply not nearly enough to make a Mexican or a Turk to even break a sweat since it took a while to make them sweat. The same can not be said of the Pole or the"

Collaboration iGEM team Aachen 2018 - iGEM Biotechnology Conference
On 20th September, we organized the iGEM Biotechnology Conference in collaboration with iGEM Team Aachen . In keeping with the spirit of iGEM this conference was ‘valorisation’-themed and was intended to bring public engagements and collaboration opportunities together. During the iGEM meet-up in Munich, we came in contact with the iGEM team from Aachen and ran our idea of a possible collaboration on the conference by them. They were very enthusiastic right away and already had many ideas.
After the meet-up in Munich, we started Skyping with them weekly to keep each other updated. We divided the tasks and both started with our search for speakers, companies and funding. Our team arranged the venue and facilities, catering services, ticket sales, two speakers (Dr. Silvia Mihaila and Dr. Mauro Muraro) and two companies (Single Cell Discoveries and Mimetas). Team Aachen arranged two speakers (Dr. Aljoscha Wahl and Dr. Karel Olavarria Gamez) and designed the flyers. They also helped with designing the powerpoint for the conference. Together we promoted the conference on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, as well as face-to-face promotion both in Germany and the Netherlands.
Before the conference, we had two meetings in Utrecht to sort problems and to get to know each other even better. We had a lot of fun during these meet-ups and during the iGEM Biotechnology Conference itself. We are happy we managed to organize such a successful conference together, with about 60 paying participants!
Collaboration with iGEM team ETH Zurich 2018
This year, the iGEM team from ETH Zurich is developing an autonomous robot that uses biosensors as its control element to follow molecule gradients in the air to detect their source. To speed up their biosensors, they are also aiming to exploit and modify the natural Tar-receptor-based chemotaxis system of E. coli.
During the European iGEM Meetup in July, we came to the conclusion that both of our teams were working on chemotaxis-based biosensors. Although our projects are based on somewhat different methods and applications, we did struggle with similar complications at the time. For those reasons, we decided to stay in touch and update each other about problems and solutions, which formed the base for our collaboration. An example of"

This enabled them to carry out their project successfully as they were able to use all the parts that they wanted. We transformed all four parts from storage into the E. coli DH5α strain before mini-prepping, nano dropping and posting to them. This was repeated when the first package did not arrive.
SVCE Chennai
We filled in team SVCE Chennai 's survey on lab techniques to pass on our experiences of protocols that worked, and others which didn't, in order to help them improve efficiency for other iGEM teams in the future.
Illinois
We were in regular contact with Illinois UIUC throughout the project. We planned to test their promoter systems in our flow cytometer to provide a measure of cell variance for them and they would try to integrate our copper chelator Csp1sfGFP with their promoter system to see if that would create more even expression and maybe reduce the protein's expression issues. As we both were delayed in getting our part constructs prepared we ran out of time to carry this out fully.

Collaborate with ZJU-China
Last year, team ZJU-China constructed a kind of reverse promoter which we designed to add to our biobricks this year. So they generously provide us with these biobricks. We appreciated ZJU-China very much and we are looking forward to further cooperation in the future.
They constructed two main circuits, first one expresses a serine integrase. This intergrase can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP, the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome. This recombination results in the reverse of the sequence between attB and attP, changing the two sites to attL and attR at the meantime. This inversion can be reversible by appropriately controlling the conditional expression of integrase and an excisionase in Bxb1 named gp47 at certain ratio. They change start codon ATG to GTG for a appropriate expression quantity.
Fig. 2.1 Gene circuit of serine integrase
The second one contains a switch, two reporters, two RBS and terminators. At first, the plasmid expresses GFP, when gp35 is expressed, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.

Queens_Canada,2018," as it is the major component of antifreeze for windshield frost in the    winter! We suggested that their by-product could be used in cryopreservatives here in Canada. Above all, our teams agreed that because the distance between us would making sharing resources difficult, we could however proof-read each others work, give suggestions on standard operating procedures, and aid in general scientific dissemination. This has included presentations to each others teams, and providing feedback wherever needed. Ultimately, through various Skype calls and email exchanges, members of both our teams were able to    assist the other with different aspects of the projects. Our outreach teams often had calls together to share our plans for outreach events, and public dissemination of current science that it would be easy accesible to the general public. Our dry lab teams were able to collaborate with    various 3D modelling techniques in PyMOL, help with Opentrons OT-2 protocols, as well as wiki formatting.
University of Toronto
It's a warm feeling to have a great friend so close by. The University of Toronto, and Queens Canada teams became friends at the oGEM meeting (see above), and we continued conversations and support for one another all the way to the jamboree. The University of Toronto team were there for us for 1am cloning troubleshooting, theoretical conversations about synthetic biology, and selecting E. Coli strains. This friendship evolved into a collaboration when we provided the University of Toronto team with their Wiki, by providing the services of our graphic design and wiki teams. We developed graphics for them based off sketches they drew, which can be now seen on their homepage and throughout their wiki. In exchange, University of Toronto provided us with a gift of a pSB1C3 vector with a unique nucleotide sequence (UNS) flanking the Biobrick Prefix and Suffix. We are extremely grateful for this gift because it allows for easier Gibson Assembly, and therefore construction of biobricks. Gibson Assembely relies on overlaps of >15bp between the vector and the insert without majorly repetitive sequences. Since NotI is found in both the prefix and suffix, this can result in poor assembly of inserts. The UNS sequence designed and created by University of Toronto allows for PCR linearization of the vector, and then highly efficient Assembly. We are thankful to University of Toronto for their friendship and help, and we look forward to seeing them at the Jamboree!

iGEM Concordia
We collaborated with iGEM Concordia to validate the functionality of our constructs BBa_K2048001 and BBa_K2048002. We have shipped our DNA samples to Concordia iGem on September 2016. Following protocol was executed by iGem Concordia for the preliminary results:
Transformed E.Coli DH5a cells with BBa_K2048001 and BBa_K2048002 separately.
For control groups untransformed E.Coli DH5a cells were used.
10uM and 100uM gold(III) metal ions were added to the control and experimental groups along with XGal
Blue color change was observed.
Results:
After the 2-3 hours, visible blue color was observed in 10uM and 100uM tubes containing E.Coli BBa_K2048001. Faint blue color was also observed in 10uM and 100uM tubes containing E.Coli BBa_K2048002.
After 24h, tubes with BBa_K2048002 device also showed dark blue color. In addition, BBa_K2048002 tubes had a darker visible blue compared to BBa_K2048001.
Concordia iGEM teams results further validated the functionality of our devices BBa_K2048001 and BBa_K2048002. Moreover, they proved the expression levels can be observed at 100uM gold(III) levels in presence of XGal.

Concordia iGEM grew untransformed E. coli cells with no antibiotic, E. coli cells transformed with GolS grown in chloramphenicol, and E. coli cells transformed with GolSP118A grown with chloramphenicol to an OD of 3. They diluted our cells into a final volume of 600 µL of M9 media, having an OD of 1.5. They used Au (III) ions at 1 µM and 5 µM, Cu(II) at 1 µM"
Shenzhen_SFLS,2017," school teams attended             the meet-up.
At the meet-up, each team described the background and core theory of their project and raised valuable questions for other teams. SZU_China purposed an important experimental hypothesis linking Human Beta Defensin 3 ( hBD3 ) to motor protein             so that hBD3 can not be transported outside the bacteria.
We learned more about projects of other teams and had further understanding about synthetic biology.

Stage 2
WPI’s visit to BostonU had two purposes. First, it would help validate WPI’s assay protocol and results in another lab, Second, it would give our team a better understanding of the protocol we would be moving onto a microfluidic device. Two students from WPI, Catherine and Aylin, met with a member of our team in Boston University lab on July 26th. Before performing the experiment in the lab, the WPI team gave a quick overview of the experiment as well as any specific safety protocols required while working with lead. In the lab, the WPI team members performed their protocol in its entirety; the BostonU Team member observed but did not touch any biological materials.
During this process, the two teams discussed various limitations and difficulties found in performing the assay by hand. A difficulty of note was the importance of adding and mixing reagents at exact times. For example, GSH needed to be added between 15-20 seconds after mixing the Lead and Gold Nanoparticles; however, adding the GSH at a uniform time was extremely difficult. With this information in mind, we decided that reliable timing would be an integral part of the microfluidic chip design.
WPI performing their lead assay in the BostonU lab on July 26th 2017. They performed their entire assay in the lab while the BostonU HW team observed and asked questions.
Stage 3
After meeting with WPI in the lab, our team had a solid plan for what the design of the chip would look like. The chip would perform one portion of their assay with volumes scaled down by a factor of 10. It would consist of 5 main sections:
Lead Metering: 4.15 ul
AuNp Metering: 3.46 ul
Lead and AuNp Timed Mixing: 17.5 Seconds
GSH Metering: 1.0 ul
Final Mixing: 18 seconds
With this workflow in mind, the chip on the right was designed. The animation details how liquid would flow through the device.
We provided WPI with full documentation of the chip including SVG files, a usage protocol, and the animation seen to the right. All of these files can be downloaded below.

Due to the restriction of Hong Kong high school laboratories, we are thankful to have iGEM HKU, who has collaborated with us the Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and cloning part of our experiments. Their helping hand is exceptionally important to us so that we could be able to complete our investigation. For instance, PAGE result serves as a crucial proof for our assembly of the nano-cube. It also proves that the biomarker of the H3N2 virus was able to bind with the nano-cube. All these evidence are essential to prove the progress in our project.
Besides, HKU team had paid a visit to organize two workshops for our team in order to extend our knowledge in DNA nanotechnology and gave us useful advice for our design and experimental stage throughout the project. For detail, please visit our Workshop and Idea Exchange page.
We would like to once again express our gratitude to iGEM HKU for assisting us in our experiments and organizing various kinds of workshops for us.

7.OUR COLLABORATION WITH Jilin_China
Discovery Studio 3.5
In the process of designing the site-directed mutation, we communicate with Team Jilin_China about our problem. They offered us a software Discovery Studio 3.5, which can speculate the rough 3D structure of a protein molecule according to its amino acid sequence. This software gave us a reference about which site should be mutated without the exact 3D structure.
8.SYSU-CCiC MEETING
It was a great honor to be invited to SYSU-CCiC meeting organized by Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) to share iGEM experiences with other teams. CCiC(Central China iGEM Consortium) is a national iGEM seminar held by Chinese universities, aiming to promote the communication of Chinese iGEM teams and publicize the conception of synthesis biology.
On the morning of September 2, 2016, we took a flight to Guangzhou from Tianjin. One hour later, we arrived at SYSU. Upon our registration, we exchanged ideas with some teams. At 7 pm, the opening ceremony began and each team made a brief introduction. In the following two days, we simulated the process of iGEM Giant Jamboree, presenting team projects and posters.
At 5 pm of September 4,2016, the seminar was coming to a close. We took a photo together as a reminder. After dinner, we attended the closing ceremony. Afterwards, we went back to Tianjin and got occupied with our experiment again.
We are so grateful to SYSU for invitation and treatment. During the seminar, we have made a lot of friends and had an understanding of other teams’ projects. In the meanwhile, we also got a number of beneficial suggestions. P.S. SYSU-CCiC Handbook"
Paris_Saclay,2016," TEC CEM
Our team was approached via Facebook by Enrique Salas to participate on a survey related to Self-medication and Public Health. Later on the team also showed interest in getting to know better our project. After some messages exchanged, we offered to send them a copy of our recent poster designed for “The European Experience 2016”. This was an opportunity to share knowledge about layout, structure and content of a scientific poster, a very important feature of the iGEM experience.
iGEM Manchester
Our team was contacted via Twitter by iGEM Manchester to take part on a survey related to Alcohol consumption. There was quite a fuzz over this survey among our team members since the topic “Alcohol consumption” is very appealing. We contributed with over 15 entries and had a lot of fun while answering.
iGEM Groningen
Our team was contacted through email by Ilona Mager from iGEM Groningen to take part on a survey related to Digital Information Storage and Cyber Security. Our contribution to the survey was awarded with this great cooperation badge shown above.
iGEM Tel Hai
Our team was approached via Facebook by David Lancry to help their team raise awareness about Cystic Fibrosis. They collaborated with the Cystic Fibrosis Fondation of Israel and created together a campaign worldwide which our team was invited to participate. The goal was to take a picture of our team with a red rose, the symbol of the campaign.  We were really proud to be part of this initiative!
iGEM Mentorship Program
We enrolled on the Mentorship Program proposed by iGEM this year. We received a first contact from our Mentor, Fabian Fröhlich, and our Team Coordinator, Liza Figueiredo by email. Further on a monthly schedule of Skype conference calls was settled with Fabian, who is a bioinformatician and has a great deal of iGEM experience.  The Mentorship Program allowed us to be more aware of the iGEM standards and to come to our mentor with several obstacles our project faced through the course of the months. We were pleased to have taken part on this experience because it brought to the team fresh eyes when needed, external opinions and therefore new perspectives we could not have had otherwise.

European Practice Jamboree
The translation service wasn’t the only project where we collaborated with other iGEM teams. On the 7th of October, four iGEM teams from our neighboring countries arrived in Leuven for the European Practice Jamboree. The goal of this event was to sharpen the presentation skills and optimizing the team presentation and poster through positive feedback from the other teams. We interacted with team members from the different teams, talked about our projects and all the problems we encountered which immediately created a bond. Thanks to their help we were able to make our presentation and poster perfect for the main event in Boston, we want to thank iGEM Amsterdam, iGEM Ionis Paris, iGEM Aachen & iGEM LMU and TMU Munich for this amazing event.
