Collaboration:
_____We collaborated with Washington University St. Louis. We first communicated through email and we decided to share our yeast strain with them. We cultured our yeast strain with YPD media overnight. We aliquot drop of cultured yeast on autoclaved filter paper and wrap the filter paper with clean foil. The yeast was delivered to Washington University St. Louis and they successfully obtained the yeast from the filter paper and used the cell for their experiments. We also collaborated with University of California, Santa Cruz. They traveled to our campus during the summer and we guided them to tour our lab and several buildings located on the East Bank of our campus. Then we had a meeting together to share some details of our lab methodologies and human practice preparations. Since we started our project earlier then them, we were able to make some suggestions on plasmid construction and general lab techniques. Team UCSC put a lot of effort in their human practice activities and they showed us their description of their project as a whole. Their Professor also gave us some feedback on our project design, and we did some revisions on this part in the follow up experiments

Tokyo_Tech,2015," experiences in 2014, iGEM Team Nahahama gave us these 2 advices about chemotaxis experiments.
    1. In order to increase the chemotactic activity of E. coli, the best concentration of agar is 0.3 %.
    2. It is better to directly stick the chip inside the agar and then inject the E .coli, than to place the E. coli on top of the agar.
Also, Team Nagahama gave us the raw data along with the protocol of the experiments for assaying the chemotactic activity of a wild type E.coli, following the protocol written above.
Fig. 7-5-2-1.Positive Chemotaxis of E.coli
Fig. 7-5-2-2.Negative Chemotaxis of E.coli
Our plan at first was to integrate the chemotaxis experiment into our overall project. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain positive results from the gene that we constructed, before the Giant Jamboree. However, the advice we received from Team Nagahama helped us a lot. We would like to say thanks to all the help we received from them.
May Festival
The Japanese iGEM teams took part in the school festival at the University of Tokyo. Our teams shared ideas and gave each other feedbacks. Together, we introduced synthetic biology to the public.
See the “Policy & Practices” page for further information.
Meetup with the iGEM LZU-China Team
On the l9th of July, we held a meetup with the iGEM LZU-China team at Tokyo Institute of Technology.In this event, we each introduced our project along with the project from our previous year. We exchanged ideas about each other’s project and gave each other feedbacks. The iGEM LZU-China team also participated in our “Prisoner’s Dilemma Experiment” that we conducted. This experiment is a sociological experiment concerning the safety of genetic modification and is part of our “Policy & Practices”. See the “Policy & Practices” page for further information.

Collaboration with NYMU iGEM Team from Taiwan
On August 25th Mr. Vincent Lim from NYMU iGEM Team from Taiwan paid us a visit. We held a modeled presentation at our university Kanagawa Institute of Technology. And after the presentation, we discussed about our project and experiment method. From the discussion, we noticed an important point, HAY FEVER IS NOT AN EPIDEMIC DISEASE EXCEPT IN JAPAN.We also introduce him to our instructor and our laboratory. It is a valuable chance for us to get to know more about NYMU iGEM Team and Taiwan.
Reagent support intermediation from promega to all 8 undergraduate iGEM Team in Japan (Ordering reagents and presentation representation)
Until last year, University of Tokyo iGEM Team is responsible to be the intermediation of reagent support. However, as UT iGEM Team did not take part in iGEM 2017, KAIT_JAPAN Team become responsible for reagent support intermediation. We collect orders from each university and for those university who cannot attend to the presentation for the support of the reagent, we presented on behalf of them. And after we received the reagents from Promega, we sort it out and distribute to the correspondent iGEM Team.
May Festival
On the 20th and 21st of May, 2017, we ran a booth at school festival in the University of Tokyo, named ""May Festival"", and collaborated with four iGEM teams in Japan: Tokyo-Tech, Kyoto, Gifu and Bot-chan Lab. More than 150,000 visitors came to this festival, and we had a good opportunity to explain synthetic biology and our project to them. At the same time, each team gave some advice on the other teams' project.
Meetup at Boston University
On November 9th, our team will meet up with other Japanese team at Boston University and we are looking forward to share our ideas and opinion. Each team will present their project as rehearsal just before the event and will have the opportunity to get advice from other iGEM teams and professors.

UNebraska-Lincoln,2017," them suggestions on how they could solve their problem. Methungeny’s project aim is to develop a methane biosensor medium which consists of methane-utilizing bacteria and an enzymatic assay. When methane is present in the environment of the bacteria, they will produce lactate which will be converted to a colorful substance by the assay kit. The bacterium they chose to perform the methane to lactate conversion is the Methylococcus capsulatus. Normally, it does not produce lactate and that's why they are going to insert a gene of the lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme in it, which is able to transform pyruvate to lactate. Since this bacterium is a thermotolerant organism, they thought it would be worth using the LDH of another thermotolerant bacterium, so the LDH gene is originated from Bacillus coagulans. They will put this gene into a vector designed especially for Methylococcus capsulatus, but at this point they faced an issue.
They were searching for an appropriate constitutive promoter which would be able to drive the LDH gene, but they had not found an exact promoter sequence. They asked us if we could help them find a promoter which could be used in Methylococcus capsulatus. The UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team did some research and gave them some suggestions on which promoter they could use. We suggested that Methylococcus capsulatus's primary sigma factor for exponential growth (RpoD) is very similar to E. coli's RpoD, especially the DNA binding region. So we believe an Anderson promoter will be sufficient for their purpose. In the spirit of iGEM, we sent them a link to Anderson promoters already cataloged in the registry: http://parts.igem.org/Promoters/Catalog/Anderson.
In return, they helped us with our safety page section. Our team has designed a new idea called safety cases to help with safety in the iGEM world. We asked them for help critiquing our explanation of the safety cases and also our general safety information. They promptly responded with many helpful suggestions seen below.
“We missed a ""Safety measures in a molecular biology laboratory"" part what describes the biosafety dress code (the need of wearing gloves, goggles, lab coats etc.).  In our opinion, it would be also essential to mention the separate collection of disposable materials (e.g.: pipette tips, Eppendorf tubes and inoculating loops connecting with microorganisms).  Writing about the chemicals’ material safety data"

ABOUT PORTFOLIO CONTACT SEARCH
The objective of our project is to eliminate ammonia from public places. To determine concentration of ammonia in public places around us, we decided to sample air from sources that are potentially rich in ammonia. We sampled air in washrooms and chemical laboratories in our Institute, and analyzed them for ammonia using the indophenol blue assay (the protocol we used can be found
here
). We wished to understand whether other countries and regions face similar issues when it comes to the state of their public washrooms, and therefore, decided to collaborate with other teams to measure concentrations of ammonia present in their washrooms.
We are fortunate to have formed friendships that transcend geographical distances.
Team UCAS China
Team UCAS China is trying to address the issue of excessive ammonia present in aquaculture. Given that both our teams are trying to eliminate ammonia, determination of ammonia levels from environment samples is of relevance to both teams. We have shared our protocol for quantification of ammonia with Team UCAS. Team UCAS has carried out measurements of ammonia in air samples for us and will be sharing their results with us.
On our part, we have collected water samples from a nearby lake, Bandra talao, and measured ammonia in it using our protocol. We have shared our results with them.

Team Heidelberg
Team Heidelberg 2013 had worked on indigoidine synthesis, which forms an integral part of our project. Ever since our Skype session with the current team, Team Heidelberg has been extensively involved in helping us out with indigoidine synthesis. They shipped us two plasmids, pRB1 and pRB5, which contain genes for production of indigoidine. They also sent out relevant plasmid maps which helped us carry out successful transformation of E. coli cells with these plasmids.
All-India iGEM teams meet-up at IISER Pune
We participated in the All-India iGEM teams meet-up hosted by Team IISER Pune. It was indeed an enriching experience, presenting our project to an intelligent audience as well as listening to innovative projects of other teams. Our presentation was followed by an interactive question and answer session wherein many interesting points about our project came up, which helped us in chalking out our future plan."

Collaborations
The openness of the iGEM competition leads to an educational and competitive environment which stimulates the advancement of synthetic biology. These collaborations are formed between teams from all over the world, who can help each other carry out their projects. It also enables teams to collaborate with each other to make synthetic biology more accessible and bring it even further.
To make new cloning techniques a little more accessible, we started off compiling a cloning guide for future iGEM teams. For this guide, we were assisted by 14 teams who helped describe 9 different molecular cloning techniques. In addition, we joined other collaborations, such as the Amoy Newsletter, sending out water to York, being a PenPal, having an interview with NAIT_Edmonton and joining a symposium in Leuven. For more information on these collaborations, follow one of the links below.
Our Cloning Guide
We made a Cloning Guide which will help future generation iGEM teams with choosing a cloning method. With the help of 16 iGEM teams we formed a cloning guide with crucial knowledge and experience based tips on 9 different cloning methods.

2nd Place:
One of TJU_China’s gels really messed with our eyes. Their team leader said he tried to tweak a protocol to get better product outcome.  He upped the amount of plasmid and he upped the amount of restriction enzyme (4 µL).  As you can see, the resulting gel has a super blurry band. If you stare at it long enough, it looks like it is vibrating!

Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner:
Looking at Stony Brook’s gel will definitely make most people say “WUT”. This was their team’s first time using Diamond Dye,  since they grew wary of ethidium bromide (Jarek understands). They left their gel running for an hour,  but their gel fell apart before they could even soak it in the new Diamond Dye. Fighting through the tears,   they went ahead and soaked it anyway. When they went to view it on the UV imager, the gel shattered again!   Our heart goes out to Stony Brook for staying strong through tough lab times.

UNebraska-Lincoln’s Survey
Who doesn’t like an old-fashioned survey? We were able to get 43 responses from other iGEM teams.  The results gave our team an idea on how the current iGEM community feels about invasive species and GMOs.  The graphs can be fun to look at, however no significant conclusion can be made from this small and diverse sample size.  We still encourage you to interpret some of the data for yourselves!

Missouri Rolla
Early in the summer, we were happy to learn another iGEM team was working to stop the spread of Emerald Ash Borers.   We were fortunate enough to eat with Ryan Baumann, Rolla’s lab daddy, at Noodles and Company in Lincoln.   At Noodles, we had fun getting to know each other and talking about our projects and possible collaborations.   We had lots of ideas such as hosting a seminar or educational video together (which is still a future possibility).   We ended up deciding to create an informational brochure together that we will hand out at the Giant Jamboree.   Our goal is to spread awareness, to both foreign and domestic teams, about the EAB and its detrimental impact on North America.

This year the Stanford-Brown-RISD iGEM team worked with the Danish Technical University (DTU) overgrad team from the beginning. Both teams were inspired by the idea of mycotecture as funded by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts Program to our faculty advisor, Dr. Rothschild. With our expertise in applying synthetic biology to problems of space exploration and settlement, and DTUs particular expertise in filamentous fungal biotechnology, we worked together towards the goal of using synthetic biology enabled fungal mycelia as an material for space settlement. We shared protocols for growing the material and helped troubleshoot each other’s projects. Both teams agreed to frame the project around a mission to the Martian surface and with with advice from resident NASA experts, both teams worked to add suitable benefits to the material.
Modeling
Both teams possessed some expertise in modeling and decided to put it to use to create models which described different stages of the mycelium production process. Working together, the goal was to have models which could inform future scientists that wish to use mycelium from the stage of a single spore all the way to building the final structure.
The DTU team created two models, one taking us from a single spore and modeling its hyphal growth and the second modeling what properties of mycelium would be necessary in a building Brick to make the final structure. Our team worked on a model which  spanned the intermediate between the two, taking a large colony of fungus and modeling its growth into a mold from which building Bricks could be made. Further details on the two teams’ models can be found below.
Our teams met several times over video chat to compare and contrast our approaches to models. Key takeaways follow:
The DTU model begins from a single spore; SBR’s begins from a “plug” of existing mycelia of given dimensions.
DTU’s model maps 2D, unconstrained growth; SBR’s model maps 3D, constrained growth (within a mold). Note that early iterations of the SBR model mapped 2D, unconstrained growth"

Survey Collaboration
International Survey aims to investigate the background knowledge of synthetic biology and the experience about genetic engineering across the world. There are 11 iGEM teams from different continents in the collaboration. The idea of the survey was first proposed by iGEM Aachen 2016, and fortunately, we had had online meetups in August. So we gladly accepted the offer as a principal team in Asia. We surveyed people on the street. Finally, we collected more than 500 samples and got some great result. Here are the teams that participate in the survey.

It was in the local, and some of us were participating in the conference during the day and working in the lab at night. It was a global event, with 60 current iGEM teams and 500 people attending.
During the conference, apart from presenting our ENABLE project and explaining our poster, we also distributed questionnaires regarding the explanation of logic gates to collect opinions from our colleagues to improve the project. Moreover, we also had a valuable opportunity to meet the iGEM competition organizer Meagan face to face and ask her relevant questions regarding recent competition policy changes and the future of iGEM, etc. Overall, this conference has undoubtedly inspired us with new ideas and new methods, and has provided us with terrific feedbacks for improving our project!
Now, we are ready to head West. See you all in Boston, when the winter comes.
Abstract
Contact-dependent signaling is critical for multicellular biological                         events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between                         cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a                         complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of                         3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic                         Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the                         membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by                         transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based                         transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products.                         In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells,                         and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering,                         cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing                         contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle                         underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits,                         thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.

iGEM team Cornell University
Introduction
Filamentous fungi are only rarely used in iGEM. This is partly because genetic modifications take a lot more time, but also because there are few (if any) parts available in the iGEM registry. Fortunately, we found that the 2013 Cornell team has selected a fungus as organism of choice. They are working on Basidiomycetes and are making a toolkit for this chassis that has not been used in iGEM before. We decided that, since Cornell is making selection markers for filamentous fungi, we would use their constructs and validate them in our organism of choice: Aspergillus niger. These constructs encoded antibiotic resistance cassettes against hygromycin and geneticin. In addition a pki promoter was send to the iGEM team of Cornell.
Aim
The goal was to test the geneticin resistance gene in A. niger. Cornell was kind enough to provide us with pure geneticin to perform the experiment. As hygromycin could not be sent via standard shipping as it is considered a hazardous material, we only worked with the geneticin resistance construct.
Approach
The construct we received from the iGEM team from Cornell University was present in E. coli and the organization of the construct was as followed: promoter, the geneticin resistence gene and a terminator. The first step was to isolate the plasmid from E. coli, and after obtaining sufficient quantities of the vector it was used to transform A. niger. The transformants were grown on two different concentrations of geneticin and one controle plate for a period of 3-4 days at 30°C. One plate contained a control and no geneticin was present in the agar"

Melbourne
We assisted Melbourne with their model, and they helped us to distribute our survey in Australia in return.
Modelling
As part of our collaboration with the Melbourne iGEM team, we implemented an earlier version of the outer model on MATLAB, with the architecture to include their own interaction processes. The Melbourne iGEM team aims to increase the reaction kinetics of the mevalonate pathway using their star peptide. After the completion of our combined model, the Melbourne team realized that the products from one enzyme reaction on one star peptide node do not show a clear flow towards the node of the other enzyme reaction, where they will be consumed. Otherwise, the contour lines would trace a pattern that contains both nodes (the contour lines surrounding each node will be joined). This flow was an assumption that the Melbourne team made in the formulation of their project. More simulations are needed to verify the accuracy of that assumption. In exchange for our assistance with the diffusion dynamics of their system, the Melbourne team assisted us with validating the diffusion solver of the RIOT Model’s inner model component. We provided a test case where lactate was released from the center of the bacteria, with an impermeable bacteria membrane. The Melbourne team showed that the concentration field within the bacteria homogenized within 200 milliseconds (see Figure below), which is what one would expect. This validated the diffusion component of our inner model.
Figure: Plot of lactate concentration field in the bacteria in cylindrical coordinates, with respect to time  (plotted by Melbourne team using MATLAB).

With the help of our collaborators from the Melbourne iGEM team, our survey was distributed in Australia via an online link. The raw data obtained from the Australian survey are as follows:

Guanajuato Mexico (GTO_Mexico)
This year, we collaborated with the Guanajuato Mexico team in developing a curriculum as an introduction to synthetic biology for university students. This curriculum covered the basics of biology, synthetic biology, and its applications. We specifically designed a lesson plan on the ethics of synthetic biology followed by a debate on the justification of using synthetic biology in a real case study. This helped to expose the students to different viewpoints on the applications of synthetic biology and what we should be aware of as scientists in designing these biological systems. We were able to present this curriculum, including our lesson plan, to a group of Biotechnology students from the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education Campus Quéretaro over Skype.
Not everyone in the class shared the same perspective on synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms. From this collaboration, we gained a better understanding of the perception the general public held on the usage of synthetic biology. We learned that a large amount of concern is is due to fear related to the safety and contamination of existing infrastructure. This influenced our project by allowing us to reevaluate some of our project requirements that we initially established. It also helped us find a way to better communicate our research to the general public. Many of the students expressed interest in participating in future iGEM competitions after we shared the applications of synthetic biology with them.

Rice University
We contributed to the Rice University team's Humans of Syn Bio Project by adding stories from members of our team about how they became involved with iGEM. Through this collaboration, we were able to help create a network community among iGEMers by sharing our stories. We were able to discover the different stories of iGEMers across the world and the reasons why they became involved, giving us a better sense of connection and creating a stronger network amongst teams.

FAU_Erlangen,2015,"/21-15/08/22)
During the beta test of the Labsurfing concept of Team Darmstadt our team played host for the three team members Laurin, Thomas and Fabian during the last stop in their south tour. We showed them our beautiful city and introduced them to our local franconian cuisine. The next day was less fun more work. We presented to each other the progress of our projects since the meetup in Marburg. Afterwards we participated in their study to help improving the Labsufing website and of course all of us registered there.
Marburg - Human Practice
During the meetup we especially connected with Team Marburg . Tresor came up with the idea of a human practice collaboration with our team. We wanted to create a board game for children to introduce them to biology. Therefore Filip, Frederike, Nadine and Sabrina visited Marburg (15/08/15-15/08/16) where we thought of the basic concept of „Game of Cells“. Afterwards Team Erlangen was responsible for the biological content and the informative texts, while Marburg designed the game. To test the game, Tresor came to Erlangen (15/09/06-15/09/08) where we played the game and improved it.
Aix-Marseille University - Chewing-gum Survey
The team from Marseille asked us to participate in their survey about chewing gum and GMOs (genetically modified organisms). Three team members joined in the survey to help them in gaining statistically relevant results.

RHIT,2016," try and find something to eat. Luckily for us, Purdue University is a very large campus that offers a wide variety of food options. As we sat down to lunch with Barrett we learned of what our part of the collaboration would be. He told us that we could help them out by contributing to the past project data base they are putting together. Once we said we would be glad to help we were able to get even more ideas on how to improve our project for this year and improve future years as well. The first of these ideas was the founding of the RHIT iGEM twitter. After finishing lunch we said our goodbyes to Barrett and headed back to Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with our pictures and ideas flowing through our head of how to finish off the 2016 year right."
UCAS,2017," nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management"

We have received valuable advice about the adjustment of experiment scheme, the ways of human practice at the meet  up. After the summer meet up organized by our team, we often communicated with the members of BFSUICC-China through Wechat or telephone. During our experiment, we needed to use chromatograph to measure the amount of aflatoxin. During BFSUICC-China’s experiment, they needed to use plate reader to measure fluorescent intensity and OD 600. We often discussed with each other on the Instrument usage and procedure. Mary Du often communicated with Xiaoxia Qu about part requirement, part submission, wiki editing and so on.

Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia
This year, the ITB_Indonesia team was very happy because we could mentor one of the another university student in the lab. We mentored a student, Hilal, about the iGEM competition and several skills in the lab. We explained about plasmid isolation method of transformant bacteria, how to clone the DNA utilizing PCR, and how to analyze it using electrophoresis. And the last but not least, we helped him to know more about our project. Through this mentorship program, Hilal could learn and gain many insights from us and hopefully in the near time his university could start their own iGEM team too!

Beyond the collaboration, we also bring our help to team whom simply need it. By the end of July, iGEM Hamburg contacted us to catch up after the European Meet-up in Delft organized by iGEM TU Delft. During our discussion, they told us about some problems they encountered in molecular biology. For their project, they needed to express a gene so long they had to synthesize it in three parts. Cloning didn’t work because of the ligation between these parts. Our head of science, Jérémy, considered the problem and helped them to find other ways for ligation through Golden Gate assembly, expertise we developed after our interview with Dr. FOURNIER ( See our Integrated Human Practice to learn more ). He dressed an entire cloning strategy based on his brand new expertise and helped iGEM Hamburg to bring out their main part for the competition. He also provided support and continuous help for the issues they were facing to finally make it out. ( See our work on their page ).

Trinity
Trinity College Dublin iGEM team decided to create a youtube channel (iGEM Academy) for the diffusion of videos created by other teams with the purpose of introducing new people into synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. We sent them our own video that showed what is a regular day working in an iGEM project. Follow this link to watch it.
Amoy
For a second year, the iGEM team Amoy , Paris_Bettencourt and Pasteur_Paris, offered participation in the composition of their Newsletter. We happily accepted and sent several articles for a couple editions.
Stockholm
The Stockholm 2015 iGEM team evaluated the professionalism on showing any type of results (good or bad) and making a clear distinction between ideas and obtained results. They set up a survey for evaluation of such aspects. We participated in such survey as we consider that negative results have to be reflected always. As for the part of being to distinguish separately ideas from results, (a consultar).
Tianjin
The Tianjin 2015 iGEM team passed out a survey for evaluation of the involvement of the education center in their iGEM teams. We responded their survey talking on how our university presented to us the opportunity to participate in such incredible project and how it supported us with its development.
Paris-Saclay
The Paris-Saclay iGEM team has focused his 2015 iGEM project on biosafety by focusing on creating a universal Biobrick acting as a safeguard against accidental (or not) release of GEO.  We answered their global survey about our chassis and the biosafety measures we have considered for our project in the case it was released to the environment and when handling our chassis.
We hope that our answers have helped them in the development of their project.

The Nordic iGEM Conference
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is getting to know new people with whom you can discuss ideas and collaborate as well as make new friends. As a step towards this, the Chalmers-Gothenburg team has participated in the Nordic iGEM Conference, NiC. This was an initiative by the Uppsala and Stockholm iGEM teams who collaborated in the hosting of this event. The conference took place between the 24th and the 26th of July at the Uppsala University, and all ten iGEM teams of the Nordic countries were invited. It was a great weekend with very constructive discussions as well as a lot of fun.
On the day of arrival, a welcoming BBQ was arranged in the evening, allowing all the teams to socialise and get to know each other. The evening offered amazing food and a range of fun games, making for a great start of the conference. The next day was when the main event of the NiC took place, namely the presentations of the projects. All the teams had selected one member who would be part of a NiC jury, which in the end would determine which project and presentation would be crowned the winner of the NiC, and be awarded with the highly sought-after Golden Pipette. However, the main intention behind the presentations was to give the teams some practice for the upcoming presentations in Boston.
All the teams, including the jury, were then allowed to ask questions on each project which also was meant to be as preparation for the Q&A which follows the presentations at the iGEM Giant Jamboree. This part of the NiC was very useful and provided a lot of interesting feedback on our project, and also letting us understand the struggles and successes the other teams faced in a very constructive way.
Later that same day, the next part of the NiC was held, which encompassed different workshops that allowed the teams to compare and reflect on various iGEM experiences. The workshop topics included:
1. Awesome solutions for the lab. This workshop aimed to address solutions to technical problems in the lab, and let the teams share their experiences in this area.
2. The future of iGEM technology. This workshop allowed the participants to speculate on current and future technologies which could be used in the iGEM competition.
3. Unsolved ethics: Is your project suitable for supervillains? In this workshop the participants could discuss"
OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015," a solution to fats and oils build ups, which are caused when fats and oils solidified in the drains. The side project to break down hair was intended “To solve the build up of hair that becomes trapped in plugholes in basins, baths and showers. Hair attracts grease and dirt particulates which build up in drainage systems and restrict the flow of water through pipes. Our project has focused on development of constructs that produce lipase and Keratinase enzymes to degrade FOGs and hair. These constructs are designed to sit within a small, under-sink bioreactor that will produce and feed them into the waste system as the sink is drained.”(https://2014.igem.org/Team:Sheffield/Project) Their construct was designed to break down hair by using a Keratinase that would break down the Keratin protein, however there project was unsuccessful. We started by using the University of Sheffield's construct and then optimized it by fixing the known cleaving issue, and secretion of the protein. Our collaboration with the University of Sheffield 2014 iGEM team allowed us to receive some input into our project and what we could do to make it even better.

To whom it may concern:
My name is Freya Morgan, and I am a member of the Our Lady Of the Snows Catholic Academy iGEM team. We are a small high school based based out of Canmore, Alberta, Canada. We are contacting you because we have chosen to tackle build ups of keratin in wastewater treatment, and well as the poultry industry as this year’s project, and you tackled this issue in your 2014 project. When talking about wastewater treatment, these build ups of hair can lead to clogs causing flooding and the breakage of water pumps and pipes, something very costly to repair. The only current way to deal with this issue is to have a worker manually remove the blockage, which is slow, unpleasant for the worker and inefficient.  Upon further research our team discovered that the reason hair is such a huge issue for waste treatment facilities is because of the protein keratin, which as you probably know is a very hard protein to break down due the tightly wrapped helixes and hydrogen bonds. Once we discovered this pressing issue we looked into keratin more and realized it is also a component of the basic construct of feathers. We learned that they too build up and are hard to break down. With more searching on the iGEM parts registry we discovered your project, as well as one other project, both of whom attempted to solve the keratin issue. With"

Both of us are high school teams with Beijing, China. We have met each other for twice. The first time we have introduced each other’s project. At that time we did not register for the Giant Jamboree. It was SDSZ_China that remind us of the Giant Jamboree registration, hotel booking, flight tickets purchasing!
Thanks to team SDSZ_China’s help with TAKARA restriction enzymes. Our enzymes were denatured after delivered from the company. Without SDSZ’s help, we are not able to assemble our part.
With UCAS
Talking with a team in university has really inspired us. Because we are still teenagers that have never worked in the lab before, whenever we failed our experiments, guides from the UCAS team members have helped us out from trouble and saved us tons of time. When we had just started our experiments, our electrophoresis graphs were terrible. Fortunately, team members from UCAS taught us some skills of analyzing potential causes that lead to an unfavorable result, which is not only useful for the competition but also critical for our further studies. We also had a problem with our protocols. Then the team members from UCAS enlightened us with altering several factors by designing control experiment groups. Without their help, we are not able to"

Berlin Charité
The Berlin Charité Team is working, like us, on toehold switches and using cell-free expression systems. We had several skype      calls where we exchanged our knowledge about toeholds and how they are designed, as well as cell-free     expression systems and how to lyophylise them.
EPFL iGEM provided Berlin with a protocol and advice on how to produce      their own cell lysate and how to supply it with energy. Berlin Charité provided us with additional knowledge on how to freeze-dry our     lysates and systems including the subsequent rehydration of the lyophylised components.
We also collaborated on implementing our toehold designer. Berlin Charité provided     us with their understanding of the in-silico procedures of creating a toehold 1 2 ,     which was crucial for the software correctness.

Finally, result showed that with application of acid resistance device, pH could be regulated to a suitable range (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 Intracellular pH is regulated by acid resistance device. To prove the function of circuit, initial pH was set up to 3.0, when glsA was activated. pH can effect the activity of glsA, while glsA conducts gaseous ammonia production. With the enzyme activity changing, pH will be finally stabilized at a suitable level.
For alkali resistance device (Fig.1), NhaB and NhaA genes’ functions were assumed as similar processes to enzyme catalysis. Basing on this assumption, description of the NhaB circuit is:
Consistent with equations above, functions are:
Where description and initial value of variables are:

As for NhaA, the reaction processes are:
And the functions are:
Where description and initial value of variables are:
Fig.5 Name, initial value and description of variables.
As the result, alkali resistance device could decrease intracellular pH (Fig.6.1, 6.2).
Figure.6.1 Intracellular pH change regulated by alkali resistance circuit led by NhaB.  NhaB is not effected by pH, and can assist NhaA to regulate alkaline environment. Here we assumed that initial pH was 9.0 and NhaB had already been activated.
Figure.6.2 Intracellular pH change regulated by alkali resistance circuit led by NhaA.  NhaA will be induced at pH 7.0 ~ 9.0, while NhaB will function when NhaA cannot function normally. Here we assumed that initial pH was 8.0 and NhaA had already been activated."
Jilin_China,2017,"abinose and IPTG co-induction group turned rounded in 3h observation. That’s because the toxin addicted time was too short that only part of bacteria expressed cbtA. While expression of cbeA made most bacteria appeared in bacilliform in 6h observation. Because the experiment time was limited, we didn’t get the distinct result. We think that more solid result will appear if we extend the observation duration.
3.TJU-China
As for collaboration with TJU-China, we provided them some vital materials, and they helped us finish the indigo synthesis experiment.
This year, TJU-China utilized a novel infrared fluorescent system to track intestinal bacteria in real time. To verify their system can work in many different kinds of cells. We sent the Bifidobacterium longum and plasmid to them. Here is the link to their wiki
TJU-China also helped us a lot. When we used monooxygenase TfdB-JLU to degrade 2,4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase. We found that there is some blue matters when culturing bacteria. So we read a lot of literatures and datum on the internet, finding the TfdB-JLU can catalyze benzprole or tryptophan to synthesize indigo. So TJU-China helped us to verify whether our guess was right. They cultured our bacteria in LB fluid medium. When its OD600 values reached 0.4, they divided the culture into seven test-tubes. Next, they added 0.2mM IPTG in each test-tube. Then, they added different concentrations of Trp solution as follows, and cultured for 16 hours and the results are as follows.

THE VIRTUAL CONFERENCE
Previous Next
The teams from NYU Abu Dhabi, REC-Chennai, VIT, Macquarie University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Saint Joseph were a part of the conference call organised by NYU on the fifteenth of September. Once all the teams had joined and checked their connectivity, the rules of the conference call were stated by NYU. The teams were to elaborate on their projects while simultaneously playing their presentations at the end of which each team was asked questions by the others.
Team Macquarie explained their project that involved producing chlorophyll induced vesicles in a modified E. coli. As they explained their project and the uses of a vesicle in a cell, we understood the potential impact that their project could have in synthetic biology. VIT Vellore introduced to us their proposal that aimed to bring a reduction in ocean acidification. NYU Abu Dhabi explained to us their concept of a chip that could detect food borne pathogens and the imperative need for food safety. The high school students from Saint Joseph were working to tackle a problem in the fishery industry of Turkey by introducing a bacteriophage aimed at the lysis of pathogens in fish. Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has been working on a revolutionary technique to produce electricity from degraded plastic. We explained our project and the need for an alternate system from the conventional technique used. We were asked about out HP practises as we were working on a highly technical project.
It was a wonderful opportunity to be a part of the conference call and the projects that were explained to us showed scientific brilliance. We thank NYU-Abu Dhabi for this wonderful opportunity.
All India iGEM Meet

As an initiative to unify all the Indian teams, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore organized the All-India iGEM meet.  Three members represented our team in the three days of scientific correspondence that took place among the ten Indian teams.  The first day began with an icebreaker session where our teams got to know one another and then progressed to the presentation session.  Each presentation was followed by an extensive Q&A session wherein suggestions of possible improvements were given. A productive day ended with a much needed team karaoke session. We also got to know the other teams as the sessions progressed into fun games.
On the second day, our presentation consisted of a comparative analysis of the current system used for the detection of mutagenesis i.e. pALTER and"
IISc_Bangalore,2016," iGEM, our project and some previous years’ projects.
In enhancing the awareness of high school students about genetic engineering and iGEM, most teams undertake some form of a. and c.; however, we think we stand out by including b., a technique by which students would be able to quantitatively predict the output of the circuits they construct. The objective was to convey that genetic engineering is a diverse area with inputs from biological and more abstract areas of science and engineering.
The presentation was followed by a questionnaire presented to the audience to see how the presentation changed the audience’s knowledge of the topics (related to our iGEM project) and their views about the importance of the question addressed by our iGEM project.
The collaboration was during the presentations in Chennai, the city in which our collaborating college, SVCE is located. The point of the collaboration was that the iGEM projects of both the teams could be presented to the students and since our projects were quite different (ours was basic while theirs was applied research) and we could give the students exposure about the challenges in both these types of projects.

Istanbul_Tech,2016," Furthermore, it should be stated that conclusions drawn here are merely the thought and conclusions drawn by our team and are up for debate. After statistical analysis in the form of a t-test, the discussed results were shown to be significant.
As a whole, the attitude towards genetically modified organisms (GMOs) was more positive in Sweden with over 80 percent being positive, whereas in Turkey, 72 percent had a negative or sceptical attitude towards GMOs. The sceptical attitude towards GMOs could be linked to the low exposure to the subject within formal education. Results show only 28 percent of the Turkish participants having received any information regarding GMO within an educational setting. Furthermore, the Turkish participants showed a higher level of dissatisfaction with the information that they had received. When asked if GMOs should be used for medical purposes, 24 percent of the Turkish participants disagreed, whereas 3 percent disagreed in the Swedish poll. This result can most likely be attributed towards the general scepticism towards GMO that the Turkish participants showed. Swedish participantsdid not agree that GMO products should be labelled, in contrast to the Turkish poll where 93 percent agreed that GMO products should be labelled as such. This further illustrates the distrust that the Turkish participants showed towards GMO products.
The mistrust may be due to a low availability of good information regarding GMO, clear information on how it works and what the risks with the technology can be. Since the participants in the Swedish poll consisted mostly of university graduates, which does not represent the majority of the population, their positivity may not reflect the true opinion of the general population. From a Swedish perspective, it is quite clear that the opinion is not as high as the poll might indicate.
Both nations did however show great interest in the field of GMOs and genetic engineering. 80 percent or more were interested in learning more about this field. A prudent strategy for both nations could be to include more information of the basics of genetics and biology in the lower levels of education to increase the level of understanding for life and biological processes.
Istanbul_Tech Team’s Analysis about the Survey:
Most of the participants’ ages are 21-30. (Probably, most of them are university students or new graduated and the average age of people using internet in Turkey.)
Swedish participants are mostly male but, Turkish ones are mostly female.  High rate of female participants in Turkey may be due to GMO is an attractive issue for females because of food industry in Turkey generally use GMO.
Both of participants are graduated from university or are university students.
Also, both of participants are studying on engineering; especially Swedish ones. (Probably, Turkey is facing GMO"

Every iGEM team have its strength and weaknesses. And every project have flaws that could not be seen in a single perspective. Through in-depth collaborations, we can complement each other’s weakness with our strength, and refine our project by evaluating one another.
Mentoring with UCCKE
The Hong Kong UCCKE team aims to create biobricks that detect and degrade uric acid in order to control gout disease. We mentored the team by providing advice, protocols and also helping them to do experimental work. In the beginning of their project, they had difficulty in designing their experiment, especially when designing the assay for characterizing their biobricks. We helped them to construct an assay for measuring the fluorescence signal of their detection module. The assay can be done by incubating transformed E. coli in LB medium with saturated uric acid overnight followed by measuring fluorescent signal in plate reader. The detailed protocols can be viewed below. When they started doing their wet lab, they encountered difficulty in cloning their biobricks. To help them solve the problem, we have provided many advice. For example, to deal with the low insert concentration problem, we suggested them to amplify the synthesized DNA before doing restriction cut. We also suggested them to do restriction map before sequencing. We emphasized them the importance of negative and positive controls when troubleshooting problem of cloning and assaying. At the final stage of the project, we helped them to clone biobricks in parallel. We also helped them to sequence their plasmids and analyze sequencing result. Luckily, they constructed their biobricks on time. After having the biobricks, we helped them to perform the uric acid assay because they do not have plate reader in their school. In return, the Hong Kong UCCKE team helped us to 3D- print our hardware detection kit. They also provided us suggestions on the improvement of the prototype. They helped us a lot because we do have any knowledge in product designing and 3D printing previously.

UCAS,2017,"ynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi"
BostonU,2018," Unfortunately, we did not have the time to use the XYL-REG strain with our systems, but we hope to do so in the future!
BostonU Hardware Team
We collaborated with the BostonU Hardware team after being inspired by the InterLab study, which required serial dilutions. We believed that these dilutions could be made easier using one of BostonU Hardware's microfluidic chips. BostonU Hardware made these chips and BostonU helped test them by manually performing the serial dilutions and comparing our dilutions to the chip's."

As synthetic biologists continue to construct increasingly complex gene regulatory networks, the need for accurate quantitative characterization of their regulatory components becomes more pressing. Despite the BioBrick registry's thorough characterization of the average strength of promoters, there is insufficient description of the variability in their expression. Our project aims to characterize this variability, or noise, for the most commonly used promoters in synthetic biology and provide additional tools for the regulation of these promoters.

Texas Meetup
UT Austin
Franconia
Synthetic biology, being multidisciplinary and collaborative by nature, necessitates continual exchange of ideas and knowledge. Given our standing as a relatively new iGEM team, interaction and discussion with fellow researchers is of utmost importance to the development of our projects. Knowing this, we attended the annual Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium (FURS) held by the University of Texas at Austin this past September. iGEM teams from both UT Austin and Rice University were also in attendance. In addition to the symposium, the Texas iGEM teams had a meetup to begin collaboration, sharing of ideas, and improvement of presentation skills. Each of the teams gave mock presentations in preparation for the Jamboree and received feedback. Additionally, we discussed our projects, judging criteria, and current and future collaboration opportunities. It was a great honor to meet fellow iGEM teams and we are hoping to build upon the connections made at this event in the years to come.
The 2017 UT Austin iGEM team tested out a number of electroporation protocols, some of which they had some difficulty getting to work. Their team asked the Texas Tech 2017 iGEM team to test one of the protocols, Speer 2012, to see if the issue might fall in the protocol itself or their execution. The following is the Speer 2012 protocol and how it was followed. Materials · MRS media · Glycine · Millipore water · 50mM EDTA solution · Plasmids: pMSP3535 and pBTK519 Day One 1. Inoculate 5ml MRS medium with L. plantarum freezer stock 2. Grow overnight at 30°C without shaking Day Two 3. Add 1.25g glycine to two flasks of 50ml MRS medium 4. Shake to dissolve 5. Add 1ml overnight culture to each flask (1:50 dilution) 6. Culture for ~3 hours at 37"
NAWI-Graz,2016," weapon.  The final study will be to find out if there are any differences in expression and secreting of the proteins, as well as, if they can survive with even more pressure from the environment.

Furthermore, in our first Skype meeting with iGEM Team Concordia, we also talked about the ethics of our project. We addressed questions like: For what reason do we not care about manipulating our microorganisms to die for us? Is it because of size differences? Is it because there are vastly more single-cell organisms than humans? Because single celled organisms do not have nerve cells meaning they can’t feel death? Is the alternative just too problematic that the ends justify the means?   The ethical discussion was exciting and we all got new inputs concerning ethics related to our projects.

Manchester,2017," also have their own legislation in accordance with this framework.
In Brazil, the Biosafety Law (Law 11105/05) sets the safety rules and fiscalisation of GMMs and its derivatives in the national territory. The National Technical Committee of Biosafety (CTNBio) is responsible for enforcing the laws and setting the rules for the construction, experimentation, cultivation, manipulation, transport, commercialization, consumption, release and discarding of GMMs and its derivatives.
Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology. However, the Agricultural and Livestock Service is responsible for the importation, sowing and propagation of GMOs, also regulating the exportation of seeds (Law N° 3.557/82 actualised Law N°1523/2001). The Ministry of Health, on the other hand, regulates the labelling of food made with the use of GMOs (Article 107).
India is currently undergoing a massive overhaul in their laws and regulations regarding GMOs. Currently, there is a proposed “Regulations and guidelines on biosafety of recombinant DNA research and biocontainment, 2017’ draft that has been prepared and opened for comments. Currently, under the proposal, the following 6 bodies are in charge of enforcing laws regarding GMOs and GMMs -
1. Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RDAC) - Advisory
2. Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC) - Regulatory/ Approval
3. Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) - Regulatory/ Approval
4. Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) - Regulatory/ Approval
5. State Biotechnology Coordination Committee (SBCC) - Regulatory/ Approval
6. Monitoring District Level Committee (DLC) - Monitoring
The laws regarding the use of GMMs are regulated by 4 ministries: The Ministry of Agriculture, The Ministry of Forestry and Plantation, The Ministry of Health, and The Ministry of Food and Horticulture. They created the Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 21 year of 2005 (PP No. 21/2005) on Biosafety of GMO.
In Japan, mainly Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the use of GMMs. With these ministries at the core, other institutions such as Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare are also responsible for GMMs in each related field.
The usage of the GMMs in Korea is strictly regulated by the GMO Law, established on Jan 28,"
Cardiff_Wales,2018," have enabled Warwick to conclude that catabolic pathways are rare in bacteria, even for a molecule as common as oestrogen.
In return, a team member from Warwick's team, Kurt Hill, provided a solution to incorporating style sheets and scripts into the pages of our wikis. This is because the instructions on the iGEM registry help page did not work for us. Instead he provided working instructions to link these important pages, making coding the wiki much clearer, without the need for extensive in-line styling and scripts."

Sharing the Experience of iGEM
Lab Tutorial Video Series - East Chapel Hill High School
In collaboration with East Chapel Hill High School iGEMs ""Tasty Lab"" lab tutorial video series, we contributed a video tutorial on how to run and analyze an agarose gel. The target audience for this video are those that know about agarose gels, the theory, as well as the applications, but haven't actually poured and ran a gel themselves. Find the link HERE!
Lab Safety Video Series - Tübingen iGEM
We contributed to team Tübingen iGEMs lab safety video series by providing a video outlining how to properly read an MSDS and PSDS before working with any unfamiliar chemicals or organisms. We believe that being able to properly navigate safety forms is an ever-important skill and is somewhat lost in todays labs, as many of the chemicals we work with on a daily basis are fairly benign. Ethanol, ethidium bromide, and pathogenic E. coli, along with their safety considerations, are covered in this video. Find the link HERE!
Synthetic Biology Playing Cards - Franconia
We put together five playing cards for team Franconia's interactive and education-based synthetic biology card game (the game can be found here ). Because our project is based on antibiotic resistance, we made our cards related to our project and included: MRSA, methicillin, vancomycin, hand hygiene and Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B. Our cards can be found here.
Calgary iGEM - Canada-wide Newsletter
We participated in a Canada-wide monthly newsletter hosted by the University of Calgary iGEM team . The goal of the newsletter was to keep all the Canadian teams up to date on the research and human practices efforts being made by the other Canadian teams. Prior to this, we had a skype call with Calgary iGEM to discuss our projects and iGEM, as we are a young team and they had much advice to offer."
Uppsala,2017," were live streamed on YouTube and the recording can be found at iGEM Uppsala´s YouTube channel .
Panel Discussion
As a continuation of the webinars, our team decided to include the public opinion on how they feel about different ethical issues and questions surrounding biology. We wanted to organize a discussion that could engage not only students of biology and members of iGEM teams but also researchers and the general public. This would not be an easy task for a professional, let alone us, who never organized an event before. Fortunately, iGEM Stockholm was willing to share the responsibilities so we managed to organize a lively and interesting discussion in Stockholm - with three speakers who are the experts in the field of synthetic biology, legal matters, and ethical issues. The audience engagement during the discussion wasamazing and even exceeded our expectations. This created an interesting platform for us to learn more about how other people from different social and political background perceived biotechnology and its advancements.
Nordic Meetup
The iGEM Nordic Meetup (NIC) originated in Uppsala in 2015 as an opportunity to meet other teams from Northern Europe, get some feedback on your projects and to set ground for future collaborations for the teams. It became a tradition that the next NIC is hosted by a team that wins the best presentation contest during the meetup. This year, teams have met in Copenhagen at an event hosted by iGEM UCopenhagen. During the first day we bonded over games and activities provided by the team. The second day was spent with lectures helping us with various issues that we might run into during iGEM competition such as communication with media or ethical issues. Each team also presented their project and gained feedback from iGEM judges to adress possible critical issues they might experience. Lively discussions continued until late night hours with a BBQ dinner prepared. Best presentation award this year went to the newest team in the Nordic iGEM world: iGEM Lund. The voting by other iGEM teams' representatives was almost unanimous and in agreement with the judges' opinions. It was clear that iGEM Lund has almost never ending enthusiasm about their project and unique spirit and attitude among the teams! But even though we did not win the prize our team still got a shoutout from the judges for having a reasonable and interesting project. We also got a great and interesting feedback and suggestions from other teams that helped us a lot while progressing in the project. Thanks to NIC we got the chance to meet other teams that our close to us and it gave us a great base for the other collaborations we had during the competition. Teams represented at NIC:"
UCAS,2017," Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernat"

NEU_China_B & DLUT_China & DLUT_China_B 【Hosting Seminar and Meetup】
The NEU_China_A is proud to be able to host the first meetup of all of the iGEM Teams of Dalian University of Technology and Northeastern University this year at August, 27th 2018. By this great opportunity, we also collaborated with DLUT_China, DLUT_China_B, and NEU_China_B to hold a seminar. During this seminar, we had the chance to share each of team’s project, and discuss the specific schemes of the experiments. The seminar greatly promoted the smooth development of these four iGEM teams. At the end of the seminar, we had a discussion regarding the opportunity for collaboration in the next future and reached an experimental cooperation intention with the DLUT_China in kill switch section.
AHUT_China
【Optimization of protein expression conditions and product purification for AHUT_China】
During the online communication with AHUT_China, we learned that they were distressed by the optimization of CSCA protein expression conditions.

Uppsala-Sweden
We also collaborated with the team Uppsala-Sweden. Below, you can see their feedback on our project, the software: M4B: Mining for BİoBrick.
""The METU-BIN_Ankara team provided us their software which they developed for their project to test it if we can use for our Project. We examined the software by searching the parts that have been used during our Project.We used red,blue and green lights as input which activate  red sensor(cph8), green sensor(ccaS) and blue sensor(YF1). We are aiming to get three colours as output which are blue output(amilCP), red output(mCherry) and green/yellow output(amilGFP).
However, we got no result for our specific input - output relations but, the software has some of the inputs and outputs.
This software is very helpful to search the parts and check if the parts are in the standart registry database and decide which parts work effectively with eachother as well.That  provides an easy start to constract the parts and give more efficient results.
We appreciate METU-BIN_Ankara team to create that software and believe that it will be a very helpful software which will solve the problems that we or another teams faced up in the beginning.
The software can be improved further by adding more parameters.""
We are happy to see that they use and have positive expressions on our software. As we got the information about their project, they are adding some of the bioparts of their modified device newly into the Registry. Because of this, and since our software has 2011 spring distribution in its database, it's normal to get no results for their specific device. However, when they'll add them and our database is updated, finally our software will be able to find that specific result.
At the same time, our team has given a feedback on the Biosafety document of the team Uppsala-Sweden, you can read it on this page .
See our software, it's online!

DTU-Denmark,2018," it made perfect sense to have our teams meet with the aim to elevate the ambitions of our respective human practices projects by joining forces. We agreed that it would be fun to explore a new side of our natural science-brains and write a report founded in the humanities. We found that this was quite unusual in previous iGEM space projects and therefore we found it relevant to question issues related to space travel in a new way. The University of Exeter had reached out to do a space-related human practices project and together, we decided to do a three-part space-related humanities report, with each university exploring the same overall issue on the basis of different fields. DTU engaged in history, UCopenhagen in rhetoric, and Exeter in ethics.
We knew quite early on that we wanted the report to cover the possibility of colonization on Mars. At DTU, we were intrigued to look retrospectively at the space race that lead to the moon landing and to look into the political situation at the time, in order to draw parallels to what might need to happen now to land a manned mission on Mars. The pressing matter would subsequently be what to do when we do land a mission on Mars by looking at previous colonization and imperialism and look into some of the driving factors of that era.
Brainstorming was a big part of our first Skype meetings, and because of our early start, our discussions managed to shape parts of each others Human Practice projects. We continuously separated to do research and met online to discuss our findings in relation to the further development of the project. This way, we slowly found a common angle for the project which ended up being “why colonize Mars?”. We would structure the report so that it discussed the issues in different ways: explaining, analyzing, interpreting, and evaluating. We sorted the report in a structured manner. Firstly, exploring previous events in history and relating them to Mars colonization, then analyzing rhetorically the most cogent arguments for and against Mars colonization, and finally discussing the ethical implications of Mars colonization. We would do all of this while also determining the current measures set in place to prevent contamination on Mars, and other extraterrestrial environments.
You can read the report here.
All in all, our collaboration has been a huge success, where we have gotten the opportunity to work on our projects in a completely different way, and perhaps more importantly, worked with other incredible universities and people. Thank you Frida, Victoria, and Matt!

3.NEU_China_A
This year our team and NEU_China_A sent experimental materials in the Distribution Kit each other. These materials greatly helped both sides. We sent Nitrate reporter: PyeaR-GFP composite (BBa_K381001) and Test Device 4 for interlab (BBa_J364007) to them. PyeaR is a nitrate and nitrite sensitive promoter and NEU_China_A replaced GFP with a blue protein. The promoter PyeaR expressed the blue protein under the induction of nitric oxide. So they can use this part (BBa_K381001) to detect nitric oxide. NEU_China_A sent superfolder GFP (BBa_I746916) to us for part improvement. This year, We used sfGFP_optimism (BBa_K2541400) as an improvement part. Compared with iGEM superfolder GFP (BBa_I746916), it has no BbsI restriction site and can be used for Golden Gate assembly. So we used the part (BBa_I746916) from NEU_China_A to verify that it contains BbsI restriction site.
Here is the link to the wiki of NEU_China_A.
4.TUST_China
This year, we built a friendly relationship with TUST_China. During the meet-up in NKU and CCiC, we exchangd ideas about projects.
TUST_China focused on tetracycline detecting and degradation this year, so they would like to collect polluted water in most places in China. There is a river called Yongchun River which is closed to several bio-product factories near Jilin university. We provided a water sample from Yongchun River to TUST_China so they can detect antibiotic pollution to enrich their projects.
Back again to our SynRT, we made an improvement that we did a site-directed mutagenesis of sfGFP ("

Cooperation
Surveys
One of the most important activities of professional                         researchers is to collaborate with other teams.                         Collaborations provide benefits for both teams                         involved: they can test their designs, know opinions,                         obtain feedback, read about other projects, have other                         points of view…
In Valencia UPV team we believe that collaborations                         with colleagues participating in iGEM or with companies                         of the sector enrich our experience and allow us to                         broaden our minds, at the same time that we help other                         teams. That is the reason why we have been                         collaborating with other iGEM teams at any chance we                         had.

35s:GFP:Tnos we sent to Georgia Team. They proudly showed the package         on Twitter!
The grapes and leaves we sent to Paris Bettencourt team from         Requena-Utiel region
Georgia                         State team needed a control for they                         transformations. As we both work with Phytobricks and                         plants, we sent them a device with 35s:GFP:Tnos, for                         GFP expression in plants. We also advised them on the                         use of Goldenbraid standard to work with                         Phytobricks.
Paris                         Bettencourt team is working to remove stains with                         microbes. One of their objectives is to remove wine                         stains. As Spain is a country known by their wines,                         they asked us for samples of grapes, leaves and soil of                         vineyards, so they could search for microorganisms that                         could degrade wine stains. One of our team members                         lives in the region Utiel-Requena, a wine with                         Certification of Origin. The samples we sent them were                         from this region.
We made a program that can be used to convert from                         plain text to HTML. At the beginning, the program was                         made for our own"

The Erusian Meetup
On July the 24th, 25th and 26th, we attended the Erusian meetup hosted by TU Delft and BGI college iGEM teams. This was a great opportunity for us to present our project to others. We delivered a formal presentation, and explained our project at poster sessions. We were also able to find out more about other teams’ projects and their work.
We were able to set up links with some of the teams there which led to some of our collaborations. In addition, it was useful to talk to other teams with more experience and get advice on things like poster design or presentation skills.
GreatBay_China
GreatBay_China is another high school team in Shenzhen, China. We met first on WeChat and then we co-hosted a meetup .(see the link about the meetup:  https://2018.igem.org/Teams/Meetups#ShenzhenHS )
They also mention us on their page!: 2018.igem.org/Team:GreatBay_China/Collaborations
What we did for them:
We discussed both wiki development and modeling, giving them lots of advice and actionable tips. We later gave them some advise on human practices. We co-hosted the Shenzhen highschool meetup.
What they did for us:
Their advisor gave us advice on how to picking the topic. They also helped us on some fundraising issue and procedure problems. Their teacher gave us advice on how we can examine the results of our projects and point out some potential flaws in our project design which we later worked on to improve.

The extension PCR was performed following the standard PCR protocol for Q5 polymerase. In a second step an agarose gel proved that all amplifications worked out well and after gel extraction (ii) Golden Gate assembly was performed following our standard Golden Gate protocol .   The plasmid was (iii) transformed into chemically competent TOP10 strain E.coli cells and plated on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin  to select successfully transformed E. coli cellsl transformed E. coli cells. To evaluate the assembly and test whether the point mutations were successfully inserted, the sequence of HIF1-alpha containing the point mutations as well as the regulatory element (CMV) promoter were verified by Sanger Sequencing. The sequencing results were positive and therefore, we are happy to have helped the iGEM Team Freiburg with the cloning of a constitutive HIF1-alpha.

Human Practice Collaboration
Initialized by the iGEM Team from Düsseldorf , we had a nice human practice collaoration with the teams from Aachen, Bielefeld, Darmstadt, Erlangen, Hannover and Tübingen taking part in this campaign. The concept of this campaign was that iGEM Teams from all over Germany design postcards with an important aspect of Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology combined with a catchy motif, and exchange them with all the other teams. Now having a large variety of different postcards, the teams distribute them to the public. The aim is to give non-scientists an understanding of Synthetic Biology, what this means, and in which parts of our life it is involved.

EPFL,2018," Thus, the contact started with             multiple video conferences over the summer. These conferences discussed iGEM EPFL’s experience with cell free systems optimization, especially with linear DNA expression templates. Moreover, the EPFL team benefited from Athens’ team knowledge             and experience with kit design to start the kit design for our diagnostic tool. The collaboration finally materialized with Yannis from iGEM Athens visiting the EPFL team and spending some time with us in the lab. The discussion revolved mainly             on continuing the projects beyond the iGEM competition, and especially the realization of a diagnostics kit. Both teams are planning on developing models for a diagnostic toolkit, as well as models for the 3D printing of their device enclosures.             The two teams decided on setting a framework for the shared realization of these goals.
iGEM GreatBay China
We had the privilege of collaborating with Great Bay China , a high School team from Shenzhen. We received numerous tips and good advice about poster design, the flow that iGEM presentations should have as well as information about common                   pitfalls and how to avoid them. On our side, we were able to help them with identifying backup plans to perform the last step of their transformation chemically, since the enzyme performing this action is unknown to this day.
The Artistic Side of Synthetic Biology
Bring Science Out of Your Lab!
This year, the EPFL iGEM Team gave the opportunity to iGEMers from all over the world to compete on a new level… Art! We know how hard it is for iGEM teams to think about art before the Giant Jamboree, and  we hoped to inspire teams to look at the artistic side of their experiments.
Indeed we are convinced that art is a domain which people from all backgrounds can appreciate. This is the reason why we organised a contest of artistic images from team’s experiments! A way for us to open the dialog with the public about our project and, more broadly, about biology.
Here are some of the entries that we had, we were very grateful to all the teams that participated in this photo contest, and we hope that more teams will start to explore the interface between biology and art in the future.

Our team included questions pertaining to whether people would be willing to receive antimicrobial peptide treatments, while Columbia’s team included questions specifically relating to probiotic alternatives. The statistical analysis of this survey will provide insights on whether the attitudes toward receiving the treatments proposed by our team and iGEM Columbia differ among people of diverse demographics.

UNSW_Australia,2016," expression systems.
To help us, USYD heard our woes about being unable to express our parts, and stepped up by cloning BBa_2022000 and BBa_2022010 into their pET expression vector. Interestingly, upon using a Western Blot to detect expression, we found that our although their cells expressed our RFP-fusion part, they weren't turning red, which was the first hint that there was an issue with our part...
To help USYD, we performed a Western Blot on induced cells (supposedly) expressing EtnR1 and  EtnR2, the two proteins that underpin their project. We determined that they were in fact expressing, and were delighted to let them know that!
Outside of the lab, we attended a STEM presentation together with the USYD iGEM team, where we opened the eyes of school students to the possibilities of having a career in the STEM field.
We also attended an evening event hosted by the University of Sydney, for Australian iGEM teams to practice their presentations before the Giant Jamboree.
Paris-Bettencourt
The Paris-Bettencourt iGEM team reached out to us early on in the iGEM season, due to our team’s proximity to a wine-growing region. Paris Betterncourt’s project focused on wine-fermenting bacteria, and thus required biological samples from wineries (such as soil, branches, leaves and grapes).
Our team made the road trip to a wine valley in upper NSW, and collected some samples for Paris Bettencourt. We posted these to Paris Bettencourt, who graciously received them. We hope this small contribution on our part helped their project as much as it could!"
USTC-Software,2015," uncertainty formula: supposed that the first point's fringe series which users select is $n$, the fringe radius is $r_n$, the second point's fringe series which users select is $m$, the fringe radius is $r_m$. Besides, we notate $c=\alpha^2$. So, we get this:
$$
\begin{align}
r^2_n &=cn \\
r^2_m&=cm \\
m-n&=\delta_n \\
r_m-r_n &=\delta_d
\end{align}
$$
Solve the equation group:
$$r_n=\frac{c\delta_n-(\delta d)^2}{2\delta_d}$$
So, we get n is:
\begin{aligned}
n & =\frac{r_n^2}{c} \\
& = \frac{1}{c}\cdot\frac{[c\delta_n-(\delta_d)^2]^2}{4(\delta_d)^2} \\
& = \frac{c}{4}(\frac{\delta_n}{\delta_d})^2+\frac{1}{4c}(\delta_d)^2-\frac{\delta_n}{2}
\end{aligned}
with uncertainty transfer formula, we would get:
\begin{aligned}
U_n & =\frac{c}{4}[2\frac{\delta_n}{\delta_d}\cdot\frac{1}{\delta_d}U_{\delta_n}+2\frac{\delta_n}{\delta_d}\cdot\delta_n\cdot(-\frac{1}{\delta^2_d})\cdot U_{\delta_d}] \\
& = \frac{c}{2}\cdot\frac{\delta_n}{\delta_d}(\frac{U_{\delta_n}}{\delta_d}-\frac{\delta_n\cdot U_{\delta_d}}{\delta^2_d})+\frac{1}{2c}\cdot\delta_d\cdot U_{\delta_d}-\frac{1}{2}U_{\delta_n} \\
& = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{c\delta_n}{\delta^2_d}-1)U_{\delta_n}+(\frac{\delta_d}{2c}-\frac{c}{2}\cdot\frac{\delta^2_n}{\delta^3_d})U_{\delta_d}

TECHNION-ISRAEL,2017," a great opportunity to discuss our idea with people from different countries and cultures. In addition, we were excited to bring our message of “Tolerance” to another country and share it with other iGEM teams.
This is the first time that a team from the Technion Institute has participated in an iGEM meet-up abroad. In total four teams participated. Two teams from France, one from Spain and us. Each team presented their project and received feedback from the judges that team AIX arranged and from the different teams. The Feedback was constructive and helped us improve our presentation and poster as well as our project as a whole.
The projects presented were interesting and inspiring. The atmosphere was great and allowed room for discussion and collaboration. We truly experienced the unique and special nature of the iGEM community.
We hope that in light of this experience, future teams from the Technion and the Middle East will participate in multinational meet-ups abroad.
Collaboration with team Peshawar
Team Peshawar and the Technion have a rich collaboration history . This year we collaborated with Team Peshawar by video chat. We shared our project ideas and brainstormed regarding problems and potential solution. We also discovered we were both planning to write position papers concerning our projects, and shared insights regarding planning and execution. Additionally Team Peshawar went to extra lengths to produce a very thoughtful “Tolerance photo” that received incredibly positive feedback on social media (shown below).

UCAS,2017," Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users"
Exeter,2018," we met at the iGEM Oxford meet up who had engineering expertise. UCL as an institution has an outstanding reputation for bioreactor innovations and the UCL iGEM team agreed to offer assistance in teaching us bioreactor basics. Subsequently, later in the summer the UCL Team contacted us on social media to help fix a JavaScript site error. They had a problematic js file, which would load a json extension locally, but not when uploaded on their iGEM wiki, giving a MIME error in the console.
Cooperation: The UCL team prepared a presentation on the essentials of bioreactor design to help teach us the basics and were key in reviewing many of our early bioreactor concepts, pointing out key flaws and providing insightful improvements to the designs.Regarding the JavaScript site error, fortunately our CompSci team member Phil had encountered this error before and was happy to share his expertise and troubleshoot their wiki. By using JavaScript within source tags, the problem was solved. Though this was not part of their project, it had a key role in their wiki set-up.
Follow-Up: Everything has been working great since! We wish the entire UCL team that best of luck at the Jamboree, and hope to support them in their presentation. #TeamUCL
University of Copenhagen and Techical University of Denmark
Initial Contact: As soon as we decided upon a project whose focus was on Mars we started to look for other teams interested in the synthetic biology opportunities offered by space. We discovered that both the teams from Technical University of Denmark and Copenhagen were looking at projects based on or relevant to Mars exploration. After several skype calls we determined that a review of ethical and legal issues surrounding going to Mars would be mutually beneficial and began researching.
Cooperation: Throughout the competition we remained in close contact: sharing ideas, expertise and contacts in order to create a comprehensive review of; historical incentives of space missions, the arguments for and against colonization and the ethical implications of colonization and transport of biomaterial to Mars. Much of our contact centred around the need to closely examine our own reasons for wanting to do a space project and exploring the ethical issues surrounding space projects in general. Our review can be read here .
Follow-Up:This review has been mutually beneficial to all of the teams involved and offered a fresh perspective on both the benefits and issues surrounding our projects.   It has been a pleasure working with such committed and insightful teams - best of luck for the Jamboree! #TeamCopenhagen

Team: Hong Kong HKU
In mid April, our team had our first meeting with HKU iGEM team. In that meeting, we exchanged our project idea with their team members. They raised a few questions upon our project and shared their past experience with us.
During the wet lab in the summer, we suffered from unsuccessful transformation of a designed composite. HKU iGEM team kindly offered help by transforming the composite for us in their lab.
In the final stage in our project, we presented our project to HKU team members. They suggested a few ideas for us to improve our presentation and gave some useful guidelines for the iGEM competition. We gratefully honour their help throughout our project.
Team: LMU TUM Munich
It is our great honour to be invited by Munich United IGEM team to collaborate with them and help them out with filling their survey form. Although our project is still under a laboratory testing phase with no intention to enter the market in a foreseeable time, their  focus on putting research work into real world application has definitely broaden our view--we can actually put our ideas into something on the market! Maybe you will see biochemical-synthesized repellent and attractant out on the market some day. Please kindly check out their website too! Team:LMU-TUM_Munich

iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania
Our first collaboration took place in March, when the iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania team  came to Tartu for a visit! They gave us some valuable pieces of advice as to how to successfully manage our whole project. Furthermore, they additionally described the different spheres we ought to pay special attention to i.e. human practices, public relations, modelling ect. For our team’s first iGEM experience this collaboration was very valuable as it gave us a better understanding of what steps we need to take in order to yield a successful project. We briefly discussed their idea for this year's competition. During the collaboration weekend we organized an excursion to the Estonian Genome Center - we had a really informative and science-filled weekend!
Unesp AQA iGEM
In May we got a collaboration request from a Brazilian team and altogether came up with some great collaboration ideas. As UNESP AQA was focusing on Diabetes type 1, we helped them to gather the data comprising Diabetes type 1 frequency, treatment possibilities and costs in Estonia and Europe. Brazilian team helped us with gathering information on ethylene production in Brazil and setting up our crowdfunding campaign. Our collaboration lasted for 2 months via various emails and online calls.
Peshawar iGEM
In the middle of the summer we contacted a Peshawar team and had interesting conversations via Skype calls concerning our projects. From that we gained some useful advice and a good feedback on our concept.
Toronto iGEM
In the beginning of July, the University of Toronto’s iGEM team invited us to participate in their podcast exploring how synthetic biology intersects with different disciplines ranging from engineering, law, business to the arts. We gladly decided to take part in it and on 12th of August, we had a meeting with one of the team leaders from Toronto, in Tartu. We had an interesting conversation during which we introduced our team, project and also discussed the further development and real-world application of our project.

Delaware
Since the Mid-Atlantic iGEM Meet-Up, we have been working with University of Delaware to help them establish a foundation for their new team.  By establishing this mentorship, we have been helping them by offering them a diverse set of protocols, providing templates/methods for brainstorming and designing iGEM Projects, and have been available for calls discussing qualities of a successful iGEM project.
Manchester
Involvement with Manchester began when they expressed interest in a business model for their device. Our conversations led us to find that there are major differences with regard to GMM laws across the world. Together, we helped synthesize questions that revealed these inconsistencies among nations. Additionally, we researched and submitted summaries detailing United States law with respect to GMMs within the confines of the targeted questions. Our major collaboration, outside of contributing US law, was in developing a cohesive way for demonstrating the differences between countries. A link to this collaboration can be found here.
William and Mary
After our Mid-Atlantic Meet-Up, William and Mary offered us a set of protocols related to Arabinose-inducible promoters, which helped us further characterize the promoters in Paracoccus denitrificans and use the pBAD promoter in our final tested device."

2.With SYSU
We met up with the iGEM team SYSU-China in May, introducing each other's projects, teams and experiments, sharing some experience in modeling, and exchanging ideas. We built strong friendship with each other.
In September, in order to solve the problem of simultaneous measurement of the rate of detachment of bacteria and algae, two-wavelength method was established based on Beer-Lambert Law. After obtaining experimental data, we needed to verify the accuracy of the two-wavelength method by modeling and data analysis. Team SYSU-China had given us a lot of help in data analysis, and to some extent proved the reliability of the method.
3.With Team SUIS Alpha
On June 16th, the Shanghai Pinghe High School team came to our school. Since we both contain bacteria and algae symbiosis in project, we gave guidance on the overall framework of design and experiment to them. In the original design, they wanted bacteria to express a small molecule (iron carrier) so that they could better achieve the purpose of manufacturing. We emphasized the importance of pre-experiment for them and suggested that it should be carried out with pure chemical molecules. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the engineered bacteria transformation and expression could be carried out after the pre-experiment success.
4.Communication with Team worldshaper-wuhan
On July 31, 2018, the high school team worldshaper-wuhan came to visit us. In addition to giving them introduction on the project, we took the initiative to help them contact the community and provide them with a platform to showcase project and broadcast synthetic biology.
5.iGEM Central China Regional Conference and with HUST
At the beginning of this summer, team Hust-China held the 5th Central China Regional Conference. Although there were not many experiments results in the presentation, but the design was basically completed. We presented our projects and communicated with each other.  We knew about that the project of team Hust-China this year also involved the symbiosis of bacteria and algae, and they plan to use it to generate electricity. We have discussed experiments on symbiotic co-culture of algae. What’s more, our project - the automatic water element recovery device and theirs- usage of bacteria and algae for power generation also have a high degree of upstream and downstream cooperation relationship.
In addition, Hust-China team also helped us to freeze the parts and helped us solve the problem of sending samples.

Edinburgh,2015," we are testing is the processed vs unprocessed cellulose. As you can see on the graph, there are large error bars however there is a clear difference between the binding on the processed and unprocessed sheets of microbial cellulose. This could be because the processing may get rid of any remaining organisms or proteins that would inhibit the CBD binding. Due to limited time and cellulose sheets from the Stanford-Brown team, we were unable to repeat this experiment.
From these results we would have to conclude that if we were to make a microbial cellulose based biosensor, it is best that it uses the processed sheets. From this we also advise the Stanford-Brown team to use the processed sheets. Due to the higher binding affinity of the CBD to the processed sheets, they should be able to have the spores stick for folding. Check out their project and how they processed the cellulose!

UFlorida,2018," much like puzzle pieces. Systems biology graphical notation is a standardized diagram format. This allows scientists to understand the entirety of an example biological system and visualize how the pieces fit together. Using recommended software and characters, our team used this graphical notation to display our biological pathway. Thankfully our system is not too complex to depict ... although assembly of the system proved to be a bit difficult!
Music Video
One of our simpler collaborations included making a 15 second segment of a music video to the song “Moves Like Jagger” by Maroon 5, which was called ""Moves Like iGEM."" The song lyrics were modified by Tec CEM iGEM 2018 and sent to all participants. A total of 27 teams from around the world filmed their respective segments and sent them in to be compiled into a whole music video. Our lip-syncing abilities were put to the test!
Shanghai
Our collaboration with the Shanghai Tech iGEM Team began when we were interested in obtaining a part from their 2016 research team. We eventually decided to steer our project in a different direction that didn’t require their part, but our relationship and informational collaboration with their team grew. As both of our teams were working to edit the E. coli genome, we shared papers and methods that we were either attempting or came across during our searches. The Shanghai Tech team was interested in replacing an origin ribosome site with a designed orthogonal ribosome, and they wanted to utilize the lambda Red system. We suggested the No-Scar method utilizing CRISPR-Cas9. In return, they shared information regarding the CAGO technique which also utilizes CRISPR-Cas9 and lambda Red. This collaboration was very helpful in expanding the knowledge base of both of our teams."

Viability Assay with Azurin
This year’s iGEM team from ETH Zurich is working on a tumor microenvironment based approach to fight cancer as well. Their approach is responding to the lactate secreted by tumor cells and should result in the secretion of azurin by E. coli. Azurin has the ability to induce apoptosis by binding to p53 which results in intracellular accumulation of p53 and BAX. Elevated levels of p53 and BAX lead to the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol which initiates the caspase cascade process resulting in apoptosis (Punj et al., 2004).
In order to show the cytotoxic effect of azurin on tumor cells we, the iGEM team Freiburg, performed a killing curve experiment with azurin and HEK293T cells . A fixed amount of HEK cells were seeded into 12-well plates, with one plate for every counting day. Four different conditions were applied in this experiment, no azurin treatment (negative control), 1 µg/ml azurin, 10 µg/ml and 100 µg/ml azurin. Since azurin is not stable at 37°C, 2 % of glycerol was added to the medium for stabilization. Every second day, the medium was changed without washing the cells.
Figure 1: Viability curve with HEK293T cells.
Course of the used azurin concentrations in the killing experiment. The negative control was not treated with azurin. All experiments were performed in triplicates.

Figure 1 shows the results of the killing experiment. After 8 days, the untreated cells show constant viability of around 80 %, while azurin treated cells show decreased viability. For 1 µg/ml and 10 µg/ml azurin in medium, the cells show a loss of viability of more than 50 %. The highest azurin concentration (100 µg/ml) has a stronger killing effect on HEK cells. Hereby, viability goes down to 18 %, which indicates a"

Collaborations
To improve our project we collaborated with several other iGEM teams, returning the favor for them as well. These collaborations include surveys, campaigns, webinars, BioBrick testing and other laboratory partnerships. These, in turn, can roughly be divided into two categories: wet-lab collaborations and human practices collaborations. We collaborated with iGEM TUDelft, Utrecht, USP-Brazil, Uppsala and Cologne-Duesseldorf. Moreover, we had meaningful collaborations with two institutes: The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Institute.
iGEM TUDelft: Drying and storage of E. coli cells
We collaborated with iGEM TUDelft . As both projects involve a diagnostic tool in live cells, it is important to correctly and easily preserve the cells for storage and shipping, ideally without the need of a cold-chain.
Tardigrade proteins
The iGEM team of TUDelft created BioBricks containing proteins from the Tardigrade, an animal known for its tolerance to extreme environments. These proteins can help preserve and stabilize enzymes, which can be greatly beneficial when drying E. coli cells. We tested these three BioBricks:

Our outreach this year consisted of two different collaborations. Although we don’t have details ready for the wiki (as we are meeting with them a few days before the competition, well after the wiki freeze), several members of our team are planning to have an extended meeting with several leading experts in sleep medicine to exchange ideas and get feedback on our overall project idea. Organized with the help of Prof. Eve Van Cauter from the Sleep, Metabolism, and Health Center (SMHC) and director of the Sleep, Chronobiology, and Neuroendocrinology Research Laboratory at the University of Chicago, the session will include a presentation by Dr. Rachel Markwald, a sleep research physiologist from the Naval Health Research Office in San Diego, a presentation on current human melatonin research by Prof. Kathy Reid from Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine's Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine, then some time for presentation of our own project. We hope to be able to report back with updates on this interesting collaboration in our presentation at the Jamboree.
 
Additionally, we helped provide mentorship and feedback to a high school team from Our Lady of the Snow Catholic Academy in Alberta, Canada (check out their wiki here: https://2015.igem.org/Team:OLS_Canmore_AB_CA ). This year, they are pursuing a project to express keratinase similar to our project from 2013, and so we provided them with guidance on difficulties we encountered in our project, molecular mechanism of the keratinase, the process of chemically digesting the bonds, and ideas for making the keratinase-based father waste digesting process economically viable for chicken feathers. We also discussed different approaches that could be used to either produce pure keratinase on a large scale in bacteria or yeast or produce bacteria that could secrete keratinase on a large scale with no need for lysis.

Background
This year our team has focused on creating a system that will allow other iGEM teams to easily control the gene expression speed of an arbitrary protein without requiring a costly wholesale redesign of existing architecture. To that end, we characterized how protein degradation tags (pdt) can be used to modularly change the speed of mScarlet-I, a fast folding, high quantum yield red fluorescent protein. We also created a set of easy-cloning parts which enable future iGEM teams to clone our parts without needing intermediates. At the UVA Mid-Atlantic meetup, we were particularly intrigued by University of Maryland iGEM’s copper sensor. After discussing with them, we agreed that we would collaborate on improving the function of their copper sensor ( Bba_K2477013 ). Since they primarily wanted to use their copper sensor as an educational tool, reducing the time required to get results would help them keep students engaged, as well as enable them to use their device in labs or outreach activities that did not have a lot of time.
To help UMD increase their gene expression speed, we proposed that we jointly create and characterize modified versions of their copper sensor parts with pdts (Figure 1). Since time was short and Maryland did not have access to a cell sorter, we simply had them ship us their parts, and then performed the modifications and characterizations at William and Mary, before sending the modified parts back for use. On the other end, William and Mary sent blinded speed constructs to Maryland for testing. We hoped that this would enable us to confirm degradation characterization in platforms other than our own, and potentially show speed change as well.

Results
We successfully cloned and sequenced all 6 pdt variants of University of Maryland’s copper circuit ( K2333437 - K2333442 ). We confirmed that they are inducible with copper sulfate and that the RFP produced can be degraded by mf-Lon (Figure 2). We then performed preliminary speed characterization of a"

Handbook for non-model iGEM organisms
Despite Chlamydomonas reinhardtii being a model organism in the world of microalgae research, its presence at iGEM has been virtually non-existent. With a few exceptions like Concordia 2014 and Valencia 2012 , microalgae has made little of an appearance. While we hope our protein expression plasmid makes it easier for future teams to use Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we went further by contributing to a dedicated non-model organisms guide.
The partnership, facilitated by Yale 2015 , includes the following five teams: Concordia 2015 , Cornell 2015 , University of British Columbia 2015 , University of La Verne , and Utah State University 2015 .
The guide itself appropriately stresses the need for both time and resources for non-E. coli species and emphasizes the utility of in-lab experience to help guide the project. We hope it is of use for future iGEM teams."
Tufts,2015," regarding the ethical and safety implications regarding the engineering of bacteriophage.
We have also worked with and mentored the Westford Academy iGEM team, answering technical questions and assisting them in setting up their project involving finding new methods of making bacteria competent.  Our mentorship has consisted mostly of advice, and sending protocols."
UCAS,2017," is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Characterization of lldR-operator promoter collection
In exchange, Stockholm agreed to characterize a part of our synthetically designed LldR-operator promoter collection for us. They probed our engineered bacteria, carying a green fluorescent protein under the control of lldR along with constantly expressed lldR with or without lldP, for their reaction to different levels of L-Lactate. Thereby they actively contributed to the characterization of our promoter collection .
Amoy
We collaborated with the Amoy team by contributing to their newsletter. We have written about the selection process for iGEM in the issue No1 and participated in the questionnaire about the most useful software for us in issue No6 . We also published a description of our project in issue No3 , an update in issue No5 and an article about our human practices in issue No7 .  Finally, we wrote short essays about the situation of synthetic biology in Switzerland for the Special issue and about the ethical dilemmas of editing a human embryo for the issue No2 . Next to the Amoy team itself we were the only participating team that contributed to every issue of the newsletter.
Darmstadt
On their Southern Germany tour, representatives of the TU_Darmstadt iGEM team visited several German, Swiss, and Italian teams. We were happy to host them for a weekend in Zurich and Basel, where we showed them our lab and our city. We were talking a lot about our projects which was a great opportunity to find out how someone completely unrelated to our idea would react to it, and vice versa.
Next to this, TU_Darmstadt also introduced us to their Lab Surfing platform, which we tested for them. We came up with many inputs to improve the user interface and general usability of the platform. The result of the TU_Darmstadt Lab Surfing project can be found here .
EPFL
Since both Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology, ETH Zurich and EPF Lausanne, are hosting an iGEM team in 2015, we were of course eager to find out what our colleagues in Lausanne were working on. We invited their team to our lab where we were able to test our presentations on each other and get useful inputs on how to improve them.
We found also that for both our teams it is important to spread public awareness on the rapidly rising field of synthetic biology to which we have become so used. EPFL invited us to take part in their survey on the public awareness of and opinion on synthetic biology, which they had planned to conduct in Lausanne. Together we then went out to"

Abstract
As a first year joining the iGEM, we have insufficient experience about how to set up a team or what on earth does iGEM want us to do. So, we sought help from the experienced undergraduates since they have an edge over us on either biological knowledge or experience of iGEM competition. Luckily, We found assistance from TJU iGEM 2015 which has an assistance project for other teams this year by spreading the handbooks. Notably, we have accepted one in Chinese version from them, which then become a convenient and useful tool for us to get familiar with this competition. Information like the prolonged history, necessary knowledge about synthetic biology, requirements for medals and projects of other outstanding teams are all recorded in a single book. Therefore, we master the basic principles of experiment for synthetic biology and requirements of the competition in a fastest way.
Requirement of experiment
After communicating with the experiment teams, we find out that they need inspiration when choosing projects, information when starting on projects and tools when processing data and diagram.
Offer of software
And then, we consider what software can do to help the experiment teams. After the brainstorming and we get the answer we want. The introduction of previous projects will kindle their inspiration of their projects and give them the chance to stand on the shoulders on their ancestors. The tags help to well classify all the information and save lots of time. And the synsketch will help them draw clear and standardized flow diagrams of experiment. IGEMers can use this tool to consummate their projects.
Collaboration with the experiment teams
So, we establish a close connection with the experiment teams.
This summer, we have nice collaborations with teams like SCUT-China , SYSU-China , SKLBC-China . And we really appreciate the help and communications among teams.
Meet-up    2015 July 14th
At that day, the members of three software teamsincluding SKLBC-China, SYSU-Software as well as our team, SKLBC-GDSYZX and three laboratory teamsincluding SCUT, SCUT-China and SYSU-China, gathered together in the lab of SCUT. We discussed and exchanged thoughts about the relationship and interaction between the software and experiment of synthetic biology. At this meet-up, we also showed our projects with each other, after which we got lots of useful advice and"
Utrecht,2018," while holding the rope, which they were not allowed to let go of. Almost every team managed to make a perfect square in time.
After the task, we evaluated the problems and findings, which arose during the task. The main conclusion was that structure and good communication is very important, regulated by a leader who guides the whole group by making sure everyone understands the task, evaluates if the task has been performed correctly and channels all the input of the group. This conclusion is also applicable in their own iGEM teams.
Tar-Transformation
Figure 1. Colony PCR of 6 Tar expressing colonies.
Since the Tar receptor plays a central role in our project, we opted to use the biobricks BBa_K777000 and BBa_K777001 . After isolation from the distribution kit and subsequent transformation of these parts to E. coli DH5-alpha we performed a colony PCR on several clones using the VF and VR primers, to confirm the presence of the Tar construct in our bacteria. The results of this screening showed the presence of a DNA fragment of 1200 bp, even though the expected fragment size should be 1762 bp (Figure 1). Sequencing results showed the presence of a GFP coding sequence downstream of an undefined region that presumably contains a promoter sequence. These results were confirmed by examining the plates under the fluorescence binoculars.
We hypothesized that this was due to inconsistency in our DNA distribution kit, since we did not isolate any GFP expressing constructs, with the exception of constructs that were already used for the interlab study. Because these constructs were isolated on a separate occasion, we asked other iGEM teams if they could replicate these results. The Dutch teams from Eindhoven and Groningen decided to help us by testing theses parts from their kit and sharing their results with us. From these results it became clear that the parts BBa_K777000 and BBa_K777001 from their kits showed no fluorescence at all (Figure 2 and 3).
Since we really needed these parts to complete the methylation part of our project, team Groningen decided to send their parts to us. The effort that both teams put into helping us is a perfect example of the iGEM spirit. We would like to thank both teams for their time and effort!

This year, we have collaborated with Virginia, EPFL, UC_Davies and Imperial_College iGEM teams!
For collaborations this year, we completed the biocontainment survey created by the Virginia iGEM 2016 team. They collected information about the awareness of biocontainment within iGEM teams. We responded by stating that our biological system would be contained within the confines of a bio-refinery with no exposure to the external environment.
Second, we participated in the iGEM.today project, designed by the EPFL iGEM 2016 as a part of their human practices. This platform presents iGEM teams and their projects through news articles, it makes a great platform to learn more about iGEM projects in interactive and interesting ways. We were interviewed about our team, “Crescentium,” our project, and our overall experience with participating in iGEM this year.
We also participated in the iGemMatch.org project, created by the UC Davies Team. This project is designed to easily find collaborators from the iGEM community relevant to your project or areas of expertise.
Lastly, we have collaborated with Imperial_College iGEM team. For their project, they chose to develop a framework to engineer microbial communities, what is extremely relevant to our project. We collected some growth data over a range of pHs for Caulobacter and E.coli, which they can use to validate their developed A.L.I.C.E software for co-cultures.
All in all, this was a great year for hearing the experiences the international iGEM community. We heard a lot of interesting stories and a lot of great experiences are"
