""If you have an apple and I have an apple, and we exchange apples, we both still only have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea, and we exchange ideas, we each now have two ideas.""
This year, we had the honor of collaborating with six other iGEM teams to work together, sharing our ideas from different corners of the world to push forward each other’s project goals.
Mingdao iGEM team
Mingdao iGEM team and our team have had close collaborations because both of us are from Taichung City in Taiwan. In the beginning, we got to know their project design and problems with Salmonella in a meetup. We advised them to clone the synthetic gene expression vector carrying glucose transporter gene from the bacteria and then assemble with the promoter.
Furthermore, we helped them contact a lab PI, Dr. Cheng-Yang Huang, in Chung Shan Medical University who has handled the bacteria before, and then used primers designed by Mingdao to amplify the gene fragments by PCR. Salmonella is well known as a Biosafety Level 2 organism, so Mingdao could avoid the safety issue of Salmonella through the collaboration.
On the other hand, we really appreciate Mingdao iGEM team’s help and advice when we received synthetic DNA from IDT. Since it is our team’s first time participating in iGEM, we were not much familiar with Biobrick and subcloning BioBrick parts. Luckily, Dr. Phil Chen, the instructor of Mingdao igem team, and his students have actually completed in total at least 28 BioBrick parts this year. They did us a favor by subcloning BioBrick parts and shared valuable experience in"

Collaborations
Collaborations were an exciting aspect of the iGEM experience: there seemed to exist a certain community through the iGEM networks, of students who were engaging in lab work just as we were - succeeding and failing, and of course, learning. We maintained correspondence with a few different teams, meeting with a representative of Tec de Monterrey for instance. But the more impactful communications we made to the mutual benefits of two teams came from our participation in the NEGEM meet up that was hosted by the Boston University iGEM Team.
This was one of our first experiences presenting our project, and the feedback we received on our work was very helpful on what aspects we needed to clarify and expand on more for future presentations. Beyond having the first time exposure, talking about our project brought us into contact with local teams who offered us aid from the discoveries they made from their own research.
Harvard iGEM Magazine
With a project that relies on the use of live bacteria, we know that our project would raise a few heads for anyone who was not familiar with the use of synthetic biology. The stigma against gene editing and different methods of meddling with the very codes that make up a human, is something that is heavily controversial as the field continues to expand and grow. In order to highlight the positive potential that could come out of harnessing synthetic biology, our team reached out to our peers around the world to send in their abstracts in order to #FightTheStigma!
Our formal collaboration request: ""Calling all iGEM teams! This year, Team Harvard wants to work with you all to end the stigma against synthetic biology. We’ve noticed that human contact with bacteria is frequently associated with negative consequences and as such, it is regarded as dangerous by the general public. As iGEM teams, we understand that genetically engineering bacteria is a largely untapped resource for positive change. Help us show the world the true potential of harnessing bacteria for use in therapeutics, diagnostics, the environment and more!""
Thank you to all the teams who participated!

High school Engagement
So far, there is no iGEM high school team in Wuhan city and Hubei province of P. R. China. It is partially owing to students’ heavy burden of homework, exams and the college entrance pressure, and also because of that most high school students haven’t even heard of iGEM before.
This year, we decided to change this situation and we cast our sight on popularizing the knowledge of synthetic biology in high schools. After plenty of researches, we decided to firstly target on The Affiliated High School of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), which is one of the top-leveled high schools in Wuhan and has a global view by recruiting students for international class every year.
After early communication and preparation, we successfully held a seminar at The Affiliated High School of HUST on Jan 7th with over 300 high school teachers and students attending. On the seminar, we introduced the concept and basic knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM and presented our 2015 iGEM project to them. Students showed great interest in our presentation and were amazed by all the novel ideas of iGEM projects in the past years. After the presentation, we sent out questionnaires to the audiences and received exciting feedbacks.
These high school students said that they were introduced to a new world of biology and a new technology that they hadn’t learnt before in their textbooks. They asked us various questions about synthetic biology and iGEM on the questionnaires. After the seminar, we discussed with the teachers from The Affiliated High School of HUST about the possibility of forming a high school team to attend the competition. They listened to our suggestions and felt promising to form a new team in the future.
Since then, we also invited some students to our lab several times and taught them basic laboratory skills and the progress of our Filter project. Hopefully next year we’ll have a new iGEM high school team in the Giant Jamboree!

Collaboration with Lanzhou
[confirming the mercury concentration]
◎ BIT-China for Lanzhou
https://2016.igem.org/Team:Lanzhou/Collaboration
This year, team Lanzhou aimed to employ the gut flora to treat the mercury pollution inside fish body. To transform the gut flora, they planned to feed the fish with genetic engineered bacteria.
Above is the gene circuit they designed, INP (Ice Nucleation Protein) is an extrinsic membrane protein of E.coli and acts as an anchor. gfp acts as a reporter gene while metal catcher can bind heavy-metal ions.
We helped them designed and operated the pre-experiment to identify the maximum concentration of mercury ions which can keep the fish alive. From literature research, we chose the following concentration: 0.3mg/L, 0.2mg/L, 0.15mg/L, 0.1mg/L, 0.05mg/L, 0.025mg/L.
Then we raised 10 fishes and measured the number at the same time in fifteen days.
At last, we found that the concentration of mercury ions should be maintained at 0.1 milligrams per liter. When the concentration is higher than this value, the fish will die. When the concentration is lower than this value, the difference will not be obvious.
◎ Lanzhou for BIT-China
On September 18th, 2016, we met and exchanged ideas with members of teams from Lanzhou by the Beijing Institute of Technology. After the meeting, we confirmed our collaboration relationship. To further extend our system, we asked them for helping us constructing one of our gene circuits.
They constructed one of our testing circuits.
The ""inhibitor"" system is very important for our project, we use the concentration of inhibitor proteins as a signal indicating the plasmid numbers, and it can trigger the downstream reaction by activating the killer gene while the plasmid concentration reduce the threshold.
3. Collaboration with CIEI-B"
Edinburgh_OG,2018,"EM team this year. The Iowa 2018 team is developing a biosensor for the detection and quantification of 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP), a natural plastic precursor with considerable importance in the industrial production of bioplastics.
In order to produce a co-polymer such as polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate PHBV, the monomer 3-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA (3HV) can be introduced via the precursor propionyl-CoA. Currently, the necessity of propionate or propionyl-CoA is a limiting factor in production of PHBV, which has potential to become a versatile polymer in the commercial setting today. With our metabolic engineering strategy inspired by that of Srirangan et al. (2016), the E. coli can be modified to produce PHBV from substrates such as glucose or glycerol, exempting the need for direct feed with propionic acid. This requires the activation of a cluster of genes called the Sleeping Beauty Mutase (SBM) operon, which has been inactivated through multiple evolutionary selections, that encodes for the net conversion of succinyl-CoA into propionyl-CoA (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Proposed mechanism for propionate synthesis via the evolutionarily dormant Sleeping Beauty mutase operon (SBM) and a complementary methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MCE). Succinyl-CoA is converted into (R)-methylmalongyl-CoA by the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (encoded by scpA). The compound is then converted into its stereoisomer (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA via MCE. The isomer is the form required for the stereospecific conversion into propionyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA carboxylase (scpB). The CoA from propionyl-CoA is transferred onto succinate from the citric acid cycle by the propionyl-CoA: succinate CoA transferase (scpC), culminating in the biosynthesis of propionate and succinyl-CoA.
However, even if the conversion is successful it is difficult to verify a successful trial due to limitations in the capacity to detect production of the precursors culminating in the 3HV monomer. An assay that our team has developed to measure the quantity of propionate produced informed by the work of Phechkrajang & Yooyong (2017) was ultimately unsuccessful.
To our joy, we were happy to discover that the Iowa team may have just the answer to our"
Nanjing-China,2015," technologies encounter the problem of sediments which contained a variety of heavy metal such as lead. The combination of our two teams not only identified the significance of collaboration, but could solve some real-life problems as well.
2.SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
This year, we were very close with Nanjing-China team. They are dealing with heavy metal problems through biofilms. When we talked about collaboration, we first thought about binding two projects on seawater desalination field. Thus, we discussed an application with this two project combining. Our team is responsible for explain this application and its supporting fact. Nanjing-China team will explain the details which needs to be discussed to make this working for real.
First, we start with the features of seawater and the end purpose of the combination project. Most of the seawater desalination plant use open-water intake near costal to avoid intake costs. This also means that the factories can’t avoid to deal with different pollutions in costal seawater, including heavy metal pollution.
The main source of coastal heavy metal pollution is runoff and atmospheric sedimentation. From 2006 to 2007, Oceanic Administration of People’s Republic of China did a massive-scale offshore detection for water condition. In its report, the concentration of lead, copper, zinc and mercury in seawater which is over the first seawater class at some monitoring spots. Among them, average lead concentration in the Bohai Sea is over the first seawater class, and some of the monitoring spot detect a number over the second seawater class. The natural degradation of heavy metal is very difficult. Also, the offshore is relatively big water body which makes the pollution hard to increase as well as decrease. Overall, the heavy metal pollution of Chinese offshore cannot be overlook when we use seawater as material.
In normal desalination process, even normal resource water has to go through some sedimentation processes. In fact, one of the safety concern of general seawater desalination is what do we do with those sediments. The idea of cooperating two project is to merge Nanjing-China team’s project to achieve a new seawater recovery and utilizing system.
The word “circular economy” should be familiar to most people. In China, this is one of the guiding ideology for the economic and society development. The core of the concept is to maintain the balance between resource and waste. To balance the rapid consumption of resource, man should not only depend on nature but also ourselves to turn wastes into resources.
Unlike water has a strong nature balance itself, heavy-metal’s nature circulation is much slower. We need to use"
UESTC-software,2016," feel different styles of presentation. We exchanged the final preparation for the competition, discussed the summary of the achievement, and found the problems existing in many aspects.

The new collaboration, the new harvest
Significantly, it was our first time to contact with Nanjing-China. We learned from their indefatigable efforts. They were willing to cooperate with other teams and visit different universities to make improvement. They focused on public awareness about the spread of synthetic biology knowledge. We are making the same effort.
Fig.14. The introduction from Nanjing-China
The meet-up was held on the basis of project’s completion, so we inspired each other in all aspects. With such a good platform for collaboration, we can help others and improve ourselves at the same time, become less blind and less helpless. We got the inspiration from sharing, and we attained the courage from communicating. We would like to thank TMMU_China to design primer for the DNA sequences generated by Bio101. Their efforts provided basis for synthesizing DNA sequences.
What we harvest from the collaboration
Through all the collaborations we have taken part in, we learned a lot and shared happiness. We knew collaboration, competition and communication deeper and better. What we acquired was not only about the iGEM competition itself, we made friends and expanded our eyesight. We communicated face to face to understand what they did and let them know what we are doing, through which we improved our own abilities. And we encouraged and competed each other to hold on the scientific trip, which made us know about the importance of the competitors and collaborators to scientific workers. All these memories will be a unique part of iGEM experience as well as our scientific life experience.

DTU-Denmark,2018," most of the DTU Biobuilders team went to Lund in Sweden, where the team from Lund University had invited us to the annual Nordic iGEM conference (NiC) together with all the other Nordic teams. The weekend was filled with iGEM related events, such as workshops on how to effectively communicate and work in a team, and a workshop about the possibilities of bioinformatics. However, most of the weekend was spent connecting with the other iGEM teams and hearing about their projects in a mini-jamboree, where we all participated in poster and presentation sessions.

Nagahama,2017," to express more mRNA, we found that it would be better to turn into high activity of terminator. This was useful information for our project. We advised team Gifu about the selection marker of S. cerevisiae. Since Gifu seemed to be suffering from S. cerevisiae selection marker to be used, we suggested that we used genetic markers.
Furthermore, we discussed the matter regarding the safety and law concerning experiments and GMO. We taught mutually regulations on the handling of genetically recombined organisms. Gifu presentated about bio-safety.

Botchan_Lab_Tokyo
Botchan_Lab_Tokyo was founded last year and It is an iGEM team of Tokyo University of Science, a private university in Japan that participated in this year's first iGEM. Team Nagahama is one of the few private university teams in Japanese iGEM team. We helped each other. At iGEM Japan Kansai Forum , we were the only private university iGEM team, so we advised on how to set up funds at the time of group establishment, acquisition of funds, operation method etc. as the team of the same private university. We also taught how to write a wiki.In addition, We responded to the questionnaire that Botchan_Lab_Tokyo performed. This questionnaire was necessary as an appeal for Botchan_Lab_Tokyo to be allowed to participate in iGEM. There was a question such as whether I think it is a good experience to participate in iGEM .
Botchan_Lab_Tokyo has earned funds through Crowd Funding before us and has been collecting support beyond the target amount and making it succeed. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8JKakFLY7TYsYukTtGmsDGoeiY1lvAFV5h1YIyR2ipn-MiA/viewform

The 2018 Leiden IGEM team showed that nalidixic acid, an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections, induces cellular stress within bacteria. They hypothesized that this similar stress response might translate into mammalian systems as well.
Therefore, we collaborated with Leiden by testing four concentrations (0µM, 1µM, 5µM, 25µM and 100µM) of nalidixic acid addition in CHO DG44 cells transfected with our family of metallothionein (MT) promoters. As we described in our design page the MT1 promoter and and variations of the MT2 promoter have all been shown to activate transcription in response to cellular stresses.

MT1 - derived from Mus musculus 305bp, MT2 full - taken from HEK293T cell line 381bp, MT2 - 59bp promoter fragment as described by Santos, Anderson K. et al[1] .

CHO DG44 cells were transfected with pcDNA+eGFP plasmid MT promoter derivatives using the vender supplied lipofectamine 3000 protocol. Twelve hours after transfection cells were exposed to varying nalidixic acid concentrations (0µM, 1µM, 5µM, 25µM and 100µM) and varying H2O"
Toulouse,2015," it increases tremendously at the end of it, leading to the death of the colonies during fall or winter.
Needless to say, this infestation has a financial impact, be it because of a decreased honey yield when it is sold, or because of the necessity of buying treatments or even new swarms.  ¾ of beekeepers say they are affected financially by this mite.
Measures against varroa and their efficiency:
Beekeepers use different kinds of methods in the fight against varroa: physical methods such as a wire-mesh floor or the destruction of male broods (preferentially infested by varroas), chemical methods with products like apivar, amitraz, formic and oxalic acids, or essential oils, and finally the genetic selection of resistant bee strains.
Need These diverse methods are more or less efficient. The most efficient of the treatments are the chemical ones, but this efficiency is never 100%.
Description of treatments, pros and cons:

Residual product in the honey
Essential oils: vetiver, lavander, thymul…
Organic product, no identified toxicity
No identified disadvantages
Apistan
Easy to use, does not cause death of the bees
Necessity to wear gloves while using it
Apivar
Recommended by some beekeeping trainers
Necessity to wear gloves while using it
Some beekeepers believe they don’t have enough perspective to estimate this impact. Furthermore, since most of them are amateurs honey production is not their first object. They are more concerned about the welfare of bees as pollinators.
This being said, we can state that honey quality is not affected by most products since they are used after the harvest and have enough time to disappear from the hive before the following year’s harvest.
On the other hand, production is affected in the sense that an insufficiently treated beehive will have a population too small to effectively make honey. The size of the colony is linked to the harvest. If the queen lays a lot of eggs but varroas are numerous and weaken the new bees, the colony will weaken and will not be able to gather a lot of pollen to make honey.

Since we have continuously met obstacles on transformation, we exchanged views ASTWS-China as well as HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, eliminating the possibilities derived from operating errors and found the cause of the problem might be our E. coli competent cells. Moreover, when we asked help from undergraduate team ZJU-China, who are representing Zhejiang University, they offered us not only their distribution kits and commercial competent cells, but also an experimental operation training in their lab to make sure we solve this problem.

iGEM MeetUps
Organised: Spanish MeetUp 2018
This iGEM season has been great, specially in our country, being the year with more teams registered in           iGEM. There are five spanish iGEM teams this year, one of them BG-Navarra, formed by High School Students.           UPF_CRG_Barcelona arranged an Spanish MeetUp from 18th to 20th August in Barcelona Biomedical Research Park           (PRBB). If anyone wants to check the program, find itind it here .
Four teams assisted to the Spanish Meetup, BioIQS-Barcelona, OLM-Madrid, BG_Navarra and Grenoble-Alpes. We           held presentations to prepare for the Giant Jamboree, we organized workshops in order to discuss doubts and           problems that an iGEM team can face in Spain and finally we assisted to lectures from researchers in the           PRBB. The lectures were given out by Professor Jordi García-Ojalvo (Dynamical Systems Biology Lab), PhD Núria           Conde (Complex Systems Lab and DIY BioBCN) and Professor Marc Güell (Translational Synthetic Biology Lab).           Finally, we skyped with the european iGEM ambassador, Thea Chrysostomou.
We also combined some inter-team building between the scientific events. For example, we played beach           volleyball, we did a tour around the beautiful city of Barcelona and we hiked up to the Air Bunkers in           Barcelona to observe the stars and get a fantastic stars-master class by the Instructor of BG-Navarra team.           For our team, holding the meetUp was a great experience in order to get to know the other teams, enrich our           knowledge and share concerns and worries about the iGEM competition.

Duke,2017," field of science. It's important we create a discourse within our community aimed at making us all more self-aware and conscientious towards the societal impacts of our work so that the power of bioengineering is in responsible hands. Also, everyone needs a good meme now and then to get through a long day of lab work! In order to meet these needs, Duke iGEM started r/iGEM_Exchange as a place to share ideas and to discuss critical issues related to our field.

This year, we built a YouTube channel. This channel's main goal is to educate the iGEM community about different techniques but also to show newcomers to our community what it is like to be a young researchers. With help from schools like Oxford, UW Seattle, Gaston Day, and East Chapel Hill High School we had many guest stars on our channel to help us teach different protocols as well as to share their perspective on iGEM and synthetic biology.

BNU-China,2018," number of the plasmid, we can present the following equations:
Furthermore, we know that there is an equilibrium in the process of NcrB binding with Ni, which can be stated as follows:
Combine 2.1 2.2 2.3, and we can have:
As is proposed above, LI is linearly dependent on the number of free state promoter. That is to say,
Substitute 2.4 into 2.5, we can get the following equation:
Further substitute 2.6 into 1.4, now we have obtained the final expression of LI, in which time and the concentration of Ni2+ are the variables.
discussion
1. Luminescence intensity versus time curve with a constant concentration of Ni2+ ions
According to the relevant data in the literature and obtained by experimental measurements, we roughly made a function image of the brightness signal as a function of time, and the image is as follows.
From the above figure, we can see that the intensity of luminescence increases with time. When the time is longer, the intensity of luminescence will gradually become a fixed value, that is,.
2. Relationship between final luminescence intensity and Ni2+ ion concentration
From the above figure, it is not difficult to see that as the concentration of Ni2+ continues to rise, the final luminescence intensity is also increasing, and according to the formula derived above, this is a linear function relationship, which means that the linear response of luminescence intensity to Ni2+ concentration can be achieved by this system.
HBUT-China: Experimentg
Overview
Bioengineering uses stable, highly productive mutants, target strains, which contain foreign genes. However, screening these mutants costs vast time and workforce, and it is difficult to avoid using antibiotics. The  philosophy of our team is to use salicylic acid to induce glucose dehydrogenase expression to enhance the strain's pentose phosphate pathway, giving the strain a growth advantage. EmrR protein can inhibit the role of the downstream promoter PemrR, so that the gene downstream of PemrR can not be expressed, but salicylic acid (SA) can bind to emrR to eliminate this inhibition. Our team sets the gene of PemrR downstream to gdh, using SA to control this route. After the our team replaced gdh with mCherry, HUBT-China helped us induce the expression of mCherry by SA, measured its fluorescence intensity to determine the optimal concentration induced by SA and the optimal induction time at the optimal"

William and Mary Team
Transforming & Fluorescence
As part of their project, the William and Mary (W&M) iGEM Team were imaging cells expressing a variety of fluorescent proteins, including RFP, CFP, GFP, and YFP. Their constructs are being used for the Interlab Measurement study. As part of the measurement track the W&M team assembled fluorescent constructs, and measured and reported their fluorescence. The samples were sent to us to confirm the correct assembly of the parts by validating their fluorescence. Their interest in seeing how their constructs performed (in terms of fluorescent output) perfectly matched our own need to test OpenScope on cell samples rather than fluorescent beads. In addition, optical components were obtained to extend our imaging capabilities to both GFP and RFP. In particular, RFP imaging has not been tested previously.
The W&M team were kind enough to send us dried DNA samples containing constructs for GFP and RFP expression in E. coli. Details on the protocols used to resuspend the DNA and to transform the cells can be found below.
Transformation Protocol
Context

A great and important part of the iGEM competition is the so-called iGEM spirit. For this, we are encouraged to work together with other iGEM teams worldwide to build up an international network of well educated and highly motivated young scientists. It was really great to get in contact with all the iGEMers we met this year. Every one of you helped us a lot with our project and some things wouldn't even be possible without the support of other teams. Some of the initial work-based relationships even grew to friendships that we don't want to miss anymore.
Even if there is no separate text about your team, be safe that it was a pleasure for us to share this iGEM year with you.
Collaboration with iGEM Stockholm
In September, five of our team members visited iGEM Stockholm in efforts to motivate and inspire new students to apply for the iGEM team Stockholm next year during their recruitment event. Thereafter, iGEM Stockholm and our team presented our projects, and exchanged constructive feedback to further enhance. To this event we also invited a class from Johanna-Geissmar-Gymnasium (high school) from Mannheim, Germany. The most essential advice iGEM Stockholm suggested was moving the linked fluorophores in closer proximity to the proteases in order for the detection system to work correctly. We also asked iGEM Stockholm for their insight on how to restructure our team and recruitment process to further increase the quality of our program.

Collaboration with iGEM Dresden
iGEM goes green is a project with the goal to not just make lab work more green, but also to motivate iGEM participants to think more sustainable in their daily life.
When we heard about the initiative created by TU Dresden, we were immediately interested in the concept and wanted to take part in it. So, with their iGEM goes green guide in mind, we started to make subtle changes in our lab. From implementing reusable inoculating loops to acquiring an electricity meter for measuring our power consumption, we learned that even small things can make a difference. Even when we were not actively searching for these changes, the thought of iGEM goes"

From August 26th to 29th, our team held the 4th Conference of the China iGEMer Community (CCiC) as             the co-organizer in FAFU. Our instructors, Lou Chunbo and Zhang Haoqian both gave talks during the opening             ceremony. They shared their iGEM experiences, raised some problems faced by iGEM and synthetic biology, and             encouraged us to work more and try to deal with them. Two members of our team attended the conference and             performed well in the presentation and poster section. Additionally, our members gave a special talk about             the Synbio Wiki (know more in Human Practice session) initiated this year by our team, which received a great response.             Through the four-day communication with other teams, we got a lot of excellent suggestions about our project             and SynbioWiki, and gave some help to them, too.

Interact With Undergraduate Teams
As the host, our team communicated with quite a lot of undergraduate teams from China during the             competition.
In June, our team instructor visited and communicated with SCAU, SYSU, SCUT, TJU and TUST. During                     the meeting, we exchanged our project ideas with them, and as one of the first iGEM teams in China,                     Peking iGEM is also taking on a responsibility to help and guide other young contestants.

This year we kept in touch with SUSTech_Shenzhen team. We came to visit their team and talked about our projects and problems we met. Later we were invited to visit their lab, and they shared their electron microscope with us as soon as we required it. They also gave us suggestions on downstream of our projects like fungal fermentation and model design. We characterized the part together and made sure the sequence of Biobrick part is correct.
SSTi-SZGD
Prior to last year’s collaboration, this year we had an even stronger collaborating relationship with SSTI-SZGD team. At an early stage of our project, we encountered some problems in the transformation of Bacillus subtilis strain. We had previous experience working with Bacillus species, so we set up a meeting to help them with the transformation as well as technical trouble shooting. They did manage to successfully transform our B.subtilis 168 based on their suggestions. In the later stage of protein purification step, we also lend a vacuum pump to them to be used in affinity chromatography.
In return, SSTI-SZGD helped us by sharing our iGEM Interlab kits as they ran out some of the key materials in their experiment. By providing silica Beads and Fluorescein Sodium Salt, we were able to finish their Interlab project on time. Additionally, they helped us promote our Mini Program by sharing the process of their team project on their program and giving us detailed feedback after using it.
Reference can be seen in the site of Collaboration site of SSTI-SZGD.
OUC-China
This year we collaborated with OUC-China in our public engagement. OUC-China made a 13 language translated comic book E.coli spacebook. We contacted them and asked for Chinese and English versions for our science popularization in Yueliangwan Primary School, with their supply, students at the primary school had a better understanding of synthetic biology. Reciprocally, we gave them a detailed feedback and suggestion on improving the logic of the whole story.

May Festival
On the 14th and 15th October, 2016, we ran a booth at school festival in the University of Tokyo, named  ""May Festival"", in collaboration with four iGEM teams in Japan;
Tokyo-Tech, Kyoto, Gifu and KAIT.  Almost 150,000 visitors came to this festival, and we had a good opportunity to explain synthetic biology and our project to them. At the same time, each team gave some advice on the other teams' project.

University of Freiburg
In the context of developing novel technologies for diseases diagnostics, we contacted Freiburg iGEM team who are developing a DNA Microarray to screen for several different diseases at the same time. Their project is based on the coating of a nickel surface with a certain disease antigen and the binding to the antibodies of a patient’s serum. In our collaboration, we have sent the team in Freiburg His-tagged HER-2 affibody molecules, a strong molecular binder for the breast cancer antigen. This will allow to screen directly for currently present antigens in the patient as the indirect detection via serum antibodies can also give false positive results due to old infections.
ETH Zürich
The project of ETH Zürich is in the field of cancer cell detection. Apart from several fruitful Skype conversations in which both groups have been helping each other with advice and reflections, we have also established a scientific collaboration. We characterized six of Zürich's biobricks which are different lactate sensing circuits. We tested the circuit with pure lactate and looked at their GFP production in response to increasing lactate concentrations (0.125-160 mM). In return, the iGEM Group ETH Zürich offered to investigate on binding capacity of our BAR expressing TOP10 strains to HER-2 expressing cancer cells (SK-BR-3). The attached E.Coli were also expressing genomic GFP. Hence, using confocal fluorescence microscopy, they tried to image BAR-expressing cells at the outside of HER-2 cells.
Testing our three BAR expressing constructs (BAR1 (BBa_K17009), BAR2 (BBa_K1766010) and BAR3 (BBa_K1766011)) for their binding capacity towards HER-2 expressing breast cancer cells. BAR expression was initiated by ITPG induction.
In their attempt to visualize BAR expressing bacteria attached at the surface of SK-BR-3 cells, they tried to co-transform our bacteria with a plasmid expressing continuously GFP. However, this unfortunately failed. Even transforming E.Coli, which are stably expressing GFP with our BAR-containing plasmid seem to be ineffective. The iGEM Team ETH Zurich visualized the HER-2 expressing cells together with IPTG induced or non-induced bacteria. The results obtained due to inefficient contrast of bacteria and background remained elusive (see figure above). We hope that the increased presence of IPTG-induced bacteria in comparison to non-induced bacteria might be a sign for an increased retain"

As shown from the above bar charts, F3’H and FNS genes level is confirmed. While this is expected for the F3’H gene, for its blue light repressible promoter acting like a constitutive one in dark conditions, FNS gene under pBAD promoter shows expression even without arabinose induction.
It is worth to notice that the RT-PCR efficiency might be different for different genes due to the sizes of their PCR products and that the formula used above is assuming the PCR efficiency to be 100% that eventually resulted in 2 copies of products.
 How They Helped Us?
We appreciate and thank Team NUS_Singapore-A in helping us by validating the construct in our adenine base editing project. With only growth on Kanamycin when both plasmids were induced, they verified that our system works as proposed and regulation of these two plasmids is indeed tight.  The detailed experimental procedure can be found here.

This year, in our collaboration with Macquarie University Australia, We performed qPCR measurement for two of their constructs to verify plasmid gene expression profile upon IPTG induction. In return, we leveraged upon their protein purification and analysis technique to perform an EMSA shift in hope of observing improved DNA or gRNA binding by our improved tCas9 variants. Two improved variants with site-specific mutations were sent for analysis – Rec2_HNH 5_6_10_15 HNH-pK and 3ple 5_6_10_15 HNH-pK. Following figures show the results they obtained.
Constructs were tested against their unimproved variants (without 5_6_10_15 HNH-pK). Results were depicted as protein gel (bright green) overlaid against nucleic acid gel (black). Results indicate that all tested tCas9 binds to target DNA efficiently. Further repeats should be done with normalized, high"

Overview
Knowing that collaboration is the tenet of iGEM competition, this year we have collaborated with three iGEM teams, a high school team (SHSBNU-China) and two undergraduate teams (Tsinghua-A, Peking). By collaborating with these four iGEM teams, we can seek out help whenever needed and receive prompt feedback about our project design and Wiki contents.
Collaboration with team Tsinghua-A
Having been known each other for a long time, we were quite thrilled to reach out to our old friends Zhaojian Wang, Shuailin Li, Chenhao Wang, Chi Zhang and Wanlin He, five team members from Team Tsinghua A, and form a very healthy and constructive relationship with them. In retrospect, it turned out to be a very worthy journey with them.
During the brainstorming stage, we shared our ideas to each other and got useful suggestions to modify details. And whenever we got results, whether positive or negative, we would discuss and analysis together.
Their team consists of students from school of life science or department of automation. With friends majoring in life science we could talk about strategy and technology in wet lab works, while with those from department of automation in their team, we could exchange experiment in terms of math and modeling.
Zhaojian and Chenhao, with excellent social skills, were able to get in touch with many other iGEM teams and invite them to Tsinghua University. Zhaojian always shared the information with us and communicated with them together. Additionally, Zhaojian took great photos during communications.
Thanks Team Tsinghua-A! we fight together. University’s Biotechnology Building has seen the two teams spend entire summer vacation in the lab for their project and force their ways out towards light and truth together. A day usually started with two teams’ early morning greetings at the building hall and ended up with “goodbye” in the evening. The way back to dorm listened the bitter and sweet they shared with each other. What a great scene we created. What a goal we have been always chasing after. In the future, we would really look forward to creating more memories with them.

A joy that's shared is a joy made double
The milk to our coffee
Working together is especially important in a scientific context - when it comes to iGEM it is indispensable. This year collaborations with three teams came about, the first being Team Düsseldorf, which take part in iGEM for the first time, and the others being Team Freiburg and Team Lethbridge.
Take a look at our collaborations!
Düsseldorf
One partner we frequently collaborated with was the fellow iGEM team Düsseldorf . They are the very first team from the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf so naturally they had a lot of questions on how to get started in iGEM.
We were asked if we could help them on getting started and so we invited them to Bielefeld to answer their questions and aside from that, cake. Topics we discussed were Gibson assembly, Biobrick assembly, Sponsoring and many more. We met again at the German iGEM meet up in Marburg and stayed in touch. This lead to our participation in Düsseldorfs postcard initiative to spread knowledge on synthetic biology where we submitted our own design.
They also invited us to the NRW- day where we"

(We helped Shenzhen_SFLS with part of their modeling, and there're the results)
    We have acknowledged that one Ab with wAg + one Ag coming into one Ab with Ag and one wAg is irreversible and the amount of this kind of changes is related to the amount of Ab with wAg(x2) , the amount of Ag (x1) and time.
According to Volterra Model,we can know that ‘dx1/dt=dx2/dt=-k*x1*x2’.
k is a regular value which is related to affinity(f) between one Ab with wAg and one Ag which is defined as p,so we can attain an another equation:’k=pf’.
According to the first equation above,we can know that ‘x2=x1+m’.
We assume that the inchoate value of x1 is x0.
‘dx1/dt=dx2/dt=-k*x1*x2’
’k=pf’
‘x2=x1+m’
‘x1(0)=x0’
And the program code of matlab is:
dsolve('Dx1=-p*f*x1*(x1+m)','x1(0)=x0','t')
ans =
m/(exp(m*(log((m + x0)/x0)/m + f*p*t)) - 1)
x1= m/(exp(m*(log((m + x0)/x0)/m + f*p*t)) - 1)
We can define the extend of combination as E.
‘E=(x0-x1)/x1’ which is simplified as ‘E=1- m/((exp(m*(log((m + x0)/x0)/m + f*p*t)) - 1)*x0)’

University of Ottawa
We worked with the University of Ottawa in the design of a deterministic ODE model to describe their inducible switch. We assisted them in implementing their model in MATLAB and analyzing it with phase plane and bifurcation analysis in pursuit of tri-stability. To see the University of Ottawa's models, click here .
University of Virginia
During the summer, we received a request from the University of Virginia:
""We have designed an online survey to gauge acceptance and understanding of synthetic biology by the general public.  We hope that global distribution of and participation in this survey will allow for more targeted public education efforts in the human practices component of the iGEM competition.  Participation would involve going to a public place and approaching pedestrians to fill out the short survey.""
We were happy to help and collected responses on their behalf. We received the following badge for our help:

Laboratory equipment and minor collaborations
After meeting other teams at the UK meetup, we connected with the London teams and offered help whenever we could. Some of the main things we want to mention are the materials that we exchanged with the King’s college team (96 well plates for fluorescence readings for the InterLab study) and UCL, who saved us during the last days before DNA submission by providing us with their BL21 Strain of E. coli for the protein characterisation experiments.

We participated in several collaborations with teams from Europe and South America. The iGEM team from Marburg carried out an InterLab study with Vibrio           natriegens to show the potential of this organism to increase the speed at which new findings in synthetic biology can be generated. Another collaboration we had was with the Unesp Brazil team. Thanks to our experience with modeling we were happy to help them improve on their own modelling part. Finally, we had a collaboration with the iGEM team from Utrecht . They engineered the Tar receptor to establish different sensing thresholds. The intellectual exchange helped us to improve on our own project.

This year, students in School of Life Sciences, Shandong University forms a brand new team. As as an old team that has been participating in iGEM competition for 8 years, OUC-China is very willing to help SDU-China. At the beginning of the team formation, they came to ocean university of China and asked for help. We explained the process of the iGEM competition to them in detail and remind them some important deadlines. For their project, we gave them some pertinent suggestions. For practice activities, during the summer vacation, we invited them and held a summer camp for high school students in order to popularize life science and synthetic biology. Members of SDU-China explained to the campers how to make insect specimens.

TEAM NTU-SINGAPORE: WETLAB CHARACTERIZATIONS
With Team NTU just being next door in sunny Singapore, how could we not collaborate with them? Both teams first met in our SG iGEM Meetup, and we subsequently met up several times to finalise our collaboration plans.
Team NTU made a trip down to the BioMakerSpace for discussion!
NUSGEM helped Team NTU in 2 ways. Firstly, we gave them some CoE1 plasmids. Secondly, we validated their Adenine Base Editing project. We co-transformed 2 plasmids into the strain, sgRNA Kan* plasmid and ABE-dCas9 plasmid, and validated the constructs under 4 different inducer conditions: No inducer, IPTG, Arabinose, IPTG+Arabinose. Their system has the following proposed working mechanism: sgRNA Kan*, induced by IPTG, is a construct with a mutated kanamycin gene attached to sgRNA, while ABE-dCas9, induced by arabinose, is capable of editing and correcting the mutation on Kan* to restore the plasmid’s antibiotic (kanamycin) resistance.
The editor system is only supposed to work when both IPTG and Arabinose are present, as both SgRNA and dCas9 must be induced. SgRNA provides a guide sequence to direct dCas9 to target its plasmid, to perform adenine editing on sgRNA Kan*. To demonstrate this, we plated the cells from each condition into 2 types of agar plates with different antibiotics composition, one with kanamycin+gentamycin+chloramphenicol, and the other with gentamycin+chloramphenicol.
Results of our characterisation experiment
Top row: Agar plates with gentamycin+chloramphenicol (control)
Bottom row: kanamycin+gentamycin+chloramphenicol
Left to right: No inducer, IPTG only, Arabinose only, IPTG + Arabinose
We verified that their system works as proposed. As shown in the picture above, only the system induced by both inducers had colonies growing on the agar plate with kanamycin+gentamycin+chloramphenicol, while no colonies were observed for the other 3 induction conditions.
As our labs lack the necessary equipment to conduct RT-qPCR, we were unable to study the level of mRNA expression of our constructs. Fortunately for us, Team NTU is well-versed in this technique, having provided"

In the schools
We made presentations introducing genetic engineering to students of class 11 and 12 (equivalent to high school sophomores and seniors respectively) in 5 different schools across 3 different cities.
Broadly, the presentations had 3 parts:
a. Definitions of some basic terms used in genetic engineering such as gene, promoter, operator, inducer, reporter etc and how to put together these modular components in constructing genetic circuits.
b. A simple, binary framework for quantitatively analyzing the outputs of simple genetic circuits.
c. Introduction to iGEM, our project and some previous years’ projects.
In enhancing the awareness of high school students about genetic engineering and iGEM, most"

Postcard-Collaboration
This year our team had a great opportunity to participate in the postcard exchange campaign initiated by the iGEM Team Cologne-Duesseldorf. Without missing a chance to spread the word about our team’s project and iGEM goes green, we decided to incorporate our enthusiasm coupled with creative imagination to design even two postcards for our team. Our team's postcard with information about the project and a postcard with information about iGEM goes green.
After iGEM Team Cologne-Duesseldorf had taken care of distributing each team's masterpieces all over Europe, we were thrilled to receive from them a package of postcards created by the other 26 European iGEM teams and made sure once more that we took part in a really rewarding and valuable collaboration!
Learning about other iGEM teams’ fascinating projects, we joyfully decorated the main working point of our team with freshly received one-of-a-kind postcards and decided to share them among as many people as possible. Newly arrived TU Dresden students from different corners of the world were happy to find their postcards in the welcoming bags presented them by our university. Moreover, the postcards were shared by our team members with people coming from different backgrounds in their neighborhoods and local university communities.
We would like to thank iGEM Team Cologne-Duesseldorf for the organisation of this campaign and every iGEM team for their participation, creation of amazing postcards and willingness to increase public awareness about iGEM.
Synthetic biology is worth spreading and we are happy that iGEM provides us with the opportunity to do so!

Zhejiang University - China
We are the recipient of ZJU-China's mentorship at the very beginning. Since we are all new to igem, having little experience and very basic knowledge of the correct procedures and protocols we would require to complete their lab work, ZJU-China gave advices on their team building, project design and experimental skills. Also, with primers we designed, ZJU-China helped us construct and standardize a gene that express a fusion protein of three different enzymes linked with EAAAK and GGGGS protein linker.
Furthermore, we have in-depth collaboration in public engagement activities. Together, we experienced TEDxYouth@Hangzhou, the STEM activity at ZAST, interviewed ZFDA officers and provided each other with all our resources.
This year, ZJU-China is focusing on a system and the corresponding workflow for applying biocontrol. Wish them good results!
University of Chinese Academy of Sciences
To be honest, we are a new team. Great thanks to UCAS for paving the way for our newly established team by mentoring us, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting our circuits. In addition, we learnt DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and UCAS helped point-mutating one of our biobricks.
This year,UCAS is focusing on removing the excess nitrogen in pond water. Wish them good results!"

TU Delft's Policy & Practices Research
This year, the 2016 TU Delft iGEM team began a research initiative focused on iGEM’s influence on science, education, and policy. To start, they developed a survey about the 2015 competition and asked other teams to report on their 2015 experiences as a contribution to their research. We gladly participated in this collaboration.
Collaboration with Team Exeter:
Contributing Podcasts
This year, Team Exeter came up with the great idea to produce a podcast series. In the series, entitled ""Desert Island...Science?"" Exeter students interview pioneering researchers whose work is relevant to synthetic biology. The series targets a wide audience, and it aims to inform and inspire those unfamiliar with synthetic biology.  Our team independently decided to conduct video interviews with like figures, and we planned to post these interviews on YouTube.  Ultimately, we decided to pool resources with Team Exeter and help them develop more material for their Soundcloud channel. We have converted our interviews into podcast format and are uploading them to Soundcloud. As a result, our interviews will reach a broader international audience, and the channel will represent international perspectives.

We employed fed-batch fermentation to produce injanus (HGFI), and injanus produced was detected in fermentation broth through HPLC (showed in Figure 1 and Figure 2). The spectra peak of pure injauns appeared around 30-32 mins, which showed the spectra peak appeared at around 33 mins in HPLC profiles of fermentation broth was injauns.

We then analyze the broth though SDS-PAGE and western blot (showed in Figure 3). According to the results, molecule weight of injanus was around 8kDa and the injanus fermentation broth was mainly in two states, monomer and dimer. Dimer injanus binds better with the primary antibody of injanus.
In addition, we compared the production of injanus after fermentation in bioreactor and flask cultivation. The concentration of injanus in broth was measured by UPLC, and the standard curve of concentration with adsorption area of UPLC was measured using pure injanus samples. Figure 4b shows the cell fresh weight and injanus production in different methanol induction days (Figure 4b). After 4 days’ induction, in bioreactor the cell fresh reached 365g/L and in the meantime the injanus density reached 0.3g/L, which was about 10 times the production of injanus in flask cultivation. Results of SDS-PAGE indicated that the production of injanus kept increasing during the 4 day’s induction (Figure. 4a).

Ⅱ. Collaboration with other teams for iShare
IShare is a brand new idea raised up by Nankai Team in 2014. It is an resource-sharing platform aiming at converge all information of experimental materials used by iGEM  teams such as bacterial strain, cell strain, enzymes, plasmids and so on. A fully functional"
Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,"EM in general. It was an educational weekend and we had a lot of fun getting to know the other iGEM teams. The weekend was a great success and gave a great foundation for both collaboration and fun during other meetups and our projects.
Copenhangen
In June, UNIK-Copenhagen hosted the Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC) in Copenhagen. During the weekend, the teams connected and shared their projects with the other Nordic teams. We presented our project at the mini-Jamboree, where the requirements set by iGEM Headquarters were in focus. The mini-Jamboree gave  us the opportunity to get a feel of the big iGEM competition in Boston and refine our projects. Besides the mini-Jamboree and two workshops there was also time for social activities for the participating teams.
Parts improvement
Our biobrick BBa_K2329000 is an improvement of the earlier biobrick part BBa_K740000 from team Tsinghua-A 2012. The improvement of the cre-lox recombinase system was done by changing the loxP site from reversible switch to a non-reversible switch with the help of a mutated form of the LoxP sites. The new mutant loxP sites (lox66 and lox71) have shown great success since the direction of the promoter did not flip back. Read more about the part improvement under Achievements, biobricks .
