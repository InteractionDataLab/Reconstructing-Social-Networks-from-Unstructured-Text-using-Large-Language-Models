Amsterdam
Amsterdam is our most significant collaboration. We skyped together early in the summer and realized that both of our projects had an important connection. The Amsterdam iGEM team worked on making E. coli to produce fumarate, which reduces methane emissions in cattle when fed in certain doses. As a result, the UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team and the Amsterdam iGEM team joined forces to come up with a way to reduce methane emissions. Methane emissions have a huge impact on climate change. UNL and Amsterdam explored the possibilities of feeding fumarate to cattle in order to reduce methane emissions. We can conclude that fumarate is a promising molecule for this application. The result of our collaboration is shown below.
On top of this, Amsterdam was also able to give us comments on our safety case page. Using their suggestions, we further modified our information. Their comments are found below.
“Introduction:
The introduction is actually very clear, it is well written and raises ‘the need’ very well.
Safety Case Units and Structure:
This part is clear as well, except for the actual meaning of a diamond. I don’t see a diamond anywhere. Also the last line of this part could use an extra figure, in which you can see the standard form of what every safety case must have. Actually this is figure 4. I might place it a bit up.
Modularity of Safety Cases for iGEM:
Smart idea. However did you consider the statement: ‘could help change the views of those still skeptical of the safety involved in synthetic biology’ This makes it sound like the safety case is meant to change people's mind instead of making synthetic biology safer. Implicitly saying that the concerns of these people are invalid, I don’t think you want to go into this, since it is quite sensitive. Maybe just leave this sentence out.”
Above is a picture showcasing our successful skype session with the Amsterdam iGEM team.
Methungeny
We collaborated with Methungeny about safety cases and general research questions. They posed us a question about their experiment, and we gave them suggestions on how they could solve their problem. Methungeny’s project aim is to develop a methane biosensor medium which consists of methane-utilizing"
BostonU_HW,2018," no way of making consistent, uniform droplets with the viscous sodium alginate solution. Additionally this chip, like the other
versions, is prone to clogging to due to the mixing of the calcium chloride and sodium alginate solutions, making this chip inefficient to test.
Conclusion
While the chip did not completely work with the final design, we learned about the effects of viscosity on droplet-based microfluidic systems during the four chip iterations and subsequent weeks of testing. If we were to continue this project, the next step would be to perform a more in-depth study of the effects of viscosity on the generation of droplets in microfluidic devices by experimenting with various flow rates and chip geometries.

BostonU Wetlab
Northeastern iGEM (NEGEM)
Our team hosted the Northeastern iGEM Conference (NEGEM) with the BostonU iGEM team. On July 6, 2018, the iGEM teams from Harvard, MIT, UCONN, BostonU Wetlab, and BostonU Hardware teams met at Boston University to present their work and share advice among teams. Each team presented within time constraints of the Jamboree, with 5 minutes allocated to set-up, 20 minutes for the presentation, and 5 minutes for questions. We created feedback forms for each team in order to create a simple and organized method of collecting feedback.
NEGEM gave our teams a great method of obtaining
feedback, networking for potential collaborations and getting Jamboree-like presentation experience.
Serial Dilution
Inspired by the InterLab Study, this series of chips attempts to follow the protocol of running three consecutive 1:20 dilutions followed by a pair of consecutive 1:10 dilutions. These sequences of mixers are then paired with an valve actuated output selection mechanism such that either the third, fourth, or fifth dilutions can be selectively dispensed onto an agar plate. Since the real estate on our desktop CNC milled microfluidic chips is limited, this protocol has been divided into two chips which, when run in tandem, accomplish these specific serial dilutions. The first chip in the system consists of three consecutive mixers, design with flow rates intended to handle the three 1:20 dilutions. The other chip will run the two 1:10 dilutions and the output selection mechanism.
Version 1
This initial chip consists of four inputs, one for the initial sample and the other three are used to dilute that initial sample by adding water."
Warwick,2017," enormously when we came to look at our own Human Practices.
After lunch, everyone travelled across the Thames to meet at the iconic tallest building in the UK – The Shard. This was our contribution to the UK meet and we used it as an opportunity for teams to practice their presentations. As the event took place in mid-August, we were aware that not all teams had finished their research yet, and so teams gave a condensed, 10-minute version of their Jamboree presentation. Once again, this was a great chance for teams to find out what they do well and what they need to work on.
Emzo De Los Santos, a research fellow at the University of Warwick kindly came to give a short talk on how he came to work within the field of Synthetic Biology. His research has both computational and experimental aspects, which is indicative of how interdisciplinary SynBio is. We wrapped up the UK iGEM Meet with cocktails in the Aqua Shard bar, on the 31st floor of The Shard. Taking in the Panoramic views of London was the perfect way to end a very successful and valuable weekend.
The two days were obviously a good way for us all to meet the other teams, talk about synthetic biology and practice our presentations, but there were also lots of opportunities for teams to say ""we need some help with coding"" or ask ""is anyone here a cellulose expert?"". Some of the problems that teams raised were solved there and then, whilst others developed into official collaborations between teams after the event. The collaboration between ourselves, Westminster and UCL in organizing the event provided the perfect opportunity for teams to troubleshoot their projects and gain invaluable advice from their peers.
We hadn’t met either Westminster or UCL before the event, and so we organised the entire meet via Skype sessions and instant messenger alone. We were so pleased when all of our hard work came together, and we got feedback from all of the other attending teams saying that they had had a really enjoyable time and had found the whole weekend to be very useful.
Bristol: iGEM Development Environment (IDE)
As we’re sure that most other teams have found too, Wiki editing can be a real pain. We had played around with making changes early on in the summer, but found it quite frustrating that it wasn’t possible to make real-time changes quickly and easily. You can imagine how relieved we were when Bristol iGEM contacted us with their collaboration proposal… IDE allows local development of your Wiki, which means that edits can be viewed almost instantly by simply refreshing the page.

Cork_Ireland,2015," had a social that evening!
In August this year we had the opportunity to meet up with members of the UCL iGEM Team at the IndieBio Demo Dinner & Summer Party. We also met up with them the following day at Forma labs. We spoke about our projects and planning for the Jamboree. We spoke about London Hackspace and the hacker community in London and the future of Cork's hacker community.

Our first and one of the most important partners that supported us in this project, inviting us to participate in it was the Universidad Mayor, who provided us with their laboratories, classrooms and counseling for teachers and students of the University. We were taught English On line and were an essential support in the management of funding and logistics to get to Boston and participate in the Jamboree.
Another great work was explore national program reporting and assessment of science and technology; that encouraged us to continue to participate in this project.  A program that has as one of its objectives to develop actions that foster communication between the scientific and technological community, the educational community and the public in general, increasing the number of people who increase their assessment of science and technology as a result of their participation in non-formal education.
Our project not could have developed, if CORFO productive development Corporation will not encourage such initiatives, which have the objective of improving competitiveness and productive diversification in the country through the promotion of investment, innovation and entrepreneurship and strengthening capital human and technological capabilities.
Among others we can mention: to the Ministry of education, Ministry of economy, education Corporation of the Queen and Cas Chile enterprise computing;  that it supported with financing."
BostonU_HW,2017," coat PDMS in order to obtain the precise thickness. There was varied success in the beginning, but eventually we were able to get a consistent result. However, after subsequent testing we realized that more research was still needed.
We then reached out to one of the publishers of the paper, Rajeev Ram, who is a professor at MIT University. We wanted to have an up close look at the device after realizing the high level of complexity it took to design and manufacture the chip. We went to visit his lab and see a copy of the microfluidic device as well as the corresponding system that is used to run it. Both teams were provided with valuable insight into the chip’s operation and design after the visit. This allowed us to understand the minimum pieces of the design that needed to be kept in order to maintain the same functionality.
Stage 3
The BostonU Hardware team worked to develop and manufacture a replication of the microfluidic device. Eventually with the help from the Harvard iGEM team we were able to replicate a relatively accurate design of the chips cell culturing chamber. However, when the chip was tested using colored water there was very little success. The fluid was unable to move in a proper clockwise movement and was not able to be displaced fully from any chamber. Progress was eventually stopped due to the lack of hardware resources from last year's project, Neptune.  In order to continue the development of the microfluidic module more work would be needed with programmable syringe pumps.
Stage 4
The last portion of the collaboration was to validate the Harvard iGEM team’s optical density sensor. The BostonU Hardware team developed small scale microfluidic chips in order to test the sensor. However, in order to test the OD sensor, the Harvard iGEM team vapor polished the surface to remove any etchings that was left from the manufacturing process. This aimed to decrease the possibility of inaccuracies that could occur during testing. The Harvard iGEM team came to the BostonU Hardware team’s lab. Check out the Harvard iGEM team's wiki for more information.

We're working closely with the Wellesley HCI software team this year.
In June, we hosted the Wellesley team at BU where we discussed our projects and started planning how we could work together. The following day we visited their campus for a brainstorming session where we started to discuss software tools that our team could use in the wet lab.
The MoClo Planner
The MoClo Planner is a software tool that the Wellesley team has developed that will assign the fusion sites and generate the primers required to utilize the MoClo Assembly method to create genetic devices. In the two brainstorming sessions, our team worked with the Wellesley team to explain and help develop the ideas that led to the implementation of this tool. We also tested the software on July 30th and provided the team with feedback and suggestions for the next stages of the tool's development.
Corporate Collaborations
As we continue collecting characterization data from our flow cytometry experiments, we have been working closely with a group of computer scientists at Raytheon BBN Technologies to help analyze our characterization data.

Aachen- Prediction of mutated Subtilisin E protease
We met with experts from the Technion to help us visualize the Subtilisin E and the photocaged serine in order to obtain insights regarding the structure of the mutated protein.
We contacted iGEM Aachen when we learned their project deals with protein inactivation, as we believed it might correspond with our Intein sub-project. After discussing the details, we concluded that the Intein protein would not be applicable to Aachen's system. Nevertheless, we decided to collaborate on different aspects of our projects.
iGEM Aachen asked us to visualize and model the structure of the Subtilisin E protease, which is mutated with a photo caged serine as part of their project.
After consulting with several professors from the faculty of Biology,  we concluded that it would be impossible to finish this task properly in our time period. As an alternative, we wrote a document describing the steps for an exhaustive computational work, including insights from the comparison of the structures of Subtilisin E and the photo-caged serine. ( View PDF ).
Finally, we constructed a 3D visualization of Subtilisin E adjacent to the photo-caged serine along with the above document. The information we have obtained was highly valuable and helpful to Aachen’s project.
Tar fused to GFP marker
In return, we asked Aachen to build a biobrick consisting of the Tar chemoreceptor fused to a GFP marker.  We provided them all the information necessary for this task ( View PDF ).
Aachen's work was successful, providing us with a valuable result on the importance of a linker domain to connect the Tar receptor and the GFP marker. The work made by Aachen had a major significance to our project and we would like to express our gratitude to the Aachen iGEM team for the valuable scientific work they have done for us.

Apart from working on our project, our team also respect the “iGEM values” very much. We believe that through co-operating with other iGEM teams, we can share our passion and assist each other to create better results.
(1) Lab Work and Modelling Collaborations with City University of Hong Kong
For this collaboration, our team members visited each other’s university and presented our projects with the team members and professors. During the visit, we have reached an agreement on collaboration of which we would help them to do characterization on the expression of the lacZY gene. And they helped us to do a part of the modeling for the application part of our project.
CityU team provided us 2 plasmids for the characterization:
1. Pro LacZY
2. Pro LacZ(control)
Theoretically, only the E. coli containing LacZY would absorb ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (OPNG) which is a lactose analogue. Then the beta-galactosidase produced by the LacZY E. coli would convert the OPNG into galactose and ortho-nitrophenol, which is yellow in colour and absorbs at 420 nm. Therefore we can measure OD420 to monitor the expression of LacZY.
Procedures:
1. Prepare an overnight culture of LacZ and LacZY in E. coli.
2. Measure the OD420 of the overnight culture and dilute it into ~0.5 OD.
3. Add OPNG solution into the sample.
4. Measure OD420 at 20 min intervals.

IISc Bangalore
The team from IISc Bangalore intended to make software for easy counting of cells from Haemocytometer, to remove the errors caused by human counting. To test its efficacy in various environments, they collaborated with different teams to test their software. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the species and followed the protocol provided by IISc Bangalore to grow and measure the number of cells in a haemocytometer. We took the images at 10X and 20X as they required the usage of an air objective. We counted 720 plates and the results are as follows:

What We Offer
HAZU
    (1)We offered them a knockout exercise-induced gene system      The system we provided was a recombination system and its detailed experimental process is from Lv Zhenmei, our teacher in college of life sciences, Zhejiang University.     (2)We shared the data of light control system with them          Due to the situation that ZJU and HAZU all adopt light control system in their projects, we constructed and tested the red light and green light system together and shared the data based on documents written by Jeffrey J Tabor.
FAFU
    We supplemented their incomplete toxicity models. According to their project, we built models in mainly two parts. The first one is about the growth rate of algae. The second one is about the quantity of wrigglers according to time. We built these models in a specific logic: first we built separate models, and then we found their relationship. Finally, we gave FAFU our suggestion and feedback based on our results from modeling which has helped them improve their project (the modeling page) . Also, we helped them with some difficulties that they met when editing their wiki.
What We Receive

Academic conference, meetings, lab work
We are fortunate to have opportunities to work with two iGEM teams of NTHU_Taiwan (Figure 1) and NYMU-Taipei. We worked together for discussing problems we faced and together figured out solutions for improving the protein performance in experiements.  In addition to attending the 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 Taiwan, we have many chances to discuss our iGEM project with these two universities.   Particularly, NYMU-Taipei team gave us lectures which are crucial for us to proceed our project,  gave us technical supports  when we had problems, provided us lab rooms and supervised our lab work."

18th August-19th August UK meetup 2017
Although the two days were predominantly meant for meeting other teams, talking about topics within the field of synthetic biology and practicing our poster / powerpoint presentations, there were lots of opportunities for teams to say ""we need help with modelling"" or ""is anyone an engineer?"". This allowed some of the problems raised were solved to be solved there and then, whilst there were plenty of opportunities for other collaborations to be formed with invited teams The meetup was the perfect opportunity for teams to troubleshoot their projects and gain invaluable advice from peers. Also the debating session made all team members think about the ethics and safety of the field, which could apply to integrated human practices.
27th September 2017 InterLab
As part of their Interlab study, the City of London School high school team had to quantify the fluorescence of their samples, and lacking the equipment in their laboratory, were invited by us to Cavendish campus and we provided their results for them. We also practiced presenting our presentations in front of academics from both institutions as well as their team helping our team create our model and wiki."

This year we continued our cooperation with University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. We helped their team with the cryostat section process, and they returned the favor helping us acquiring RBS sequences and analyzing them.
Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University
We maintained close cooperation with XJTLU-CHINA team since November 2014.Experiences on how our team run the team and recruit were shared and instructions were given to XJTLU-CHINA team. We also noticed them some problems that might trouble them and some important things that they should pay close attention to. Specific document was made to help instruct them when using the iGEM website, including how to search and acquire bio-bricks. Considering the circumstances they were in, we gave our personal advice and answers to their question without reservation.

Modern technology makes information acquisition more convenient, but there is no other way better than face-to-face communication. The conference provided teams with an opportunity to learn about each other. Meaningful exchanges in ideas enhanced the efficiency of problem solving. That’s why we tried our best to make a relaxing and pleasure atmosphere for participants, by providing delicious snacks and conference meals.
Attendance of CCiC helped all the teams acquire both reflections and inspiration from communicating, and improved the projects in the end. All in all, we believe that the conference will make a significant improvement for all CCiC attendees in the Giant Jamboree.
Communications
In addition to the Conference of China iGEMer held by Peking iGEM Team, we also attempted to communicate with other teams by various kinds of activities.
In April of 2015, the iGEM team of Ocean University of China (OUC) came to Peking University to take part in our discussions. At that time, both teams of PKU and OUC just had the core ideas of the project, with many details to be considered. Through the presentation of our idea and the brain storming, their participation has brought us some new ideas.
From May 16th to 17th, ZHANG Haoqian, our team instructor, visited Zhejiang University and gave their iGEM team members a speech about his insights into iGEM. As a predecessor, he shared his iGEM experience with the new iGEM team of Zhejiang University. The subsequent academic exchange between Zhang and the whole team has brought the talks to an end. Besides, having been invited as an instructor for the iGEM teams of several high schools in Hangzhou, he came to Hangzhou Technological Museum to provide theoretical and experimental references for them.

SDSZ-China,2017," initial reactant, instead of UDCA, our expected product. This conundrum                         stopped us from reaching any further into the experiment. At this time, Prof. Xu suggested us to                         separate the two enzymes into two steps. (see figure 2) After listening to his suggestion, our                         team worked together and produced our new experiment plan with a two step reaction instead of                         one. In this way, the end product will not be transformed back into CDCA, and the mass                         production of USCA proves to be successful. As well as enhancing the biopharmaceutical effect of                         UDCA, we also aims to reduce the production cost. When we were designing the experiment, we                         included the usage of cofactors: NADH and NADP+. However, the cost of cofactors can be immense                         if they are not regenerated. After hearing about our problem, Prof. Xu suggested us finding                         enzymes to help with the regeneration of cofactors. With his suggestion in mind, we eventually                         employed GDH(Glutamate Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADP+, and LDH(Lactate                         Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADH. Carefully answering our questions and giving us other valuable information and cases about our topic, Prof. Xu used his actions to encourage us                         in refining our experiment and to give it a try.
Outreach
Contact with Local Hospital and Patients
In addition, we contact local patients from Xuanwu hospital who suffered from liver cirrhosis to                         discuss the curing effects and prices of various UDCA-contained medicines in the market to                         determine our direction. Through our interviews, we understood that current UDCA medicines in                         the market are unaffordable for patients with average or below average income in long term                         treatment. Also, medicine which price can be accepted by the patients has relatively weak curing                         effect. In order to solve this problem, we consulted experts from doctors from Xuanwu Hospital.                         She reported that UDCA has a large pharmaceutical application. As well as UDCA’s usage in                         dissolving gallstone, its efficacy in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing                         cholangitis (PSC) as an adjunct to medical therapy has been well established. Newer indications                         include its use in the management of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, post liver transplant                         rejection, graft-versus-host disease and acute viral hepatitis, where it not only relieves                         symptoms of cholestasis but also arrests ongoing hepatocyte necrosis.

Q：Hi, how are you"
Manchester,2017," in Asia (Japan, Indonesia, and Korea) and Canada, ministries and departments are responsible for enforcing the laws of GMMs. The kinds of ministries enforcing the laws as well as their numbers vary from country to country, but usually the large organizations are in charge.
On the other hand, countries like India, Brazil, the United States, and Australia have more specialied committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.
In the European Union, the European Commission is responsible for enforcing the GMO laws to be followed by all member countries. Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology, but has responsible institutions when commercing or trading.
*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*
Stemming from research from the University of Virginia and EMBO, the J. Craig Venter Policy Center Team has concluded that the United States lack an agency that specifically focuses on enforcing laws regarding GMMs. Instead, there is legislation such as the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology and the President's Commission for studying Bio-ethical issues, which was established by Barack Obama. As of now, the regulatory agency with the most regulatory control on issues regarding synthetic biology is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
In accordance with Foods and Drugs Act, Health Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment Canada are the administrative branches responsible for the regulation of products derived from biotechnology. Health Canada’s role is to enforce standards for safety and nutritional quality of all foods sold in Canada. It works under the Foods and Drugs Act. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) role is to minimize diseases and other public health hazards that could potentially be caused by the food supply system. Fisheries and Oceans Canada role is to regulate Canadian fisheries, oceans and freshwater resources. This joint effort helps ensure that informed decisions regarding GMMs by pooling the expertise and considerations of each agency together.
European Commission is the institution responsible for proposing and implementing legislations applying to all member countries. Member countries may additionally restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMMs in their territory. This possibility, however, is regulated by Directive (EU) 2015/412 adopted by the EU.
In Australia, the use of GMMs is regulated under a nationwide legislative framework consisting of two main branches: the Gene Technology Regulator and Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ). Individual states and territories also have their own legislation in accordance with this framework.
In Brazil, the Biosafety Law (Law 11105/05) sets the safety rules"

The University of Nebraska-Lincoln team and Tec-Chihuahua team collaboration goes back to the beginning of the summer. We first presented our projects to each other to get to know us a little better. Later on, the UNL team asked us to share their General Public Survey to get to know Mexican opinion. We ended up video calling to officially meet each other and got a great feedback on our projects.
Leuven's Central Hub
Did you know there are more than six thousand languages around the world? Some of them are widely spoken, like Mandarin, Chinese or English, while some others are less spoken, like Tarahumara and Náhuatl in Mexico. In iGEM’s Tec-Chihuahua, we are in favor of diversity because we are sure every language is singular: in composition and expression.   With this in mind, and with iGEM KU Leuven team initiative, we participated in the multiple collaboration of the Central Hub: a platform in where more than a dozen iGEM teams share project descriptions to be translated into ten different languages.  We translated several teams project descriptions to our native language: Spanish; at the time, our description was translated into ten different languages.

What’s more, we exchanged our ideas about Human Practice in the areas of education and public engagement.
A Video about Biosafety Level By communicating with BGIC-Union, we decided to cooperate with them to produce a video about biosafety level. In order to contact and discuss the issue at any time, two groups formed a WeChat group. After               looking for a lot of information and revisions, we set up a transcript of text and pictures and translated the English version.

On July 10, 2017, we held a diminutive meet up in Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) with their team. At that time, we were informed that our previous project about treating Trichophyton rubrum infection by defensins had               a low feasibility. We then got the chance to discuss the project with Prof. Hongmin Zhang, an instructor of SUSTech_China, and asked for some questions about expressing a mutated defensins in bacteria.

Collaborations
This year, we had the honor of collaborating with three other iGEM teams to work together across the world to push forward our own project’s goals as well as theirs. We collaborated with the Munich United iGEM team, by completing their assessment as they try to figure out what factors play a role in hindering or pushing forward entrepreneurship in the biotechnology industry. The Cornell iGEM Team has recently focused heavily on business and entrepreneurship as a way to effectively and efficiently design a product that would meet our predicted consumer’s needs. Thus, we felt heavily invested in the Munich United iGEM Team’s research, as we hope that they will be able to identify factors that could be restricting our ideas as well as hundreds of start-ups.
Another iGEM team we collaborated with was the VIrginia iGEM Team and their mission to analyze awareness and use of biocontainment. We also felt that our input would be valuable to their research, as we considered biocontainment options but decided that the most feasible option would be to physically contain our biological organisms in the laboratory. Finally, we collaborated with the Cambridge iGEM Team. We were inspired by their incredible project last year of 3D printing a microscope and decided to include into our endeavor this year a 3D printed microscope to detect mastitis and bring the laboratory to the hands of dairy farmers. We are grateful for their help and the opportunity to collaborate with all the these teams!"
TU_Darmstadt,2016," iGEM Göttingen
The iGEM team from Göttingen helped us testing the cytotoxic activity of miniColicin in other organisms than E. coli. Shimwellia blattae was transformed with miniColicin without mutation (\(\text{mCol}_{\text{WT}}\)) and with mutation (C266A) \(\text{mCol}_{\text{Mut}}\) under control of the T7 promoter (BioBrick BBa_K525998 ) on the BioBrick backbone pSB1A3. Previously, the \(\text{mCol}_{\text{WT}}\) construct seemed to show a significant cytotoxic activity in E. coli, even without induction of protein expression. We sent Patrick (Team Leader of the killswitch team) to Göttingen and he was in their lab to carry out all the experiments. It was a great experience to work in another lab and we learned a lot about the iGEM team Göttingen and how they are structured. Of course, there were also some social events which leads to us and iGEM Göttingen stay in contact and visiting each other. Thank you for this great exchange!
The Shimwellia blattae cells were transformed via electroporation with the miniColicin variants and cultivated on LB-Agar plates supplied with ampicillin. This procedure was performed twice. In order to ensure that pSB1A3 is suitable for amplification in Shimwellia blattae, original pSB1A3 was also tested.
No significant difference in colony amount on each LB-Agar plate was obseverd between the two Minicolicin constructs: \(\text{mCol}_{\text{WT}}\) transformed cells yielded \(220\pm20\) colonies and \(\text{mCol}_{\text{Mut}}\) cells yielded \(200\pm50\) colonies (mean of the dublicate with standard deviation).
Collaboration with TU Munich and LMU Munich
One part of our robot is a do-it-yourself syringe pump which we constructed and 3D printed on our own. Also the iGEM team of Munich had the idea to work with syringe pumps . They want to construct a feature to easily upgrade a 3D printer to a bio printer. The essential part for this transformation is a syringe pump, they constructed. Since our robot basis is a 3D printer and we also use a syringe pump it was natural to work together. Munich sent us their system and we printed the"
TJU_China,2018," teams are in the same university. So, how can we miss the opportunity of collaborating with each other?!
There are too many biobricks this year, and the plasmid pSB1C3 used as vector always run out since only one man in         our group is in charge of this. It was very kind of Members from Tianjin that they helped us provide the backbone,         which ensured that we can complete so many biobricks we have.
Also, for response, we helped them compare the degradation of the origin with improved NanoLuc in 3 hours, and prove         the newly constructed NanoLucPEST could work effectively in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeBY4741.
Secondly, though not in the same university, the IGEM team of Nankai’s school of life science is the closest team         with us, only around 20 minutes’ walk. Therefore, there is no reason we don’t show up in the collaboration hosted         by them. There are nine teams together who communicated with each other on projects and individual advices or suggestions.

To tell the truth, we are a little surprised that the number of girls are about two times than that of boys in our University where the population of boys are three times than that of girls. We know that girls like beautiful pictures, and that is why we took part in this collaboration. The Bulgaria team has a tradition to take photos of every place they visit—together or part of them. That’s why they spread their idea for this collaboration. We took photos at some special places in our school and describe of the places.
Figure 5.Our school is the first college in China, which was established in 1895. Every year the school of life science takes part in the IGEM competition, and this year, we decided to do the “magic scissors”(the CRISPR-Cas system). This is a photo of the team members and our school’s monument, which is memorable to all of us.
Figure 6.After more than half year’s hard work, we picked an afternoon to take beautiful pictures around our university and this is one of the creation of us. We not only relaxed but also enjoy the work we have done. Though the idea was thought by the girls(they always like beautiful things), we are still glad to make it interesting.

NYMU-Taipei
We have continued our long standing collaboration with NYMU-Taipei. Several of our members have attended weekly meetings with the team and discussed our projects together. They have been very generous in lending us chemicals and reagents (PEG 8000 and MR17 broth). This year three members from TAS (Anna, Yasmin and Jake) are members on both NYMU and TAS teams. They learned the cloning cycle from TAS and helped run experiments and human practices for NYMU throughout the year. Additionally, they have provided access and instruction for several instruments. Specifically they provided protocols, cuvettes, and access to an electroporation machine so that we could attempt electroporation into Lactobacillus casei and Lactococcus lactis. They also provided access and instruction to a 96-well plate reader so that we could test the efficiency our alcohol induced promoter (K2539550). In return we have helped NYMU with the cloning of biobrick parts. Lastly, TAS and NYMU teams worked together to help troubleshoot the interlab study and measurements using their plate reader.
Near the DNA submission deadline, we assisted NYMU by cloning their ALB-mCherry (BBa_K2751012) and mEGFP (BBa_K2751011) parts into the standard BioBrick backbone pSB1C3.  We did this for them while they were also trying to clone the same part, just in case their ligation and transformation was unsuccessful.  Both teams were successful and this helped them verify that ligation and transformation of their part was successful.

We also have a long standing collaboration with Lambert iGEM team.  This year we were excited to test their prototype of an ElectroPen. They shipped their pen to us along with videos and a protocol. After going over specific details of the protocol through Skype, we then used their ElectroPen to electroporate a GFP expression construct into both E. coli K-12 DH5a and E. coli Nissle 1917. We validated that the ElectroPen works! It successfully helped transform both E. coli strains!

Westminster UK
On August 9th, we conducted a video call with the Westminster UK iGEM team to discuss the applications of their project to help us reduce polystyrene waste produced by our project. The team’s project uses chemicals to break down polystyrene down to monomers which are consumed by bacteria. Our device would necessitate multiple discs per day, based on the size of the field, and the conversation inspired us to look into alternatives to polystyrene.
Southern iGEM Video Conference
On July 19th, along side the LASA and UVA teams, we attended the Southern iGEM Video Conference hosted by the Tennessee Knoxville team. Each team gave a 15 minute presentation regarding their project followed up by questions. We were asked questions regarding the expression of the transformed transport protein which we had not previously considered. This encouraged us to double check the translationality of the operon between E. coli 1303 and E. coli DH5α. We posed questions regarding the safety hazards and application of projects dealing with human blood samples and encouraged them to explore an education component regarding the safe usage of their product.
Following the presentations, we participated in a discussion focused on general questions and roadblocks many iGEM teams face. We shared our experience with fundraising and directed newer teams to reach out to personal contacts and local companies working in fields related to their project.

We were not the only team working on optical switch-CcaS/R, Team_SDU-China(2018) also  worked on it. We communicated with each other about the data and stressed the importance of the ""leakage expression"". What's more, Team_HZAU-China(2017) worked on it too and modified the pathway  to make it a 2.0 version, which makes it have a lower leakage expression.We wrote in wiki that in the next iGEM season we may improve our system, actually we may try the DNA that HZAU modified at that time!"
SKLBC-DGSYZX,2015," software and experiment of synthetic biology. At this meet-up, we also showed our projects with each other, after which we got lots of useful advice and knew experience in iGEM from the three laboratory teams’ members.
Experiment train    2015 August 7th- 9th
Our project is about an online panel app, with which the scientists and non-scientists can easily design their gene circuits in the same model. As a new high school team, we do not have solid knowledge about synthetic biology. Even though we can acquire a concept about synthetic biology by self-learning, we still need an intuitional sense about how the molecules interact in the experiment operations. During August 7th- 9th, we had a three-day experiment train and got a better understanding of synthetic biology from team SCUT-China. With the help of experiment, we believe we can make a greater User Experience in our project.
Gene circuit library
In order to help the iGEMers create more amazing circuits easily, SCUT-China suggested us to added remarkable designs of iGEMs’ teams to build up a gene circuit library, during which we can test our app and gain some novel idea with the library. However, gathering the gene circuits is a hard work for us, because we have to read the projects of previous iGEMs’ teams and we lack experience of designing gene circuits. Therefore, members of SCUT-China finished reading the projects and used the panel app to complete the construction of gene circuits library, after which they gave us a feedback to help us improve our panel app.
Course design
It is a collar work for us to design the course by ourselves so SCUT-team offers to help us collect the information about synthetic biology and simplify the knowledge point. Actually, it’s a brilliant idea which helps us learn synthetic biology easily and save time at the same time.
Collaboration with other software teams
We also cooperate with other software teams. We create a cooperative function with SKLBC-China team. By scanning the QR code, we can view the biobricks that have been stored up in the wechat ID through the project WeiGem 2.0 of SKLBC-China. The function not only links wechat and personal computer, but also connects the two high school teams.

HUST-China,2016,"wing to limitation of experimental conditions, we got a problem of measurement this year. HZAU-China generously offered access to their lab and microplate reader for us. This is crucial for our circuit characterization this year and we deeply appreciate the helps from HZAU-China.
In return, we did a favor to them on part submission by helping them prepare the delivery samples using our vacuum freeze dryer.
Interlab help out
Over the past two years, iGEM has advanced the frontiers of science with the two biggest interlaboratory studies even done in synthetic biology. These studies establishing a baseline for replicability of fluorescence measurements and identified likely key sources of error, and have now been published as an open-access journal article in PLOS ONE.
But some accidents occur during the delivery, so we turn to each other for help. We offered device 3 plasmid to JLU and get positive control of Interlab from NKU and give back device 2 plasmid.
We are grateful for the concept raised by the iGEM committee that all iGEM teams should offer each other helps during this whole voyage of attending iGEM competition. This had indeed brought mutual benefits and long-term friendships to teams.
In all, HUST-China is a friendly and helpful team, we are eager to help more in the whole iGEM and synthetic biology~"
USP-Brazil,2018," biological but also chemical crosstalk between different quorum sensing devices. This can be performed by using two compatible plasmids at the same time. They also gave us some of their plasmid constructs for us to test what would be the minimum concentration for their project to be measurable.

We approximate the bacteria, the zinc fingers, and the DNA arm by a set of beads. The bacteria becomes one large sphere, the zinc finger one small sphere, and the DNA arm becomes a rod consisting of a cascade of beads.
Using these assumptions, the free energy can be calculated from geometrical and electrochemical considerations. In other words, knowing the positions, radii, and charge magnitudes on the beads, the binding free energy of the system is directly calculated as follows.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2018," projects all focus on colon-related diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). NEU_China_A provided us with E.coli Nissle 1917. Since this strain can target the cancer cells without any further processing, it is the ideal chassis for our project. NEU_China_A also gave us plasmids containing gene norR, which can express NorR protein to help the norV promotor function well. In our project, we use the norR promotor to sense the level of nitric oxide and then produce azurin to kill cancer cells. In return, we gave them the colon cancer cell line HT29 to test their system and also the nitrate and nitrite sensitive promoter Pyear with a GFP in 2018 Distribution Kit Plates( BBa_K381001).

ShanghaiTech
ShanghaiTech built a system to minimize the unpredictable disturbances and stabilize the expression of genetic circuits this year. In this system which employs feedforward control they use STAR RNA as the second module to continue trigger the next module. Our team has worked with STAR system in last year’s projects so we gave the plasmid to them. Moreover, they faced some problems transforming the bacteria which were used for the 2018 interlab study so we inoculated colonies from our own plates and sent the culture to them. Visit their website
RDFZ-China
RDFZ-China is a great help to our team. They provided us with plasmids expressing acoustic reporter genes, arg1 and arg2. We use them to report the location of cancer foci combining with ultrasound. They also applied the gas vesicle genes in their project, trying to perform noninvasive monitoring of the bacteria, so we shared the protocol and according instrument’s parameters with them. Besides, since we all took part in the fifth CCiC, we made a meeting there and offered a lot of advice to each other. Visit their website
CSU_CHINA

Manchester,2017," Risk Group 1, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and CFIA recommends containment level 1 (CL1) safety guidelines, however no requirements are specified. Risk group 1 includes any biological materials that are potentially pathogenic to humans or animals, but are very unlikely to be so, or are not pathogenic at all. Some recommendations for CL1 facilities outlined in the Canadian Biosafety Standard are as follows:
1. The designated areas for handling biological materials should be separated from public areas and administrative work areas.
2. There should be designated hand and eye wash stations appropriate for facility operations.
3. Appropriate personal protective equipment, such as safety glasses, lab coats and, footwear covering the feet, must be worn.
4. Only authorized personnel and visitors should be allowed in the facility.
5. Waste materials must be disposed in the proper containers and wastes that came into contact with biological materials must be decontaminated before disposal.
6. Proper hand washing techniques must be employed after coming into contact with biological materials.
7. Procedures must incorporate proper aseptic technique and minimizes contamination and the formation of aerosols.
8. Food and drinks should be prohibited from the lab.
9. Personnel must be trained for the safe handling and storing of biological materials to protect them.
10. Safety guidelines must be kept up-to-date.
To work with biological materials in higher risk groups (2, 3, and 4), in addition to adopting the appropriate containment level, a Pathogen and Toxin Licence must be obtained from PHAC. Although CL1 provides the foundational biosafety guidelines for these containment levels, further requirements must be followed to minimize contamination and hazards to personnel working with high risk group pathogens. Additional information for the operations of these controlled facilities are discussed in the Canadian Biosafety Standard Second Edition handbook.

The European Experience
From July 2nd to 3rd, three of our team members joined “The European Experience”, a meet-up of iGEM teams from Europe, in Paris. Over 27 teams from around Europe were a part of this great weekend. We heard talks about the challenges and risks of synthetic biology as well as how it is a new business opportunity. We got the chance to connect with people from many parts of Europe while simultaneously getting to present our project and ask for advice or recommendations we also did a sightseeing tour through the city with the teams from Düsseldorf and Leiden.
German Meetup Marburg
The iGEM team Marburg organised a two day meet-up for all the German teams to get together, communicate and learn from each other. All German teams were represented and also joined by the team from the SDU Denmark. Four of our team members drove to Marburg on August 5. In the evening, we split up in different groups, discovered the Oberstadt from Marburg and had first talks about the different projects. On Saturday, we heard different talks from the leader of Symikro Marburg and the mayor of the city. In addition, every team had the chance to present their own project and talk about collaborations. We finished the day off with some matches of bubble soccer and a barbecue. On the next day we all left happy and motivated to collaborate and support each other.

The exchange of ideas and resources is an increasing practice among scientists, with networks of research collaborations growing around the globe. The iGEM competition has allowed us to get in touch with many teams globally.
During the course of the iGEM competition we collaborated with two teams. Our main collaboration was with the University of East Anglia located in the UK.

The UEA team were looking for a fast and accurate method of comparing how different surfaces affect the adherence of E.coli versus Shewanella cells. Their project aims to prepare biological systems within Shewanella cells that will store energy harvested from the sun as hydrogen, so finding out which materials suit the growth of Shewanella was crucial.  Imaging the cells on different surfaces through atomic force microscopy seemed to be the best method. After a few Skype sessions with UEA we decided to send 10 AFM metal specimen discs and host them for a day to image their pre-prepared samples. Due to time constraints, not all the discs prepared were imaged that day, 4 discs remained and were imaged at a later date by the Kent team.
Here are some examples of images taken on the AFM for UEA. These figures show E.coli and Shewanella on graphite
In return the UEA team kindly agreed to generate model  structures for our protein sequences. This was a crucial part of our project as some of the proteins we are working with have been characterised. The protein sequences of each protein were sent to UEA and the proteins were modeled using the Phyre2 software. The UEA team sent the"

Overview on Collaborations
This year, our team actively collaborated with two iGEM teams in China, which are the team Tsinghua-A from Tsinghua University and the JSNU-China from Jiangsu Normal University. The team Tsinghua-A focused on constructing a synthetic biology circuit to seek insights into noise propagation as well as measuring the capacity of parallel information channels. Our team members, Lechen Qian and Haolong Zhu, helped them to gain access to a better home-built computation platform, applied their knowledge to modify and operate the algorithm, and scanned two key parameters, Ka (dimer association rate) and Kd (dimer dissociation rate constant) relevant to their modeling project in use of Gillespie Algorithm. In addition, we also helped JSNU-China from Jiangsu Normal University to culture a hela cell clone (the ninth generation) in our culture facility, which later on became an indivisible part in their project and gave them new thinking about utilizing new cell lines. We also benefited a lot through multiple interactions with the two teams during team collaboration. For example, the wiki-design team at Tsinghua-A depicted a brief mechanism of our project in a cartoon style to better illustrate our biofilm-interfaced hydrogen-producing platform. Their help has also provided us inspiration to design our own big picture later on.
Besides, to further propagandize the iGEM as well as synthetic biology, the iGEM Day for the Public Interests (iPDI) was established this year alone with the start-up of the first-ever iGEM team at ShanghaiTech. For this year's iDPI, our team organized a Lab Open House Day in relation to the Shanghai Concordia International School. Inspired by our speeches and the lab visiting, some of the students demonstrated strong curiosity to the iGEM and synthetic biology. Therefore, we were now assiting them to build up their first-ever high school team for the futrue iGEMs. Our team will keep supervising them.

UT-Knoxville,2017," fundraising to cover all costs. We did fundraising throughout the summer whereas Team Aachen tackled fundraising much earlier in the process. Our team members were assigned several companies to contact for fundraising on their own time, and this made it more difficult to ensure everyone was proactive about the fundraising effort. Team Aachen came together on the weekends and contacted companies together. They also suggested doing more research into the company’s profile and finding common ground with the company and the team’s research in order to have more success. They also recommended calling companies over the phone rather than over the email because companies were more responsive that way.
Important Lessons
Focus on a recruitment process that encourages members to understand one another.
Ensure that each member understands the commitment of being on the team.
Make meetings less lecture based and more engaging to members. Encourage creativity and sharing of ideas.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,":Muc16_65roses.png
A rose from Munich
As part of their project dealing with the most prevalent mutation in the CFTR protein, which is responsible for cystic fibrosis, the team from Tel Hai Academic college dedicated themselves to raise awareness for the severely life-shortening genetic condition. The “65 Roses” story itself dates back to 1965 when an observant 4-year-old, hearing the name of his disease for the first time, pronounced cystic fibrosis as ""65 Roses."" Nowadays, “65 Roses” is a term often used by young children with cystic fibrosis to pronounce the name of their disease. We are very happy to be a part of their noble efforts and dedication for this project.
BioBricks for the world
Due to the history of interesting projects from Munich, it did not take long for the first Biobricks requests to come in from all over the world.
Media:Muc16_Toulouse.jpg
Vive le France!
The first inquiry came from our cave-saving colleagues from Toulouse , who were in need of a BioBrick for their Bacillus subtilis originally developed by the team from LMU in 2012. Go save those caves! ;)
The far east
Not long after, a more distant call reached us all the way from - 2016 XMU-China iGEM team . They required components from the biosensor part of the LMU team 2014 in order to detect and kill Staphylococcus aureus.
Our dutch neighbours
Last but not least, the team from Groningen got in touch with us regarding yet another Biobrick for Bacillus subtilis from LMU 2012.
Double Kill
But we did not only ship BioBricks, we also requested some ourselves. For our Kill-Switch, we asked iGEM Freiburg (2010, BBa_K404113) and Slovenia (2012, BBa_K782063) for their parts. Since both parts inherited a pstI mutation site, we repaired this and enhanced the part with an additional poly-A sequence.
HowTo
In order to properly showcase our project, we decided to use the hightech 3D animation software Maya by Autodesk . As we consider this an awesome way to show people what you have been doing all summer long, here's an introduction video on HowTo do it.
We hope this helps you to get started and as we really want to see more of these animations, we also added our ""cell"" template file for you to download:

TU_Delft,2015," system, where the filter would separate the fresh from salt water. This separation of salt and fresh was not acquired. This was due to the salt water added on one side of the alginate filter, it leaked to the other side, which didn’t allow the possibility of adding fresh water. The voltmeter did measure a voltage of 10 mV, but the Groningen team stated that the this was caused by the carrier material, which produces a voltage of around 10-12 mV by itself. Therefore it could not be concluded that the alginate filter was selective for sodium ions.
Thanks to the help of Gronigen, we are able to state that our Biolinker (3D-printer) is indeed an open-source platform technology, since Groningen was able to print their bacteria, B.subtilis, by themselves. The Groningen team wasn’t able to prove that their filter was selective for ions, due to the fact that the filter made let water molecules pass through.
We would like to thank the iGEM Groningen team for their time, bacteria and for the great dinner we had afterwards.
Dutch iGEM Teams Meeting
Preparatory starting course for all the Dutch iGEM teams of 2015
On the 26th and 27th of March 2015 there were two training days for all the iGEM teams of the Netherlands. The teams invited were Groningen, TU Eindhoven, and TU Delft.  Both days were filled with different lectures, on the 26th at the University of Groningen, and on the 27th at TU Delft.
We left the Delft station early in the morning, prepared for a long train ride. Without any delays we arrived in Groningen by 11am and were warmly welcomed with tea,coffee, and biscuits. Aljoscha Wahl started with a general introduction to iGEM, and we were introduced to the members of the other teams.  It was really nice to meet them all and learn about all the different backgrounds.  The first speaker was  Renske van Raaphorst who gave a lecture about how to be successful in iGEM. She had participated in the iGEM competition in 2012 with the team of Groningen, and  won the grand prize that year.  She summarized what they had done and how their project had proceeded from beginning to end. It was very surprising how many obstacles they encountered and how they solved them. She gave us a few good tips how to approach problems and avoid stress moments. Clement Gallay continued with a general"
Cadets2Vets,2017," reactions made by bacteria or yeast.
The violacein pigment is produced through a series of 5 different genes and altering the synthetic pathway can produce different colors. This project is also developing an analytical system that monitors the turbidity and color of the culture in the bioreactor. There are many possible applications of this technology for monitoring metabolic reactions while maintaining affordability.
We discussed the possibility of sharing some reagents to help each other characterize some Parts. Cadets2Vets is looking for collaborators to measure the GFP fluorescence from the plasmids we made and Washington is looking for ways to characterize some of its plasmids in a similar way. ​​
Interlab collaboration with lab pats air force research lab
Cadets2Vets had a Skype call with Dallas McDonald from the Lab Pats team.
​The results obtained from the Lab Pats Interlab study were different from Cadets2Vets. At the 6 hour time point, the plasmids with highest to lowest GFP fluorescence were:
LB + Chloramphenicol
Negative Control
Device 6
Positive Control
Device 1
Device 4
Device 5
Device 3
Device 2
After sharing these results, Cadets2Vets were curious why the results were so different. The Lab Pats team speculated that the difference may have been due to pipetting errors or differences in the instruments. Te Lab Pats used a SpectraMax M5, which uses monochromators to excite the GFP instead of filters, which is what Cadets2Vets had in their FilterMax F5 instrument. Cadets2Vets went back to their transformation plates and tried to assess whether the bacterial colonies sill expressed GFP and if the intensity was similar to the pattern gain from the plate reader.​
Cadets2Vets’ one-month old transformation plates were still fluorescent, and we used a hand-held blacklight to qualitatively observe the colonies. The order of highest to lowest fluorescence using this method was:
Positive Control
Device 2
Device 4 = Device 1
Device 6 = Device 3
Negative Control.
Device 5 was omitted due to the few colonies present were on the edge of the plate and difficult to see clearly.
The sensitivity of using a blacklight was much lower than using a plate reader, and so it was hard to see the differences between some of the plates. However, it appears that the pattern of fluorescence we observed in the plate reader is consistent with the bacteria in the plates. ​Washington also shared the results of their Interlab study. Summarizing their data"
NUDT_CHINA,2016,"293 cells were assayed for 2.95 E8 particles each milliliter. Then the relationship between particle number and protein was determined that exosomes in 1 ng protein were equivalent to 6277.95 particles, according to the dilution multiple (24) and protein concentration (1127.756 ng/ul) we have tested. All the data collected help us decide the transfection dosage of siRNA and dosing of treatment prepared for animal experiment.

Mentoring TMMU-China
It was the first time for TMMU-China to take part in iGEM, so they had something unfamiliar about it. We provided a vigorous support for their project from beginning to end.
In March of 2016, we attended a meet-up hosted by The Third Military Medical University (TMMU) to discuss on some issues about iGEM.
We introduced the concepts and rules for iGEM in detail, and we also talked about some crucial points that should be paid attention to. Having had two years’ experience of taking part in the iGEM, we also shared our own lessons that we got from iGEM.
During the meet-up, both teams communicated and exchanged each other’s ideas through presentation, brainstorm and other methods. This discussion had brought us some inspiration for our own project this year.
The connection between us has accelerated the project's improvement. Meanwhile, it let us understand one of iGEM’s core value---collaboration, sharing and community.
Collaboration with NEFU_China
In August of this year, we went to NEFU_China and carried out an issue communication. They took advantage of magnet tool to purify protein, which would improve the yield and purity of some protein. This idea may help us reduce the complexity of the protein cas9 purification, so as to focus more on the miRNA detection method developments. Besides, they are also very interested in our project and describe it open, close to the forefront and worth their studying. Briefly, we are pleasant to have the communication with NEFU_China.

Ding: But I do think that you should upload the common genes in the synthetic biology researching process like genes of fluorescent protein, different kinds of enzymes and so on. Chen: OK, because we are not major in biology, so we did not think about this when we did the text analysis. Chen: It is unavoidably imperfect for this edition. We will perfect it in the future. Ding: Yeah, it is just a suggestion.
Ding: I have not found any problems in the System page. Ding: In summary, this software is excellent, I guess it is the first software focusing on the searching of iGEM part. Ding: What you need to do next is enlarge the database, remove some bugs like unable to load picture, and change the part editing page, which I think is not so friendly. Chen: OK, thank you for your feedback. Ding: You are welcome.
2.OUR LECTURE IN TUST
Tianjin University of Science and Technology is a key university in Tianjin, China, which is famous for its excellent fermentation engineering and food engineering subject. Some years ago, some professors and students of TUST decided to set up a iGEM team and participate in the iGEM competition in the future. This summer, a sophomore student and a graduate student from TUST came to Tianjin University and study the basic knowledge about iGEM and synthetic biology and help our experiments in protein modification part. They told us about the enormous difficulty they are facing in team establishing process and we shared our experience and gave several suggestions to them. Before they leaved us, they invited us to give a speech in their school after summer vacation. On September 27th, five members of our team went to Teda campus of TUST and gave a speech about how to set up a iGEM team and what could a iGEMer receive from this competition. Almost all the seats were occupied by listeners. Since the iGEM competition is almost a band new term for most students in TUST, many"

Collaborations
With the extensive support we receive from Mindfuel’s geekStarter program, many collaborations were made possible this year, both with High school and Collegiate iGEM teams.  Three different Mindfuel events were held in the last year, which brought the following teams together to share our ideas and project successes, and to troubleshoot and support one another with stumbling blocks:
Notre Dame Collegiate iGEM
Lethbridge High School iGEM
University of Calgary iGEM
University of Calgary BioMod
University of Lethbridge iGEM
University of Alberta iGEM
Through these meaningful collaboration events, we got to know other students working in Synthetic Biology and made meaningful connections with other experts and mentors in the field.  In particular, we are grateful to have met the U of Alberta iGEM team, who worked with Dr. Robert E. Campbell, who was an expert in mCherry, and provided us with a sample of purified mCherry lysate for our spectrophotometric assays!
We had hoped to connect more closely with the Tianjin 2016 iGEM team members since our PET-hydrolase constructs were intended to be modifications and improvements upon their excellent work. Unfortunately, we did not get any responses from our emails or social media outreach to Tianjin 2016, and so we were not able to collaborate with them.

BostonU_HW Collaboration: Microfluidics
We collaborated with the Boston University Hardware team . We followed the protocols they provided us and assembled three types of chips: PCR, digestion and a toehold chip they designed specifically for our project. To test out functionality of the chips we used color dye to imitate the process of biological fluid flowing into the chip. The toehold chip had a relatively serious leakage problem, and air bubbles in the valves blocked the way for color dye to get through. We hypothesize several reasons that explained why the leakage happened and redid some steps to improve the assembly. After several rounds of tests and trials with all the chips, we gave BU Hardware team some feedback about our thoughts of the chips and how it could potentially be improved. We also pointed out steps on the protocols that appeared unclear to us as users and suggested them to explain purposes of certain steps better to make sure users understand why they are important.

MIT Collaboration: Adding an MS2 Domain to Triggers
We collaborated with MIT to test the potential for their RNA binding protein (MS2) to sterically protect our RNA trigger from exonuclease degradation. For the MS2 protein to be able to recognize our trigger DNA, a hairpin loop structure was added at one end. After DNA is transcribed into RNA, the MS2 protein binds to the hairpin loop on the RNA sequence. The below is a flowchart showing the procedures of collaboration. MIT designed the hairpin loop that was added to the trigger sequences we provided them. We eventually put MS2 protein, trigger and toehold sequence into cell-free. However, due to potential contamination of trigger RNA, we were not able to get valuable cell-free data."

In April, we were invited to participate in the March for Science in Cologne. Of course, we accepted this invitation and met with other German iGEM teams located in the Cologne area to promote the importance of science in our modern society and everyday life. At this event, we got to know many iGEM teams in person and got first impressions of their interesting projects. We got to know the iGEM team Duesseldorf quite well with whom we were in close contact throughout the year and started a collaboration for independent sequencing.

On 24th of April, the team from Tuebingen followed our invitation and visited us at the CeBiTec  in Bielefeld. After guiding them through our facility, both teams presented their projects and we had the opportunity to discuss them in detail. Especially in such an early stage of an iGEM project, an intensive discussion helped a lot in identifying blur aspects of the project. At the end of this interesting and successful day, we had an awesome barbecue together.

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2017," functionality of original biobrick, but able to revert the transformant back to wild-type with time. We helped HKUST team’s progress by providing them a Cython-implemented Python interface. It enables them to use the ViennaRNA package functions(written in C language) in Python interface, so they can easily model the dissociation constant for the antisense mRNA and transcript mRNA. We also help characterizing their biobricks by running an GFP assay, detailed protocol and results attached below. In return, they provided us two Python scripts for our modelling of free energies of opened and closed toehold switches, by plotting ODE-based model and stochastic model using Euler’s method and Gillespie algorithm respectively. This facilitates our screening of optimal toehold switches in our program.
Below showed the test result of the characteriation of 6 biobricks provided by Hong Kong HKUST team. (Detailed interpretation of data is in their wiki )The biobricks were incubated with varying concentrations of AHT and measured the GFP fluorescence with COSTAR plate reader. Only pSB1C3-BBa_F2620-C0261-E0240-R0063-Anti2 shows a positive trend with increasing AHT concentration. In contrast, Hong Kong HKUST team's own results show a positive trend with pSB1C3_BBa_T9002.

TecMonterrey_GDA,2017," creating science. This manual is intended to be presented to the Mexican Ministry of Education. Each team collaborated with the proposal of 10 different experiments according to the national education plan, making a total of 30 experiments. We validated them in public and private schools in the cities of Chihuahua, Guadalajara and Mexico City where we got feedback from teachers and students. We aim to awaken the children’s curiosity and to bring them closer to scientific activities through the manual and in the long term, to increase the scientific development in Mexico and to make progress in our country.
The manual consists of 30 experiments divided into 3 segments, according to their educational level and average age range. Each of them consists of the name of the experiment, objective, theory of the phenomenon studied, material, procedure and questions. Each section aims to ensure the understanding of the experiment and its relationship to the topics seen in class. Each experiment has its fundamentals clearly explained for all ages to which the manual is directed.
iGEM Tec GDL validated three of the 30 experiments of the Science Manual in a Public School in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The Elementary School principal, Manuel Cañedo, mentioned that he feels fortunate and pleasurable of having us in their school to participate with their students in science activities. Manuel Cañedo welcomed us and introduced us to the 5th graders; we explained them the activities, and all the children responded, participated enthusiastically and payed attention at all time, then we made other experiments in 1st and 2nd grade, in which children responded in the same way.
Teachers and students were excited because this experiments took them out of the daily school routine, they could all participate, they all had fun, but most importantly they all learned science.
In this picture we are creating a Non-Newtonian fluid with the second grader students. They are touching and feeling the difference between applying pressure to the fluid with the finger and not applying pressure at all.

Brazil: Amazonas_Brazil and USP-Brazil Teams
The Amazonas Brazil Team had problems with the LUDOX solution during the InterLab experiments and ran out of it, so we sent them a sample and helped them completing their participation in the InterLab.
The Brazilian teams also collaborated in many aspects through a WhatsApp group. There, we discussed and helped each other with wet-lab issues and discussed doubts about the iGEM deliverables. Since it’s our team’s first time in iGEM, the group helped us a lot in getting some information about how to do a lot of things! We also had a Brazilian meetup early this year where we got in touch with Amazonas_Brazil, USP-Brazil, teams from the previous years and groups interested in participating in iGEM next years.

USA: Harvard Team
We collaborated with the Harvard Team by creating a Global Perspective Outreach Survey about biomanufacturing. This survey was intended to standardize the way teams reach out to experts and authorities related to their projects and how the information is documented. Also, a goal from this collaboration was to understand the gap between academia and industry, the level of public knowledgement about biomanufacturing and the main challenges to push foward the development of biomanufacturing in the world.
Our team created a few questions for the survey that would be asked to the general public, academics, industries, politicians and regulatory agencies. After we created the questions, all participating teams gave their opinions and Harvard Team compiled the best ones and we began to spread the survey and get the data. In this work we have also collaborated with Linkoping , Aalto-Helsink and Hamburg Teams .
Our team has collaborated creating the questions below:
To academics:
How do you think your research could contribute to the advance in biomanufacturing in your country/region?
Do you consider easy to be in contact with the industry and have a research the benefits both, done together?
To industries:
Are you interested in work with universities to develop a biomanufacturing process that benefits you or"
Danzi_Kesh_8,2015," contacted us through Skype was extremely nice and patient meeting 23 students. After introductions and sharing information about the projects, we explained the essence of our social activities. We asked the representative about the attitude towards celiac patients in the educational system in Australia in order to enrich our theoretical background. The conversation focused on the ability to connect between science and social needs, and the importance of this process. We also asked her opinion as a student concerning high school students participating in a world wide science competition, and whether it is worthwhile or not.
It was amazing to speak to a scientist on the other side of the world and to know that she herself appreciates and welcomes young students attempting to make a breakthrough with a science and social idea as one.
At the end of the Skype conversation with Paris and Sydney we succeeded in understanding more how prestigious the competition is, also for those who are already on their academic road, and how this challenge with all its difficulties progresses you as a human being and develops your ability to cope and overcome things individually and as a team.
Technion HS Team
The Technion is the first high school team we have managed to collaborate with. The meetup and hospitality at the Technion was very comfortable for us because the participants are almost the same age as us.
The meeting helped us understand how to prepare for a winning presentation. Both teams helped each other by giving feedback on how each team should present itself in the activity in the framework of the competition. We gave and received remarks on how to stand in front of an audience, the correct use of technical aids, and to summarize a deep and prolonged process.
At the end of this part of the day we worked together on how a good poster should look compared to one that is not as good. Both teams collaborated and gave feedback on the posters exhibited at the Technion.
After that, Technion students gave us the basics for writing a mathematical model and we offered assistance on the construction of the wiki site, and gave the student who regard after the Wiki some advises.
Mini IGEM Technion
This year four teams will be competing at the iGEM: One team representing Ben Gurion University, 2 teams representing
the Technion and us from Danciger Darca High School, Kiryat Shmona. All competitors met at the mini-iGEM at the Faculty of Biotechnology of food at the Technion. This was the reason for a meet-up with the teams from Israel.

Our team was also pleased to see how others managed to progress with their own projects. It was interesting to confront our ideas of human practices with theirs and particularly when parts of our projects were similar. (e.g. peptide production, treating water, dealing with worldwide health issues)
At this point of the competition, all teams were unsure about some aspects of their projects, and these meetups contributed to make progress on how to answer interrogations / solve ethical issues.
Skype meeting
Greece
It was our first skype meeting. We had the opportunity to talk about modeling because the Greece team already had modeled the comportment of a quorum sensing molecule in a cell population. This modeling could have been related to our project with the diacetyl acting like a quorum sensing molecule between V. harveyi and P. pastoris. Moreover they were interested in NMR facilities we use to detect quorum sensing molecule.
Singapour
We did a Skype to meet each other and to introduce our project. We talked about collaboration but didn’t find how to help each other.
Purdue
We had an interesting exchange about collaboration. Indeed, their project is about using lung microbiota to detoxify lungs and because one of our members already dealt with strains coming from the lung microbiota, it was the opportunity to do an experiment for them with these lung strains (experiments and obtained results are described above). More than that, in their lab they had the opportunity to use rats organs which could have been useful to test the cytotoxicity of our AMP once we’d produced them. But we couldn’t produce them soon enough.
Boston
Their project is about producing AMPs against a wide-range of bacteria causing world-wide disease like malaria or cholera. with an in vitro system. Because their system is based upon AMP without a methionine in N-ter they were interested in our project. As their production is based on an in vitro production and ours is based on the communication of several microorganisms, we had a lot of points to compare. We talked about our protocol, pros and cons of our projects and so on. We would have liked to collaborate with this team but while they were starting their experiments we were ending ours on the shareable part.

They also offered us the gene which could be added as the kill switch, helping us to notice the importance of using a kill switch to make our bacteria safer. Of course, we  give some methods to help with their experiments and shared some experience about our project. Because this is the first time to attend for the iGEM, we are very appreciated that Unesp_Brazil could share experience with us and adopted our ideas even though we are a new team for iGEM.
Collaboration with XJTLU-CHINA
    At the beginning of the iGEM, we have already contacted with the XJTLU-CHINA since they have rich experience about igem. They held a seminar to introduce the rules of the igem which helped us to start our project in a correct way and they also gave us many instruct in our human practice. They had some problems about website construction,  so we put forward some advice and finally they solved the problems. We also help them make a mind map which you could see in their wiki. We are appreciated XJYLU-CHINA and hope we will have more collaboration in the future.

In the collaboration between the Taiwan and American team, we were able to help each other survey American’s opinion and knowledge on EDCs as well as Taiwanese knowledge on bacteriophages and their opinion in regard to E. coli contamination. With their help on designing our 3D model system, we were able to use one of the software programs that they suggested and designed a 3D model of our water test kit. We improved each other’s project based on these collaboration experiences, and it was a pleasure to work with them!

In the project of iGEM UoA , they transferred antifreeze protein gene to crops and combined the ability to regulate gene expression. They are aiming for the gene to only be expressed at high levels when the plant is at a cold enough temperature. We thought that our temperature sensing system would be ideal for them to set up the initial temperature database. Because the data would be collected immediately and accurately, they could derive continuous data from different areas and decide whether it is necessary to plant antifreeze crops in every farmland or valley. So far we have provided our design detail including hardware and software to iGEM UoA. We hope it would show a better value for both of us.

Hamburg,2018," to 150 mg. In aqueous HCl solution the gel seems to be dissolving at a slower, but measurable rate to 170 mg. In Thermo Fisher GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit Binding Buffer the gel’s mass increased further to 235 mg. In aqueous lactic acid solution the gel started to slowly dissolve as indicated by a decrease of mass to 157 mg (Fig 1.).
Fig. 1: Dextran gel mass change over time under different conditions.
Conclusions
iGEM Eindhoven’s dextran gel is remarkably stable under varying conditions which exceed tolerance of most common bacteria. Given the information that under acidic, non-physiological conditions the dextran gel dissolves, we tested conditions at E. coli tolerance borders. At pH 3 and pH 3.6 in HCl and lactic acid, respectively, degradation was measurable after 24 h of incubation. Since iGEM Eindhoven previously tested their gel’s stability under acidic, but not under basic conditions, we tested degradation at pH 8 in agarose-dissolving buffer, and pH 9 in aqueous NaOH solution. Due to high salt concentrations in the Gel Extraction Kit Buffer, the gel’s density increased over time, rendering a possible degradation impossible to measure. However, visual inspection indicated that the gel was intact after 24 h of incubation. Under more basic conditions, the gel dissolved. While at pH 8, E. coli is able to survive, we expect E. coli to be disrupted when incubated at pH 9 for 24 h.

Marburg
We are very grateful to get in contact with iGEM team Marburg and want to thank them for organizing an amazing German iGEM meetup. Additionally, they helped us with our Golden Gate assembly by sending us an alternative protocol for our assemblies. With great care we participated in their well-organized InterLab Study using Vibrio natriegens, for developing a new model organism for prokaryotic cloning. For this we repeated the InterLab protocol they optimized for Vibrio natriegens.
Why is working with Vibrio natriegens not only good for the iGEM Team Marburg, but also for our approach and almost all synthetic cell biologists?
When you are familiar with microorganisms and talks about Vibrio genus, you may think that “it is an ordinary halophile organism”, but what you actually should think is “Well, may this little super organism can change the whole cloning workflow all around the world”!

Heidelberg,2017," pollution and climate change are two of the major challenges we desperately need to solve towards our agreed goal of a sustainable human civilization on our planet. The iGEM Team Pasteur Paris focused on environmental issues and highlighted the problem of air pollution, which is particularly strong problem in quickly industrialized countries with low standards of waste air cleaning in fossil fuel power stations, industrial facilities and transportation vehicles. To receive an impression about the air pollution situation in different regions all over the world they created a comprehensive survey. We hope that we could convey an impression about the situation in Heidelberg, which fortunately is a rather small, bicycle-friendly city closely surrounded by five beautiful nature reserves. iGEM Team Heidelberg is also taking part in the iGEM goes green initiative by team TU Dresden.
Survey about methane production from UNebraska-Lincoln
The iGEM Team UNebraska-Lincoln aims at inhibiting the methane production in cattle and wanted to integrate the general public opinion into the design of their project. All members of iGEM team Heidelberg filled in their survey and we are looking forward to helping you gather information and maybe even contribute to decreasing the alarming speed of climate change.
Survey about cholera from iGEM Toulouse
In order to tackle the cholera disease, the iGEM Team Toulouse asked everyone to answering their questionnaire to receive an impression about the informational situation according to cholera disease. Hopefully we could contribute a little bit to succeeding with your project on eradicating Vibrio cholerae.
Genetic modification to produce medicines - Cardiff iGEM
To investigate the public´s view on genetic modification for pharmaceutical production the Cardiff iGEM Team created a survey. They aim at treating the Grave´s Disease, an autoimmune disease affecting the thyroid, with the help of genetically modified organisms. We filled in their questionnaire and hope that they succeed with realizing their innovative therapeutic approach.
GMO perception survey from Ionis Paris
To gain more information about GMO perception by the public the iGEM Team Ionis Paris conducted a survey we took part in. They aim at creating an interactive map to make the comprehensive information from their interesting questionnaire easily accessible. This map contains regimentations and opinions about GMOs and could provide novel insights into region-specific, public perception on the creation and use of GMOs.

Mentoring Local High School iGEM Team
This is the first time S.K.H Li Ping Secondary School is participating in the iGEM Competition. A collaboration visit was carried out in March with S.K.H Li Ping Secondary School, where we had a meet-and-greet session with students and exchanged basic knowledge about synthetic biology, iGEM, and our projects. It was a great opportunity to witness young bright minds keen on tackling real-life scientific problems. A second visit was carried out in April in the form of a workshop, where we taught the students on the basics of DNA and DNA nanotechnology, as well as extracting their own DNA using everyday commodities such as salt and meat tenderizer.

Project Collaboration with High School
Due to a shortage of certain equipment in the high school we helped to produce the plasmid for the submitting their device onto the registry. The transformation, cloning and miniprep extraction of their desired plasmid insert was conducted by our team. It was a great learning opportunity for us to learn about their project and design. This collaboration allowed us to advise the school about how to make more stable designs. Despite it being arduous to finish the submission of both our team’s and the high school's, we believed that it was essential that the fantastic designs generated by the school reach safely to the iGEM foundation.
University Collaboration
In emphasizing the ‘I’ in the iGEM, we have been very active in seeking collaborations among local institutes as well as international ones. We are delighted to announce that our Team organized a Biosafety Sharing Session in August, featuring members (both team project leaders and members alike) from all Hong Kong iGEM University and High School Teams, namely, HKUST, CUHK, UCCKE, LPSS, in addition to the SUSTech iGEM 2017 team from Shenzhen, the first ever in Hong Kong.
During this sharing session, all iGEM teams presented their projects and exchanged ideas. We were also enlightened by Ms. Maria Li, one of the Co-"

Cooperation between iGEM Teams
Marburg Team
This year our iGEM team had the opportunity to form a trans-Atlantic collaboration with a team based in Marburg, Germany.  We sought to determine the evolutionary trajectory of killswitches, with the Marburg team. Throughout this collaboration, the Marburg team assisted in modelling the behaviour and evolution of a previously described MazF killswitch. The Lethbridge team was able to devise a novel protocol for analyzing and accelerating the evolution of killswitches utilizing ultraviolet light. Our group also had killswitch parts synthesized by the Marburg group and improved upon them. This was a valuable collaborative opportunity which we hope to translate into a manuscript related to biocontainment and biosecurity trajectories over time. Our collaboration will be an ongoing one, with the aim of fully characterizing killswitches from a molecular standpoint as well as a computational modeling perspective.
Experimental Protocol
500,000 microjoules of UV light was used to irradiate 200 microlitres of E. coli cells (OD600=0.1) containing an inducible plasmid expressing MazF. Cells were then plated on LB+agar plates containing antibiotic and inducer and grown for 16 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. The number of CFUs obtained after UV irradiation was compared to prior to irradiation and an escape frequency was obtained using this method. Clones which escape the killswitch will be sequenced to examine possible mutations allowing for their escape. Optimization of the amount of UV delivered as well as replication of these experiments are required, however it is a valuable step forward in assessing the evolution of killswitches.

Cooperation with iGEM Team Marburg – iGEM 2018 Vibrigens InterLab Study
Our team first met iGEM team Marburg at the German iGEM meetup in June. There we heard about their project Vibrigens – Accelerating Synbio.
Figure 1: V. natriegens
InterLab study kit.
Team  Marburg strives to establish Vibrio natriegens as the new chassis organism for synthetic biology. 1 V. natriegens is a gram-negative, non-pathogenic, marine bacteria with a population doubling time of seven minutes. 2 In comparison, the common model organism Escherichia coli has a doubling time between 40 and 64 min. 3 By using V. natriegens culture growing time was reduced significantly so that one day cloning became feasible.                  Team Marburg also built and characterized a flexible golden-gate-based part collection, consisting of more than 100 parts,                  which enables them to create complex pathways in a short period of time.                   The V. natriegens strains VibriClone and VibriExpress were designed for cloning and protein expression applications, respectively.                  Moreover, team Marburg established the first synthetic metabolic pathway in this organism now producing the platform chemical 3-hydroxypropionate.                  In addition, they developed an accelerated workflow for metabolic engineering along the way. 1
As team Marburg works on such an exciting project we were very interested in working with their new model organism.                  Our collaboration started on the 9th September 2018 when team Marburg sent us their kit.                  The kit arrived a few days later and comprises one plate with V. natriegens wild type,                  20 aliquots of recovery media (BHI + v2 + 680 mM sucrose),                  3 falcon tubes with 50 mL 10x v2 Salt (204 mM NaCl,                  4.2 mM KCl, 23.14 mM MgCl2),                  4 falcon tubes with 2.5x electroporation buffer (680 mM sucrose , 7 nM K2HPO4, pH 7),                  a 10 mL-falcon tube with LB + v2 for the overnight culture for the competent cells,                  8 1.5 mL-Eppendorf tubes with the following plasmids from the InterLab study, as well as a protocol (Appendix: Protocol Vibrigens Interlab.pdf) and a team-prospect.

Collaborations
Figure 1: All the awesome people from the Nordic Jamboree. You guys rock!
A huge part of iGEM is collaboration and open source community. In the spirit of iGEM, we went to Lithuania from the 1st to the 3rd of June to help the Vilnius iGEM Team getting started on their project. Through the experience of former SDU-Denmark iGEM team participants, we were able to aid the Vilnius University with their very first iGEM team. We intoduced them to techniques for organizing the lab work, how to navigate and use parts registry, how to interpret the iGEM medal recuirements, wiki tips, and important iGEM deadlines.
Figure 2: The silver medal was earned by helping the 2015 iGEM Team from d'Aix Marseille Université by sharing their survey on chewing gum.
While pursuing the goals for our project we collaborated with other iGEM teams and participated in both a Danish and a Nordic Meetup.  The Danish Meetup was hosted by the DTU iGEM Team. This meetup took place the 24"
London_Biohackspace,2015," a format similar to the iGEM giant jamboree held in Boston at the end of the competition.
Hackarium
We had an opportunity to visit Hackarium, located in Lausanne, Switzerland back in June. Hackuarium was founded in 2014 – a fairly new community lab.  We were fortunate enough to interact with the biohackers at Hackarium and we are potentially working together on the beer project by providing them with some sample strains for them to sequence.  Their “Beer Decoded: the 1000 Beer Genome Project” recently got funded on
Kickstarter.
Clearing up confusion in the registry
As part of the main activity of the 2015 London iGEM Bootcamp we attempted to perform a digestion, ligation and transformation of a simple biobrick and backbone with a promoter. However, not all was as it seemed! The simple biobrick we had chosen to ligate into a biobrick backbone was an mRFP coding biobrick ( BBa__I13507 ) to be found in well 21P, plate 4 of the 2015 distribution.
Upon transforming the final product of the restriction + digestion we did not, however, get any visible mRFP production from our cells. Noticing something might be up, we checked the sequencing results for this part and discovered that it did not match the part's proper sequence. After doing a quick BLAST search through the registry using an iGEM registry BLAST tool we discovered that well 21P, plate 4 of the 2015 distribution actually contained BBa_I13602 . Looking at the history of the part, we can surmise that in 2011 BBa_I13602 was pipetted into the well intended for BBa__I13507. It's also interesting to note that the two codes could easily be confused when hand written on something like a microfuge tube.
To prevent teams from getting caught in this mix-up in the future we have submitted a part with the correct sequence for the RBS, mRFP and double terminator (and we have even included the original barcode). YOu can find this corrected biobrick here .

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

Major achivements
In order to make the combination of drylab and wetlab, we collaborated with
1.SYSU-CHINA; our software evaluated the grade of their devices and it was also meaningful for them to evaluate the circuits with software.
2.SJTU-BioX-Shanghai; we evaluated their biobricks; worked together with our brother team in their verification part.
3.China-Tongji; we helped their team find the similar biobricks which could indicate their biobricks with hidden function in the database.
It can be seen from the result that our score is positively correlated to their experiment satisfaction.
According to this result, the comparison of our software score and their experiment results, our software successfully test the parallel experiment and it is also meaningful for them to evaluate the circuits with software, which would be beneficial to improve their future experiments.
This year, SYSU-CHINA develops a plug-in for microbes, a system that can build up a living clock for microbes and guide them to live regularly as well as to work efficiently. Also, microbes with the system inserted acquire the concept of life span so that some dangerous bacterias will come to death in time before they cause any biohazard.
We cooperate with SYSU on the project of experiment grading and result predicting. We would evaluate multiple parallel experiment groups in the construction and testing of inverted components from their team. These groups are comparable between our designs and results, which would become one of the pivotal parts of SYSU project, and the data extracted from which would meet our needs.
Through our cooperation, we got 5 biobricks which were evaluated by their experiment experience; according to our software, each biobricks also got a score. Here are the results.

Our Collaboration with the Broad Run iGem Team
Just prior to the formation of our own Baltimore BioCrew, our team collaborated with the Broad Run iGem from Virginia. Originally, we had worked together to progress their research from the year before; however, because the commute was significantly strenuous for both parties, we mutually decided to set up our own, individual teams.
Before the we started our research on the plastic-degrading Ideonella Sakaiensis, the team collaborated with the Broad Run team by assisting in a multitude of operations.
Since the Broad Run iGem team specialized in yeast cells, vigorous research had to be enacted by all team members to acquire a more refined knowledge-based concerning our research. We assisted the Broad Run team in a multitude of ways in the lab; oftentimes, every member from the Baltimore team would volunteer to work a certain day to focus our efforts on specific wet-lab tasks. By this, our collaboration was cumulative- we would build off of each others knowledge and work together to make a great product!
Thank you, Broad Run, for your dedication and mentorship!"

Why did we collaborate?
Not only does the option of the InterLab study contribute to communication within the scientific community, but so does the collaboration aspect of iGEM. Here, we reached out to teams across the world, offering our help and advice, and also receiving some in return. We have conversed and gotten to know many other teams, both national and international, through not only e-mails, but Skype, Twitter, Facebook & more. It has been a pleasure getting to meet such amazing people all around the world. Many thanks to all who have helped us through our journey.
Newcastle University
Initial Contact: We were looking for a UK team to perform a perchlorate growth curve, and luckily Newcastle offered to do one! We got in contact via e-mails, and soon had sent the COSHH and protocol to follow.
Cooperation: As Newcastle's iGEM project is focusing nitrogen fixing bacteria, they grew these in sodium perchlorate salts. The following bacteria were used: Herbaspirillum seropedicae, Azorhizobium caulinodans and Azospirillum brasilense. They were grown in different concentrations of sodium perchlorate, in a 96-well plate. They then gathered the data from this, and produced a growth curve shown here . This data helped us hugely with understanding how perchlorate affects the growth of different organisms, not just E. coli, and opened the idea that we could potentially take other bacteria to Mars.
Follow-Up: Since these results we have stayed in touch via e-mail. From one UK team to another, we'd like to thank Newcastle for being amazing and helping us with our project. We're very much looking forward to supporting their project and presentation in Boston! #TeamNewcastle

We have established the collaborative relationship with Jilin_China, LanZhou and ZJU_China during the competition. We have made effective communication in terms of experimental condition control and results                                         testing, and we helped each other so that our projects progress more smoothly. We                                         are very grateful to these teams mentioned above for help.
HELPING SECTION
With Jilin_China
We had a lot of discussion with Jilin University about interlab such as experimental                                         conditions control and operation practices. During our human practice, we want to                                         see how the public react to their own health status, to our project, so we did a random survey online and we also went out onto the street to send out some of the                                         questionnaires and we want to thank Jilin University for helping us to send our questionnaires                                         in their city. This makes our findings more convincing.
Jilin_China wanted to get more opinions of their project, so we helped them interview associated professor Peiyong Liu, vice Dean of college of life and health sciences Northeastern University. We told her what Geneguard is, and discussed with her. Peiyong Liu thought the usage of Geneguard system was an innovative idea and it was feasible to control the engineered bacteria in the environment. She thought Jilin_China 's project is meaningful, and it is a nice attempt to solve this problem by using synthetic biology methods.
Here is the link to their Wiki.
EXPERIMENT SECTION
With LanZhou
The ecdysone receptor (ECR) plays an important role in the molting, metabolism, development                                         and reproduction of insects. They tried to build an RNAi system to silence the ECR                                         gene.ECR silencing can effectively reduce the expression of these key genes, thereby                                         reducing the survival rate of insects and reproduction rate.
In their project, they need various functional vectors for dsRNA production, but                                         the gene sequence complementarity will cause secondary structure, which is impossible                                         to synthsize gene for one time. The task of constructing vectors is heavy. We helped                                         them to construct hpRNA producing vector ecrL, which sped up their vectors construction                                         progress.

We collaborate with SZU in Biobrick part as well. We tested and found that one of plasmid in 2018 Distribution Kit had error sequences and we sought for help from Team Shenzhen University. We than characterized the part together to make sure the sequence of Biobrick part is correct.
XMU-China
This year, the XMU_China team is also working on microfluidic chips for building a hardware platform, thus we think it would be beneficial to have a discussion over our projects and get some suggestions.
On 16th, Sep 2018, we had an online collaboration with this year’s XMU iGEM team. The two teams engaged fiercely in the discussions of projects and experiment techniques. Their core design is to set up a centrifugation disk to detect the single strand DNA as biomarker to some sort of disease in a cell-free system.
Our team laid questions and helped their team with the microfluidic chips and the flow parameters in the centrifugation system they were working on, and members from the XMU-China team mentioned that we should focus more on presenting our main idea as a synthetic biology related question and showed us the way to present it more coherently. They also gave some advice on cell signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions, and recommended several related articles to us.
Our team also got great inspirations from their design of Wiki pages and poster. It’s till this point that we realized how to create a more simple and concise Wiki page.
GreatBay_China
We assisted a high school team, GreatBay_China Team in Shenzhen. We invited them to our lab and introduced some basic concepts in Synthetic Biology. We exchanged our ideas on project design and provide some experimental and technical instructions. The high school team aimed to reconstruct the whole enzymatic pathway in both E.coli and yeast using Biobrick. They tried to build a stabilized promoter which can regulate the transcription level regardless of it copy number, which will be applicable for different transformation methods in Synthetic Biology. We also provided some experimental materials to help them to set up a better experimental procedure.

SoxR and pSoxS library design and characterisation
When we heard that the Oxford team would be using SoxR/SoxS parts we were excited to form a collaboration with them. While designing our constructs we realised a fairly significant limitation on the use of the SoxR/SoxS system: the lack of a characterised library. We saw an opportunity, and decided to design a library of our own to help us understand and exploit this genetic system further. In collaboration with the Oxford iGEM team, we designed a SoxR protein library and a pSoxS promoter library, which we characterised in our respective systems, the results of which can be found in our results page . Our improved part, submitted for a gold award, was taken from this library. We would like to thank the Oxford team for collaborating with us on this endeavour.
New Scientist Live Science Fair at the Excel Centre, London
New Scientist Live (NSL) was an amazing platform for presenting our project to the general public. The people we met were interested in science, but relatively unaware of the field of synthetic biology. With the Oxford team, we manned a booth at NSL for four days. We spoke to hundreds of guests about synthetic biology and our respective projects. Also, as part of the collaboration with Oxford, we designed a flyer with the aim of introducing synthetic biology and iGEM to the general public, as well as educating people on some basic molecular biology techniques we use in the lab. We would like to extend our warmest thanks to the Oxford team for collaborating with us on communicating our projects and the field of synthetic biology to the public.

We got in touch with the AQA_Unesp team from São Paulo State University as soon as we learned that they were also working on insulin. Their team is working to create probiotics that secrete insulin in the gut in response to glucose levels, and we thought it would be great for our teams to share our expertise on working with insulin.
We helped the Brazil team by giving them ideas and helping them to resolve issues regarding their lab work and integrated human practices. We also helped the AQA-Unesp team to use the modelling program MatLab. The two teams shared information about insulin prices and accessibility in Australia and Brazil, as well as transformation protocols and ideas for working with Bacillus subtilis.

But it turned out to be a really great experience for our entire team, as we grew more comfortable with IISER Mohali team. So much so, that we now are really confident about mentoring new teams and look forward to it in years to come. IISER Mohali Team members were really awesome, we had a great time mentoring them and we wish them all the best for all their future endeavours in the field of Synthetic Biology.

Michigan State’s iGEM team reached out to us after the conference that they hosted to ask for help putting some specific features into their wiki. We let them know which library was needed for a responsive animation, and helped test the design. The presentation of research cannot be overlooked, and we were happy to help Michigan State be satisfied with theirs!
Software Team - ProtoCat

We helped the University of Michigan’s Software iGEM team this year by testing their project, Protocat , which is a website that hosts user-submitted scientific protocols. We used several protocols from their website, testing the viability of the website and its user-friendliness. Michigan Software wants to provide a tool to make research simpler, and we--as a research student organization-- gave them feedback that we think will improve the experiences of people using that tool.

We are invited to test the front end of the project of the team HFUT-China for finding bugs and fix them. We found four bugs and design flaws.
1. When we clicked the button on the 'project' page to expand the gene chain list and delete designated gene chain, it might occasionally fail to delete although a notice of successful deletion is displayed. We discovered that it was caused by transaction locks of the database, which led to a failed concurrent Ajax request. This failure cannot be detected by the program, which would not stop the front end popping a successful notice.
2. The dragging-up of the recommending gene chain in the 'design' page might fail occasionally and the dragging function collapsed meanwhile until we refreshed it. It was diagnosed that problems were gestated in the interaction between the action scopes of AngularJS and NG-sortable database. We fixed it once after the bug was detected.
3. We found that there was not a clear button for registration, which made it difficult for users to register. It might affect the user experience.
4. Expanding the relationship network in the 'gene relationship' page may lead to the overlapping of the balls of surrounding genes.
We spent days on fixing bugs above and succeeded eventually. This experience contributed much on strengthening the bond between the team HFUT-China and us.
USTC
The procedure of the team USTC involved processing images of fluorescent cells. However, it required distinguishing the part of fluorescent cells from those non-fluorescent ones and the background as the pretreatment.
We calculated the distribution of the greyscale of images. Based on the distribution, we can determine which pixels may belong to fluorescent cells and which pixels may not.
Therefore we are able to cut out the part of fluorescent cells from remainders, which helped the team USTC solve this little tiresome problem.
SJTU-Software
We accepted the invitation from the team SJTU-Software to fill out their questionnaires. They told us that our opinions and advices on their project really mattered, which we were truly glad to see.

HFUT-China
We help the team HFUT-China to solve some biological problems and help them to validate their software, building a better platform or forum for iGEMers to communicate, especially about the parts. Here’s our suggestions about their search engine—Bio-Designer-Dolphin.
The searching engine—bio-designer-dophin, is very powerful. It consists of 4 different parts. The first one, the searching section, is the most useful tool on this website. Just type in the key words you are interested in, the Dophin will tell you all projects in iGEM competition over the last 12 years that are associated with your key words. For example, this year, our project is about bio-cathode, so the first try I did was to search bio-cathode. A few seconds later, all projects about bio-cathode would come up to me. No matter the awards they got or the biobricks they had submitted to the HQ would be sorted out. Then you can have a general understanding to this project. This function is so great as there have not been any search engine that is serve for iGEM competition especially. Besides, it also provides us a platform to design our project online, drawing out the gene circuit with any biobrick you want. Though it still has some problems if we want to search out the proper biobrick we want to use when we are designing. Thirdly, it also have a section called “Gene relationship”. In this part, the Dophin will show you the genes that have close relationship to the one you concern. This two parts can help us design and optimize our gene circuit more conveniently. The last section is called “System”. It’s a tool that you can use to search out the characterizations of some chemical compounds.

We have assisted other iGEM team in several dimensions. Interaction between iGEM teams definitely benefits the growth of synthetic biology. At the same time, we are very glad to achieve iGEM’s core value, which is to share resources with other teams.
Zamorano
This year Zamorano team focused on making a toxin that targets insects. They believe our biobricks from last year’s project, which are BBa_K1415202, BBa_K1415205 and the BBa_11415206 could be really helpful to them, hence they contacted us through our Facebook fan page. Our team shipped it to them immediately. Hopefully, our parts can really aid their project.
HSNU-TAIPEI
This year is HSNU's first year to participate in the iGEM competition. As a high school iGEM team, they demonstrated extreme team spirit. We sent them previous year iGEM kits and helped them finish their experiment more smoothly. Providing them with our full help, we hope that more high school students will participate in the iGEM competition.
Mindao
We helped Mindao when they called for helping them analyze protein amino acid component.
NTHU ( National Tsing Hua University )
We promoted the iGEM competition in NTHU. Also shared experience on how to run an iGEM team by inviting them to participate in our meet up. Moreover, we invited them to visit our lab. All of the help contributed lead to them forming their first iGEM team and they are going to join the giant jamboree in 2016.

Our collaboration efforts have lead the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology 2016 iGEM team to West Lafayette to visit the Purdue University iGEM team. Our goal of the trip on August 10th, 2016 was to travel to Purdue to make use of their fluorescence microscope. This machinery, which we learned later on in the day go for about 800,000 dollars, was used to capture crystal clear images of our yeast. However, before we could use this awesome machinery we had to first drive the hour and 45 minute trek up to West Lafayette. This meant waking up around 6:00am and drinking various drinks ranging from coffee to energy drinks to get our bodies going in the morning. The drive through the backroads was a peaceful one with music and conversation. Then we hit the college town of West Lafayette. Coming from a relatively small campus, it was a mess trying figure our way through the random one-way streets as we made our way to the parking garage. Our contact, Barrett Davis, was super helpful as he rode his bike to show us exactly where to park. After successfully parking on the third floor, we made our way downstairs to introduce ourselves to Barrett.
The route we took on our drive.
Once acquainted we made our way to the Chemistry and Seed Commissioner building where we were told we would be heading to the basement where the microscope was housed. Once we arrived at the bottom floor we were introduced to Dr. Schaber who was the microscope specialist at Purdue University. Dr. Schaber explained to us the basics of the hardware and software he was using then it was time to get to work. After using a very old and crude fluorescence microscope here at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, it was a shock to see the clarity of the pictures and the ease at which they were captured. After a couple hours and focusing on the cluster of cells we wanted, we felt confident that we had enough of our cells pictured for our results.
Dr. Schaber adjusting the microscope as Xintong observes.
After the wonderful results of our pictures we were all extremely hungry and decided we should walk around campus to try and find something to eat. Luckily for us, Purdue University is a very large campus that offers a wide variety of food options. As we sat"

I.3) Numerical evaluation
We have simulated the effect of arm length on free energy (low free energy implies high binding probability) using the Born salvation free model, pair van der Waals energy, and electrostatic potential, described above. However, there are some parameters that we are not sure about (Equivalent charge and Hamacker coefficient of Zinc fingers, equivalent charge and Hamacker coefficient of base pair) that depend on charge distribution of the DNA strand, which should be determined experimentally as boundary conditions. Alternatively, one could consider each base pair with independent charge.
The systems have been simulated in MATLAB.
Figure 1 shows a rendering of the bacteria - arm compound (E. Coli in blue, zinc fingers in red, arms in orange).
Figure 1. Rendering of bacteria connected to DNA arms through zinc fingers expressed superficially.
Figure 2 shows relative free energy against arm length. As expected, the longer the arms, the lower is the free energy, and thus the higher is the bonding probability.
Figure 2.Effect of arm length on free energy for a constant zinc finger surface distribution.
Figure 3 shows relative free energy against arm length, where the distribution of zinc fingers is randomized. We notice that the distribution of the zinc fingers plays a very important role in the binding as shown in the figure where the distribution is varied randomly, but the trend is more and less the same as when the distribution is assumed to be deterministic.
Figure 2.Effect of arm length on free energy for randomly distributed zinc finger distribution.
I.4) Conclusion
The bead approximation and thermodynamic information theoretical framework we proposed effectively captures the challenge of modeling binding probability where different DNA strands compete in binding with a multitude of zinc fingers. The model takes into account the geometry and charge magnitude distribution on the bacteria and the DNA strands.

BNU-China,2016," or not in E.coli. If microtubule assembles successfully, it means α-tubulin and β-tubulin have biological activities and have interaction in E.coli. So, FAFU-CHINA plan to use Co-Immunoprecipitation(CoIP) to confirm their interaction.
Design
Since pET30a(+) has His protein tag, they plan to add HA protein tag and Flag protein tag to the down-stream of α-tubulin and β-tubulin respectively . The target fragments are amplified by PCR and cloned to T vector and sequenced. Then they link the confirmed gene to pET30a(+) (enzyme site: XhoI, HindIII) .After that，they transform the recombination vector into expression strains(BL21)for culturing. When the concentration of bacterium is appropriate (OD is 0.6-0.8), they induce the strains by 1 mmol IPTG. By using ultrasonic waves to break the cell of bacteria and centrifuging, they obtain the pellet and deal with the inclusion body for the further experiment of Co-Immunoprecipitation(CoIP).

♦iGEM Southern California Meet-up♦
The SoCal iGEM Meet-up was a great opportunity for our team to share ideas and challenges with one another. iGEM members from UCLA, UCSD, Alverno High School and Marburg attended the meet-up. Each team gave a presentation on their project and were given feedback from the other teams. We then went on to discuss the structures of our iGEM teams, challenges we face, and solutions that might work for those challenges.   Discussion lead to relationships and mini mentorships being built as the high school members of our team were able to stay in contact with Alverno High, a first year iGEM team, to mentor them through some of the struggles they were facing. It was decided that Southern California is the best. :)
