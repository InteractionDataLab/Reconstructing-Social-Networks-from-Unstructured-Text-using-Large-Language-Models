Intra-Provincial Collaboration
IISc Bangalore: Modelling
In terms of modelling, we created a system that was modelled the buoyancy of GVP proteins, independently of diffusion. We had assumed that diffusion plays a negligible role in the overall speed of the E. coli bacteria that eventually rise to the top. However, after collaborating with the IISc Bangalore 2017 team, who is also working with gas vesicles, they informed us that diffusion plays a significant role in the buoyancy of the bacteria. They highlighted this importance by their Peclet number (Pe) calculation: the ratio of the rate of advection of a physical quantity by the flow to the rate of diffusion of the same quantity driven by an appropriate gradient. When they calculated this number for very similar environmental conditions as ours, they found that this number was on the order of 10^(-3), a lot smaller when compared to 1. This evidently suggested that diffusion is dominant over adjective transfer and must be considered during our calculations.
Since the IISc team was also working with gas vesicles, our collaboration did not stop at modelling. Over the course of the iGEM period, our team continued to discuss experiment plans, objectives, results and tips that could help the both teams succeed. In the future, Team UAlberta and Team IISc will continue to benefit heavily by combining their manpower and resources to strive for the goals collectively.
UrbanTundra Edmonton, Sister Team
Throughout the course of the summer, the members of Team UrbanTundra had become an extended part of our iGEM family. In both general lab training and the InterLab Study did we develop a robust collaboration. A large majority of UrbanTundra had not had previous experience with the techniques of molecular biology. So, as many of members of Team UAlberta had been in the same boat in iGEM 2016, we were glad to help acquaint UrbanTundra with the skills they would need. Over a series of several days did we train their members in the various laboratory protocols that are commonly used in synthetic biology. This included guiding them through a workflow which"

iGEM-Team BOKU Vienna
For the Interlab Study we got 2x100µl competent cells NEB® 5-alpha Competent E. coli (High Efficiency). Therefore we picked them up from their team (Vienna) and transported them in a dry ice box to graz to our lab.
iGEM-Team Marburg
We attended at their own interLab study. For this we had to do the GFP-experiment, like the one we did for the Igem interlab study. But this time we did it with the vibrio natriegens strain. Team Marburg sent us a toolkit and a description. Unfortunately, we got no valid results because we made some mistakes with the cells and had no backup. After that they sent us transformed cells (on agar plates) for a second round but the plates were not valuable because of too much moist inside the plates.
iGEM-Team Tec Monterrey
We participated in their #scienceeverywhere challenge where we took a photo in the traditional Austrian outfit called “Tracht”. For this challenge, we had to take a photo with a sign, which said how far away our hometown is from the giant jamboree. In addition, they invited all the attendants to their presentation at the giant jamboree.
iGEM-Team HAFS
The Hankuk Academy of foreign Studies had an inserat to challenge our cooking skills. They invited all Teams to send them a traditional recipe of their hometown. Therefore, we sent them our “Styrian pumpkin cream soup” recipe. It´s a very popular meal in Austria and it tastes amazing.

Collaboration with NUS Singapore Team-A
Our team did not get desirable results when probes are expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). While Team NUS Singapore-A initially wanted to explore using RNA aptamers as a reporter system for the stress promoter htpG1, they had difficulties in cloning the construct for months. When they discovered that we are working on aptamer and the expression of it in E. coli, their team leader, Nanda, has a small meet-up with our wet lab team members in Hong Kong. We saw that our projects are closely related and there is an opportunity for collaboration.
Nanda (far left) with the members from CUHK iGEM team
After the discussion, we found out that their team has BL21 Star (DE3), a RNase-knockout strain of E. coli. As we expected see stronger signals from expressing the fluoescent RNA probes, we asked for this strain from them, which they kindly delivered it to us in the form of dried filter paper. We made competent cells from it and performed the assay again .
We received the package!
On the other hand, NUSGEM needed help on RNA aptamer constructions. While de novo gene synthesis or PCR from plasmids did not work for them, we have succeeded in cloning using oligo PCR, a design that allows the partially overlapping oligos to extend and form the desired gene fragment. We attached the Spinach aptamers to either a constitutive lpp promoter as a positive control, or a htpG1 promoter for their assay. Both teams agreed on constructing the constructs from both teams simultaneously, using the set of primers which our team has designed. In the end, their cloning was finally successful and is documented in the parts registry ( BBa_K2819010 ).

UCAS,2017," coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR"

Collaboration with the iGEM Stockholm
The iGEM team from Karolinska Institutet (KI)/Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH) has a similar project and we want to thank them for always being open to discuss ideas. As part of our project regarding bacteriocins, we wanted to check the bactericidal effect on different bacterial strains. Stockholm (KTH/KI) contributed with that by performing a MIC test of crude cell extract containing our bacteriocins. Three different strains were used namely S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. Cloacae. Stockholms contribution with the MIC test made us able to compare their results to ours. For further information check out Demonstration & Results.
Collaboration with the Danish Technical University
We assisted the iGEM team from the Danish Technical University with the selection of a BioBrick. Their BioBrick did not express the desired gene, we suggested the use of K880005 instead.
Collaboration with Copenhagen University
Birka chaired a workshop on mathematic modelling, held at the Danish Technical University.
Collaboration with Chalmers University
At the Human Practices workshop in Copenhagen, our philosopher began a collaboration with Chalmers University. The iGEM team from Chalmers had made sci-fi novels as a way of presenting problems that could occur when working with GMO's. Our philosopher then made a sci-fi story for them, in dialogue style. The dialogue is focused on the Precautionary Principle.
Collaboration with the University of Virginia
The iGEM team from the University of Virginia asked us to help them by answering a survey, which we were more than happy to do.
Collaboration with the LMU and TUM Munich
We helped the LMU and TUM Munich iGEM team out by answering their survey about entrepreneurship. They had some great thoughts concerning the possibilities in creating a business through iGEM.

iGEM Work Environment Evaluation
During 2018, our team has collaborated with many other igem teams worldwide. Besides keeping close contact with all Nordic Teams through a common slack workspace for the project managers we have worked together in various other ways.
Vidilab
From the start Vidilab has been a loyal partner; giving us not only information about the problem that needs solving but also with the equipment needed for RNA sequencing.  In addition, they sponsored us with financial support in order to further develop the field of veterinary diagnostics.
Vidilab has throughout the summer been kind enough to provide us with fecal samples. This company has been a bridge between us and horse owners, giving us invaluable contacts and sharing our market analysis.

iGEM Stockholm
Since 2017, iGEM Uppsala and iGEM Stockholm have been collaborating to host panel discussions. This year we have evolved the concept making it a science symposium with two sessions, the first about how to maintain a healthy mental state while working in science and the second about biohacking. What’s also new is that Lund has also joined the event and the work in arranging it. The work started in June and we starting having meetings in early July, with a session every second week. The symposium was held at Uppsala University in late September where students, professors and previous iGEM participants attended. You can find more information about the event on the human practices page!
Furthermore, iGEM Uppsala and iGEM Stockholm have had a close relationship this year and held several social events together such as BBQs.

Bordeaux,2018,"The European meeting organised by the IGEM Munich team took place from the 20th to 22th of July. The organizers welcomed             4 of our members (Yasmine, Jean Clément, Anaïs and David) in a good mood, offering them badges and goodies.
We then attended lectures given by Friedrich Simmel and Kristen Jung, researchers at the University of Munich. Afterwards,             the members of the Munich team were kind enough to show us the city and we finished the evening at the English             Garden with all the other teams.
The following two days we were able to share our experiences during various workshops and games. We had the opportunity             to present our poster to the other teams during these 3 days. This allowed us to get feedbacks on our project,             on our experimental approach and on the way our project is presented.
On the last evening we shared dinner followed by a few drinks with our new friends from various iGEM teams. This meeting was definitely worth the trip!
Marseille:
The mediterranean meetup took place in Marseille on the 9th and 10th of August, 2 members of iGEM Bordeaux attended             this meetup (David and Estelle). First of all we had a presentation of the project of each team in 180 seconds,             a very interesting and challenging training. The afternoon was supposed to be booked for the Marseille tour, but the weather             did not agree. However many discussion between the teams and the general good mood saved this afternoon and we spent             the night in some pubs with many teams to continue sharing our feelings and experiences about the competition.
The second day we attended several workshops about bioethics and after iGEM, those workshop were very interesting. The             afternoon we had a poster session with some guests, all researchers at Marseille University. We received many great comments, a perfect way to keep our motivation             . Overall it was a wonderful meetup full of good people and relevant workshops."

iGEM Team Düsseldorf
iGEM Team Düsseldorf for iGEM Team Aachen
Our teams met for the first time at the German iGEM meetup in Marburg held in the beginning of August. There we exchanged our project ideas. We found out that both our projects are dealing with light activation. We discussed different ideas to irradiate our samples. iGEM Team Düsseldorf uses a so called light box, where the LED is fixed at the top and can be used to irradiate the samples with light of a specific wavelength. This seemed to be a good device for our activation process too.
iGEM Düsseldorf offered to build such a light box for our project as well. Because we need a specific wavelength for the activation of our non-canonical amino acid, we sent them one of our LEDs. They integrated this LED in their device and created a similar device for our purpose.
We used the device to study the activation of O-(2-Nitrobenzyl)-L-tyrosine (ONB-Y). ONB-Y was exposed to UV light for different exposure times. The activated ONB-Y samples were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The results reveal that when the exposure time was increased the cleavage of ONB-Y was higher. This was confirmed by the presence of a peak corresponding to 2-nitroso benzaldehyde i.e. the cleaved product.

If you want to see more details for what purpose we used the light box, go to E.coli - targeting tyrosine irradiation point.

University iGEM Collaborations
1. Oxford University iGEM
We participated with Oxford iGEM via skype calls, where we shared some of our most frequently asked questions from public outreach and saw that the question of how to keep genetically engineered bacteria contained from public release was a consistent question for both projects.
In addition, we shared with them our solution to this problem: 0.2 micron membrane filters from Sterlitech which can be used to make bacteria ""pills"". We also shared with them our user-friendly generator for markdown versions of the Wiki, in order for their team to more easily edit their Wiki content. The generator can be found here: https://github.com/igemuoftATG/generator-igemwiki
2. OGEM - Ontario Genetically Engineered Machine
OGEM is a consortium of iGEM teams from across Ontario. We met at different campuses over the summer term (at University of Toronto and Queen's University) to discuss how progress was moving along for all of the teams, and most importantly, to discuss any issues or roadblocks the other teams could help with. This lead to collaboration specifically with Waterloo iGEM.
3. Waterloo iGEM
Our partnership with Waterloo iGEM involved bringing copies of their surveys on the public perception of gene editing and genetically modified organisms to Toronto and Alberta, in order to broaden the scope of their research. Their research results also similarly aid our team in gaging what level of knowledge the public tend to have regarding issues such as GMO release, which is useful knowledge for the public outreach of our project.

The team, and especially their team leader, who continued working on their project, gave us tips about the design and the assembly of the switches and generally about many wet lab issues that we came up against.
iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2018 Team
The Bielefeld-CeBiTec team shared with us a slide-show they prepared about Dual Use and Research of Concern. They informed us on these topics in the context of science and explained how they form a part of Biosecurity issues. We supported their commendable effort to raise awareness on such important topics by viewing the slides at the Molecular Virology Laboratory of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute where we conduct our experiments. The Bielefeld-CeBiTec team granted us the Dual Use Awareness button.
iGEM Erlangen 2018 Team
Both team Erlangen and our team created a video for their Human Practices. In order to make it accessible to more teams and people around the world, our teams translated each other’s video script in their own language, so that the translated script can be used as subtitles. Thus, our video has German subtitles, and iGEM Erlangen Team’s video has Greek subtitles!
iGEM EPFL 2018 Team
Having just started our iGEM journey, we sought out for teams with previous experience on the diagnostic mechanism we had chosen: the toehold switch. We initially contacted the iGEM EPFL team in order to work as a liaison with Aptasense, the previous year’s team. Yet, that was only to find out that we share much more in common than what we initially thought; cell - free systems utilization and materialization of a diagnostic kit stands in the core of both of our projects. That stood as the beginning of a meaningful collaboration. The EPFL team shared with us their expertise on cell-free system optimization and provided insightful tips on our experimental design. From our part, we assisted the EPFL team set the basic lines and specifications for their kit design. Throughout several skype calls during this summer, we tried to identify the key characteristics our suggested mechanisms should enclose, as well as the needs we should address. Yannis had the chance to meet in person with the team, spend time in the lab with them and discuss future collaboration plans. Since both teams are planning to keep on working on their projects after the course of the competition, we decided to set a common timetable on realizing our kits. To this"
Tec-Chihuahua,2017,"ajara and Tec-CEM, working together in the development of an experiment manual validated by SEP (Secretaria de Educación Pública) containing 30 scientific experiments. Our main objective was to motivate and involve elementary schools’ children in scientific subjects. The experiments were divided into three blocks by complexity: easy level experiments were planned for to 6-8-year-old children, intermediate level for 9-11 years and finally the expert level for 12-13 year-olds.
The three teams planned to present one experiment of each section in three different elementary schools. The team attempted to explain the theoretical framework of the experiment widely and performed step by step each experiment together with the children to ensure the correct realization of each experiment. At the end of the experiments, a survey and some general questions about the experiments were asked to the children to know the quality of the information given by the team and the satisfaction level of the children while they carried the experiments out.
Meetup
The ""Mexican Teams Meetup"" had several activities. Amongst them was a collaboration in Human Practices, which laid the foundations for the Laboratory Handbook. This handbook is a guide that aims to introduce children from elementary school to science, and a presentation of the progress that we had until that point regarding our project. It also helped us see our areas of opportunity, which consequently allowed us to improve and be able to be more competitive in the Giant Jamboree. Although these were the technical aspects of the meeting, it was thanks to this meetup that we were able to establish relationships with the members of the various teams that participated. This experience has not only helped us with areas concerning the project but has also made the iGEM community of Mexico closer and stronger than ever.
IONIS PARIS
The IONIS Paris team contacted us for a team collaboration. We worked together for several months, mainly focusing in Human Practices and Modeling. The IONIS modeling team helped us to visualize one of our enzymes: “yhjH,” based on bibliography and the optimal enzyme conditions, they managed to simulate it in silico, helping us to establish and assume model parameters and enzyme behavior, among other things. Our teams also managed to collaborate in Human Practices. Based on the IONIS human practices project, some of our team members contacted winegrowers and oenologists to interview them about how climate change has affected their vineyards. The information gathered was used for a comparative framework between French and Mexican wine production actual adversities. During the meetings with the experts, we also discussed the IONIS team proposal, so they could let them know their points of view"
Aalto-Helsinki,2018," His-tag instead. We also discussed about which E. coli strains would be more suitable for cloning and producing the protein and ended up using different production chassis which we could then compare. Besides silk-related work, together we went through troubleshooting about several parts of our project, such as Human Practices.
iGEM Toulouse
iGEM Toulouse
As the iGEM Toulouse team was working on functionalizing cellulose, we met them on Skype to discuss our respective approaches on cellulose binding. We planned to have a collaboration in which we would send them our birch cellulose nanofibrils and receive their bacterial cellulose produced by Gluconacetobacter hansenii, so that both teams could test their own products on two different substrates. Unfortunately, due to time limitations we could not complete this collaboration, but it would have been a great opportunity to further test the binding affinity of our final products.
iGEM Düsseldorf
iGEM Düsseldorf
We decided to participate in iGEM Düsseldorf’s Postcards collaboration idea. The goal of this collaboration was to design synthetic biology themed postcards to bring the topic closer to the general public. Every participating team created a postcard related to their project or synthetic biology in general and sent 100 printed postcards to Düsseldorf iGEM team. They then took care of sending back to each team 50 postcards together with 50 postcards from other teams. In this way, each team would have a range of hands-on materials to share with their local community during public engagement events. Our postcard design represented the theme of our project: colors and dyeing.

NUS_Singapore
In their project, the NUS_Singapore team was also tackling the environmental pollution caused by the textile dyeing industry by producing natural dyes with synthetic biology. Given the affinity of our goals, we decided to collaborate on human practices. On the one hand, we joined our efforts in finding reliable and unambiguous sources on the issue, to have a better and more consistent picture of the damages that textile dyeing is doing to the environment and human populations. On the other hand, we agreed to parallelly write learning materials about sustainability that could be potentially used to educate the fashion industry players about natural dyes. Unfortunately, this second part of the collaboration was not completed due to our busy schedules, yet both projects benefited from our thorough discussions about the textile industry.

SCUT-FSE-CHINA
        We mentored a new team SCUT-FSE-CHINA. We shared with them                     the experience of how to form an iGEM team, and guided them in the rules, timelines and precautions of                     the competition. Besides, we mentored them how to standardize the genes. In return, they assisted us the design of modeling and help us write some parts of code of the MATLAB.

SYSU-Software
        We met SYSU-Software in April on a meet-up meeting among                     teams in Southern China. This year we use the Mer-merr bi-direction promoter to sense mercury (Hg) in                     the environment. If the concentration of Hg transcend a threshold, Hg can repress the repressor of cds                     of SRRz protein, which will lead to the expression of SRRz protein. Cells lysis process could be detected                     because the release of the beta-galactosidase which is not able to spread cross the cell membrane at                     a normal situation will trigger the chromogenic reaction of oNPG whose tube will turn yellow. Since we                     were not aware of whether the design could work and the approximate range of expression level of the                     SRRz gene before the experiment, we reached out for them to do a simulation for their genetic circuits.
Solution & Results
        They built a model for our project using the same algorithm                     that utilized in their software simulation section. The following is the circuit we designed for our                     project redrawn by their design platform.
        For a preciser measurement of the expression of their                     gene, SRRz gene, we used GFP as a reporter in this case alternatively. Their model simulated the concentration                     of the GFP expressed in our system. The mathematic formula and parameters' and the results are as follows:

Collaboration with EpiphanyNYC
We collaborated with the nearby EpiphanyNYC team, located in Manhattan, New York City.
We sent EpiphanyNYC some DNA samples to quantify, since they have equipment we do not have access to that can accurately quantify the concentration of DNA. This will help validate our method for DNA quantification (a type of dot-blot technique using Ethidium Bromide) and test the standard curves we generated.
In return, we completed a survey for EpiphanyNYC on genetic safety."
CMUQ,2017," concentrated at areas of high SRB growth this will be more efficient.
Since the Pitt iGEM’s project works with optical control of bacteria movement, while iGEM CMUQ’s project works with biosensors and biofilm degradation, combining these projects to optically direct the degradation of bacterial biofilms to appropriate sites will be beneficial for regulating the localization to a greater degree.

IIT Delhi
Together with IIT Delhi we were increasing each other’s Social Media impact, jointly built up an RNA isolation and purification pipeline in India and helped each other with circling samples and research equipment between India, Germany and the US.
How everything came into existence:
In the beginning of 2017 Berlin diagnostX launched their Facebook Page. Back then the team did not even know whether they would ever participate in the iGEM competition. They were a group of students lacking funding and a laboratory, but were planning on building a diagnostic test for Taenia Solium. They wanted to do so within the framework of the iGEM competition. Since social media is an important factor to gain financial support, Noa from Berlin diagnostX contacted iGEM IIT Delhi to ask whether they would be willing to share each others posts to gain more followers and increase the reach of our posts. This small-scale collaboration worked promoting each other on social media. This initial collaboration laid the foundation for our extensive collaboration – because without this pre-existing contact, Berlin diagnostX may not have skyped with iGEM IIT Delhi before travelling to India.
A first Gasp of transcontinental research
Later in 2017 Henrik and Dimi of Team diagnostX flew to India to establish new research cooperations. Because their journey would lead them through Delhi they contacted iGEM IIT to visit their lab and exchange research ideas. Throughout a first skype call with Kshitij and Tarun, all got along so well, that the idea emerged to jointly build a pipeline, that would allow local PCR and RNA isolation of/on lysed, non-infectious S1-security level samples, that Berlin diagnostX planned to acquire from India.
With that in mind Berlin diagnostX tried to order some RNA isolation kits and PCR reagents to the lab of iGEM IIT but it turned out that multinational companies like NEB, ThermoFisher and QI"
NTU-Singapore,2016," operon genes)-Ct(Induced Ampicillin gene)
Finally, use ΔCt(test)2- ΔCt(control)1 to get ΔΔCt
As shown from the above bar charts, with 0.5Mm,1.0mM and 1.5mM of IPTG induction, there is only slight increase of gene expression level by only 2-3 fold. However, with 2.0Mm of IPTG induction, there is much greater fold change of more than 2-3 folds. It is worth to notice that the RT-PCR efficiency might be different for different genes due to their size of PCR products and the formula used above is assuming the PCR efficiency to be 100% that eventually resulted in 2 copies of products.
Advise and information sharing with Team Macquarie on HemH gene knock-out in bacterial genome
Macquaire iGEM team members wish to knock-out HemH gene in DH5α using CRIPSR-based system. HemH gene is responsible to encode ferrochelatase enzyme that insert ferrous ion into protoporphyrin ring IX. By knocking out this gene, protoporphyrin ring IX can be redirected for the production of chlorophyll a instead of heme.
As the CRISPR-Cas based bacterial genome editing application is relatively unexplored and underpresented, our team is helpful in advising Macquiare iGem team that it is not preferable to use CRISPR-Cas based system for bacterial genome editing . This is because later we have realized that lethal effect has been associated with CRISPR-induced double-stranded break on targeted gene. This phenomenon can be explained by low occurrence of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), one of the DNA break repairing mechanism in bacteria.  Hence, this lead to irreversible DNA breakage . Thus, in this situation, CRISPR-Cas system is used as a selection force rather as primary editing tool.By this selection system, only successfully recombined or modified cells are able to survive.
As a proof of concept, this lethal effect can be shown from CRISPR-based HemH gene knock-out results that accomplished by Macquarie team. When they try to introduce purified Cas9 protein with a series of concentrations for HemH gene targeting,cells with higher amount of Cas9 protein shows significant slower cell growth. For Cas9 concentration such as 17uM, cell growth are almost negligible.This again highlight the lethal effect of high concentration of Cas9.

Franconia,2017,"asmid for selection.             We performed the test with different concentrations of the antibiotic and – for control – with ampicillin, water and MeOH, resulting in the pictures presented below.
Hence, the tested antibiotic works just as well as ampicillin against C. glutamicum.    We really enjoyed this collaboration, as we think the project from Tübingen is very interesting and the work on novel antibiotics is very important – especially in the fight against bacteria that are resistant against traditional antibiotics. So, thank you very much Tübingen!

Sydney_Australia,2016,". The UNSW team performed a Western Blot for us using anti-His antibody conjugated to HRP to verify our proteins were expressed with a His6-Tag.  Additionally we both looked at the laws surrounding the use of GMOs in Australia and in other countries such as the contrast between developed countries and developing countries.
We also shared progress and experiences through an informal meet-up overflowing with laughs and pizza!
Michigan, USA: Misconceptions of SynBio Articles
We contributed two articles to the Michigan iGEM team’s website about common misconceptions in the synthetic biology world. We wrote about the misconception that antibiotics can treat all infections, like the common cold or the flu, and the misconception that all E. coli are dangerous.
Skype meeting(s) with iGEM Toronto, Auckland and NCKU-Tainan
Despite being from land down under, we conducted skype meetings with a variety of other iGEM teams to discuss our projects so far, and to share any advice and learning experiences that we’ve had. It was great to learn so much about the brilliant work going on in other labs and super-exciting to see all the potential improvements synbio can bring to the world!
Specifically, we shared ideas and codes for phone apps for readout of reporter protein biosensing systems with iGEM Toronto. We also exchanged thoughts about biosensor design, particularly on having cell-free extracts on paper. We love your project on gold – in this case, all that glitters is definitely gold!
With iGEM Auckland, we shared protocols for protein expression and His-Tag purification and also collaborated on contacting industry partners relevant to each other’s respective projects. We reached out to waste management companies and thought leaders in Sydney for the Auckland team, and they reached out to horticultural companies in Auckland for us to get advice from!

AHUT_China,2018," gas ratio which can be found in literatures .The corresponding proportion of the gas was mixed manually and the gas was injected into water to prepare an unsaturated solution. The content of carbon dioxide in the solution was tested continuously according to the time of the gas entering, and this was used as the data source of our mathematical modeling.
First of all.By using MATLAB to conduct the correlation analysis of the experimental data,we found that the color readings (five dimensions: B, G, R, H, S) showed a certain linear correlation with the concentration of carbon dioxide.This conclusion is consistent with the other conclusion ,which obtains its conclusion by using lambert-beer's absorption law. That is, there is a certain relationship between the substance concentration and the color reading. Secondly, using the multiple regression of statistics to carry out regression analysis on the data, the relationship between the material concentration and the color reading (five-dimensional) is obtained, and the appropriate mathematical expression (or mathematical model) between them is determined as the empirical formula or regression equation.
A mathematical model for determining color readings and carbon dioxide concentration - a linear regression equation. Firstly, a linear regression model between carbon dioxide concentration and color reading is established. The residual of the model is large and the fitting effect is not good.
Considering establishing a nonlinear quadratic regression model.Using the rstool function modeling in the MATLAB statistical toolbox, and evaluating the pros and cons of the model by residual standard deviation and residual. In the final nonlinear quadratic regression model, the residual standard deviation is small, the prediction model is very good, and the residual of the model is reduced by an order of magnitude compared with the multiple linear regression model. Therefore, the linear quadratic regression model is better than the linear regression model. The comparison of the errors of the two models shows that the nonlinear regression quadratic equation has higher precision.
In the process of project communication with each other, we learned that they had a little trouble in modeling. It may be that Northeast Forestry University-China did not fully consider the influence of external factors on the experiment, which led to some errors in the model establishment. Through our tests, we found that the lethal efficiency of their calculations was wrong. After we found the problem, we told them in time and helped them improve the model.
The Northeast Forestry University iGEM team (NEFU-China) also helped us to test the safe reliability of our model. Through this cooperation, the friendship between our two teams was strengthened and the progress of the project was promoted. Both sides regard it as a fairly successful collaboration.

Since collaboration is one of the hallmarks and core concepts of iGEM, cooperating with Chinese iGEMers has always been our tradition and focus since we set up team NJU-China. Through collaborations and partnerships with other Chinses iGEM team, we share our idea, provide assistance within our capability, promote our friendships, and strengthen our understanding of synthetic biology. And on this page, we would like express our heartfelt gratitude towards all the teams below that we have kept sound cooperative relationship with this year. Furthermore, we expect that all of these will pave the way for a deeper cooperation and are looking forward to build friendships with more iGEMers around the world in the near future.
schoolCollaboration with SYSU-Software
In order to design short hairpin RNA (shRNA) conform to demands in our experiments, we cooperated with SYSU-Software from Sun Yat-sen University to develop a corresponding software. We provided algorithms and design requirements, and then SYSU-Software wrote this delicate software for us. With their help, we successfully designed K-ras shRNA, whose sequence and predicted structure are shown below (Fig. 1). We validated that this shRNA was able to down-regulate the expression level of K-ras in A549 effectively. We thank SYSU-Software for receiving us with attention and for such strong contribution to our work.

Team Düsseldorf Cologne (postcard exchange)
We collaborated with Team Düsseldorf Cologne and other teams worldwide to create and distribute our postcard making our sophorolipid research more accessible to the public. We created the graphics and composed the text for our postcard design. Team Düsseldorf Cologne generously provided for the cost of printing and distributing many copies of our postcard. Our postcard was mixed into the distribution of all participating iGEM teams’ postcards that was mailed to each of the 28 participating teams.
The front side of the postcard is shown below.
The text on the reverse side of our postcard reads:
Sophorolipids are non-toxic, biodegradable alternatives to current petrochemical-derived surfactants. Their anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-microbial activities may enable therapeutic use. The difficulty of systematically changing their structures to find structure-property relationships and the challenge of producing homogeneous molecules rather than mixtures of different products have barred their previous use in therapeutics. Our project aims to produce uniform sophorolipid products with control over the fatty acid structure. With genetic engineering, we can selectively repress active domains of the MFE-2 enzyme. This could enable the yeast to make uniform sophorolipids with desired fatty acid structures while limiting metabolic stress on the yeast. We will then investigate purified sophorolipids to define structure-biological property relationships. Ultimately, we aim to identify potent new sophorolipid therapeutic agents.
Team Franconia (Biological themed card game)
We collaborated with Team Franconia to design a sophorolipid card for their educational card game. Working from a template file provided by Team Franconia, we provided an image showing the sophorolipid structure and the explanatory text for the caption. Team Franconia will print our card as part of the game that their team will bring to the Giant Jamboree in Boston. Our sophorolipid card is shown below."

    1.Collaboration with Harvard
 The grand iGEM Jamboree is coming, and a lot of teams have put out applications for various collaborations on the iGEM website. Fortunately, we got an opportunity to be part of the team Harvard (Fighting Stigma Against Synthetic Biology), and we also wanted to promote communication between us through the cooperation.
This year, Harvard wants to work with other teams to end the misunderstanding of synthetic biology. We found that human exposure to bacteria tends to have negative effects, which is as something dangerous. As an iGEM team, we understand that genetically engineered bacteria are largely untapped resources, helping us show the world the true potential of using such a bacteria for treatment, diagnosis, environment and so on.Harvard plans to release a series of articles to show all the cool things and germs the team is working on. Besides, they want introductions of other teams’projects, so we send ours to them on request.
Here is the introduction of our project. In the wake of the increasing greenhouse exerting more serious impacts on the global environment, the question of how to efficiently deal with CO2 is particularly critical. However, the traditional gas collection technology featured by high energy consumption and low efficiency is not yet mature enough. Meanwhile, it is these characteristics that have limited the development of itself.Our project is to obtain carbonic anhydrase (CA-2) with high thermal stability through computer simulation of the protein molecules expressed by carbonic anhydrase gene locus mutation, and import it into escherichia coli cells to achieve efficient collection of CO2.
We are honored to participate in this cooperation, and hope that through this channel we can reduce the misunderstanding of genetic engineering.

Collaboration with Tec-Monterrey Team
We met the Tec-Monterrey team thanks to the fact that they got in touch with us through social networks. As we share a language with this team it has been easier for us to relate and thanks to it, 2 collaborations have come out:
Computational modeling of structures of interest
This has been the most important collaboration with this team. Our team has a member with knowledge of prediction and editing computation of biological molecule structures. They asked us if we could obtain the structure of 3 proteins of interest for their project and perform some animation in which the protein was observed from different points of view. To obtain all the structures of the proteins, the procedure explained in the Computational improvement section was followed:
Protein Structure Predicion
The 3 proteins were the following ones:
CAS1 and CAS2
These two proteins often form a complex and have been studied on numerous occasions. The animations are the following:
RT EC86
This protein is a retrotranscriptase. And yet it has not been so studied and its structure had to be predicted.
Mentoring in the wiki building
For the reason that in our team there is no one specialized in web design and wiki building, nobody had the necessary knowledge to start with the formation of the wiki. That's why we took advantage of the fact that we already had contact with this team to ask them to mentor us in some decisions when building the wiki. He was asked for help us in understanding how to upload the different files, about the operation of the templates and the scripts.
Mentoring of Valencia Team
For the reason that in our team there is no one specialized in web design and wiki building, nobody had the necessary knowledge to start with the formation of the wiki.  Knowing it is not a trivial task, we decided to contact an experience team in iGEM such as  the Valencia UPV and take advantage of their experience to help us building  and working  with the wiki.
They answered us and  offered  to mentor our team about  building the wiki, as it was a great opportunity to make a collaboration between teams,  we happily agreed.
We schedule a meeting via Skype with two of their teammates in charged of software ( Héctor and Blanca) who guided us through the main concerns we had at the moment:
- A general explanation of how the media wiki platform works.
- How to upload the different files.
- The operation of the templates and the scripts.
They also shared with us some useful tricks, they have learn along"
BostonU,2013,"
We are also working closely with the Purdue Biomakers team this year to work on a standardized data sheet.
While working from the 2012 BostonU Team’s start on the Data Sheet app, we learned that the Purdue Biomaker’s team had a very similar concept in mind for creating a standardized way of sharing information about parts.
Early in June, we contacted the Purdue team to let them know that much of the groundwork has already been laid by the 2012 team here at BostonU. We shared our rough draft of the data sheet format with them and inquired if they had any plans to write software to implement the new data sheet.   By July, the Purdue replied to us that the would like to use our data sheet draft as the basis for the project. Purdue’s team members had been collecting survey data from over 75 teams around the world to find out what information they thought was essential to a data sheet and showed them a version of our draft. Purdue also video chatted with several teams to demonstrate what the data sheet’s functionality and ask for more feedback. We also video chatted with Purdue to discuss more changes to the data sheet format and how we wanted to propose that we would build a web app to create the datasheets. Each team began to develop a simple mock up of what we envisioned for the user interface and shared them with each other.
In early August, Thomas flew out to Indiana to visit Charlotte Hoo and Chris Thompson from the Purdue team to show them our progress and plans on the web app. At the meeting, we compared programs at talked about what the final product might look like. Both teams mutually agreed that the BostonU team would handle all of the software side of things while Purdue, with their extensive network of team contacts, would continue to refine some of the specific assay data fields for the data sheet and work on distribution and promotion of the new standard. Furthermore, one of our other collaborators, Jake Beal of BBN Technologies heard about our collaboration through iGEM HQ and offered to give some advice on the information that would be needed in the flow cytometry section of the data sheet.
Corporate Collaborations
We are collecting large quantities of characterization data from our flow cytometry experiments.  To analyze this data, we have been working with BBN Technologies and utilizing their BBN Synthetic Biology Tools . These tools came out of the TASBE project, which was a collaborative effort between BBN Technologies, the Densmore Lab at Boston Univeristy, and the Weiss Lab at MIT.

Tongji-software team
In the process of our project, we had some difficulty in network visualization. Just then Tongji-software team got in touch with us. They had some problem in the COBRA toolbox, hoping to get some help from us. Since they had completed the visualization work, they could help us with front-end visualization. So we decided to communicate face to face.
On September 23rd, we met each other in our lab. Tongji-software gave us some suggestions on network visualization and showed us how D3.js package was used. They helped us to deploy the package with an example. And we taught them the FVA function in COBRA toolbox and some methods to do gene knockout analysis on the result of flux balance analysis as well. They added this function into their software later.
Besides the communication on projects, our team leader Yangzhen Wei shared some experience in Giant Jamboree as an old iGEMer. What’s more, he shared some tips about transportation, climate, sightseeing in Boston.
USTC-software team
After completing our tool box, we invited USTC-software to run our β test. And they gave us some feedbacks. They pointed out problems on user guiding, and gave us their opinions. Then we improved our software in the way they recommended, making our software more user-friendly.
We also participated in their test. Their software, Biohub was an experiment process recording tool. It was convenient for process-experiment recording. Creating process module and sharing them in the community facilitated the communication between researchers. We gave them advices on visualization and multithreading experiment recording. In the end, we exchanged some of the visualization methods.

Team FSU
Teams from both the University of Florida and Florida State University participated in iGEM during the 2017 competition cycle. Our collaboration last year consisted of video conferences and a joint YouTube channel. This year, we decided to step it up a notch and meet each other in person! The first team collaboration event was a Florida iGEM Summer Social hosted by the UFlorida team. We started off the day with icebreakers and team introductions. Each team then presented a project overview and future experimental goals. Aspects of community outreach, human practices, and future collaborations were also discussed among students. This portion especially provided insight about how the UFlorida team could expand our project. It also set the foundation for our future collaboration involving diagram modeling.
After all the technical and experimental conversations, it was time to eat! Everyone carpooled to our university’s Lake Wauberg recreational complex and had a grill-out next to the water. We spent several hours playing volleyball, chomping on burgers and hummus, and engaging in team building exercises. This bonded the Florida teams in a way the video calls could not accomplish last year.
Students from Florida State University drove for several hours to attend the Florida iGEM Summer Social. In late September, it was our turn to make the drive, and a small group of us made the trip to visit our partners in science. We spent several hours in a conference room at the College of Medicine where the FSU team has their laboratory. Dr. Cesar Rodriguez is the FSU team mentor and has been involved with iGEM since 2009. His advice was amazing to receive, and it gave us plenty of insight on how to go about styling our wiki and finishing up our collaboration.
The collaboration led us to integrate FSU’s approach to biological system design modeling into our project. An important aspect of synthetic biology is the creation and use of standard parts, much like puzzle pieces. Systems biology graphical notation is a standardized diagram format. This allows scientists to understand the entirety of an example biological system and visualize how"
Tuebingen,2018," proteins as a potential  alternative to classical antibiotic treatment.
Since biologicals (biopharmaceuticals) often have the problem of being targeted by the immune system through the prescence of specifc anti-drug anitbodies (ADA), we performed our deimmunizaton workflow BERT on a construct of the iGEM team Paris-Bettencourt. A low immunogenicity would be crucial for the application of AMP/scaffolding protein constructs, since in this case binding of ADAs  to the protein would most likely severely impair the self-assembly properties to large complexes.  Moreover, this was also a ""blind test"" for our deimmunization tool, since we applied the steps on a protein which was completely unknown to us. Had we solely focused on our own botulinum toxin shuttle with the aim of optimizing the steps of the workflow, there would have been the risk of losing the general applicability of the workflow on arbitrary proteins.
A further important aspect of this collaboration, was the validation of the structural integrity of the fusion protein we used in our deimmunization workflow. In this external validation we investigated the influence of the AMP on the tertiary structure of the scaffolding protein using MD simulations. Since we have access to the required hardware to run prolonged MD simulation, we were able to share our expertise on this subject and our computational capabilities with the iGEM Team Paris-Bettencourt. Furthermore since both our teams were using MD simulations to model the structure of the proteins in our projects, this collaboration allowed us to exchange knowledge about this topic and help us in the almost never ending process of troubleshooting while simulating complex biological problems.
For the application of our deimmunization workflow BERT on an AMP/scaffold protein, Paris-Bettencourt provided us with the sequences of their proteins. We focused our approach on a ovispirin/l-fucose Mutarotase fusion protein, for multiple reasons. Firstly, this protein has very prominent clusters of epitopes for the three most prevalent MHC class II alleles in central Europe (DRB1*03:01, DRB1*07:01, DRB1*15:01), which allows for very effective reduction in the number of immune epitopes. Secondly, we were able to find many closely and distantly related proteins, leading to an excellent identification of highly conversed residues by our tool, which are in turn avoided in the mutagenesis process. Lastly this fusion protein is of smaller size, which allowed us to include longer MD simulations in our tight schedule for simulation on our hardware.

Exeter & Warwick
Crash Course in Bioreactor Design
The Exeter and Warwick iGEM teams were both designing bioreactors that would allow them to clean up water. Bioreactors are large containers that allow for substrates to be converted into products under the correct conditions - often requiring organisms to catalyse the reactions. he Exeter and Warwick iGEM teams wanted to be able to put contaminated waters into a bioreactor and have the microbes clean it up. We provided a crash course in bioreactor design, which in turn helped them troubleshoot their designs.
The Exeter iGEM team hopes to put their bioreactor on Mars. To achieve this they initially chose graphene as their main construction material due to its lightweight. However, as graphene is very malleable it would be unable to withstand forces generated within the bioreactor by the impellers. To resolve this issue and using our knowledge of bioreactors, we suggested stainless steel. This resulted in them designing a theoretically functioning bioreactor and taking their idea to other experts.
Wiki Support
The Exeter iGEM team helped us design our Wiki page by troubleshooting errors we had in the interactive webpage. This enabled us to produce a more aesthetically pleasing and user friendly
website. This is essential for stakeholders to better engage with our work. Without them, a large interactive aspect of the page would not have been functional.
Water Samples
The Warwick iGEM team collected water samples around the United Kingdom by asking iGEM teams to pick three tubes full of river sediment and water. We assisted in this
by collecting London river water. In return, the Warwick iGEM team provided us with their samples, allowing us to measure the metal concentrations in the water.
Aalto-Helsinki
Spider Silk Troubleshoot
The Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team also worked with silk proteins, providing us with the opportunity to collaborate with them. We held several meetings where we helped each other design experiments and troubleshoot problems. More specifically, we looked at the protein purification
and silk spinning methodologies we could each implement. The Aalto-Helsinki iG"

Collaboration with Michigan State University - MI, USA
Michigan State University is working on showing the effect of ACC deaminase engineered endophytes on plant growth in drought and high salinity conditions. We worked with the team to build a kinetics and genetics model that described their system. We were able to make simulations in MATLAB that returned graphical data on how their system acted over time.
Click here to go to their modeling page and see the work we did for their team.
Skype Calls with Other Teams
We met with the University of Michigan iGEM team on video call to talk with them about their project. They are working with a Cas9 system and had questions about how it could be modeled. We were able to give them initial steps on approaching the problem and explained mass-action kinetics to them. After the meeting, we have kept in contact emailing  resources we used for our model, a self-made presentation breaking down simple genetics and enzyme kinetics generic examples, and offering advice on overall model development. In return, they reviewed our wiki and gave us some pointers on the aesthetics and organization of the material.
We skyped with the Yale iGEM team to talk about our projects. Both of our teams are making cells that secrete the enzymes PETase and MHETase to break down PET plastic. They have had more success in the lab than we have, so we were able to ask some questions about how they got their plasmid working. They also suggested we try Gibson Assembly and ligation independent cloning for our plasmid. Additionally, they told us they were finding more success with the yebF secretion tag than some of the others they had tried, like our pelB secretion tag. We were able to answer some questions for them about the modeling we had done, our outreach plans, and other work on our wiki.

Midwestern Meetup:
On June 30th, two members of our team traveled to Michigan State University for the Midwestern iGEM Meetup. They spent the morning on a tour of the university’s botanical gardens learning about a range of plants and the history behind the gardens. After lunch, each team gave a short presentation and answered questions about their project. Then, they went on a tour of the Michigan State University iGEM team’s lab and facilities. Through"

Our Collaborations
Arizona State University
The ASU team generously offered to sequence our constructs in their lab. In sending them our constructs, we also helped them to test their measurement and identification system. Their sequencing of our CLD+ gene showed us that there was a mutation that caused it to be ineffective. They also sequenced our functional CLD- gene and confirmed that it did indeed produce chlorite dismutase.
Ingenuity Labs
As a component of community outreach, we went to St. Elizabeth Seton Junior High School with the Ingenuity Lab team to give a joint presentation about IGEM and synthetic biology. They also helped us conduct the strawberry DNA extraction experiments and team building exercises for the students. It was a great experience collaborating with their team and introducing the students to concepts from both of our projects. For more information, read our community outreach section.
EPF Lausanne
We had the pleasure of being interviewed by the EPFL iGEM team in Switzerland via a Skype call. This was a chance to get to know global IGEM teams before the jamboree. Check it out here if you want to learn more about our project and our team!
XMU-China
We participated in the XMU China team's yearly newsletter , which featured IGEM teams from all over the world in the areas of project overview, human practices, and collaboration. It was something that gave us the opportunity to get in touch with other teams who were looking for collaboration, and to learn more about other teams before the Giant Jamboree.
aGEM
Prior to the Giant Jamboree, we went down to the University of Calgary for the regional Alberta Genetic Engineering Machine Competition. We exchanged ideas and received some very valuable feedback with other collegiate and high school iGEM teams. Structured very similarly to the Jamboree, aGEM included presentations, prizes, and a panel of judges who all had experience judging teams at the Giant Jamboree. We achieved 2nd place"

USAFA
The United States Air Force Academy iGEM team, USAFA , was very close with us this year and spent five weeks sharing a lab space with us. Along with helping them with lab work, we also helped them with their Interlab and bounced ideas we had off of them. Since they were a first-year team we mentored them helped them a lot with all of the new things that come with being a new iGEM team, such as their Wiki, safety forms, and what iGEM is all about. Having a new iGEM team right there to talk to was a great experience for both of the teams because we were able to present to each other, bounce ideas off one another, and learn about each others projects.

The Midwestern Meetup
Some of our team members attended the Midwestern Meetup to present our projects to four other teams across the Midwest: Michigan State , RHIT , Michigan , and UIOWA . We discussed the details, applications, and the many problems that the teams were facing at the time. We tried to help where we could when speaking with some of the other teams. We spoke with the Iowa iGEM team about using superfolder GFP to get a quicker response time for their GFP that will help their project.

RHIT
One of our team members went to Rose-Hulman, iGEM team RHIT and was shown around the lab and discussed some of the problems that were going with their project. They had also just finished the Interlab and some of the results were discussed then later compared with our data. During this time the RHIT iGEM team was making trading cards and they agreed to make one of our very own Mike the Microbe.

Introduction
Like the fact that one chopstick is easy-break while ten chopsticks are hard to break off, iGEM is a team competition, which need not only cooperation in own team but also collaboration with other teams.This year, ZJU-China have worked with four teams tightly and participated many teamworks.
Take a look at our collaboration.
UCAS
UCAS is our important fellow iGEM team.We have established initial relationship as early as team building.We first participated in their questionnaire survey about security law problem raised by transgenosis technologies or related products, and we also helped them collect more than 70 samples in our university.
When we did molecular cloning experiments to build our BioBricks, it was difficult to build this part(BBa_K2207021) which has four repeated short  sequences on its forepart.UCAS used Goldgate method to link 17 Oligonucleotides and successfully builded this BioBricks for us.We combined this part with mRFP to respond to the Calcium influx in yeast which is an upstream signal in our transduction system.
Fig.1 The transformed E.coli that UCAS sent to us.
When UCAS was trying to investigate the ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen content of different waterbody, we helped them to gather water samples from our local waterbodies even from our own fish tank. We adapted  Peking University’s Taipu kit and UV spectrophotometry to detect the ammoniacal and nitrate nitrogen content of these samples.
What’s more, we also detected the contents of four metallic elements in these samples with ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer). The four elements are potassium，sodium，calcium and magnesium. The equipment is Agilent-700 ICP-OES from Department of Chemistry, Zhejiang University. We have discard the impurity through filtration and adjust the pH value to 2.0"

Valencia UPV
We participated in the Valencia UPV iGEM team’s research on the status of transgenic regulation, consumption, and perception in various countries. The opportunity to reflect on how genetic engineering affects our day-to-day lives beyond the research lab was interesting. We also asked our peers about their perceptions of genetically engineered products to have a more representative sample of US consumers than just iGEM team members. The variety of reactions we heard ranged from ambivalent to strongly negative. This was an important reminder of how the importance of projects like our human practices outreach and engagement initiatives.
We also collaborated with Valencia UPV to produce two Humans of SynBio posts.
University of Texas and Texas Tech
We had a Texas iGEM teams' meet-up at the 2017 UT Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium. We had the opportunity to practice our Giant Jamboree presentations and exchange valuable feedback. This is the second year in a row that all of the Texas iGEM university teams have gathered in the fall before the Jamboree, establishing a valuable statewide peer network.

Mentoring Program
As an over graduate team, it's our pleasure that we experienced more and received more knowledge which provide us the abilities to help high school teams. So in order to make it into place and meaningful, we checked the registry information in 2015 iGEM official website and found Shenzhen_SFLS team(Shenzhen Foreign Lauguages School, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China) in which team the members are also studying in Guangdong province. And then we contacted them and organized this program between us in order to help them.
This program included six parts which can also be called six mentoring courses, including iGEM program introduction, synthetic biology knowledge sharing and experiment skill mentoring, bio-brick standardization, modeling, human practice design guidance, and web building.
The first course was about program introduction. During the first course we gave a systematic introduction about iGEM competition to Shenzhen_SFLS, including its history, development, characteristics, standard, and et. al., which helped them find some new sights to understand iGEM and form a systematic ideal about iGEM competition.
The second course was about knowledge sharing. Since we are all working hard on finishing the assignments of iGEM competition, during this period, there is nothing more important than improving our related abilities. Then we gave a lesson about synthetic biology and experiment skill mentoring which was aimed at enriching their knowledge on synthetic biology and helping them improving their experiment skill.
The third and fourth courses were about bio-brick standardization and modeling. During those courses, we gave them advice on all the important points that we thought they need to pay more attention to, the necessary skills they'd better know, and the problems they might meet during the competition. In the modeling course, one of our team members majors in bioinformatics. During the class, she introduced several software related to molecular simulation, and teach them how to use these software. In the process of preparing iGEM, we have been in touch with each other in the molecular simulation"

With each cellular division so to is my despair divided, vanquished.
Before me, my happiness in tremulous agar
Oh how I've transformed my cells, and how they've transformed me!
Plasmids taken up, and with them my heart
I reach out, drawn to them, attraction inescapable
Sweet contact, pure bliss, prokarya and eukarya unified as one
Softly, I wipe away the tears of joy, of science realised
In an instant my heart sinks, my ungloved hand drawing away from my face in horror
That was last summer
Coughing, wheezing, I glance out my hospital window
And with an autumn breeze fell leaves and a molecular biologist too
Gathered round a weeping crowd

Meetup with SDU
We are very happy to have other iGEM teams around ours. As early as June 3rd, we hosted SDU team (Denmark) in Lithuania. We gained advices on organizational activities, lab work and wiki webpage. Moreover, we shared the usable information on topics, such as CRISPR/Cas systems, microfluidics and modular proteins (interactions between them and nucleic acids). We also organized a tour around Thermofisher Scientific Lithuania. Check out some more details of our meetup here . This great partnership did not end after their trip. As one biobrick ( BBa_I0462 ) was damaged in our kit, SDU team helped us by sending their sample of this biobrick. Thank you SDU team!
Biobrick collaboration with Toulouse
After we were given a hand by SDU team, we had an opportunity to help a great team of Toulouse iGEM. At the end of a summer, they told us that they need a specific construct ( BBa_K195613 ). Luckily, we were able to build it. Even more, we did some characterization of this part. It was already in a Registry of Standard Biological Parts, but has been poorly characterized. We sent this biobrick to France and hope that Toulouse team did a great job using it.
Meeting Paris Bettencourt
Dealing with French people doesn’t end this way. Our team member Mykolas visited one of the greatest iGEM teams and gained the experience from Paris Bettencourt . Impression of the structure of a team was inspiring for us, so after this visit on July we were more motivated to make this experience a part of our team routine.
Questionnaires
As the Beatles notice, with a little help from my friends, we filled in a lot of questionnaires and shared data from our ones. These questionnaires asked about GMOs, the attitude and acceptance of genetic modifications’ technologies.  We are happy to share this info with iGEM Tec-Monterrey , Vanderbilt iGEM and Oxford iGEM teams"

iGEM Exeter contacted us in early summer to organise a collaboration between our two teams. We spoke with their team over skype in order to determine what each team could do to help the other. As part of this several team members were involved in a brief video interview with regard to the following;               (i) Define a kill switch               (ii) Our opinion on gender inequality in science.
iGEM Norwich
As one of our team members, Brandon Malone took part in a research project in UEA (University of East Anglia) it was decided that we would collaborate with the iGEM Norwich team. A video series to aid future iGEM teams was decided on and the production of it began in August. These videos include background theory and experiment tutorial on basic techniques used in synbio lab such as; cloning, ligation, transformation. Our contribution to the video involved the production of the aforementioned experiment tutorial. Links to these videos can be found below.
iGEM Xiamen University
For both 2014 and 2015 Xiamen University, which is based in Fujian in China, have produced iGEM newsletters. The subject matter in these newsletters included Team introductions, how team members are chosen, ethical discussion and human practices. For our part in the newsletter we submitted a piece on team and project introduction and another piece on vaccines."
Groningen,2018," David took us to a restaurant where we met a few more members of the Bordeaux team. We got to know each other and discuss our projects more informally over a pleasant meal followed by a small digestive.
The next day, after a light lunch, we started working on our collaboration in earnest. Saturday we would work on the chemistry part. Jacques gave a presentation on his findings concerning the extraction and characterization of FDCA from the cellular mixture. Together with Hemant Kumar (University of Groningen) he had evaluated the Bordeaux protocol and came up with a number of improvements and recommendations for safe practice. A separate protocol for HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) was also suggested.
Following this, a presentation about HPLC was given. It started with the basic chemical principles that govern this type of measurement, as the Bordeaux team is mostly biologists with no chemical expertise. Then the layout of the machine was explained. Finally, the interpretation of the measurements and troubleshooting were explained via the fundamental parameters of HPLC; resolution, selectivity, retention and efficiency. By the end of the presentation, the Bordeaux team felt confident about their eventual use of the HPLC. A question and answer session followed the presentations.
The following day, in the same chamber from chateau d’Eck, we discussed the ethics part of our collaboration. This was started with presentation by Anais, David and Inez about the progress their team had made towards understanding the ethical implications of their project. This involved brief summaries of the conferences they organized and the experts they went to visit.
Next we had a general discussion about the ethics of GMO use, contrasting the differing societal and governmental attitudes between France and the Netherlands. The French team also presented the results of a survey they had conducted to investigate public opinion on GMO use. Matthijs and Jan-Marten then proceeded to ask a list of questions the Dutch team had prepared. Once answered, we tried to summarize the main insights of the interview and presentations via a discussion that was filmed.
To celebrate a successful collaboration we had some wine from the castle’s vineyard and then went to downtown Bordeaux, where we sat by the Garonne and socialized over a picnic dinner. On Monday, we slept in and then went on a day trip to the countryside with the Bordeaux team. We first visited the lake of Biscarrosse. While the bulk of the group relaxed by the beach; Jacques, Jan Marten and Vincent went on a “geocache hunt” (a type of scavenger hunt) in the surrounding countryside. Towards the beginning of the evening we drove towards the fantastic sand dune of"

The European Experience
For the first time since the end of the iGEM Regional Jamborees, two teams collaborated to organize the European Experience, a meeting where all the Europeans iGEM teams were invited in Paris to exchange, discuss, and celebrate. iGEM IONIS and iGEM Evry decided to organize such an event in order to tighten the relations existing between all European iGEMers.
We started organizing this event in late January, and reached out for iGEM Evry to help us organizing it given its importance. We also wanted to team up with another iGEM team to collaborate on a big scale common project. Our goal was to create an event that people would remember, and needed help in order to do so.  As time went by, the teams discussed and agreed on the type of event we wanted to do. There was a lot of discussion about what kind of event we wanted to do, but eventually we stated that we had mainly 3 mains goals in mind for the European Experience: train for the Giant Jamboree, learn more about Synthetic Biology, and exchange with other teams.
We then decided to organize 2 roundtables, focused around two main themes: “Challenges and Risks of Synthetic Biology” and “Synthetic Biology: a new economic world”. The aim of these roundtables was to make everyone learn more about Synthetic Biology straight from professionals,"

The 2015 iGEM Nankai Team decided this year to develop an information-sharing platform that will converge all information of iGEM China members. Through this platform they unify all required information needed to reproduce iGEM projects, besides the biobricks.  They decided to advertise their platform through a video and sending questionnaires to other iGEM teams. We were one of the lucky teams to answer their questionnaire, and we showed our support for the creation of such platform.
NEFU_China
NEFU_China 2015 iGEM set up a survey for evaluation of the current service that the iGEM wiki system offers. We delightly participated in their study by filling in the survey, as like many other teams, wiki development is a hard process that can’t be carried by just one member and that servers could be optimized for better performance. We hope that our successors will use their Flight iGEM platform for easier wiki development.
Enterprises
Emxys
Emxys is a research and development company in embedded instruments, data acquisition and control systems. We contacted with them at the birth of our team as we considered ideas involving outer space and beyond. The idea of packaging information in a smaller platform was appealing to them. From their point of view is much more interesting to transmit in our seed platform the information required for the production of bioplastics or biofuels, especially methane, but also saw interesting relating it with medical drugs.
Farmamundi
Farmamundi is a pharmaceutical NGO located in the village of Paterna with the objective of ensuring the universal health right through humanitarian actions supporting vulnerable groups of populations in poverty countries and awareness campaigns in our social environment. We established a meeting with their chief pharmaceutic asking about the most needed medical drugs.

Newcastle
We collaborated with the Newcastle Team to help characterise one of their parts, the deGFP construct , which acts as a reporter in their improved biosensor framework called Sensynova .  We offered to use a flow cytometer to thoroughly quantify the expression of the deGFP construct, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as this method was not accessible for the Newcastle iGEM team.
After the arrival of the DNA, we transformed the deGFP construct into E. coli Top10 cells before we ran the sample through the flow cytometer. This would sort from a stream of bacterial culture individual cells based on their properties, specifically fluorescence. Culture fluorescence was excited at 488 nm and intensity was recorded using a 530/30 nm detector to obtain the mean, median and standard deviation of a sample of 10,000 cells from the original population. We have sent both the raw and analysed data to Newcastle for their further analysis and interpretation.
In return  Newcastle conducted a repeat of our experiment into testing the ability of UV to kill bacteria. By carrying out this experiment it meant that we could determine whether the results we obtained were reproducible, follow this link to see the results.
Cardiff
We also collaborated with the University of Cardiff iGEM team who conducted further experiments into testing the effectiveness of UV for the purpose of destroying bacteria.  Due to time constraints we could not carry out these experiments ourselves. We felt that it was important to extend the experiment to see how the percentage of bacteria that had survived irradiation changed with a greater amount of exposure for instance, 20 minutes or 30 minutes. Additionally by collaborating with another team it meant that we could guarantee the reproducibility our of results.  We sent a plate containing Top 10 E.coli to Cardiff and then using the protocol we had devised they irradiated 1 in 100,000 , 1 in 10,000,000 and 1 in 100,000,000 sample solution for five different exposure times. Most important Cardiff conducted the experiment for the extreme exposure times "

The Colorado State University (CSU) iGEM team graciously invited us to their hometown in Fort Collins, Colorado for a weekend visit. There, we took turns presenting our project to each other and giving feedback on the presentation quality and the project itself. CSU gave us useful feedback and we will implement their suggestions for our final presentation in Boston! Afterwards, CSU brought in a guest speaker, Professor Jeff Kasser, who discussed some case studies on the Philosophy of Science. Professor Kasser presented many important concepts and, in doing so, gave us an opportunity to think deeply about the impact of our biological creations. Occasionally scientists may not foresee certain implications that could arise from a new biological system. Therefore, Professor Kasser reminded us to be thoughtful scientists as we dive into the new and uncharted waters of synthetic biology. We will take his important lessons with us and share them with future CU Boulder iGEM members in the hope of fostering thoughtful scientists who understand the full implications of their work.
We also participated in surveys from these teams....

Hefei University of Technology - The BioOrganizer
The iGEM-team from Heifei University of Technology is doing a software project called the BioDesigner , made with the purpose of making BioBrick information more accessible through improved searching and documentation. As we had previously written a script with a similar purpose, we can definitely see the value of such a project. They were surveying what sort of functionality other teams would be interested in having in such software; we gave feedback on what we'd like to see, as well as asking how feasible those implementations would be as not all the information we'd be interested in would necessarily be easily collectable from the iGEM webpages. We also actively tested the software and provided feedback on functionality, design, and things we thought were lacking and unnecessary.
TNCR Korea
At the very end of the competition, TNCR Korea's iGEM team asked us to fill in a questionnaire on gluten and if both teams would be interested in giving feedback to each others wiki pages. This was done, and both teams got useful feedback that they were able to put into practice.

The Aachen 2017 team was trying to collect Na + efficiently in their previous project, but because there was no assay method or detailed data on the Wiki, we contacted them and asked for advice via e-mail.
We were worried about how to measure the amount of Na + uptake of yeast, so team Aachen suggested their assay method. Their method was to cultivate yeast in a salt-containing medium and measure 1 or 2 ml of the separated supernatant after several hours in the culture.
Unfortunately, their method requires expensive equipment so we couldn't use the method directly but referred to it for the last assay. Furthermore, according to their modeling, they advised that the peak of Na + absorption by yeast is 6 hours, and advised to divide measurements by the culture OD in order to measure uptake between different yeast strains. Their mentoring was truly encouraging and helpful. Thanks to their help, we were able to launch an improved project.

3) 6th Asia Pasific conference
We went to Taiwan and attended the 6th Asia Conference. We were very inspired by the presentations and posters from teams all over Asia. Also, it was good practice for us our own presentation and poster. At the conference, other iGEMers gave us valuable advice on our projects which was very helpful. After the conference, we have continued to exchanged opinions through SNS.
4) Meetup with Gifu
We met up with Ryo Niwa, Leader of Team Gifu, who came to visit us in Kyoto. We discussed the current situation of Japanese iGEM teams and shared detailed progress of our projects. We discussed how to meet the criteria and gave advice to each other. In addition, we informed him about how we secured lab space and how we are conducting experiments. Ryo also advised us that an important point to make an iGEM project successful is to take in adequate food and sleep. There are very few teams in Japan, but we encouraged each other to do our best. It was a very unique and meaningful meetup.

In 2016, CCU_Taiwan iGEM Team was formed and determined to participate2017 iGEM competition. Since it is our very first time participating iGEM, we did not have enough experience. At this time, NYMU-iGEM Team had given us many valuable suggestions and experiences. So that we successfully formed our team, CCU_Taiwan. In addition to helping us created our own iGEM team, they also taught us how to run Fusion PCR (Figure2, 3 and 4) and the Photo-Bioreactor function through webcam.

Abstract
During the competition, we realize that proper collaborations with the above team is                                         necessary, which make our project progress more smoothly. In addition, frequent communication                                         allows us to know about the progress of other teams to determine whether we need                                         to speed up the pace of the experiment. But we found that the Chinese teams rarely                                         establish a cooperative relationship with the igem teams in other countries, which                                         may be due to geographical relations. However, we still believe that cooperation                                         with foreign teams is necessary for we can understand each other's experimental techniques                                         to improve our own projects. In any case, we are very grateful to the above team                                         for our help and we hope that our friendship can last forever.

Postcards
Just like last year, the team Cologne Duesseldorf organized a campaign to promote synthetic biology by inviting other iGEM teams to design interesting postcards related to synthetic biology. We were thrilled by this idea and started with the design of our own postcard. Since we were then in a time of intense cloning which consumed a huge amount of agarose gels, we decided to collect the nicest and most terrible gel pictures of our current work. We liked the funny design of the final card, and this little distraction motivated us to work even harder.

Labnotes Creator
To make it easier for this years and future iGEM teams to write and upload their lab journals to the wiki, we developed the Labnotes Creator . After initial testing performed by our team, we reached out to other iGEM teams to test the software. We would like to thank our beta testers team TU Darmstadt and team Duesseldorf-Cologne . Team Duesseldorf-Cologne provided some valuable feedback, while team TU Darmstadt actively tested and validated our software. A big thank you to both team!"

UCC iGEM 2017
École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
We collaborated with École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland whose project focuses heavily on using cell-free systems. During the course of our collaboration, we discussed how cell-free systems could be beneficial to both our projects, enabling our systems to be used more widely and with more ease than if they were implemented in live bacterial chassis’. We also discussed cell-free protocols and reporter systems that could be used.
Specifically, the EPFL iGEM team asked us to review their cell-free protocol and compare it to what we would use with our cell-free collaborator Dr. Thomas Meaney, who aims to bring cell-free technology to a wider market. This comparison of cell-free protocols will help them to optimise their cell-free extraction and build out their project.
Through the course of our discussions, we learned that the EPFL team had tried to use chromoproteins in their cell free system with limited success. This has informed the future design of our biosensor strategy and has made us aware that we need to be careful in using amilCP as a reporter system and has made us aware that optimisation of the cell-free chassis may be required.
Overall, our discussions and sharing of ideas were mutually beneficial in the future design and implementation of both our projects and we are very thankful to EPFL for their time."
OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015," set of images of feathers being degraded over a period of 24h or a few days. We had no luck there which is why we chose to use SDS-PAGE to see if we had any product at all. If i remember correctly (though you might want to check our wiki) we had a band of 'protein' that corresponded neither to the pre- or post- cleavage kDA size for the enzyme. I think we found a paper indicating that the secretion step may occur in 2 parts, but I don't think we could confirm sizes.  We tried out construct in a number of E. coli strains, (the paper we based it on used BL21, but we also tried MC100 and DH5alpha) but we didn't get a chance to look at protein from all of them, we just had breakdown assays to confirm we weren't making an active product. In terms of implementation, we aimed to make an under-sink bioreactor which would tackle the problem close to the source, as well as releasing enzyme into the water supply to help further downstream. We aimed to use filtration systems to allow for enzyme release whilst keeping our cells contained within the device - no worry about water contamination! We did look at kill switches based on time, nutrient depletion etc, but decided it was too risky for what we wanted.  There should be some images of the device on the wiki too.  We hadn't really looked at implementation of the Keratinase too much, our main focus being the lipase. Interestingly, a few companies are now making hair conditioner that contains peptides - something you would be producing as a byproduct. Perhaps something to look at? Competition-wise, keep everything really simple. Don't make big bold claims - the judges will see through it in a heartbeat. If you don't know something, admit it, but be ready to explain how you would find it out in future. Have your presentation ready before you go!!! We spent 4 days in our hotel lobby putting it together before the jamboree started and so didn't get to see much of Boston while we were there.  Well done on making it this far! Let me know how it goes and if the Keratinase does work, I'm sure the rest of my team would like to hear about it too.  If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask.

This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

2. Affibody expression in human cancer cells
Affibody-AAV was produced [link to protocol of virus production] , and used for transduction of human cancer cell line (HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line).
As the Affibody was predesigned to include 3xFLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) in its sequence, we used anti-FLAG-specific primary antibody to specifically detect the protein in human cancer cells (HT1080 fibrosarcoma) using immunofluorescence [link to staining protocol] .  We used two staining protocols, with and w/o permeabilization step, in an attempt to distinguish between extracellular membrane localization and intracellular expression. As shown in Fig. 3, transfection with Affibody-expressing vector resulted in detectable Affibody expression only when permeabilization step was applied. This could indicate the the protein construct is expressed, but it is not correctly transported and localized to the outer membrane, or FLAG sequence (the antigen for the primary Ab) is located inside the cytoplasm.

Representative images of Affibody expression in human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, using Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibody (methanol fixation & permeabilization). C. Lack of staining w/o permeabilization step (fixation with 4% PFA in PBS). D. Negative control (w/o primary antibody).
Conclusion and future aspects
Affibody construct could be successfully expressed in human cancer cells. However, the design of the construct should be optimized to ensure the expression on the outer cell membrane for its subsequent use for cancer cell tagging and targeting. For detection, primary Ab against Affibody part of the construct is preferable, in order to clearly validate the expression on the outer membrane.                 In the future, the Affibody could be expressed exclusively in cancer cells using our Boomerang approach using dCas9-VP64-gRNA system under the control of cancer-specific promoters.

NEFU modeling:
NEFU modeling: They store information in a yeast, and the time of information storage is the key to the case. The information storage time (a yeast growth time) needs to consider some parameters ,such as the initial inputs of α yeast and a yeast, the concentration of a-factor, and the expression efficiency of Bax gene. Firstly, partial correlation analysis is used to analyze the local sensitivity of the complex relationship between parameters and results, which provides a basis for accurate and efficient modeling and reliability analysis of simulation results. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the secretion amount of α-factor and the growth time of a yeast had a higher sensitivity . Therefore, α- factor is refined into dry powder, which excludes the influence on the information storage of other interference factors such as the growth of α yeast . Secondly, since the main body"

""Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."" – Helen Keller.
We were lucky that a road to strong collaborations had already presented itself to us in the early phases. Due to the success of earlier DTU Biobuilders teams, we had the immense pleasure of hosting the annual DTU BioBrick Tutorial for the Nordic teams. We also owe our thanks to Lynn J. Rothschild approaching us with not only a project, but a chance to collaborate with the strong and competent team from Stanford-Brown-RISD across the world. However, we also wanted to see how far our own collaborative skills could take us and thus our combined work with the University of Copenhagen began. As the Lund team from Sweden were the successful winners of the Nordic iGEM Conference in 2017, we had the amazing opportunity of visiting Lund for this event in June together with a lot of familiar and new faces.

Our universities are already tightly bound together and seeing as we both did space-related projects and were familiar with each other and our respective projects, due to having met at the BioBrick Tutorial and later at the Nordic iGEM Conference, it made perfect sense to have our teams meet with the aim to elevate the ambitions of our respective human practices projects by joining forces.

Postcards
This year, our team had a very active and talented graphical design group. We decided to take part in a collaboration organised by iGEM Düsseldorf Cologne. The team was tasked to design a postcard related to synthetic biology and iGEM. Then we exchanged these postcards with other teams!  This collaboration was a great fun and a chance to get to know other teams and their projects a little bit better.
iGEM Lund
As a first year team for iGEM it is hard to know what to expect and it is very valuable to get all the help you can. Uppsala has been in the competition for 9 years running. We have a lot of experience and knowledge to share with a starting team. Representatives from Lund and Uppsala met at NIC conference and decided to talk about how to run a team. We had a Skype meeting with Lund to share general tips and tricks for running an iGEM team. The tips were everything from how present in the best possible way at the Jamboree to organization of the team. Lund initiated most of the general questions and we were happy to help out. We hope that our advice has helped them and we thought it was a great way to share our experience."

Conference of China iGEMer Committee(CCiC)
From August 14th to 15th, Conference of China iGEMer Committee (CCiC) was held in the School of Life Sciences, Peking University. 34 teams from all over China accepted our invitation, a markedly increase in the number as well as the kind of teams compared with the 1st CCiC held by HZAU, 2014. More than 300 iGEMers have attended this year’s conference.
In the opening ceremony on August 14th, we invited two special guests, ZHANG Haoqian and LI Teng to give the keynote speech. Both of them are co-founders of BluePHA , an iGEM startup in China. More importantly, they are also the team leaders of Peking and Tsinghua iGEM 2010 team respectively. As predecessors in synthetic biology field, they shared their iGEM experiences, along with their opinions on the prospects of synthetic biology. Furthermore, they encouraged young scholars to study deeply in this area and fight for great achievements in the future.

CCiC Peking 2015 seeks to establish a sustained platform for Chinese iGEM teams to communicate with each other.
With excellent and attractive presentation, all the teams get numerous responses from others, including suggestions on the thoughts of experiments, heated discussions on pathway design, and reflections on safety and application. All teams' posters were exhibited in the hall, to facilitate the idea exchange of participants in an open environment. In the tea break, team members could present their projects to other participants who had an interest, and this has aroused passionate discussions among them. Problems and solutions on experiments can be easily shared in front of a"

Team WPI met the members of the Boston University and MIT teams at NEGEM this year, and established several collaborations.
Collaboration with Boston University
We gave the BU team two versions of our BclA-YFP ( BBa_K1423005 ) cell surface expression device: one in the Cam backbone and one in the Amp backbone. Team BU performed flow cytometry on the samples as well as a control line expressing YFP internally from a Kan backbone. The results indicate good, though reduced, expression of BclA-YFP compared to the internal YFP.
In return, we performed microscopy on two devices built by the BU team: pTet-pBad-RFP ( BBa_K1401009 ) and pBad-pTet-RFP ( BBa_K1401010 ). The pTet-pBad-RFP or pBad-pTet-RFP expressing E. coli strains were cultured in LB with chloramphenicol plus the additives indicated overnight at 37°C overnight with shaking. 20µL samples of each culture were dropped onto microscope slides and allowed to air dry.  Slides were then fixed in methanol for 10 minutes, dried, and wet mounted with a coverslip in a 50% glycerol solution. Slides were imaged on a Zeiss AxioVert miscoscope with an 100x oil immersion lens, and imaged with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera. Images were acquired using Zen software, and processed with Adobe Photoshop. All images were exposed for 2 seconds. Brightness and contrast adjustments made during processing were applied equally to all panels within the figure.
The results indicate good induction of the pBad-pTet device. The concentrations of aTc used for induction of the p"

To complement the results of your experiments we asked all participants to fill out a quick survey.  We wanted to hear about their difficulties with the experiments and Vibrio natriegens; with this information we could improve our protocols based on their feedback in order to optimize them for possible future worldwide adoption.

Stuttgart, Hamburg, TU_Darmstadt, JMU_Wuerzburg, ETH Zurich, and BOKU-Vienna performed the complete Vibrigens InterLab experiment. Thessaloniki and NTNU_Trondheim each performed a growth curve experiment. The measurements from iGEM Hamburg cannot be used for evaluation since the negative control showed a higher fluorescence than the positive control at times. This is likely due to a contamination or a pipetting error.
Unfortunately, the other three teams on the list couldn’t produce results due to various reasons. The Valencia_UPV Team got their own Vibrio natriegens from CECT, listed as the same strain we use.
They encountered problems with transformation. We think this might have to do with the strain used, since most other teams were able to insert their plasmids using our strain. Regrettably we don’t trust this website to have the right strain, because in the description of the organism it lists Vibrio natriegens as an Archaea. TU-Eindhoven couldn’t finish the experiments due to issues not related to the Vibrigens InterLab. NAWI_Graz had no valued measurements and were missing two of the devices, because they broke during transportation and the plates were too moist.
For the growth curve experiment the teams simply measured the OD600 every 10 minutes for"

Fortunately for us, Team NTU is well-versed in this technique, having provided assistance to many teams previously. We gratefully accepted their offer to help and passed them several of our dye-synthesizing constructs for RT-qPCR analysis and characterization.
The RT-qPCR results showed that mRNA transcribes were produced from our constructs. Moreover, we also gained further insights into the design of our plasmids and how we can improve on them.

SG IGEM MEETUP
On 11 June 2018, all three Singaporean iGEM teams met up at the National University of Singapore, for the first ever Singapore iGEM meet!
iGEM participants mingling over everyone’s favourite food - pizza!
The goal of our inaugural meet-up was to provide an opportunity for all Singaporean iGEM participants to get to know each other, network, and spark fruitful discussion on potential collaborations. This meeting was the first official platform for all three teams (NUS_Singapore-Sci, NUS_Singapore-A and NTU-Singapore) to share with each other our respective team projects, and discuss possible avenues for collaboration. Hearteningly, members from all three teams felt the meet-up was fruitful, and we made many exciting plans for collaborations!
Deep in thought during our meeting
No meeting is complete without food! All of us had a great time socialising and discussing our iGEM experience over a pizza party! The meetup was indeed a great opportunity to get to know members from other teams, and even our own team members better, and perhaps more importantly, many memories were made that night!

The Jiangnan iGEM team members were in Singapore for a summer exchange programme, and they chanced upon our project. They took the initiative and wrote to us about the possibility of a meet-up to share our respective team’s iGEM experience, and learn more about the problems we have encountered, and how we managed to overcome them.
Without hesitation, we agreed to meet up with the Jiangnan iGEM team members! In fact, we were all so excited about the meet-up that we planned an engaging day of activities for our fellow iGEM-ers!

The                         weekend with both teams promoted communication and                         exchange of project ideas. The presentation sessions                         served as practice presenting our project to different                         people. And more importantly, we made friends!                         Afterwards the Meetup, we have kept contact with                         Barcelona and Sevilla teams, helping each other in any                         doubt related to iGEM, Jamboree and Wiki.
XMU-China :                         one year more, our team took part of the XMU-China newsletter In this newsletter teams get to know each other and can                         start a discussion of interesting topics on Synthetic                         Biology. It also allows teams to contact and start                         enriching collaborations.

Other Collaborations
Pedestal
With help from Mr Michael Rampe and Mr Peter Reeves from Pedestal our team designed a 3D rendering of our prototype, H2GEM, which will soon be available on their website. With this rendering, our team was able to conceptualise our design in the physical space for its potential use in marketing H2GEM.
The Australasian iGEM Social
During the proceedings of the Synthetic Biology Australasia Conference, our team met up with our colleagues from Melbourne, Auckland and University of Sydney in Kirribilli, and presented our projects together during the iGEM session of the conference. The two days of the conference were capped off with social drinks and an impromptu trip to Luna Park, which was kindly organised by our iGEM Representative, Abigail Sison.
Team Franconia Game Contribution
“There has been an incident at the iGEM Giant Jamboree 2017 in Boston and numerous young scientists have been contaminated with some of the most dangerous viruses of our time!” Team Franconia developed an app that will run an augmented reality game, for which the Macquarie Australia iGEM team, H2ydroGEM, will contribute by attaching a small QR-code (approx. 4 by 4 centimeters/1.5 by 1.5 inches) on our station, for players to partake in the game, as well as attract our iGEM family to our station.

The American author Helen Keller had it right! As an iGEM team, you can reach many goals, but as an entire community, we can aspire to achieve so much more. We would like to thank all the people that made our iGEM experience so memorable, we truly enjoyed your companionship!
Danish Ethics and Wiki Workshop at SDU
In the spirit of the iGEM community, we hosted a meetup in August for our fellow Danish iGEM teams: InCell from the University of Copenhagen (KU), and the Snakebite Detectives from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).  A total of seven members from these two teams joined us for breakfast and attended our meetup. This was the first ever iGEM meetup hosted by our university, so we decided to make it memorable. We took advantage of our interdisciplinary team roster, and thus designed a wiki and ethics workshop to aid our fellow Danish teams.
We utilised the broad interdisciplinary profile of our team, to have Emil S. and Lene present the perception of science throughout the history and the meta-bioethical aspects of GMO, respectively. Emil S. has a Bachelor of Arts in History, and Lene has a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. The ethical presentation was purposely turned into an ethical debate, where viewpoints of ethical conduct were exchanged and discussed. After the presentations and discussions on metaethics, it was time for the wiki workshop.
The SDU-Denmark iGEM teams have won the Best Wiki prize several times in the past. As such, we wanted to share the knowledge gained from our university's experience. To facilitate this exchange of knowledge on wiki development, we recruited our current supervisor Thøger Jensen Krogh, to facilitate presentations on how to design a good wiki page. Thøger was qualified for this task through his role as the designer of the SDU iGEM 2013 and 2014 team wikis, both of which won the special prize on both occasions. During the presentation, Thøger had arranged several exercises where the attendees got to mingle, discuss and evaluate their wikis. This resulted in a steady flow of information and constructive feedback between all three teams.
After a long day of learning and discussing, we went for a tour around campus under the summer sun. This concluded in a visit to the roof terrace of the campus dormitory, followed by dinner. It was requested, by our fellow Danish teams"
NTU_SINGAPORE,2017," our WT-dCas9, although a high MW smear was observed. This phenomenon seems isolated as the same smear was not observed with the truncated dCas9 variants.
They demonstrated liberation of gRNA upon denaturation in Figure B lane B5. Unfortunately, the same gRNA bands were not observed in our wild-type dCas9. Similar gRNA bands were observed for truncated dCas9 in figure D. Based on the difference in intensity of the gRNA bands between RNP/RNPF lanes and denatured lane, results seem to suggest that HNH is able to bind to gRNA best, resulting in lesser free gRNA, followed by 3ple and 5ple. This corresponds to our gene activation tests, confirming that the poorer gene activation observe is not just due to poorer target DNA binding – it is likely that poor gRNA binding could be a contributing factor for the poor gene activation by truncated dCas9-VPR.
The lack of supershifted RNFP in WT-dCas9 experiments coupled with a high MW smear led us to suspect potential DNase/RNase contamination. Such a contamination would also explain the loss of the gRNA band in the denaturation lane. Supershifted RNFP also adds doubt to the intensity of RNPF complex band. A lower percent native gel and a smaller target DNA PCR product would likely result in a smaller shift, and be more in line to established dCas9 EMSA experiments in literature. Noting these weaknesses, we look forward to further improving this protocol in the future. Such information would conclusively characterize the altered binding affinities for target DNA and gRNA by our truncated dCas9 variants.
We are deeply thankful to Macquarie iGEM team for going above and beyond in this iGEM collaboration. We had initially proposed this experiment to merely observe DNA binding causing a supershift, but the results have taught us much more – such as about the variable gRNA binding by truncated dCas9. A special shoutout to Dr. Edward Moh, whose expertise has made the planning of this collaboration a fun process, despite us not being familiar with the experiment. Do check their wiki also!

Cooperation with other teams
With University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB)
We cooperated with the iGEM team from University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB) and we both learned a lot of thing from each other.
We often had friendly conversions through WeChat and told each other what our projects is about and how our projects is going. They told us that they had some trouble in assembling a plasmid they needed. They tried a lot of ways to assemble the plasmid but failed and they asked us for help. They sent us the photo of their unsuccessful plasmid and after some analyses we suggested them using a method called Gibson Assembly. They adopted our opinions and did some try again. Later, they told us that they had made it successfully and we were all glad to hear that.
We also invited them to our school and talked about our projects. We learned about that their project is about a kind of compound named notoginseng saponin. They told us about the process and purpose of their experiment in detail and we noticed that there are some cases they ignored. And also, we help them optimize the process of their experiment and gave them a hand on the analyzing of their result. At the same time, we invited them to our laboratory, showed them how our experiment goes on and also, gave them some advice on the operations they should take care of when they did their experiment. And they also gave us a lot of useful suggestions and all of us had a great and meaningful day!

We have been exchanging information and ideas with Lund while discussing the various topics related to stress and project management. While we are looking at the problem from the perspective of an individual, iGEM Lund are focusing on burnout related to management and group dynamics. Together we aim to create an overview of different sources that can cause exhaustion and also what you can do to avoid it.

It turned out to be especially valuable for early year students and students that never had performed a transformation before.

As it happened that we share with the BCCS-Bristol projet some similarities and especially on the modeling part we have decided to contact them in order to either find synergies or just to be sure not to make a redondant modeling work. Obviously it seems that we were not working on the same domain.
So in order to make a complete modelisation of the ""project"" we provided them unconditionally with the Mathlab source code of the production of vesicles.

We also exchanged ideas about our iGEM projects. Thanks to Amy Yang for presenting CUNY Kingsborough iGEM's exciting research project :)
We also collaborated with CUNY Kingsborough Community College iGEM Team on EtBr project with same 6 samples - for one we took the picture with the overhead light turned off and for the other with the overhead light turned on. In retrospect, our DNA sample concentration was not very high to start off with and when it was diluted the concentration decreased even more.

Backyard Biology @ Emory University: Project JBroth
Low Cost LB and Competent Cells!
Our interest in our topic began when we were researching possible projects. What we found most interesting was a research paper from the Journal of Pakistan Medical Association that tested the efficacy of microwaving LB rather than autoclaving.  Also, a project that inspired us was the project from the University of  Calgary (2014) that tested the efficacy of a homemade wash for competent cells. From these projects, we asked ourselves: Could one conduct a synthetic biology project without access to a professional laboratory?
This summer, we created a cost effective alternative to lab grade Luria Broth (LB). To compare our homemade broth, J-Broth, and lab grade LB we compared optical densities of liquid cultures and transformation efficiency of competent cells. For each method of testing, we compared autoclaved LB, microwaved LB, and microwaved J-Broth.
Materials/Methods
We grew XL1-Blue E. coli cells in liquid culture of lab grade luria broth and J-broth. The media was either autoclaved or microwaved for 8 minutes at 650 Watts before the cells were added.
We then made competent cells using XL1-Blue e. coli cells that were grown in each type of media following the Inoue method (Inoue, 1990) and calculated the transformation efficiency for comparison.

Intro
Starting this summer, we have formed connections and maintained communications with other high school                     and                     collegiate teams, and we are glad that we could offer our help to some of the teams, and happy to                     receive theirs.
RDFZ-China
We provided lab resources to team RDFZ-China for two times. In the first time, we provided Kit Plate                     4 N4                     L12 and Kit Plate 3 G6 I6 F22 to their team. In the second time we provided bacteria solution of PSB                     1c3                     with designed restriction enzyme cutting site. Since high school teams do not usually have the                     financial                     support from school, most of the lab materials used by RDFZ are purchased by their team members. We                     are                     very happy to share our lab resources and help keep their experiments going and make their project                     come                     true.
Shipment Coordination
Because of the fact that the person responsible for receiving part in Genescript has recently                     resigned                     from his position, so there was a period of confusion where all the teams in China didn’t know who                     to                     send their parts too. One of our team leader Ruohong Wang actively communicated with the Genescript                     company and after rounds of negotiation finally got to know the new recipient of all the team’s                     parts.                     After knowing this piece of information, Ruohong spread the news the all the teams in China and                     helped                     all of them with this shipping problem.

Diary note regarding collaboration
We had a lot of fun with these three teams. The meet up is set in Hangzhou where two of the teams are located, and we spent our time together from July 26 to July 30. We arrived in Hangzhou at 2:00pm on July 26 and then went to a meeting with the representatives of the other three teams to plan the presentation and activities on July28 and July 30. The representatives came up with the idea of doing simple experiments in order to attract the kids. We spent some time at the meeting room thinking about the possible experiments we can do. We thought about different types of activity that can introduce our project and synthetic biology to the younger kids. However, we didn’t pass any of the plans due to feasibility problem or safety-related concerns.
On July 27, we visited the lab that ASTWS-China and Worldshaper-Nanjing are using. We went to see the facilities and were told about the functioning of the equipment there. Another meet up is held as well. We continued our discussion about the presentation and activities, and finally we decided doing science-related experiments would be fine as the condition in the museum wouldn’t allow the kids to sit down and"

Collaboration with Tianjin-iGEM
Teams trying to solve practical problems may meet problems when performing their integrated Human Practice. This year, in line with the principle of “to be more responsible and reflect more”, we joined the research conducted by Tianjin University on the transformation of biotechnology achievements. Through this expended research, we demonstrated the verified feasibility of the transformation of our iGEM project this year and made efforts on the practical execute solutions. Particularly in this research report presented in the collaboration, we were responsible to demonstrate how to transform of our project as an iGEM team.

SKLMT-China
In terms of collaboration, we have many communications with SKLMT-China. We used firefly luciferase report assay to characterize the strength of the promotor they provided and helped them establish the Pseudomonas fluorescence promoter pool. In detail, we electrotransform the plasmids into Pseudomonas fluorescens and used the intensity of the firefly controlled by the promoter to reflect the strength of the promoter. At the same time, SKLMT also used the reporter experiment to characterize our part. Thanks to the results came from them, we can verify our data and make the improve part section more complete.
Below is the result.

Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.
Which other teams can we work with?
You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration gold medal criterion .
In order to meet the gold medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.
Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:
Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device
Characterize another team's part
Debug a construct
Model or simulating another team's system
Test another team's software
Help build and test another team's hardware project

NTU_SINGAPORE,2017," NUS, we noted their experience with well characterized bacterial plasmids. Thus, it was suggested that we leverage on their plasmid assets to test the CRISPRi potential of our truncated dCas9 in bacteria.
In bacterial CRISPRi, dCas9 is targeted to -35 or -10 of promoter to block RNA polymerase binding, or to the non-template strand of the gene to block RNA polymerase transcription from proceeding. Transcription is blocked, resulting in expression interference. Once again, dCas9 affinity is studied, since strong affinity is required for effective binding and blocking. We hypothesize that truncated dCas9 would have decreased binding, and hence poorer interference of gene expression. In both NUS and our CRISPRi constructs, the target is GFP reporter gene.
NUS provided 2 plasmids, a gRNA expressing plasmid (NUS-gRNA) and a low copy plasmid expressing dCas9 and GFP to be interfered with (NUS-dCas9-GFP). The gRNA targets -10 of the GFP promoter. These plasmids has previously been shown to work by the NUS lab’s pHD student. dCas9 expression is inducible with tetracycline. We performed Gibson assembly to move our truncated dCas9-VPR onto the NUS-dCas9-GFP plasmid, and subsequently carried out the CRISPRi experiments.
The results in this experiment is different from that of our CRISPRi against endogenous genes – here, interference data more closely correlate to our gene activation data. WT and ∆HNH provides robust downregulation of genes, ∆REC3 provides intermediate while ∆3ple provide poor downregulation. Once again, similar to our mammalian model results, ∆3ple ∆R1-1 ∆R1-3 exhibits no downregulation.
Such a result is to be expected: in this experiment, only the gRNA was induced. The dCas9 is under a strict tetracycline inducible promoter, and without tetracycline, expression level is likely to be very low. The low amount of dCas9 available for CRISPRi would mean strong binding affinity is especially more important. Indeed, preliminary tests performed with tetracycline induction alone appears to results in better CRISPRi activity for poor performers, likely due to abundance of dCas9 for CRISPRi.
Not only that: the GFP gene in this case is on a p15A origin plasmid. Literature suggests that there"

We shared their project with a broader audience and talked about its significance by making it part of the outreach we conducted, thus ensuring that we both could successfully get our project ideas imprinted on the minds of people across different regions.
Team ICT Mumbai
Our team had a successful collaboration with ICT-Mumbai. Upon discussion, we helped them troubleshoot their overlap extension PCR by sharing two of the protocols that had worked in our case. We also showcased their project along with other teams at Synbio Symposium as a part of iGEM Day.
Additionally, we also tried using a basic software developed by them - 'BBRICKIT' which biobricks any DNA sequences, checks illegal sites and suggests sequential changes.
Team Tec-CEM Mexico
We had an interactive session with the team Tec-CEM of Mexico. We discussed our projects in detail.  It was very informative and inspiring to talk about the significance of our projects and its impact at a global level. We took part in their video collaborations  “Labs like you”, where we sent our contribution to the video. Additionally, we collaborated with them on the human practices section. We presented their work along with ours, during the 'iGEM Day' that we had organized in our institute.
All India iGEM Meetup 2018
We had a successful collaboration with IISc Bangalore’s iGEM team, which had hosted a two-day All India iGEM meet-up. The scientific sessions were intense with talks followed by discussions on respective projects.
We presented our poster and delivered a talk at the meet. Out of 11 teams from India, 8 teams attended the meetup, and our project secured 96 percentile as per the judges, having garnered significant attention from many of the teams. This meetup helped us enhance our project status by many constructive personalized feedbacks received from the experts.

// The limits in flow rate [FOR A SYRINGE OF 4.73mm INNER LUMEN DIAMETER] you can use (due to the limitations of the microsecond delay function and/or the stepper driver) are:
// Max Flow rate ~32 microlitres per second
// Min Flow rate ~0.4 microlitres per second
// These limits are due to the fact that the stepper motor becomes unstable when the time between a step is less than ~ 1000 microseconds and when the delay is greater than ~10000 microseconds
// To account for this we've designed the code so that it will compute the delay time necessary for a given flow rate,
// select from 4 stepping modes (Full-Stepping, Half-Stepping, Quarter-Stepping, Eigth-Stepping), and display an error if the flow rate is unsuitable.

ShanghaiTech,2018," data in vivo, they wanted to test the ability of their thermosensors in CFPS system to gain better expression results with less noise interruption. With better equipment and well-experienced crew members in our lab, we helped them do the measurement and obtained fantastic experimental results for their thermosensors in vitro.
Ten plasmids sent to us were expressed in vitro under three temperature conditions: 29°C, 37°C and 42°C. Using microplate reader, we read the relative fluorescence intensity of each group of expressed protein, and received protein expression quantity under each temperature conditions for each plasmid according to the standard curve of concentration-fluorescence intensity. Eventually, we drew the relative fluorescence intensity-temperature plots of different plasmids, and the protein expression quantity-temperature plots of different plasmids. According to these data, we concluded that these ten plasmids have a relatively good expressing condition in vitro. With the rising of environment temperature, some of these plasmids showed the elevated protein expression level as expected.

In March 2017, SCUT-China_A team sent members to have a meet-up with our team. During this meet-up, they gave us experience of establishing a new team, and they clearly demonstrated the medal judgements of iGEM. Besides, they illustrated what is modeling, and how to do basic mathematical modeling. Furthermore we shared our projects, and set up the collaboration relationship.
In April 2017, both our team and SCUT-China_A team were invited to attend the bio-festival in Sun-Yet-San University. We shared the concept of synthetic biology and iGEM competition to the students in Sun-Yet-San University, together with SYSU and SYSU-Software team.
In summer 2017, both team gave help to each other. During InterLab study, SCUT-China_A team failed in transforming devices into E. coli. We offered help, and they managed to finish the InterLab study.
Nevertheless, SCUT-China_A team offered theoretical help during our biobrick assembling, and We have helped them to construct a model of β-galactosidase release and catalyze oPNG degradation.

AALTO-HELSINKI 2016
We were lucky to have quite a few collaborations. We got to help in starting up a new iGEM team, as we were approached by UCLouvain team from Belgium. It happened to be that one of their team members was on an exchange in the University of Helsinki, so we met and talked. We told as well as we could how our team was assembled the first time and what problems they had had. We talked about financing the project, choosing the project subject and about founding an organization to help with the financial side. Hopefully our tips were helpful and UCLouvain has had a great time in iGEM!
Thanks to the Stockholm conference we made good friends with the other Nordic iGEM teams and got to do a small collaboration with the Uppsala team. They asked for general information and methods for working with yeast, since they knew from our NiC presentation that we were working with yeast. We had a Skype meeting with them and sent our protocols.
EPF Lausanne team contacted us regarding a collaboration project they were planning to do which was somewhat related to our CollabSeeker. They wanted to create a platform, in the form of a blog or website, on which they could present iGEM teams and projects through “news articles”.  We informed them about the CollabSeeker, which they found very exciting. We ended up giving them an interview via Skype, telling more about our search engine and answering questions to the survey they had prepared.
We also got in touch with a few other teams. We shared information about ourselves and CollabSeeker for XMU-China team’s exchange platform – Newsletter.
We had a Skype meeting with TEC CEM team and shared information about our teams as well as projects. The team, which is from Mexico, didn’t know that we had a true mexican in our team, and finding out about this was really fun.
We also helped METU HS Ankara team who wanted to create a database consisting of protocols in different language. We helped them to achieve their goal by translating our protocols into Finnish. Protocols were about Transformation, LB Broth, LB Agar, ONC, Competent Cell Preparation by Calcium Chloride, Getting the DNA Parts from the Kit Plate, Mini Prep Plasmid Isolation and Plasmid Isolation."
BostonU_HW,2017," final chip design in order to receive feedback regarding its effectiveness. Feedback was also provided for the Microfluidics 101 content and the usage protocols for our microfluidic chips which was used to improve MARS.
Stage 1
The initial stage of the collaboration focused on determining what goals we would aim to achieve over the course of the summer. A key component of this meeting was a discussion regarding transferring the BostonU team’s biological protocol onto a chip. If possible, we wanted to automate their entire testing procedure on a single chip and have five samples prepared for plate reading simultaneously. The second objective of the collaboration was to have this design incorporated into the MARS Repository and be accessible for iterations or adaptation even after the collaboration ended. With this in mind, we moved on to the design and test stage.
Stage 2
Before beginning the design stage, we wanted to ensure that our microfluidic chips could be read within a plate reader. Following a consultation with the synthetic biologists working in the BDC, there were no obvious detriments to using polycarbonate inside a plate reader. In order to test this, we milled a mini chip with the same well spacing and depths as a 94 well plate. This was inserted into a 3D printed skirt and placed inside the plate reader. GFP was filled inside the milled wells of the chips in various patterns and the plate reader’s results analyzed for any discrepancies. The results indicated that the chip could be read accurately toward the center of the chip with increasing inaccuracies at the periphery. This was incorporated in the future designs.
The initial designs for this chips focused on a few key features:
Using shared inputs to decrease the chip’s complexity
Utilizing valves in order to create a complete seal between chambers
Determining how to measure volume of liquid dispensed
Avoiding leaks to prevent contamination
After a number of iterations, another meeting was held with the BostonU Wetlab team in order to discuss progress on the design. It was concluded that performing all five tests on a single chip would not be feasible given the time constraints. As a result, their biological protocol was adapted to suit the limits of our chip design abilities. This included cutting down the samples run to a single test.
The final design integrated a chamber designed to fit the dimensions and depth of a well from a 96-plate reader. It also utilized our new metering primitive in order to ensure accurate ratio volumes of liquid would be dispensed while running the protocol. In order to make the design easier to use for the BostonU team, the control layer’s inputs were shared as much as possible.

UCSD iGEM COLLABORATION
We met with the UCSD iGEM team on September 4th in the Bioengineering building of the Jacobs School of Engineering. During this meeting, we discussed the details of our project, including our goals, impacts, and progress. UCSD iGEM responded with their opinions on and insight into some of the key applications of our project. We also discussed various human practices tactics and UCSD iGEM shared helpful information on how to get funding and scholarships from biotech companies in our area.   The LbCHI31 chitinase-encoding gene, extracted from Limonium Bicolor by Zhihua Liu and his team at the Northeast Forestry University in China, has very limited background literature, thereby making it difficult to demonstrate LbCHI31’s effectiveness against fusarium oxysporum. We presented our idea to test chitinase on varying concentrations of chitin in a minimal media, and UCSD iGEM provided us with valuable bioinformatic advice regarding graphs and in silico protein modeling."
Virginia,2016,". They created a comprehensive survey to determine the factors that contribute to a successful iGEM team. We discussed the questions amongst ourselves and responded to their survey.
XMU China
We assisted XMU China in their human practices. We completed a survey about antibiotic resistance in bacteria. This was a great opportunity because there was much we did not know about antibiotic resistance.
Tianjin
The Tianjin team created a questionnaire union comprised of themselves, Pasteur, Pittsburgh, ULV-LC-CV, Valencia UPV, and Virginia. Each team submitted questions regarding their individual projects. Each project was different, so the questionnaire was able to cover a wide range of topics regarding iGEM and synthetic biology.
EPF Lausanne
One of our team members, Raquel, interviewed with the EFP Lausanne team. The team hosted a newsletter featuring various iGEM teams. We were fortunate enough to be selected! Raquel spoke at length about her experience with iGEM and shed light on some of the lesser known fun facts about the University of Virginia. We received a badge (below) from EPFL for our collaboration with them.

Scut-Champion-Park,2015," and teach them how to use these software. In the process of preparing iGEM, we have been in touch with each other in the molecular simulation.
The fifth course was about human practice design guidance. Our team has analyzed the contents of the 99 gold medal teams last year. We communicated our analysis results with Shenzhen_SFLS, and gave our suggestions about iGEM to them.
The sixth course was about web building. There are 5 members with a master's degree in design and computer science in our team. We introduced some web building software, and exchanged relevant experience about this part. We have kept in touch with each other in the topic of web building. They were very active and during the course they asked many questions. It's a great blessing to someone studious like them that who is doing research.
The program was really successful. It will be more than this time since we'll keep in touch. Shenzhen_SFLS team said they have gained much from this interaction. And what's more, this activity provided them some new sights about their project and their experiment skills. For our team, we received the priceless happiness when we felt we can help others with our knowledge and we'll keep on going helping. We think this program is a very valuable experience.

Istanbul_Tech,2016," iGEM Team for our design of a Do-it-yourself FRET measurement system.
We were thinking about a measurement device for our project, but since we are all molecular biologists, we could not make any serious progress about actually doing the hardware. So, we discussed our ideas with the Washington iGEM Team.
And of course they sent us a feedback report. They approached our design from a different perspective, and ended up giving us brilliant ideas.
METU HS iGEM Team
We collaborated with METU High School teams in many aspects including sharing the protocols and mutually cloning of our parts.
Besides, we made MD simulations of FimH protein with its natural ligand HETA for their project. They wanted to know whether the ligand HETA interacts with the FimH or not, and we found the answer for them.
