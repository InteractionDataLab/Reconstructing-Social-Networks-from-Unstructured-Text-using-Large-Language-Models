UCLouvain,2018," We able to share our concern about different aspect of the contest such as the modeling part, etc. It was great to have this opportunity to help each other before the rush time. That allowed both of us to take a step back and                 set up a good approach from the beginning of the adventure!
Collaboration with iGEM Paris Bettencourt (France)
We had the opportunity to meet with Santino Nanini. Santino made Celestin a visit of their workspace and building. As you can see they are located in a central area, with a stunning view of Paris. We exchanged ideas on the brainstorming                 approach. We both knew that we wanted to solve a antimicrobial resistance problem so we shared our visions. It was a great science talk that helped both of our team to take take a step back and share point of view. But beside the                 science talk we also shared our management approach, about how to efficiently manage the lab work, and everything else. Since we are teams over 10 people that is a crucial part of the work.                 After our first meeting in Paris, we kept in touch regularly to exchange our point of view and help each other on specific problems."

Collaboration with the other iGEM teams
In the course of our project, we established collaborations with several iGEM teams.
Collaboration with TU-Delft
Firstly, we established a collaboration with the IGEM TU Delft team , after realizing that our two projects had one component in common: Biosilica. Since we had already done an extended bibliography search on this topic, we helped them by sending them some links on refractive index measurement methods using the surface plasmon resonance technique, and a couple of other articles we believed could help their project. Additionally, we talked with them (via Skype) about the poly-silicate structure and the optical effects of biologically produced poly-silicate. Then we sent documents to help them for their literature search. In the biomineralization paper we pointed to them that the experiments (silification of wood in the laboratory, Gotze et al, pg 275) performed, and the analysis showed that materials that were deposited have a peak size of 20 nm or so, and spectral analysis shows absorption at 500 nm (similar to Opal). Some similar values of the optical characteristics of bimoneralized silica. Here is the references of these papers, click on the book to Download them:
Following an interview on Skype we also talked about laboratory manipulations. This led us to help them in protocols on labwork for their protein purification, we advised them to use a His-tag (A polyhistidine-tag or Histag) which is an amino acid motif in proteins that consists of at least six histidine residues, often inserted at the N- or C-terminus of the protein. Various purification kits for His-tagged proteins are available from Biorad, Qiagen, Sigma, GE Lifesciences, and others. We also helped them to develop a testing strategy for expression and validation of expression, especially with the choice of methods of induction (IPTG,  growth curves, taking the OD (optical density) at different times, and methods of comparison whether or not there has been expression SDS-P"
Manchester,2017,". In Brazil, there is a registry for biological products. In Japan and Korea there is no such law for GMM products. In Indonesia, supplementary documents must be submitted to use GMM biological foods and products. In Australia, there is no such law for GMM products.
In terms of international trade (export, import), countries like the United States, India, and Korea have clear laws detailing the procedures. They have taken permission and submission of documents to the law regarding this export and import of GMM uses. In European countries, these directly come under the laws of regulations of GMMs. There seems to be no specific laws regulating international GMM trade in Australia, Japan, Korea and Canada.
The most important documents related to GMMs are concerned with biosafety, food, trade and production processes. In places such as India, European Union, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, there are many different laws regulating each of these issues. On the other hand, Korea, Indonesia, and Australia have only one or two laws governing all these issues.

UNIK_Copenhagen,2016," own Human Practices Workshop and the Modelling Workshop we all co-hosted at the University of Copenhagen Campus, and all the many social events we shared together. We have all been integral in the development of each other's projects.
Gothenburg-Chalmers are fellow proponents of the co-culture, and frequent guests of Copenhagen at our own workshop and at more casual social calls. We have been in dialogue with them throughout most of the project, and we have shared insights and experiences with each other. Similarly, we have engaged in dialogues with XMU-China and they were kind enough to include us in their global newsletter, combining knowledge of most teams in iGEM (anyone that took up their call).

UK Teams Meetup (Organised by Westminster Team)
Bringing microscopy to iGEMmers
In order for UK iGEM teams to meet, socialise and discuss their projects ahead of the Jamboree, the Westminster iGEM team organised a two day meeting in London. As the Hardware track was new to this year’s competition, and being the only team following this track in the UK, we felt this would be a fantastic opportunity to introduce other teams to the track and highlight the important role of hardware in synthetic biology.
Our workshop took the form of three stations, each covering a slightly different aspect of our project and each with a different discussion focus:
Optics Bench
A working set-up of our first optics bench, and demonstration 3D printed material. Discussion points:
3D printing and rapid prototyping
Principles of open-source hardware
Inverting the Raspberry Pi camera lens
Field of view and resolution calculation
Microscopy Awaits
A working set-up of our latest microscope prototype, brightfield and fluorescence modes, fully motorised and video streaming to the Webshell. Discussion points:
Importance of, and our difficulty with, illumination
Remote control over Webshell
Epi-cube explanation
Stage flex-principle demonstration
Build Your Own
An interactive demonstration on building our microscope from scratch. Discussion points:
Importance of documentation and instructions
Design choices
Discuss improvements required
How to use Arduino and Raspberry Pi
The entire team was involved, and this allowed members of other teams to chat and ask questions at all three stations while the equipment was being run.  The level of enthusiasm from other team members was extremely encouraging, and we were very surprised by the number of questions about the hardware track in general. We hope that as a result of our worksop, some teams may consider it for next year’s competition.
Perhaps one of the most important outcomes of the workshop was in raising awareness of the role of open source hardware (OSH). We emphasised the degree of collaboration and community that it fosters, in the context of our own project. Underlying this is the ability of other iGEM teams to build, modify and improve our microscope in the spirit of OSH and the competition. We invited and encouraged other team members to look at our designs, tinker with them and think about how they might alter"
AHUT_China,2018," the project was promoted. Both sides regard it as a fairly successful collaboration.

A. Finalized component average results for each component in varying inducer concentrations using our lab’s protocol. E. coli strain BL21 is designated by “BL,” and strain MG1655 is designated by “MG.” Values were obtained by taking the average of the fluorescence at each inducer concentration. Negative controls, which consist of the wildtype strain grown in each corresponding inducer concentration, were averaged and then subtracted from each component value. “R0010 BL” showed a 2x increase in fluorescence across inducer concentration; other components remained static.
B. Graph of finalized component average results with error bars showing standard deviations. R0010 in BL21 is designated by blue, R0010 in MG1655 orange, K314100 in BL21 gray, and K314100 in MG1655 yellow. No significant change in fluorescence was observed in any component other than R0010 expressed in BL21.
Additionally, we also used their protocol as a means to test the validity of the two parts. Similar to our protocol, stationary phase cultures were grown overnight. The following morning, those cultures were pipetted into their allocated rows with prepped, diluted inducer concentration corresponding to the appropriate column. The fluorescence values we measured followed no strict patterns and greatly differed from plate to plate. Since the deviations we obtained for each point were significant, the results from this experiment were inconclusive.

UIUC Illinois
Last year, our team was nominated for the Safety Commendations for our work with a concept we call “Safety Cases”.  Safety Cases is a proactive technique that use an organized combination of structural units to help build arguments that prove the root goal of a project is safe.  This year we tried to further develop Safety Cases by launching a website to help other iGEM teams build their own Safety Cases.  Promotion of our online tool was difficult since it was released late in the iGEM season. However, we were able to get our friends from UIUC Illinois to try out the website.  They created their own general Safety Case and gave us helpful feedback. You can read more about it on our Safety page.

Knowing that collaboration is the tenet of iGEM competition, this year we have collaborated with two
iGEM teams, a high school team (SDSZ China) and an undergraduate team (Tsinghua A). By collaborating
with these two iGEM teams, we can seek out help whenever needed and receive prompt feedback about our
project design and Wiki contents.
Collaboration with Team Tsinghua-A
Having been known each other for a long time, we were quite thrilled to reach out to our old friends Ke Yuxi
and Wang Linghan, two team members from Team Tsinghua A, and form a very healthy and constructive
relationship with them. In retrospect, it turned out to be a very worthy journey with them.
Linghan first approached us for help for the generation of BioBricks that are eligible for delivery accorded
by the rule of Standard Plasmid Delivery. She brought up the conversation on how they lacked proper lab
facility for liquid evacuation. We offered the machine with alacrity and helped them processed their
extracted DNA into the dried form. We also reciprocated the topic on choosing a delivery company, and she
mentioned one that seemed the most suitable for our purpose. This first collaboration initiated the
following interaction.
With the deadline for freezing Wiki approaching, we visited their Wiki pages and they did it as well. They
noticed several technical flaws regarding to the awkward website design, and professionally pinpointed
the problem being originated from the misuse of the HTML and CSS programming language. It is because of
their help with scrutiny we would be able to adjust and optimize our website display. We were very
grateful to their help. On the final day before the excruciating Wiki freeze, two teams decided to host
a get-together on Wiki final check. We brought snacks and drinks, and outputted Wiki contents with
high-quality.
These two collaboration for the sake of medal requirements, but actually boosted our working efficiency,
improved the"

TU_Munich 2012 iGEM team
Munich team sent us this badge with a quaint fat and alcoholic German guy as a present for having answered their survey about IP rights.
Valencia and Copenhagen 2012 iGEM teams
As these teams are working in a project similar to ours we contacted them with a collaboration in mind. We exchanged a few e-mails and had a couple of Skype meetings. We suggested to exchange constructs, however, they did not send us material by the time the Wiki was frozen.

Collaboration with Georgia Tech iGEM Team
Our team is mentored by Styczynski Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology.  Over the summer, our Lambert iGEM team visited Georgia Tech and with the current Georgia Tech iGEM team. During our visit, we presented and explained our project and they, along with Dr.Styczynski and Dr. Liangjun Zhao, were able to give us advice.  We used these pointers to design our project.   In particular, they helped eliminate some projects that would have not worked at all in the scope of our timeframe, including a CRISPR cas reporter for Wheat Stripe rust.  They played a major role in assisting us with our initial construct ideas. We used the IDT offer of gBlocks to order several different constructs.  In turn, we had the privilege of listening to their project as well. We asked questions about their designs and discussed our experiences at the Collegiate Jamboree in 2013 and 2014.  This was valuable to them as members of their team had not been to a Jamboree before. Lastly, the team led us on a tour of the new Engineered Biosystems building and labs.  Without this type of collaboration, it would be impossible for our team to have as successful of a project.

IISc-Bangalore,2018," joined us on the last day of the meetup to discuss after iGEM.
Other than IISc-Bangalore, the following teams participated in the meetup: IISER-Bhopal-India , VIT_Vellore , IIT-Madras, ICT-Mumbai, REC-Chennai and IISER-Kolkata .
Problems ranging from getting VISAs to the intricacies of overlap extension were discussed over a cup of tea. As such, the meetup proved to be an important learning experience for both us, as hosts, as well as for the other teams.
Working with phages: A primer
During the course of our project, we felt that the use of phages as a target for genetic engineering is sparsely documented compared to more frequently used model organisms like E. coli. As such, the amount of literature review that we had to undertake for successful execution of even simple protocols was enormous.
To make sure no other teams face similar problems in the future, we decided to draft this document as a guideline for working with phages in a laboratory equipped with basic molecular biology machinery.

TecCEM “Labs Like you” collaboration
While hard work is integral for a team to succeed in iGEM, fun is also something we have to consider every once in a while. This time it happened in the form of a collaboration with the TecCEM iGEM team.

Lambert_GA,2018," Electropen hardware.  Thank you TASTaipei and UGA!
TASTaipei received an assembled ElectroPen from us and built a custom cuvette from protocols that we provided. Using these, they prepared electrocompetent DH5a and Nissile 1917 E. coli.  They were able to successfully transform both strains with a GFP plasmid and provided transformation efficiency data.  UGA’s team also received an assembled ElectroPen and cuvette from us for testing.  They were also able to successfully transform and validate GFP expression with a plate reader.  Both teams gave us feedback on design and ease of use of the devices.

Nanjing-China
Lambert iGEM created a lab emoji in collaboration with Team Nanjing. The teams hoped to increase accessibility of science to the community. It was an activity that allowed Lambert iGEM to consider the fun of science rather than always focusing on its serious effects. This mindset set allowed a more relaxed, inviting lab environment and an overall better iGEM experience. Team Nanjing also used our app Color Q, testing and proving its functionality. They gave us great feedback on versatility and accessibility, changes that we took to heart. Here are their results:
Team Nanjing-China shares their results.
Westminster UK
Due to limited resources, the Lambert iGEM team understands the significance of conservation and frugality in the lab. In fact, frugal science remains a foundation of our project. In collaboration with Westminster UK iGEM, the team developed a protocol to recycle spin columns without an autoclave, promoting an easy method of increased conservation in the lab.
Recyling Spin Columns
Store unclean spin columns in 1M HCl solution for 4 hours or overnight (No damage if stored for longer).
Fill each column with 1 ml sterile distilled H2O.
Spin columns in microcentrifuge (inside microcentrifuge tubes or collection tubes).
Discard the flow through.
Repeat steps 2-4, 4 more times for a total of 5 times.
Fill with 1 ml of QBT buffer to rebalance charges.
Spin columns in microcentrifuge (inside microcentrifuge or collection tubes).
Discard the flow through.
Repeat steps 6-8, 4 more times for a total of 5 times.
Data shows that recycled spin columns yield similar results to new spin columns in minipreps.

“Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: “What! You too? I thought I was the only one.” (C.S Lewis). It is the perfect quote to sum up our collaboration with the iGEM Bordeaux team. We first met at the Parisian meetup in Paris (7th July 2018). As we share the same conception of an iGEM project, our partnership was obvious.   We invited them to participate to the organization of the conference “What will synthetic biology bring to the future?”. They helped us a lot to contact experts.

Alternative Roots: Engineering Microbial Communities
Abtract
The demand for food, fuel and materials is placing unprecedented pressure on agricultural production. To secure higher productivity, the sector relies upon synthetic fertilisers derived from energy intensive manufacturing methods. Here, we propose an alternative approach to support plant productivity. The Alternative Roots project investigated Pseudomonas fluorescens as a chassis organism. Development of a plant-colonising chassis provides novel mechanisms for soil microbiome manipulation without genetically modified crops. As proof of concept, we focus on improving nitrogen supply via naringenin biosynthesis - a potential chemoattractant of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Legal and social considerations of the project drove the development of NH-1, a low-cost, small-scale and programmable hydroponic system. Tailored to overcome experimental limitations faced by many plant scientists, NH-1 provides improved reproducibility, coupled with high-throughput experimentation. This system enabled exploration of future deployment techniques within contained environments that may result in enhanced, sustainable crop productivity at a local and accessible level.

The biotechnology industry in the Baltic region was being developed probably at fastest rates in whole Europe in recent years. Although life sciences in our region are very popular among high-school and university students, surprisingly up until this year only one iGEM team - Vilnius-Lithuania - existed in the Baltics. So when we heard that our neighbors from the University of Tartu, Institute of Technology had formed a fresh iGEM team, we did not hesitate and immediately offered our guidance to help them with the initial steps to set up a project. During our visit at the University of Tartu, Institute of Technology we:
Gave lectures on key components of successful iGEM projects:
marketing and fundraising,
public relations,
human practices,
project development.
Through our three-year participation in the iGEM history, we have developed some good strategies to raise funds in a rather narrow potential-sponsor field in our region. Knowing that good projects require sufficient finance, we explained the best fundraising strategies which we personally applied for our projects. Next, as synthetic biology is a rather unknown scientific field in local Baltic communities, we taught efficient strategies of public relations: how to approach the public through mass media, how to build your social networks' communication strategy. We then turned to more specific iGEM topics and explained in detail,"
TUDelft,2017," on different bacterial targets.E. Coli DH5α and B. Subtilis. The probability of false-positive output for crRNA1-3 on E. Coli DH5α and crRNA 4 on B. Subtilis. (off-target genomes) is significantly lower than for the targeted genome, because there are multiple on-target sites.
We conclude that the design of the crRNAs is reliable as only minute off-target effects in the order of one in a million are observed. In addition, we gain a deeper insight into the effect of having multiple on-targets in the genome: this increases the sensitivity of the detection method but does not affect the reliability. As such, our tool assesses the design of the crRNAs by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich to be clever and to allow reliable detection. We thank iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for the fun collaboration and look forward to meeting them again at the Giant Jamboree.
Hamburg
iGEM Hamburg is another team whose project’s goal is the fight against antimicrobial resistance, on their case, by developing novel antibiotic compounds capable of dealing with multiresistant bacteria.
It all started with a series of preliminary conversations prompted by the common goal of our projects and the presence of a former student from Hamburg in our team. During the poster presentation held at our European Meet-up, both of our teams had the chance to get to know each other better and become more familiar with the science to our projects. Ideas ranging from stabilizing the siderophores in Hamburg’s antibiotic with our TDPs, to detecting a carbapenem-resistant strain with our device and eliminating it with Hamburg’s antibiotic turned into proposals.
Unfortunately, none of the aforementioned could be carried out due to time constraints and the prerequisite of our projects being in a stage as advanced as to enable the collaborations. Many thanks to iGEM Hamburg for traveling all the way from Hamburg to our European Meet-up to share their interesting ideas to make this world a better place!

iGEM Japan Kansai Forum
We joined iGEM Japan Kansai Forum held in Kyoto University on February 19, 2017. Five teams participated in this forum; Kyoto, Kobe, Nagahama, Botchan_Lab_Tokyo and us. All team made presentations about projects for iGEM Giant jamboree 2017. After having presentations, we exchanged opinions by Question-and-answer session and questionnaire. We had a good time to improve our project.
Thanks to Kyoto team for organizing the lovely forum. Thanks to 4 teams for giving exciting presentations and opinions.

May festival
We joined an annual meetup which became to be an official event of iGEM at the Tokyo University. Our team introduced our last year’s and this year’s projects. At the meetup, we made a presentation with a poster to the visitor. The age group of visitors were so wide from students of elementary school to senior. So, the event was contributed to recognize the existence of iGEM. We were so surprised at other team’s power of idea though iGEM Japan had the meetup at May 20th. It was so excited to exchange idea and point out each other about the project with other teams.

Collaborations with other teams
Nowadays, collaboration is a very important part for any successful project and iGEM is no exception. This summer, four iGEM team were working in the Zhejiang University Zijinguang Camps, including ZJU-China, ASTWS-China, HFLS_ZhejiangUnited and us. This advantage let us communicate and cooperate easily. Furthermore, for education and public engagement events,  we have cooperated with more teams, such as Worldshaper-Wuhan, ZJUT-China and Jiangnan, some of which were even based in other province.
Collaboration on Interlab study
As high school teams, ASTWS-China, HFLS_ZhejiangUnited and us were all lack of using experiences of plate reader, moreover, neither of our labs had this equipment. Therefore, after discussion, we decided to borrow the plate reader as well as the take interlab measurement together, Dr. Huang Fangliang, the instructor of ASTWS-China team agreed to supervise the experiments.
During the interlab measurement experments, we provided the ASTWS-China team with E. coli DH5a and 100μl silicon beads of better quality as well as gave HFLS team the transcriptional shaking table bacteria solution and some experimental equipment (chloramphenicol resistance, micro pipette tips, etc.). When our measurement data submission was refused by the Measurement Committee, both of these two teams helped us analysis the potential problems, and offered us the glycerin bacteria that we needed.
Collaboration on project research
During the experiments on project, despite visiting laboratory and discussion question, which happened quite often, we have many collaborations with other three teams in Zhejiang University, both on experimental materials and techniques. For example, because of unsuccessful transformation DNA parts  from official distribution kits, we lent our Kit1 and Kit 2 to team ASTWS-China, and borrowed Kit3 and Kit5 from all other three teams and bacteria with pSB1C3-GFP from AST"

Pasteur Paris
This year, we, the WPI iGEM team, collaborated with the Pasteur Paris iGEM Team . Both of our teams conducted research on biofilms so we decided to test each other’s protocols for quantifying biofilm growth to make sure the data was consistent throughout different labs. This comparison will be used to prove that any data collected using these techniques is accurate because of the reproducibility. If the data between the labs is significantly variable, then we know that the data collected depends heavily on how exactly the protocol was carried out, so the protocol should be edited to make it more consistent.
Our data concluded that the plate rinsing protocol that we followed was more effective than that of the Pasteur Paris iGEM team because submerging the plate in water is more likely to cause contamination, even into empty wells. We successfully grew biofilms using this protocol, but the data we collected shows the most biofilm in the empty column, which must be a product of contamination during the rinsing process. If we had more time, we would work further with Pasteur Paris to perfect a method of quantifying biofilms.
Pasteur Paris Collaborations Page
Graph
This graph shows the massive amount of error associated with this method of rinsing plates, especially in the empty wells that should not have had any biofilm at all.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
We also collaborated with the MIT iGEM team . We held a skype call to discuss different means of quantifying biofilms and we provided them with our crystal violet biofilm assay protocol, and they shared their colony forming units of planktonic cells protocol with us. We used this protocol when testing biofilm formation on lettuce leaves.

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

CCiC
Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) is one of the biggest synthetic biology conferences for all iGEM teams in China. With its rapid development, nowadays CCiC has grown into a mature medium for scientific leaders to pass on advanced knowledge to the upcoming successors. This year, we were proudly to be the host of the fifth CCiC, gathering 63 iGEM teams and more than 500 participants in ShanghaiTech University.
Themed “Among us, past, present and future meet” , the fifth CCiC aimed to gather present and past iGEMer to share experience and memory about participating iGEM as well as knowledge people learned from iGEM. We were looking forward to providing a platform for iGEMer or people who are interested in iGEM and synthesis biology to communicate and exchange their mind. The conference was held from August 28th to August 31st. We were honored to invite members of iGEM headquarters, Meagan Lizarazo and Richard Johnson to attend our conference and deliver interesting lectures.
During the four-day conference, we organized team presentation and poster session for iGEM teams to present their work, providing participants with precious opportunities to improve collaboration and learn from each other. To make sure that each team could get helpful feedback for the last month’s preparation for the Giant Jamboree, we invited present iGEMers to judge each team’s presentation and poster as well as experienced past iGEMers to host panel session. Every team that participated in the fifth CCiC had chances to receive instructions and give suggestions.
Besides, according to elaborate voting for special events, we held special events such as trouble-shooting which focused on problems solving for various parts of iGEM project and After-iGEM show where teams present relevant artwork, books, software, business or academic achievements derived from iGEM. We believed that these events are meaningful to continuously spread the enthusiasm of participating iGEM.
Six months of preparation, four days of synthetic biology party. Our team received numerous of appreciation from other teams. There"
TU_Darmstadt,2018," takes care of the orders, and our lab group leaders. The lab group leaders in turn are the ones who organize four to five members and work together on one subproject for the whole project.
Also, she asked us how we organize our fundraising. There are two possibilities for sponsoring: financial support or donations in kind. Due to the fact that Merck KGaA sponsors us every year, we usually focus on the latter. For financial support we set up letters very early every year and send these to possible sponsors. We suggested to the team to already do this for next year’s competition.
The last topic she was interested in was concerning the team structure and how we organize a team of about 30 members. For our three student team leaders it is all about communication with the members, the lab groups, the lab leader, last year’s members and our instructing professor. The team leaders must stay on top of things and arrange duties clearly to avoid two people working on the same task.
We hope the team can profit from our advices just like we did last year from iGEM Stockholm and wish them the best of luck for their first year at the Jamboree!
iGEM Düsseldorf
Over the years, it has become a pleasure for us to design postcards and send these to Düsseldorf. They collect them from many iGEM teams and send these to all teams designing a postcard. It is always great fun to see how other teams designed their postcards.
Thank you, Düsseldorf for spending time organizing the opportunity to exchange information about the teams’ projects in a fun and innovative manner. As always it was a pleasure for us!
Have a look at all the postcards !
German and European Meetup
Again this year, iGEM TU Darmstadt was part of the German Meetup (Marburg, June) and the European Meetup (Munich, July). During both meetups we enjoyed having poster sessions, exchanging project ideas, finding possible collaborations and hearing talks of experts in the field of synthetic biology.
Meetups are a great opportunity for us to present our project to a broad and interested audience, to get in contact with other iGEM teams and as a preparation for the poster sessions in Boston. Discussions about our project were very helpful to obtain other perspectives concerning our project and gaining a lot of impressions and ideas on how to improve our project. Therefore, we thank Marburg and Munich for hosting and organizing these meetups. It was a pleasure to participate and to learn a lot from the other teams."

April 25th 2018, August 15th 2018 and September 27th 2018
As a new team into the iGEM competition we wanted some coaching from another team so we contacted iGEM team Leiden     early in the competition. Team Leiden has participated the competition in 2014 with TU-Delft and in 2016. So Leiden     is also a team with less experience than other Dutch teams.
During the competition we met each other three times, two of them where actual mentoring sessions. Our first     meeting was at a bar in Leiden on April 25th 2018. We met each other for the first time and talked a lot about the     iGEM competition. They had already chosen a project and gave us some tips about how to choose a project. It was a     very nice evening and we learned a lot about iGEM and each other.
The first real mentor session was in Leiden on August 15th 2018. We started the meeting with a small presentation     of both teams about the laboratory progress, human practices, PR, wiki, budget and fundraising. After the     presentations the teams were divided in management groups, here we discussed the progress and problems in more     detail. We told them about how we divided the tasks between the team, how we reached out to companies and media and     about some laboratory work. They gave us a lot of tips and tricks about crowdfunding campaigns, social media and     labwork. The team leaders remained in close contact during the contest so they could help each other with problems     as quickly and efficiently as possible. The succes of the mentoring session led to a second one on September 27th     2018.
It was an honour to be mentored by team Leiden. We know that they will succeed because of their amazing individuals     at the Giant Jamboree in Boston!

HUST-Cheering
NCTU iGEM conference
HUST-Cheering! Conference the 2nd!
Three universities in Wuhan, HUST-China, WHU-China and HZAU-China, always keep in touch and have collaborations. They suggested us that we can find a more suitable microbial chassis instead of E.coli because it might be intolerable to so many heterologous recombinant proteins. This summer, we kept the tradition to hold a conference in July and shared ideas of synthetic biology when NCTU Formosa came to discuss with us. Moreover, we discussed about our projects and got valuable suggestions from each other. For instance, how can we recycle Tb3+ from the recycled REEBOTs? Maybe we can extract them (Tb3+) by some chemical solutions, and then purify them by replacement reaction or others.
NCTU iGEM conference
This year we also participated in iGEM Asia Pacific Conference. We shared ideas with different teams and discussed about the difficulties that we had ever met. Most importantly, we showed our project and realized its shortages during the statement. We can optimize the pmrC promoter and triple LBT by modeling and doing some orthogonal experiments. Besides, we should consider how to improve the efficiency of the sitag by designing the shape of our silica board. The suggestions given by Prof. Chen brought us a way to enhance our REEBOT system, which directly advanced our project progress.
In poster show time, some students made a possible suggestion to us that PH should be changed to denature LBTs to separate rare earth ions after the capture work. One teacher from SCUT questioned whether our oprf-3 * LBT can express the membrane surface successfully. She thought that the over-length of oprf-3 * LBT may not meet our own requirements.
In the presentation section. We got many questions from other teams. Most of the questions are about our capture part, including how many times the silicon net can be used, how to get the bacteria from the silicon net after the bacteria is captured, and so on. Afterwards we mentioned the use of silicon net in the group meeting, and eventually we"

Nobody can do science on their own, so collaborating is a necessity. We had a lot of contact with the other Dutch iGEM teams, via e-mail and at the different meet-ups we attended. Our biggest collaboration is with the team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, with whom we had a lot of contact in the past months. Furthermore we attended three international meet-ups, in Delft, Wageningen and Leuven, where we had a lot of good conversations about science, iGEM and life.

University of Nebraska-Lincoln
After the UNL iGEM sent around there iGEM survey, The Amsterdam team and the UNL iGEM team got into contact about combining their knowledge and explore the possibilities of a combined future application of their projects.  In this collaboration, the UNL iGEM team and the Amsterdam iGEM team joined forces to come up with a way to reduce methane emissions. Methane emissions have a huge impact on climate change. iGEM team UNL and iGEM team Amsterdam explored the possibilities of feeding fumarate to cattle, in order to reduce methane emissions. We can conclude that fumarate seems a promising molecule for this application. However, since the literature about the possible effect of fumarate is not consistent, the physiology of cattle opposes some challenges and the maximum fumarate yields in certain organisms under our specific conditions are not yet defined.  Actual empirical research must show if this promising route can lead to lower methane emissions and a more sustainable world!

Introduction
In this collaboration, we combine the knowledge on genetic engineering to produce fumarate (team iGEM Amsterdam) and the knowledge on the possible impact of fumarate on cattle physiology (team iGEM UNL). Together, we explore the possibilities of using microorganisms to produce fumarate in cattle intestine, to reduce methane emissions by cattle. We explore the possibilities of ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system and the hurdles to overcome with these strategies"

Team HKJS_S
Date: 29 September 2018
As discussed with Prof. Davis Bookhart, the head of HKUST department of environmental sustainability, for our integrated human practices, a mechanism to reuse or store the CO2 produced by cellular respiration is required to prevent creating the problem of increasing greenhouse gas in our system.
Team HKJS_S worked to convert carbon dioxide to methane using a modified nitrogenase. By learning more about how this nitrogenase works, we have came to an idea that we can convert the CO2 produced by cellular respiration of Shewanella into methane that can be used as nutrients for Shewanella under our Alkane metabolism pathway. With this implemented, CO2 from respiration can be fed back into the system for more electricity generation and therefore increase the production yield.
Apart from the implementation of system, we have also discussed about some of the issues each other have been experiencing during the summer. While the JS_S team successfully clone their constructs using standard assembly and Gibson Assembly, our team have found difficulties in cloning the long sequences we have ordered from IDT into the desired plasmid. With multiple failures in our attempts, we have decided to clone the separate parts using standard assembly and link OmpA to the laccase sequence by adding overhangs to the plasmid using PCR and then perform Gibson Assembly. However, our first attempt of Gibson Assembly had also been unsuccessful and therefore we bring out this issue for further discussion during our meet up.
The JS_S team had helped us to troubleshoot our process on plasmid amplification with overhangs and Gibson Assembly. They suggested us to put the overhang on OmpA instead and linearized the plasmid before any PCR process for higher amplification efficiency and had suggested us on using BL21 E. coli expression strain rather than DH5 alpha strain for greater efficiency in protein production. With the time limit and consideration of our team dynamics, our members with experience in protein extraction had agreed to help the JS_S team with protein extraction using SDS-PAGE. To spare our workload, the JS_S team had also agreed to help us"

ICT-Mumbai
Collaboration
Skype meetings were often a little too early for us and a little too late for them, but collaborations with ICT-Mumbai ended up being very successful! We helped the mathematical modelling team with their oscillating circuit, especially concerning the correctness and scope of the equations they had used in their system, since it was their first time working with MATLAB. From their code, we were able to find a small correction in their model, called a “basal transcription level” that is commonly referred to as leakage, that could help turn their code from a purely qualitative description of the biological system into a quantitative one that could further allow them to make predictions and test experimental data. This additional consideration comes from the fact that RNA transcription actually never reaches zero, which could have lead to potential discrepancies between the modeling and"

Mentoring a new team from a different track : Tel Hai college
Students from Tel Hai college are going to the iGEM competition for the first time. During the month of June we met with the Tel Hai students to describe and explain all about the competition.
During the meetings and conversations over time we assisted them to understand the way to prepare towards the competition. How to begin, what to put emphasis on and where it is important to go into detail.
During the months of July to September we advised Team Tel Hai regarding dealing with the management of the competition. Providing guidelines about how they should commence, Plan and execute each step according to the competition schedules. The cooperation between us and the college students was close throughout the entire period of preparation for the competition. The meetings included close accompaniment starting by studying the idea of the cooperative competition, registering on the site, advice on fundraising, getting to know the iGEM site, important details on working with WIKI and more.
The cooperation has given us a good feeling because we, high school students, were assisting college students who are competing on a different track in the competition. Meeting with the students gave us motivation to continue working; they were grateful and very very nice.
Mini IGEM- collaboration with – BGU , Technion and Tel Hai students
This year three teams from Israel will be competing at the iGEM: One team representing Ben Gurion University, The Technion team, Tel – Hai College and us from Danciger Darca High School, Kiryat Shmona. All competitors met at the mini-iGEM at the Faculty of Biotechnology of food at the Technion. This was the reason for a meet-up with the teams from Israel. The conference was very important especially for calming emotions and excitement. The corridor chats enabled us to receive advice in many areas we were not sure about. All the senior students were very nice, tolerant and patient.
It was a very emotional day because all"

Freeze-dried Lactobacillus Experiment
Done for: Purdue team
Their project:
Purdue team is working on a spray device to purify lungs from benzene and toluene. Their idea is to spray engineered bacteria in the lungs that could purify lungs, thanks to their device. So they imagined a spray device supposed to be kept at -20°C and they were looking for a way to efficiently conserve bacteria at such temperature in a medium that human could ingest.
Their experiment:
It’s known that E. coli can be conserved for a long time in a milk/sucrose mix at -80°C. They enhanced the conservation protocol to maintain E. coli as long as possible in the milk/sucrose mix at -20°C.
Our experiment:
We obtained a lung microbiota strain, Lactobacillus spp ( coming from the Micalis lnstitute), to know whether the protocol they established could be used to maintain a real microbiota strain.
Procotol used:
In order to know if the lung strain could be maintained in milk for 2 weeks we made aliquots of bacteria in the milk mixture and everyday tubes were defrosted, dilutions were made and plated on petri dish. Two days after CFU were counted. Everyday 3 tubes of milk aliquots to check repeatability of countings were defrosted and 1 containing bacteria in water as a control.
The milk mixture was made with 18% of milk powder + 4% sucrose + 78% of sterilized water. The mixture was then pasteurized.
Petri dishes (MRS) with 10-4, 10-5, 10-6 and 10-7 dilutions of Lactobacillus spp
Results
CFU counts show that the freezing  induced an expected decrease of CFU in both milk and water (approximatively 35% of decrease after one day of freezing). In the following days"

After breakfast was acquired, things started to get interesting. Dozens of awesome projects from all over Europe and even the UK! It was great to see all those ideas and of course to be able to showcase our own bioprinting project ourselves. We also obtained helpful tips and hints. After the poster sessions was over and nutrition had been taken care of, interesting panels on ethics and entrepreneurship in synthetic biology followed before it was time for Randy to drop some final Brexit jokes and conclude the scientific section of the event.

The evening promised to be a great dance party in ""downtown Paris,"" including a live stream of the quarter-final match of the European Championship between Italy and of course Germany. After this sweat-breaking, super-tight, overly nerve-wracking game was finally over, with the better end for us :), we hit the dance floor down in the underground car park. The midnight surprise: a breathtaking fire-breather, who for some reason was interrupted by the security guard, we wonder why ;). With this awesome party night marking the end of the European Experience , we used the following Sunday to enjoy a wonderful French breakfast and explore the tourist sites of the ""City of Love"" before it was time to board the plane back to the lab. What a great event!

Mini-Jamboree
This year, there are four iGEM teams from Israel competing in the competition.  For the first time ever in Israel, we held a mini-jamboree event at Technion, on September 9.  We invited the four iGEM teams from Israel, as well as the Technion student body and faculty.  About 80 people attended.  The aim of the meet-up was to provide a platform for all the Israeli iGEM teams to present their project and get feedback and tips for improvement.  At the meet-up, each team presented their project, and a panel of judges asked questions and gave tips for improvement at the end of each presentation.  After the teams presented, Dr. Ido Bachelet spoke about his fascinating research in the field of Critical Bionic Design.
We would like to thank the panel of judges, who helped make the mini-jamboree incredibly constructive and helpful to the teams: Dr. Orna Atar, Prof. Roee Amit, Dr. Ido Bachelet, Dr. Sarah Goldberg, Michal Meirom, and Asst. Prof. Boaz Mizrachi.  We would also like to thank the iGEM participants of previous years, who gave us helpful tips related to presenting at the competition itself: Inbal Vaknin, Lior Levy, Noa Katz, and Beate Kaufmann.

After this cooperation, we have established a deep friendship with XJTU-China. We often discuss some problems encountered in Golden Gate assembly. We also discuss some questions about modeling.

6.ShanghaiTech
This year, we cooperated with Shanghai Tech. They helped us measure heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensors in cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS). CFPS is the production of protein using biological machinery in a cell-free system, that is, without the use of living cells. According to recent article reported, cell-free system is more sensitive to detect RNA behavior than traditional measurement method. With the help of CFPS, we can get more precise experimental results in vitro.
For cell-free measurement, we constructed a new measurement device with T7 promoter. Then we sent ten sets of  plasmids to them. They expressed the ten samples in cell-free system under three temperatures: 29°, 37°and 42°. Then they measured the relative fluorescence intensity by microplate reader. Finally, we received their data and computed the fold-change of the response in the given temperatures.
Figure 11. Fold change of the heat-inducible RNA-based theromsensors. Each plot represents an individual theromsensor. The purple horizontal represents the fold change of positive control. The purple vertical represents the normalized fluorescence of negative control.
As these results show, the heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensors we designed can work in CFPS. The fluorescence value increases with temperature elevated. Besides, the difference in fluorescence intensity and the rate of increase points to the diversity in thermosensor response.
We appreciate ShanghaiTech to help us measure the heat-inducible RNA-based theromsensos. Hoping that we can maintain the long-time friendship and collaborate with each other in the future.

On August 11th, Team Darmstadt joined our laboratory to talk about our projects and exchange some thoughts and ideas in line with their Labsurfing project. We are glad we were a part of their big journey across different iGEM labs in Europe!
Moreover, we attended the iGEM Meetup Germany in Marburg from 31st July to the 2nd August to get insights into a huge number of other iGEM projects.
Team Marburg organised a meetup for all German iGEM teams lasting three days. Team Tuebingen sent two members to represent our team’s project and to look out for collaboration options. The weekend was filled with presentations of each team’s project, a canoe race and activities like barbecue and a  socialising party. Besides sightseeing and  pub-crawling, the teams could get in contact with each other and establish cooperations.  Our team was able to exchange useful tips and tricks regarding organisation and lab methods.
On Mai 2nd, we invited the iGEM Team Freiburg to visit our institute, introduce their project DiaChip (Team Freiburg) and talk about our project “Crellumination”.
We were highly exicted to listen to their project, which could provide a powerful tool for clinical diagnostics. We are happy to contribute to their project by providing them with a purified carboxyfluorecine labelled SpyTag. They will use this to bind pathogen-specific antigens to the surface of their diagnostic chip.
Our most important collaboration was the one with the iGEM Team Valencia_UPV , as we both work with the Dronpa protein in the iGEM competition 2015. This collaboration was very profitable for both teams as we were able to improve each others projects.
When we first got in touch, the iGEM Team Valencia had not yet been able to activate and deactivate Dronpa. We had previously stumbled upon the same problem and managed to solve it using higher intensity lasers. We recommended them to use similar contraptions.
Since both teams had little experience with the modelling of biological systems we discussed our ideas and thoughts regarding the modelling of the Dronpa activation with Team Valencia. Team Valencia attempted to implement the systems equations of their biological circuit with ‘pure/van"
Cardiff_Wales,2016," sample)
>Measure 10 times and add values for the total light output value for each sample.
>Take average from 3 replicates for a final value.
This data reveals that higher levels of PCK appears to increase ATP concentrations within the samples. However there are a number of caveats attached to these results. Firstly the light measurements were below the values obtained in the ATP standard curve and secondly the 'PCK 0' measurement had a higher than expected value.
However although these results need to be repeated, they largely confirm what the WashU team had observed in their own analysis .
Exploring dCas9 with Saclay
We met members from Team Saclay at the European Meetup. After discussing our projects we recognised that we both planned on utilising dCas's specific DNA binding function coupled to a split reporter system. Additionally it later became clear that we both were going to use the E.coli codon optimised Cas9 from S.pyogenes, with additonal conserved mutations to knockout endonuclease activity. This linkage inspired us to plan to look at potentially testing each others guide constructs with the reporters we had individually developed (Cardiff- Split Luciferase/ Saclay - Split GFP).
However both teams were unfortunately unable to clone this dCas9 gene. This is due to unforeseen issues arising either from use of the original biobrick or from our cloning schemes. From the Cardiff perspective we speculate that the size of our construct (approximately 5kb) made this experiment unsuitable for the cloning technique we had initial chosen, which is outlined on our Parts page . Ultimately it was useful to discuss the similarities in our project and swap war-stories about the techniques that we might use for cloning these genes.
Meetups
European Experience 2016 - Paris
Despite being newcomers to the competition we were eager to discuss and share our ideas with other teams. We first headed off to Paris barely 5 days after we finished training to present our design to over 20 different teams from 11 different countries. During the conference we became familiar with multiple teams, and received input into one of the potential designs of our system. This is where we discovered iGEM Paris Saclay - a fellow team using the same CRISPR-dCAS9 system.

Patients interview
Q：Hi, how are you Mrs. Zhou?
A: Good, good. I’m feeling much better now.
Q: If it’s possible, can you briefly explain to us what exactly are you suffering from?
A: Ahh. It’s not a problem. Well, I’ve been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis for several years now.                         And I’ve been constantly taking medicine to treat it. It costs a lot of money. Too                         expensive!
Q: What is this medicine that you are taking now that is this expensive?
A: I don’t really know the exact name, but you can have a look at it. It’s a medicine produced in                         America.
Q: Oh? America? Why aren’t you taking any of the medicine produced locally.
A: That’s a long story to tell. This medicine I’m taking is supposed to be composed of UDCA. From                         what the doctors told me, this medicine is designed to treat diseases like what I have here. But                         it seems like only the America version works on my. The locally produced version of this                         medicine is chemically synthesized so I guess it’s not really a good thing. And I can feel it                         too. Because my stomach often hurts from taking the medicine.
Q: Wait… Are you sure of it? Are you sure that your pain comes from taking the chemically                         synthesized medicine?
A: Well yes. The pain usually starts an hour or half after taking the medicine. And the doctors                         confirmed my theory as well. They say this chemically synthesized version of the medicine would                         usually have gastrointestinal discomfort as a side effect.
Q: Well that’s not good! So have you considered any other choices? Or have the doctors                         recommended anything else?
A: Yes. And that’s actually why I’m telling you how expansive the medicine is. The chemically                         synthesized version of this medicine is not that expensive. Although it cannot be covered by                         medical insurance. It’s definitely affordable. The medicine I’m taking now is indeed very good.                         It doesn’t have any side effects. I guess the only side effects is that it is too expensive. I                         can’t really afford it now. I really want an alternative. But it sees like the only alternative                         is bear bile powder.
Q: What do you know about bear bile powder?
A: I know it’s not extremely expensive so I can probably afford it. But I also know how people                         acquire bear bile powder. Ugh,"
UChile_Biotec,2017," the pros and cons of our project.
At the next meeting, the Peshawar team gave us a document describing solutions to the problems our project has, as well as others that our team had overlooked. The document sent by Peshawar is attached below:
Our team was very happy with the content of the document. Mainly because it helped us to find ideas for our main problem. How to avoid the disintegration of our aptazymes by DNAases, when measuring the concentration of STX in real samples (and not pure samples of STX as we have worked in our proof of concept). The Peshawar team proposed us to use molecules that block DNase activity, and sent us a complete list of molecules that fulfil this function, in order to select the one that best fits our system (that is, the one that will least affect the activity of the aptazyma). They also proposed to work our system at low temperatures, since they inhibit the activity of DNAases.
After discussing the different points of the document mentioned above, we began to discuss the most important problems of the Peshawar team project. That's how we found out that their biggest problem is how to reliably detect ion concentrations that are insoluble in aquatic samples. We also discussed the possibility of investigating if they could fulfill the objective of their project (sensing metal ions in water samples) using a system like the one we propose. That is how our team generated the following document:
In this paper, we describe how metal ions of interest to the Peshawar team (Hg, Zn, As and Cd) could be measured using functional DNA and a cell-free system, such as ours. For this we rely on a bibliographical analysis. In this analysis, we also find that these systems that use functional DNA are capable of efficiently measuring insoluble metal ions, so we managed to propose a solution to the great problem Team Peshawar, just as they did with us.
In conclusion, this was a very valuable collaboration for our team for several reasons. First, we could interact with an iGEM team from a country very distant from ours. This made us realize that despite the distance and that both teams are from different cultures, science is able to unite us deeply. As a team, we are very grateful that iGEM allows us to have these opportunities. Another reason is that we managed to discuss our projects in depth, and we received a very valuable feedback, which helped us to see our project from another point of view, which will allow us to continue improving it. Finally, we would like"

After gaining insight into each other’s project, both of us realize that we could have a further collaboration. Mutual Benefits Achieved The project of Peking is to construct a ‘synthetic membrane-less organelle’ as a multifunctional toolbox in yeast. They were planning to examine the effect of β-carotene producing in order to verify the feasibility of their project. Theβ-carotene producing consists of several enzymatic reactions.

Mutual Benefits Achieved Fudan_CHINA planned to develop a web application for visualizing their model this year. However, they got trouble in implementing their software on the web using JavaScript language. We introduced them a high-level Python Web framework which called Django to help them build web app. Similar with Fudan-CHINA, our model is related to Probability Theory.

Given the striking similarity in QGEM's bifunctional biofilm optimization project, to that of Waterloo's prion based, a logical collaboration existed between the two team. This summer QGEM faced a deficit in web development knowledge, which Waterloo was eager to aid with - graciously offering to building a web accessible version of the software for public use. Both teams planned to build upon the existing software program, broadening its bases of organism knowledge. QGEM primarily worked with E.coli this summer, and thus, the program solely contained an E.coli database. In contrast, Waterloo worked with Yeast this summer, and therefore planned to add Yeast data to our organism database. Waterloo hoped to then utilize the program, allowing faster progression of their project - as optimal parts of their organism would be quickly brought to their knowledge, saving valuable time.
Unfortunately, this collaboration between teams did not happen until late into the summer, and not enough time existed to complete the collaboration to its full extent. Nevertheless, the opportunity to discuss projects to parallel in idea and execution provided imperative problem solving aid to both teams. Waterloo brought to the attention of QGEM, various parameters that should and could be incorporated into the ratiometric program. For example, looking into the effects of degradation rates of protein production. Incorporating these aspects produced in much stronger, more accurate results from the ratiometric program. Similar feedback, along with tips and tricks, were given back to Waterloo who similarly directly benefited from the ongoing collaboration.
Collaboration with Sydney
This summer, QGEM was contacted by the University of Sydney iGEM team, who were interested in learning more about the oGEM network in their quest to set up an Australasian iGEM network. As a result, QGEM shared with Sydney iGEM details on how oGEM meetings are organized and structured during the summer, and provided information on meeting agendas, topics of discussion at oGEM meetings, methods of communication, sponsorships for oGEM meetups, and strategies for promoting oGEM to industry and academia. Some advice we gave regarding setting up an iGEM network included:
Establishing a consistent and effective form of communication between all teams (e.g. Slack)
Drafting an iGEM handbook for new teams to ease transitioning year to year

Cooperation between different teams is in the core of the iGEM ethos. We decided to embrace said philosophy by initiating an association with UNITN , a team from Northern Italy. Their project, focusing on Microbial Fuel Cells, focuses on the same issue as ours: sustainability and renewable energy. This relationship has been reciprocal. They have contributed to our Human Practices by completing our questionnaire and they have provided thorough feedback on our wiki. We coached them with their presentation and most importantly, we developed a mathematical model to describe their system.
Modeling
James helped the UNITN-Trento team with their modeling . Their project has a protein called proteorhodopsin (PR) which is a light driven proton pump that can be used to produce ATP molecules. The team asked James ""what is the number of ATP molecules that can be produced per second as a function of light irradiance that hits the bacterial membrane?"" James found that the reaction was based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics as the PR must complete its cycle before it can absorb another photon and at high light irradiance this leads to saturation.[1][2]

In order to get a clearer picture of UDCA-contained drug’s manufacturing circumstance in China,                         our team visited Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company to interview the experts                         about current chemical producing methods. According to Mr. Xing Ruwen and Mr. Li Jinlong, the                         most popular method of producing UDCA-contained medicine in the market mainly focuses on                         chemical pharmaceutical procedures. Yet this approach has disadvantages including relatively                         weak efficacy and potential harm to health of the workers. He praises our aim to produce UDCA                         medic in biopharmaceutical procedure and consider it very promising. Furthermore, he encouraged                         us to cut off cost so that our method can be accepted by the market and the patients. This                         suggestion helped us to clarify our future goal.

Mr. Xing Ruwen is the chief engineer in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company. He is                         an experienced manager who has been working on Chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drugs                         for years.
Mr. Xing introduces us the traditional chemical procedure to manufacture the UDCA-contained drug.                         Also, he leads us to visit the processing workshop and teaches us many valuable knowledge about                         drug production.
According to his opinion, chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drug basically has two                         disadvantages: the first one is its high risk; the second one is related to profit, a factor                         that influences manufacturing the most. For its potential high risk, Mr. Xing conveys that it                         comes from the utilization of metal sodium. Sodium is well-known for its highly-reactiveness; it                         is able react violently with water, which at the same time release large amount of heat and                         might cause potential safety issue to the workers. He praises our thought of avoiding the                         dangerousness and very much acknowledges our method.
Mr. Li Jinlong
Mr. Li Jinlong works as the production manager and he also participating in marketing                         department’s work in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company.
Mr. Li patiently answers our questions related to marketing. Analyzing its cost, demand and also                         profit, Mr. Li helps us to determined our minds on trying to solve the problem step by step. He                         informs that currently the successful UDCA synthesis rate is not hight enough and requires                         repeating measures to increase its purification"

Conference with Team AHUT_China and NAU-China
On 28th, September, 2016, we were invited and held a conference on iGEM projects with Team AHUT_China and NAU-China. It was a great opportunity for us to publicize our team and projects in other cities. On this conference, we introduced great therapeutic effects of our engineered MSCs on inflammatory diseases and shared different opinions on cell therapy. We were excited to find that most audience were interested in this new chassis (MSCs) including its phenotype, function and low immunogenicity. After that, they raised questions on our biosafety of our engineered MSCs and gave some suggestion to us. We were pleased to communicate with people from different fields.

MethotrExit: a HeteroGenious Cleaning Factory
Abtract
Cytotoxic anticancer drugs are among the harmful chemicals found in hospital wastewater at high concentrations. Degradation processes through physical and chemical methods exist but are often inefficient, unsustainable or expensive. We propose MethotrExit, a bioreactor-based approach to tackle this problem. We focused on the biotransformation of methotrexate (MTX), a widely used anticancer drug. We designed synthetic cassettes encoding a new biotransformation pathway using a heterologous carboxypeptidase in Escherichia coli. In only five hours, MethotrExit drastically removes MTX from the media. However, anticancer drug degradation products and/or the biotransformation pathway itself might be toxic for E. coli. To overcome this issue, biobricks generating heterogeneity in enzyme expression were built to ensure survival of a subpopulation. Modelling of this system highlights the interest of a division of labor between “cleaning” and “stem” bacterial cells.

Collaborations
Sent a Collaboration Request and constructed an alliance to build a worldwide database.
We came up with the idea that we could gather all the iGEM teams whose projects were about water pollution treatment and built an alliance to unite all information and data concerning the social impacts, knowledge and geographical advantages they collected during the conduction of their project.
Built an alliance
On 12th of August, we had a voice conferencing with SJTU/SCUT/XMU/UCAS/JLU/FAFU, during which we discussed about how we wanted to use this alliance, and the discussion led to 2 conclusions:
1. Build a worldwide database for the contents of heavy metals in local soil.
2. Mutually promote the social impact of each parties in this alliance.
Constructed a world-wide database
On 23th of August, we sent a Collaboration Request to iGEM official website. And the next day, Ana Sifuentes replied our message and posted our request in the iGEM official website.
we received the response of many teams like heretofore team EXETER and team CSMU NCHU TAIWAN. With their information, we constructed a database which contained the global data of contents of Cu2+/Cd2+ in soil or water. And we built it based on the world map. We received team CSMU NCHU TAIWAN's kindly help——they offered us information about major metal pollution incidents in Taiwan as well as the real time monitoring data of places that had the potential risk of occurrence of serious pollution incidents.

IIT_Delhi,2018," probiotics has come to our knowledge.
Mexico
In Mexico, all food that has been processed or produced by genetically modified organisms are considered transgenic, but food containing GM or transgenic compounds are not identified, even though there are biosecurity laws and norms for regulation, such as SEP, CIBIOGEM, SAGARPA, SEMARNAT, SHCP and the Federal Law for Protection of the Consumer.
In terms of the norm, the Official Mexican, Norm NOM-056-FITO-1995, is in force and regulates everything related to GM mobilization in the country, so all public and private company must fulfill the requirements in the norm to have their food with genetically engineered compounds transit through Mexico. Furthermore, the law of Biosecurity of GMO and the Federal Law for Protection of the Consumer controls the release for consumption and commercialization of pilot projects besides regulating importation and exportation of GM in the country. No companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.
Sweden
In Sweden every substance or combination of substances that is provided under the pretense that it has a preventative or therapeutic effect on diseases in humans or animals states for a pharmaceutical, which is regulated by the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA). When this kind of probiotic is been prepared to be released the Swedish Gene Technology Advisory Board and the Swedish National Council of Medical Ethics are often involved and give out statements and input in regards to the applications for clinical trials. There all pharmaceuticals that contain any modified organism need to be labeled with “This product contains (a) genetically modified organism(s)”, and all of the trials regarding GM pharmaceuticals are posted on the Swedish Medical Products Agency’s website. In Europe, the following company working with engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge: ActoBio Therapeutics (part of Intrexon) in Belgium.
United States
Engineered probiotics are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, as they are neither a food nor a drug. As a result, they currently do not require large clinical trials like other drugs in America. The following companies working with engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge: Azitra, Synlogic and ZBiotics.
Brazil
There exists no law that regulates genetically engineered probiotics, but in 2018 ANVISA, the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency, opened up the public consultation and now genetically engineered probiotics were added to the regulation. Besides, there is no companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics. With this research, we were able to see that there is a growing movement of engineered probiotics mostly in the U.S"

When we had just begun working on our project, team Korea_U_Seoul advised us about the specifications of the competition and gave us tips on time management and experimental procedure. Then both teams gave presentations on their project and had a discussion session afterwards.
iGEM Team BGU
Representative of BGU: Noa Weiss contacted us first on September 22nd when she first inquired about our project details on our official Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/koreasonyeodul/ and informed us about the variety of mutations they have been working on. Since they were working with the same protein chain as we were, we decided to exchange protocols for each other’s enzymes. When we sent them our PETase model, they were glad to practice mutations on it and sent them kindly back for our testing. The current testing, because of the late contact we had with BGU, is still under process. BGU also sent us a prototype TPA(Terephthalic acid) detection protocol that they had created, which we could use to possibly detect any signs of PET degradation."

Help HZAU build relationship with UT-Tokyo
First, the team from Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU) found us and asked us to help them contact UT-Tokyo. With the help of our software, they successfully established communication and talked about some academic issues. Second, several teams helped us test our software, did our questionnaires and provided us with feedbacks.
Receive feedbacks from other teams
Thanks to many other teams’ feedback, we could improve our software and offer our users better experience. It is not convenient to show all the feedback below, so we will only show the content of feedback from XMU and NEFU.
Feedback from NEFU:
1.Could not load the page of Map.
2.Hope to use customized stickers in Chat page.
3.Could not turn to Material page from Chat page.
4.It would be better show the type of files and the preview of images. For example, image files can be shown in thumbnails, pdf and doc can be shown in corresponding icons. Then it is more convenient to browse files.
5.End Time must be late than Start Time.
6.It would be better to explain these abbreviation forms in the guide book.
7.Sign-up function in Chat was not available.
Feedback from XMU:
About Map：    1. I can’t find the filter toolbar below.

Overview ""It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed."" –Napolean Hill We reached out for 3 registered teams this year and achieved mutual benefits in the process of cooperation. As a software team, we use our skills at data processing and front-end visualization to help other teams a lot. Also, they gave lots of practical suggestions on our project from the experimenter's point of view. SJTU-software We surprisely found that the project of SJTU-software is also relative to metabolic pathway like us from the website of iGEM. So we contacted with their team leader and held a meeting to communicate on our projects and solve problems we met together. Mutual Benefits Achieved Our software contains a function of flux balance analysis with Cobra tool box. Surprisely, some team members of SJTU-software have learnt Cobra tool box in their professional classes. Since our software only evaluated the flux distribution and did not look insight into the results, they showed us some cases and taught us how to choose knockout native genes for more efficient heterologous pathways based on the results of flux balance analysis. We added this to our project and made our software more practical.

The quantitative relationships among four parameters shows below:
$$\dot{\mathcal{A}}=\alpha_{\dot{\mathcal{A}}}f_m(M)S-(D_r+h_0)\dot{\mathcal{A}}$$
$$\dot M = -k_2 \alpha_{\dot{\mathcal{A}}}f_m (M)S+I_m(t)$$
$$\dot S=\alpha_S C-k_3\alpha_{\mathcal{A}}f_m(M)S-(D_r+h_0)S$$
$$\dot C=-k_1\alpha_s C+I_c(t)$$
Mathematic formulation
According to the expression of photosynthesis which is the reaction of photosynthesis as following:
$$6CO_2+6H_2O\longrightarrow(CH_2O)_6+6O_2$$
We know that the coefficient of the carbon dioxide which is consumed by carbohydrates is \(\frac{44}{33}\ g[CO_2]\ g[CH_2O]^{-1}\). If the increment of the carbohydrates’ dry weight is influenced only by the content of the organic matters and mineral substance, and the proportion of the two is 1:9 approximately, the coefficient of the consumed mineral substance, k2, is:
$$k_2=0.1\frac{g[M]}{g[\mathcal{A}]}$$
The coefficient of the consumed organic matters, k3, is:
$$k_3=0.9\cdot \frac{g[(CH_2 O)_6]}{g[\mathcal{A}]}$$
From the above, what can be seen is that the main idea of these ordinary differential equations is element conservation. They work out the growth velocity indirectly by analyzing the transform of the substances in the fixed space.

Introduction
We want to detect paclitaxel by using microtubule which expressed in E.coli. As we all know, microtubule is the cytoskeleton in eukaryotes which is assembled by α-tubulin and β-tubulin, but E.coli is the prokaryote, so it is very important to verify whether microtubule assemble successfully or not in E.coli. If microtubule assembles successfully, it means α-tubulin and β-tubulin have biological activities"

BIT-China for BNU-China
This year we collaborated with BNU-CHINA team and held a meeting on July 11st, 2015. During the meeting we exchanged our ideas and discussed on our projects. Finally, we confirmed our collaboration relationship.
Because most of BNU-CHINA’s team members were freshmen for iGEM, after the discussion, we decided to help them for parts of their gene circuits. Meanwhile, we had some difficulties in modeling and expressing functional gene NhaA and NhaB, so they offered help to solve these problems.
Fig.1 meeting with BNU-China
We helped them finish the light regulation system (Pcons+B0034+PcyA+B0034+ho1). In this system, Pcons is one of the constitutive promoters (from BBa_J23100 to BBa_J23119) which can be used to tune the expression level of expressing part and what we chose was J23100. B0034 is a kind of strong ribosome binding sites (RBS). PcyA and ho1 are two requisite genes which are required for the transformation from heme into phycocyanobilin (PCB). Ho1 will oxidize the heme group and then generate biliverdin IX alpha, and PcyA converts biliverdin IX alpha into PCB.
Fig.2 Gene circuits of light regulation system
Overlap extension PCR (OE-PCR) was used to finish their gene circuits. However, there were secondary structures in this part. So we could not get the part at first. Then we changed DNA polymerase Pfu to Primer STAR, which performs better than Pfu. Finally the light regulation system was constructed successfully.
Fig.3 The construction result of light regulation system
In this period, we also had some discussions about experiments and modeling face to face. Through these discussions, we learnt more about each other and made progress together.

University of La Verne Meetup
The UC San Diego team was part of the summer meetup hosted by University of La Verne, including UC Davis and TecCEM. Because it was the first time for a lot of people on our team, it was very helpful to meet with the teams and get feedback on our project ideas. It was very interesting to hear about the other teams’ project ideas, including ideas about encoding genetic data in bacterial plasmids, developing a mammalian biosensor, and wastewater treatment and PET degradation. We also got a lot of feedback about certain aspects to focus on for the wetlab design of our project, including the specificity of the MBD protein. University of La Verne was also extremely gracious in helping walk us through part of the Interlab protocol after our initial data set was rejected. As such, it was great to meet the other Southern California teams and get their advice. We also helped clarify some of the other team’s projects and were able to give tips on presentation and communication.
Imperial College
Imperial College is also developing a Communications Strategy Guide (CSG), and we were able to provide some feedback for their guide. In return, as a new team, they helped give us some tips for what to expect at the Jamboree.
Boston University Hardware Team
After our team decided to implement a microfluidic platform, we realized that we needed to understand how to integrate genetic circuit work with microfluidics. Thus, we first got in contact with Dr. Douglas Densmore, who serves as one of the primary investigators for the Boston University Hardware iGEM team. He explained the classifications of microfluidic devices and helped us understand the advantages and disadvantages of controlled flow devices and paper microfluidics. In addition, we had a follow up call with BU HW who helped us further understand some of the tools that the CIDAR Lab has developed in order to help expedite the microfluidic device fabrication workflow. They also got us into contact with Jana Healthcare who works in developing an optical sensing biosensor for glucose levels."
SCU-China,2018," first time for them to participate in the iGEM competition, there are many problems and obstacles in their experiments. Thus, it is necessary for them to get familiar with regulations of the competition as soon as possible for the purpose of researching in a more directional and objective way. So, we explained the concept of laboratory safety, Interlab, some technical methods and precautions commonly used in the experiments. And we also shared our experiences of experiments with them, such as what to do when you get an unexpected result During the lecture, the members of the CDHSU listened to us very carefully and asked us in detail about what they did not understand of the video, such as the laboratory safety levels. At the same time, we found that they had some mistakes in the aseptic operation. So we reminded them of the importance of the aseptic operation, for it is the basis of successful experiments. We also gave them some failure examples. Then it came to the Gibson assembly and the golden gate assembly. For most of the students in CDHSU, it was the first time for them to get to know these two technologies. But they showed great interest and came to understand the main methods and functions. They also tried to compare their strengths and weaknesses critically. After that, they shared what they had got in this lecture. Although some complicated gene circuits were still somehow beyond their understanding, they got to know how to start an iGEM project after our patient explanation. We had a sense of achievement that this lecture did help them to some extent. On the other hand, through the communication we also realized that we should pay more attention to the simplicity and operability of our project -- CRISProgrammer. After the lecture, we went to their lab, observed their experimental operation and put forward many constructive suggestions, such as the plates cannot be completely exposed to the air at any time. Also, we obtained more detailed information about their project, which enabled us to give them reliable advice later in the further cooperation. Due to the lack of certain experimental equipment, the CDHSU came to our laboratory to use the fluorescent microplate reader to test their products. In September, we guided them to fill in the registration information and gave them a part in the Interlab section, which is described in detail in our collaborations. The lecture in July was the beginning of the contact and cooperation between SCU_China and CDHSU, which also spread the spirit of iGEM and made contributions to the inheritance and development of iGEM.

Besides, they gave us suggestions in the improvements of our split T7 report system and the design of our kit. Also, their team is very interested in our split T7 system, certifies the potential of it, and connects this system to their frontier studies. In general, we had an exchange in material and a pleasant communication with team NUDT-China.
5 JNFLS
Since our team members come from all parts of China, it is difficult for our team to make progression for our experiments in schooldays due to the distance. Team SDU-China shares the laboratory with one team member living in the same city and facilitates the experimental progress. By sharing the laboratory with SDU-China, our team transforms the plasmid sHRPN-dcas9 and sHRPC-dcas9 into competent cell DH5α, cultures the bacteria, and harvests the plasmid of larger amount. Also, we exchanged our ideas about some potential improvements in each other’s project and design."

During the course of this iGEM edition, TU Delft embarked on an ambitious and challenging journey for the realization of its project. However, we believe that the iGEM experience is more than just carrying out complex microbiological lab work and developing complicated yet cutting-edge models: iGEM is also a worldwide community that continues to expand, with more than 300 teams participating from all around the world this year. Consequently, TU Delft organized an European iGEM Meetup in which teams from all over Europe were invited to join us in Delft, the Netherlands. Approximately 200 attendees from 9 different countries had the chance to get to know each other, engage in a debate about synthetic biology and its future prospects,"
Washington,2017," team, our team shared our project and its possible uses and applications. We learned that the Cadets2Vets team is working closely with the US Military. Aligned with US Military interests, the team has created an inexpensive, portable means of arsenic detection. Their hardware system uses components and concepts similar to our Chromastat’s color-sensing hardware, and we exchanged ideas and possible avenues of development based on our experience. The Cadets2Vets team shared insight about possible ways to develop our biobricks and wetlab work."
Peking,2018," with DLUT_China
On July 14th, we communicated with two iGEM teams from DLUT_China at Peking University. It is our great honor to invite them to come here.
The three teams introduced their projects in turn. We chose the three different tracks foundational advances, hardware and therapeutics, and shared advice from different points of view which benefited us in a major way. We’d like to thank professors Wei Ping and Zi Lihan for their specific instructions and kind help.
We then exchanged our experience in modelling, experiments and human practice and helped each other with troubleshooting. Our friends from DLUT_China then visited our lab and we talked about how to make use of the available space more efficiently.
It was a rather pleasant communication and we looked forward to further collaboration with them. Later on, we provided DLUT_China with plasmid pSB and it is our pleasure to collaborate with them.
International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition Symposium in Beijing
To communicate with the teams from universities in Beijing and seek deeper cooperation, we invited colleagues from BIT-China , BNU-China , OUC-China , Tsinghua , and UCAS-China to Peking University and hosted the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition Symposium in Beijing on August 7th 2018.
Each of the six teams presented their projects and answered questions from the audience, which to a large extent gave them ideas on refining the project both scientifically and from the engineering standpoint.
After the presentations, we had a luncheon and all the students communicated with each other freely. We came up with a number of scientific questions worth exploring. We both accepted and offered several pieces of useful advice on modelling, which helped us and our friends to better explain and predict the systems. We also talked about some particular experimental techniques, which boosted the efficiency of lab work later on.
Conference of the Chinese iGEM Community
We took part in the Conference of the Chinese iGEM Community from August 27th to August 31st 2018 in ShanghaiTech . It was a great opportunity for us to learn from hundreds of iGEMers from across China and professors from different fields.
We made the presentation on the morning of August 28th. We made great progress in various aspects including speech fluency and artistic design of the slides. We were asked several questions about the functions of the phase separation system, which shed light on our experiments and reminded us of some potential new applications.
A total of 63 wonderful presentations and excellent posters in the following days took us on a brilliant tour of synthetic biology. We communicated, we doubted, we thought and"
SCUT-China,2015,"GEMers create amazing gene circuits easily, we suggested SKLBC-GDSYZX to collect remarkable past iGEM designs to build up a gene circuit library. During the process, members of SKLBC-GDSYZX could test their app and gain novel ideas about the app. However, gathering past iGEM gene circuits was a hard work for them since they were lack of experiences in synthetic biology. Therefore, we help them to study the past iGEM projects and used the panel app to construct a gene circuits library. Then we gave them feedbacks to help them improve panel app. These are some examples of gene circuits that we created with SKLBC-GDSYZX’s app below.

The human practice of Team SKLBC-GDSYZX was to develop a class of synthetic biology .There were some troubles for the team members to understand the concepts in synthetic biology since their limited knowledge background. Therefore we offer to collect and simplify key knowledge points for them to facilitate their study. At last, we complete the work based on the textbook of Introduction to Synthetic Biology by Song Kai."
Calgary,2017," page here .
Procedure
To carry out this collaboration, we followed the protocol provided by iGEM McMasterU . The purpose of this experiment was to act as a proof of concept that the DNAzyme will cleave specifically in the presence of E. coli and will not cleave in the presence of other bacteria.
Materials:
60mm plates
M9 plating media
M9 liquid media
E. coli DH5α
Bacillus subtilis WB800
8 μM DNAzyme
100 mL of M9 liquid media for overnight inoculations were prepared in 87.79 mL of autoclaved ddH2O by combing 10 mL of autoclaved 2 x M9 salts, 200 μL of 1 M MgSO4, and 10 μL of 1 M of CaCl2. These solutions were autoclaved separately before being added to the ddH2O. 2 mL of filter-sterilized 20% glucose was also added to the mixture. Two overnights of E. coli DH5α and two of B. subtilis WB800 were made using 3 mL of the liquid media. The culture tubes were shaken for 24 hours at 37°C. After the incubation period, the cell density of the overnights as measured using a wavelength of 600 nm.
As preparation for making the M9 plating media, 2.988 g of agar powder was dissolved in 100 mL of ddH2O and autoclaved. 100 mL of the M9 plating media was then made by combining 49.8 mL of the agar solution, 49.8 mL of 2 x M9 salt, 99.5 μL of 1 M MgSO4, and 9.95 μL of 1 M CaCl2. 398 μL of filter-sterilized 20% glucose was also added. The M9, MgSO4, and CaCl2 salts were previously autoclaved and the plating media was made using aseptic technique. 2.5 mL of the media was pipetted into four 60 mm plates. Eight 60 mm plates were also made using higher amounts of the media (~5 mL).
Quadrants were drawn on the plates containing M9 media. On one set of plates, one quadrant was labelled DH5α for E. coli, another DNAzyme, and the two remaining sections were named negative controls. A second set of plates were also labelled. The first quadrant was named B"

Consort iGEM Team
Our third collaboration has taken place with our friends, the Consort, Alberta iGEM team from Consort Alberta. We have also been able to present in front of them and talk to them one on one about our projects meaning that we both have a lot of information regarding each other’s projects. For this reason consort contacted us and asked us if we would right a short report talking about their project, concerns that we have with their project, ways to address these concerns, general advice and more.
Here are our two collaborative pieces:
Canmore’s Write Up for Consort: This year the iGem team from Consort is continuing with their ECOS project, bacteria designed to detect the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons in order to prevent any harm to the environment. Consort’s ongoing project is a great concept for many reasons. Firstly it is something that is a local problem in their community and especially hits home for some of the team members, which means that they devote themselves fully to the project. Secondly because the outcome of this project could be very helpful for surrounding communities and possibly could hold some wealth in it. Finally because this project could help save countless amounts of crops and livestock from what is a major threat to them.
The science behind the project is very intriguing as well. The indicator protein is atoned to xylene, which is a very volatile liquid hydrocarbon, which in itself is a good thing to find and remove but it is tied to other dangerous compounds. When these compounds are detected the proteins emit a color indication that would alert the user to the presence of said dangerous compounds. Whilst this all seems simple the biobrick is not, and they have spent years developing this to perfection to start with their prototypes.
The prototype and models of prototypes look to be a very effective method of using ECOS. I was able to see one of the prototypes and it looked good even though I was unable to see it in action, this shows great promise for the team in their upcoming endeavors. I can see much success in the future if this team especially if they have a working prototype at the giant Jamboree, I personally wish them the best (-Joshua Lamb)

Q: The plant Vetiveria zizanioides is an example of phytoremediation. According to this fact, endosymbiotic                     microorganism should be able to multiply. How do you examine the sample of soil microorganism on the                     effect of it?
A: By testing the quantity of the chemical aimed in degradation.
Q: Does the application of genetic modified microorganism have environmental concern?
A: We don’t have any applications in this field.
Mingdao
Mingdao helped us host the 6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference. Besides, we went to their lab for some growth curve testing. With their help and the microplate reader, we've got to spend less time on this part and using the data to optimize our experiment. Thanks to them, so that we can successfully finish our project.
In contrast, we found Mingdao was lack of source about the mosquito experiment. That is the key point for application design and test of their project. We introduced MIngdao to the Mosquito Lab at Entomology Department of our school.

iGEM kit of InterLab shared by BNDS_China
In the first week of the experiment, we could not begin our Interlab project since we had not received our iGEM kit. At that time, round to July 10th, BNDS_China had completed the Interlab project and there was a plethora of materials left, so we borrowed the kit from them so that we could finish our project before the due.
Help BFSUICC_China
As our team followed the procedure of Interlab, we found that we were specialized in the dilution procedure. We had done an excellent job in the dilution process: the colony of different dilutions had perfectly normal differences, and the efficiency was much high. Therefore, we offered help to the team of BFSUICC_China to dilute the sample. Additionally, after having counted the colony, we helped them to wash the plate.
Help from Team Tsinghua
During July and August, we did our experiment in the next room of Team Tsinghua. Sometimes we shared one facility together, including the gel electrophoresis, the balance, the incubator, and the super clean bench. Team Tsinghua was there to help us at anywhere and anytime. Since we were not familiar with the location of some necessities, they were so active to guide us how to get them. Additionally, when we got something confused or incorrect, they were readily to help us. They reminded us to clean the balance after measuring the weight since we sometimes were a little bit careless when using the balance, they guided us to use their gel electrophoresis device, and they told us many of their lab rules in order to keep us safe.
Modelling Learning with BJRS_China
In August 11, 2018, our team and BJRS_China learned the basic methods to construct modelling of our data online together. We helped mutually to well comprehend the principle rule and solve questions of one another. All of us assimilated the rule of modelling, and by the time we built solid friendship with teammates of BJRS_China.

NTU-Singapore,2018," for help in ligating and cloning this fragment into a vector, so it would be easier to amplify and proceed for their assay.
Figure 1.  PCR Result of HT1 and HT2 from UI_Indonesia indicating non-specificity in amplification
How We Helped?
One of our team members Angelysia Cardilla managed to meet up with UI_Indonesia in Jakarta, Indonesia, to discuss about our projects and get to know more about each team's project. In the session, UI_Indonesia also passed us with the gBlocks that they wanted to clone. 
Figure 2.  Meetup with UI_Indonesia
We cloned the HT1-HT2 fragments into the pcDNA3 backbone. Firstly, we kept all the gBlock fragments in the TOPO clone vector before amplifying them. We found that amplifying from TOPO template could lead to higher yield and efficiency. We designed some Gibson primers to combine the two fragments into the pcDNA3 vector. There were a total of 4 primers that we used to do Gibson cloning, HT1 F, HT1 R, HT2 F, and HT2 R. To check if the cloning was successful, we did colony PCR. We also confirmed the successful cloning of HT into pcDNA3 by sending the plasmid for sequencing. The sequence below shows the conjunction of the vector backbone and the HT construct, and the part that is not highlighted is pcDNA3 which has Ampicillin resistance as selective marker. 
Figure 3. Sequence of HT in pcDNA3
As they had faced difficulties in cloning these constructs and such problems may arise again in preparing for part submission, we proposed to them to help to move HT fragment into BioBricks compatible vectors. We cut both the backbone and the plasmid pcDNA3-HT1-HT2 to get the insert with restriction enzyme EcoRI and PstI. Afterward, we ligated them and transformed into competent cells, cultured them on the plate with CML resistance. The correct insertions were confirmed after colony PCR with VF2 and VR primers which are shown on the figure below. All the colony we picked showed correct band size, indicating successful results. 
Figure 4. Colony PCR of psB1C3-HT 
Anticipating other possible difficulties they might have in preparing for part submission, we further offered to help them to remove prohibited restriction sites on the final plasmid and made the plasmid BioBricks compatible. In the end, we submitted their constructs on their behalf as  BBa_K2607001  "

As the famous Chinese proverb goes,""Union is strength"". It adequately shows the importance of collaboration. During the past years, team Nankai has been cooperating intimately with team Tianjin, our beloved neighbor and friend. We discussed from time to time about different details in our projects and helped each other out when it was needed. Besides, this year team Nankai set up a new resource sharing platform named ""iShare"" . It's a platform for all the iGEM teams to get what they need. To gather more the information, we have also reach for many other teams for help. Thanks to all the iGEM teams who offered us help, ishare is now fully functional.

The Lotus Festival held at TJU
In early April, when the lotus is the most exuberant in school, team Tianjin held a lotus festival to popularize the knowledge of  biotechnology. As their neighbor and partner, team Nankai were invited to the festival. We thanked their hospitality and offered them several samples of actinomycetes for exhibition. During the festival we had some nice chats with members of team Tianjin and had a good time enjoying the beautiful view inside the campus of Tianjin University.

Supporting date of hydrophobin expression
This year, iGEM team Tianjin worked on a special small protein called hydrophobin. They tried to optimize the expression of hydrophobin in prokaryotic expression system. However, a special member in hydrophobin group called injanus, also known as HGF1, could not be expressed in E.coli. They still needed the dates about the expression of injanus and thus reached us for help. Fortunately we managed to characterize the expression of injanus in Pichia pastoris,with the help of Qiao's laboratory in Nankai university. The results were sent to team Tianjin for further employment.

Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018," beginning of our adventure. It was a great opportunity for our two teams to build relationships and think together about a collaborative project. After several exchanges we decided to start a collaboration around the LL-37 (a human antibiotic of the class of cathelicidins). Our ultimate goal was to clone LL-37 with an AviTag to be biotinylated in Pichia pastoris. The big idea was to use our Cerberus platform in the Montpellier project and include a new functionalisation of cellulose. We had a second project whose goal was to prove the biological activity of scygonadin on the vaginal flora. Some of the clonings have been performed but we did not have enough time for completion of this task.

Aalto-Helsinki iGEM Team
We met members of the Aalto-Helsinki team at the European meetup in Munich and after discussing both of our projects, we concluded that a collaboration was possible. We talked on Skype and found out we had the same construction with our Carbohydrate-Binding Module but we were not experimenting on the same material: they were using cellulose nanofibrils from birch and we were using bacterial cellulose produced by Gluconacetobacter hansenii. We decided to perform our CBM affinity tests on both materials. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to test each other's material but it was a great opportunity to compare our projects.
iGEM France
Thanks to Grenoble ’s initiative, we were honoured to take part in the iGEM France journey. This newly created association aims to promote mutual aid between French teams and discussions about their difficulties. We had meetings every month through Skype to talk about the role of the association and define projects together to strengthen the connections between French teams. This experience allowed us to contact the teams from Montpellier and Laval (yes, we love french speaking teams!) with whom we have undertaken some great collaborations
Meetups
4th Parisian Meetup
On the 4th of July, we gathered with all the French iGEM teams to participate in the 4th Parisian meetup organised by the Pasteur Paris iGEM team . It was the first time that we presented our project to others and we got the feedback of a jury composed of various professionals. It was very interesting and helpful to receive advice from the jury and the other iGEM teams, so as to improve our presentation and our way to communicate about our project. Seeing everyone’s projects and how they managed to progress gave us an overall idea of"

Collaboration with TAS Taipei iGEM team
We gave them the part with yebF, a motor protein that brings our product out of the cell. This was essential to their project because it allowed their protein, the granzyme B inhibitor, to be delivered out into the reservoir and to diffuse through the bandage.
Furthermore, NYMU hosted an educational summer camp welcoming members from the 2015 and 2016 TAS_Taipei iGEM teams to join and learn.
We have also been supportive for helping TAS_Taipei iGEM team with research and running the model for diffusion, bandage, and the ACT inhibition model.  We provided them with modeling expertise, literature values for our models and debugging expertise.
In addition to our help on TAS, we also collaborated with TAS
To provide us with the LuxR part which is pivotal for our oscillator. LuxR is essential for our oscillator which is used to report the presence of a malicious spore in the device part of the project.
TAS also helped us by running the initial experiments for our microbial fuel cell prototype. We were provided by TAS_Taipei with initial test results of the prototype for our project so that we found the correct soil to water to bacteria ratios(August 2015).
Three members of TAS (Alvin, Fiona and Huiru) are members of both NYMU and TAS teams. They worked at NYMU over the summer for the NYMU_Taipei team and are presenting with the team at the Giant Jamboree!
Joining the Meetup hosted by NCTU_Formosa iGEM team
We joined the meetup hosted by NCTU this summer. Many other teams from Taiwan and China gathered to have a seminar of their projects."

Collaboration with CIEI-China
Our sister team CIEI-China needed to collect samples to test the salinity of kitchen waste for their project and asked if we can help. In May, our team members provided the kitchen waste from each one’s family, helping them collect more trash samples. Also, some of our team members, together with CIEI-China, asked the local residents from door to door and found the kitchen waste in the local community. Eventually, CIEI-China successfully collected enough trash samples for their project.
In order to check if our citronellol was really effective, in October, we conducted our outdoor experiments in the School of Pharmacy in Southern Medical University in Guangzhou. We invited the members of our dear sister team CIEI-China to do the experiments with us in order to gain more sets of data. Due to the experiments, each people got some mosquito bites. We felt really grateful to CIEI-China for helping us with the experiments, because it was awful to be bitten by the mosquitoes.
Collaboration with College Teams
BIT-China provided us the vector pSB1C3.
We joined in a WeChat group called Conference of China iGEMer Community, which is launched by Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. We were motivated to communicate with other teams and learned a lot.
CGEM Summit
We believed that it is of great importance to communicate with other IGEM teams because we could broaden our horizon and get more inspiration of our own project. So, we, CIEI-Beijing, together with our sister team CIEI-China, set up CGEM Summit aiming to share our research and communicate with other about our own latest progress. We invited other three IGEM teams, HFLS-H2Z-HangZhou, RDFZ-China and BIT-China, and some experts to join in our forum.
In this summit, we shared our research with each other, listened to the suggestion from the experts, and developed a further understanding of the great importance and multiple applications of synthetic biology.  Thanks to IGEM, we became close friends with each other and we would work together to make the world a better place to live with biosynthesis technology!

Measurement of pBAD Promoter
Fig.1. Team photo of NYU_Shanghai
NYU Shanghai made a Bacterial Music Generator this year, which could translate the colors and positions of bacteria colonies on a plate into sound composition. Integrating the unpredictable nature of life with digital technology, they aim to introduce new forms of bio-data into the sound domain. They engineered E. coli expressing chromoproteins, fluorescent proteins, or luciferase to produce colors visible under white light. We helped them test the strength of pBAD promoter, which they used to control and predict the expression of target protein.
We characterized the inducible promoter (BBa_I0500) in August. We tried to test it in both liquid and agar medium, which can be more helpful to our friends from NYU Shanghai. And it is the first time the pBAD promoter was measured in LB agar medium in iGEM. We constructed a GFP expression device which consisted of the pBAD promoter (BBa_I0500) and a GFP coding sequence with RBS (BBa_I13504).
The liquid cultures were diluted to OD600 0.0015 in LB and added to the 96-well plate together with arabinose at 7 different concentrations (0%, 0.00002%, 0.0002%, 0.002%, 0.02%, 0.2%, 2%, m/V). The absorbance at 600nm and green fluorescence (excitation: 485 nm, emission: 520 nm) were measured every 30min in a plate reader, until the E. coli cells reached stationary phase (that is, the absorbance and fluorescence no longer increase: about 8 hours from OD 0.5). Both absorbance and fluorescence were background (LB only) corrected. The fluorescence was then normalized for the number of cells by dividing by the absorbance.
The tested cultures were incubated at different concentrations of arabinose (0%, 0.002%, 0"
BNU-China,2018," induce the expression of mCherry by SA, measured its fluorescence intensity to determine the optimal concentration induced by SA and the optimal induction time at the optimal concentration.
Protocol
I. Determination of the optimum concentration of SA for induction
Process:
1. Pick a single colony from the top of the board, expand it with liquid LB containing Amp, and control the time at about 11h.
2. Prepare for SA induction verification:
(1) The whole experiment can be done in 3-5 parallel groups. In the ultra-clean platform, the expanded liquid is divided into several 20ml large centrifuge tubes, each tube is filled with 2ml. Pay attention to the cover of the large centrifuge tube when filling the bacteria solution, wrap it with the sealing film, and tighten the rubber band (because the sealing film can be ventilated, if the cover is covered with oxygen, it will be insufficient).
(2) Adding SA, so that the concentration of SA in the system is 0 mg / L (ie, without SA), 0.001 mg / L, 0.01 mg / L, 0.1 mg / L, 0.3 mg / L, 0.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L.
(3) 37-degree shake flask culture induction for 5 h.
(4) All the samples and the blank E.coli K12 of the expanded culture were placed in the upper 96-well plate (operated in a clean bench), using ELIASA to measure the fluorescence intensity and OD of each sample well, and the fluorescence was mcherry red fluorescence. (Absorption wavelength 580 nm, emission wavelength 610 nm).
Results:
As shown in the picture, when the SA concentration is 0.3-0.5 mg/L, the maximum fluorescence intensity per unit OD can be detected, so the optimum concentration for SA induction is 0.3-0.5 mg/L.
II. Find the optimal induction time at the optimum concentration
Process:
Find out the relationship between the time of induced expression and the fluorescence intensity at the SA concentration of 0.3 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L.
1. Expand the culture of puc19+emrr strain (note the addition of AMP resistance) for about 11 hours.
2. Set 3-5 parallel groups, in the ultra-clean platform, divided the expanded bacterial liquid into several 20ml large centrifuge tubes, each tube is filled with 2ml. Pay attention to the cover of the large centrifuge tube when filling"

Southern California iGEM 2015 Meetup
On August 6, our team met with two iGEM teams - La Verne and UCLA - at the first Southern California iGEM meetup held at UCLA.  Our entire team attended along with two of our advisors, Phillip and Bart.  We discussed our projects and our attempts to make iGEM a sustainable program at our respective universities because we are all relatively new teams.  We concluded that fundraising and garnering support from our academic departments were a few obstacles with a significant impact on team establishment.  Also, we considered the possibility of starting a smaller synthetic biology conference in California.  Overall, we had a great time meeting new people over pizza and cookies!
TP_CC San Diego iGEM Team Mentorship
We ended our week by meeting up with seven members of the the Torrey Pines and Canyon Crest San Diego high school iGEM team on September 4.  The team shared with us their project goals and their progress.  We also offered input about several applications that they mentioned.  Both teams talked about our approach to Human Practices, and we informed TP_CC San Diego about how we tackled funding and gained sponsorships from on-campus laboratories and local biotechnology companies.
TP_CC San Diego presented issues they were facing: since minimal research had been done on LbCHI31-chitinase before, they had difficulty mapping the effectiveness of the encoding gene against varied concentrations of purified chitin. A few of us helped troubleshoot. Due to the limited amount of time left, they wanted to run it in silico but did not have experience with modeling.  Therefore, we gave insight on modeling and how the results should relate to laboratory work.
Before they left, one of our team members sent a guide on wiki editing to help expedite the designing process for TP_CC San Diego.

11.Preparation for competent B. subtilis cells
Streak out the strain to be made competent on an LB or TBAB agar plate as a large patch and incubate overnight at 30 ℃.
The following morning scrape off the cell growth off the plate and use to inoculate fresh, pre-warmed, SpC medium to give an OD600 reading of about 0.5.
Incubate the culture at about 37℃ with vigorous aeration and take periodic OD readings to assess cell growth.
When the rate of cell growth is seen to depart from exponential inoculate 200ml of pre-warmed, SpⅡmedium with 2ml of stationary-phase culture and continue incubation at 37℃ with slower aeration
After 90min incubation, pellet the cells by centrifugation at room temperature.
Carefully decant the supernatant into a sterile container and save.
Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 18ml of saved supernatant and add 2ml of sterile glycerol; mix gently.
Aliquot the competent cells in sterile tubes, freeze rapidly in liquid nitrogen or a dry-ice bath and store at -70℃.
12.Transformation
Thaw competent cells rapidly by immersing frozen tubes in a 37 ℃ water bath.
Immediately, add one volume of SpⅡEGTA to the thawed cells; mix gently.
In a sterile test tube add competent cells to the DNA solution and incubate in a roller drum at 37℃.
Dilute the transformed cells as appropriate in T Base containing 0.5% glucose and plate immediately onto selective media.
13.Amylase activity analysis
Apply iodine on the plate with 0.1% starch and spectinomycin.
Incubate the engineered bacteria and non-engineered bacteria onto the plate at 37℃.
See if there are hydrolysis circles on the plate."

Overall, during the whole process of communication and content sharing, we gained valuable learnings on cooperation from their genuine thoughts and authenticity towards the project.
2. Imperial College_London
Link
With Imperial College_London, we proceeded Kuas’s team survey and discussed about each team’s project. Imperial College_London were trying to develop a team communication app that allows every member of the team an equal opportunity to voice their opinions and concerns. Accordingly, to design their app and ensure its effectiveness, they needed help from the iGEM community on deciding the content of the app. Kuas teammates were deeply interested in team communication issues and had many discussions on similar topics before, so we were glad to deliver our thoughts about the team communication by conducting individual surveys on August 17th.
Also we provided feedback on their science communication guide, which helps scientists to tackle inconsistency problems in synthetic biology when it comes to sharing information with non-scientists and with the public. Providing feedback to their guide was a valuable experience, giving our Human Practice team the opportunity to learn attitudes to have when performing public engagements.
Since Korea and the United Kingdom are so far to have an actual meet-up, we have consistently been in contact through e-mail, Facebook, and online Skype. The first online meet-up was on August 18th through email. Imperial College were working on controlling bacterial gene expression on a 2D plane using electrical stimuli from electrode placed at specific coordinates. Their project was very intriguing and as same undergraduates, Kuas thought our team could provide feedback on their project and also get wet-lab advice and feedback on our project from Imperial College_London.
On September 5th, we did oral description about each project and actual feedback by videochat. Human practice member of Imperial College_London first asked about our project and gave advice, and KUAS also gave feedback on Imperial College_London’s project. On our concern about new variable in microbial system, Imperial College_London recommended the concept “pioneer” as a creator of nutrients. Also, like suggesting quorum sensing system which gave us fresh inspiration on detecting microorganism, Imperial College gave us good opinion on our overall project. We checked Imperial College_London’s project progress and provided some feedback. On the latter part of videochat, we talked about Imperial College_London’s team communication app & science communication guide and finished the collaboration. The collaboration with Imperial College_London was really inspiring and gave us valuable learnings.

Graph of these averages. The error bars are standard deviation but are very small because the 3 replicates for each sample are technical replicates, so do not show the variation that would be seen with biological replicates (3 different colonies for each of the 16 samples).
Fluorescence scan image from the Typhoon with labels for which samples are in each well.
These data indicate that there is no difference in fluorescence between either KillerRed or KillerOrange and the cells only control either with or without induction with IPTG. There could be several reasons for this, including the light was not intense enough to excite the fluorescent proteins, however no fluorescence from this type of the test with a laser for excitation would be unlikely.  It is also possible that no protein is being produced, which could be due to insufficient IPTG. However, the RFP in J04450 under the control of the lac-repressible promoter R0010 clearly shows that in the DH5α.Z1 strain, there is less fluorescence without IPTG, than with IPTG. This is not a perfect control for the concentration of IPTG used unless KillerRed and KillerOrange also have the R0010 promoter. Interestingly, in the DH5α strain, there is no significant difference between RFP fluorescence with or without IPTG – this is due to DH5α not having a functional copy of LacI, the lac repressor, therefore lac-repressible promoters are not “OFF”, so cannot be switched “ON” by IPTG induction.
Sequencing
Another reason there may not be any KillerRed or KillerOrange protein produced, is mutations in the promoter. This was something we encountered when attempting to clone a promoter in front of the toxin from the toxin-antitoxin system we were working with. If a protein is toxic to produce, any cell which is producing less or no protein will grow faster than a cell which is producing the toxic protein. This means a mutated"

UCAS,2017,"lnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production"
Calgary,2017," another DNAzyme, and the two remaining sections were named negative controls. A second set of plates were also labelled. The first quadrant was named B. Sub (B. subtilis) WB800, and another as DNAzyme. The remaining two quadrants were negative controls. 30 μL of E. coli DH5α in liquid media was pipetted to the quadrant labelled DH5α and a bacterial spreader was used to distribute the liquid culture within the quadrant. This process was repeated with the B. subtilis WB800 cultures on the plate with the labelled B. sub-quadrant. The plates were then incubated upside down for 36 hours at 37°C.
The next day, the DNAzyme, which was sent by team iGEM McMasterU in pellet form, was diluted to the concentration of 8 μM using 12.50 μL of autoclaved ddH2O. 5 μL of the DNAzyme solution was pipetted onto the E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 quadrants. 1 μL of DNAzyme was also pipetted onto the quadrants labelled as DNAzyme. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. A picture of the plates was taken under UV light.
Results and Discussion
In our first attempt, two sets of overnight cultures of E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 were made using different colonies. The cell density of these overnights was then calculated from OD600 measurements. This conversion was done using the Cell Culture Concentration from OD600 Calculator from Agilent Genomics.

Ankara Meet Up
We attended the Bilkent organized iGEM Ankara meetup, where we each had the opportunity to present our projects to the other Turkish iGEM teams; Bilkent, METU and Saint-Joseph.
We used this opportunity to evaluate each other’s projects and make recommendations.
Furthermore, we took advantage of this opportunity to assess how our project stands from an outsiders perspective and improve on any weaknesses that we might have otherwise missed.
METU-High Scholl
METU-HS reached out to us for a chance to collaborate. Our very own Atabey Unlu used the Monod Kinetics and Curve Fitting Tool in MathWorks for various Bacterial growth calculations."
Cardiff_Wales,2018," We found that there was expression of both reporter genes, independent of induction by ribitol, suggesting leaky expression. However, we suspect that the Agrobacterium are expressing the constructs rather than the plant.
Secondly, they suggested that we 3D print their hardware, a housing unit built for the detection system of the fungus that causes stem rust. We provided extensive details about the 3D printing procedure, and a brief review of the hardware, such as its design, how well it all fit together, and the theoretical ease of use. In addition, we also contacted a local agronomist about the design, asking what sort of role such a product could have in the UK, whether it would be useful, and whether the design seemed innovative. He gave us detailed feedback about the potential usefulness of such a product, seen in the PDF below. An image of the 3D model can also be seen below.
Figure 2. Image of the 3D printed unit for WashU. This is the housing unit for a detection system for stem rust in wheat.
Details of the whole collaboration can be seen in the embedded PDF below, which we sent to WashU. It can also be downloaded here.
In return, WashU helped extensively with the design of our wiki's navigation bar, helping to debug the system when links and the display did not function as expected. This included making the side-navigation bar functional, enabling easy navigation on smaller screens.
Warwick
Our collaboration with Warwick university began just before the UK iGEM meetup in early July. The team contacted several UK teams to ask if we could collect four water samples from the rivers in our local areas to see if they could test Legionella in the water, from different places across the country. However, instead of just providing the water samples, we collected them from specific regions from The River Taff, chosen due to the activities that occur at or near each site. We pinned the locations to a map of Cardiff, and noted the activities that occurred in each area, in case these activities could influence the sample and give them new leads to investigate. The PDF can be seen below or can be downloaded here. Initially, Warwick attempted to test the oestrogen concentration of the water, but found it was too low to detect. They also tested the water samples and attempted to isolate bacteria that may be able to break down oestrogen. No water samples from any UK teams had such genes. These water samples have enabled Warwick to conclude that catabolic pathways are rare in bacteria, even for a molecule as common as oestrogen.

One of the values we can learn from iGEM is the ability to collaborate with many enthusiastic students from all over the world. This year we made cooperation with students from three different continents; Peru, the United Kingdom, and Taiwan.
1. ColegioFDR_Peru
This year, team KUAS_Korea has been collaborating with ColegioFDR_Peru high school iGEM team. We were delighted to have this chance, thanks to the iGEM since this collaboration was accomplished based on connections we have made through the Giant Jamboree last year. We shared our trials and errors KUAS_Korea have made in iGEM for past few years as well as general understandings in synthetic biology which could help them starting things up.
ColegioFDR_Peru is a high school team, and this is their second year in iGEM. This time they are aiming for synthesizing keratinase-containing E.coli, which degrades the feather waste that can cause the avian flu at chicken farms. It is such a brilliant project reflecting their country’s socio-contextual issues, so feel free to find more of them at their wiki.
Since two countries, Korea and Peru is far apart to have an actual meet-up, we have consistently communicated through e-mail, Facebook, and online Skype. The first online meet-up was held on August 14th, and at the moment both teams were still at the stage of setting basic concepts and principals of the project. We discussed each team’s projects and gave comments regarding the direction of the project and further points to elaborate. Listening from the outer perspective, especially from young active students from the other side of the world was a truly helpful and intriguing experience.
Besides contents of the project itself, collaboration with ColegioFDR_Peru was meaningful enough in the means of giving a real help to difficulties most of the iGEMers are facing. We went through some basic requirements for iGEM together such as project scheduling, wiki management, part submission and some other fulfilments for medal criteria, which can be often too overwhelming to manage all by themselves. This also actually helped us to look"

This year, we also provided some experiment materials to TUST_China, and built good relationship with them. Here's the link to their wiki ."
