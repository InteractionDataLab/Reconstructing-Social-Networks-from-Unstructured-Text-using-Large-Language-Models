Collaborations
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. ""Two heads are better than one"" is a saying that can even apply to a new, advancing science like synthetic biology. Team NAIT is proud to say that we have collaborated with multiple teams both locally and around the world.
Are peptide aptamers the new black? An alternative to antibodies. Our team completed SDU's survey on a new possibility and option to replace animal research.
Our team did a survey on BioBrick parts and integration into our project.
This summer, we collaborated with Amoy University in China by providing an article on Synthetic Biology in Canada. The newsletter in which our article was published was distributed around the world via social media. Many different teams read and contributed to this newsletter and as a whole, the science of synthetic biology gained exposure to the general public.
Additionally, our team helped Team Amoy China with editing and proof-reading some of their presentation and poster scripts as well as some of the content on their Wiki.
Over the summer, iGEM Stockholm invited our team to take a survey about Wiki results and transparency in the iGEM competition. This survey aims to investigate the experience teams in 2015 have had with reading older wikis.
Our team completed Tianjin University's survey on our institutions participation in the iGEM competition.
Our team completed a brief Survey on bacterial transformations for Team Stanford-Brown.
Through Paris_Bettencourt's iGEM Rhizi website, Team NAIT connected to teams around the globe who had similar keywords in their projects. Interestingly enough, not many people are working on a project like ours! Paris_Bettencourt also wrote to us on how they designed the iGEM Rhizi interface for collaborations.
In July, Team Aix-Marseille sent out a survey for iGEM teams to distribute locally on the streets. We are happy to have helped Team Aix-Maseille Université by collecting information on chewing gum, GMOs and patents on life in North America. We interviewed and surveyed over 30 people in our area thus earning ourselves a gold medal for contribution from our fellow iGEM team.

Collaborations
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.
Which other teams can we work with?
You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration gold medal criterion .
In order to meet the gold medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.
Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:
Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device
Characterize another team's part
Debug a construct
Model or simulating another team's system
Test another team's software
Help build and test another team's hardware project
Mentor a high-school team"
Mingdao,2016," we witnessed the whole process of developing a brand new product. The valuable collaboration not only gave us directions to improve our product, but also let us believe our design may become reality."
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018," agreed to help the JS_S team with protein extraction using SDS-PAGE. To spare our workload, the JS_S team had also agreed to help us with Gibson Assembly. The result of SDS-PAGE done by our team for collaboration had shown to be successful. Reference can be found from the HKJS_S team’s wiki here
The collaborations mentioned above will contribute to a more detailed characterisation and better product development of both teams.

Copper is an essential element to be added to the laccase module to enhance the efficiency of the laccase enzyme. However, copper ions might be added in excess if our MFC are supposed to be maintained by the potential users. This might be toxic to our Shewanella or might even pose hazards to the environment if any accidental release occurs. We therefore aimed to find any collaboration on potential safeguard mechanism to be implemented to our laccase module as a solution to this concern.
Team Hong Kong JSS project focuses on engineering bacteria to absorb accumulated copper in aquaponics and we therefore arranged for a meetup in their school to learn more about each other’s project and discuss the possibilities to integrate their design to help absorb our excess copper. In exchange, we will provide them with modelling guidance.
However, the collaboration is unsuccessful in the end due to our obstacles in cloning for the laccase protein and therefore could not achieve any characterization data to support the needs of absorbing excess copper.
Team SCUT_ChinaA and SCUT_ChinaB
Date: 27 July 2018
Upon discovering that the SCUT China team B was working on PET plastic degradation, a small meetup was organised by the HKUST team during summer for exchange of ideas in project and experimental design with the 2 teams of SCUT China. Issues such as the ratio of enzyme subunits, surfactant to enhance the attachment of enzymes to the plastic surface for better degradation reaction were discussed. However, we could not identify any possible collaboration on system design and therefore this meetup was just used as a share of experimental insights.
Throughout the summer, we have also attended the following meetups organised by our fellow iGEM teams in attempts for project sharing and discussions :

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015,"atinase properly. This type of an approach where you lyse then refold is well-documented with something long-known like insulin (I think this is actually how it's industrially produced), but refolding would probably be pretty tedious to work out for something like Keratinase where it hasn't been done before. Possibly doable though, just might take a while to figure out. 4. Express in other organisms: there's expression in a yeast that's been reported (we didn't look very much into it- I forget which one off the top of my head), but I think it might have a similar problem as B. subtilis in terms of growth rate. 5. Other approaches we haven't thought of. That's a possibility too. It's probably important to understand mechanistically how the enzyme works. Not much is known (after much searching by us), but we found that most Keratinases are simply just serine proteases. They can't actually cleave the disulfide bonds of feathers which make feathers so mechanically strong- it requires the presence of a strongly reducing environment or (speculated) reductases to get the job done. There's also an incredible number of Keratinases that have been identified that differ in mechanism (while most are serine proteases, some are metalloproteases I think), and optimal functional environment- pH, temperature, etc. For us, if we were to do the project, we would have chosen a Keratinase that functions at a high temperature due to the high temperatures at which industrial processes like these usually function at and possibly at a lower pH (instead of KerA). I probably have a reference paper somewhere with a big list of known Keratinases. It might be that it doesn't matter which one you choose and you might just choose a well known one like KerA or KerBL, but this is something that should definitely be considered. The main reasons we didn't pursue this project is because it didn't seem like there was anything novel we could do with it when looking at the literature/what had been done with the past, as well as the fact we got discouraged by the various disadvantages we'd listed above and didn't think it was possible to accomplish the goal we'd want to aim for of production at industrially relevant levels. In terms of other novel things we considered, we thought of potentially using directed evolution to make it work better, but we couldn't find any specific characteristic that we could do directed evolution on- finding a high temperature functioning mutant is a possibility, but many Keratinases have already been identified from"
HBUT-China,2018," influenced by the expression of NcrB gene or its degradation process, because the speed of these two processes is relatively low compared with the competitively binding process. More importantly, based on this hypothesis, we can further assume that the concentration of free state NcrB remains constant during the process of competitive binding. This is because the kinetics feature of the process is similar to enzymatic reactions.
Notations
Ki: the reaction rate constant of each reaction
Ni: the concentration of Ni2+ inside the cell
Ne: the concentration of Ni2+ outside the cell
E: the concentration of the Ni2+ transporter protein NikABCDE
P: the promoter pncrA which binds with NcrB
B: the copy number of the recombinant plasmid in a single cell
LI: luminescence intensity
The construction and the solution of the math model
According to the hypotheses proposed above, the following dynamic
process exists inside the engineering bacteria:
1. The diffusion of Ni2+
We described this process through the differential equations below:
This system of equations is a set of first-order linear constant coefficient differential equations, and this system of equations has analytical solutions.
2. The transcription of LuxCDABE conducted by NcrB
Since the concentration of the free state NcrB remains constant, and the concentration of total NcrB is a function of the copy number of the plasmid, we can present the following equations:
Furthermore, we know that there is an equilibrium in the process of NcrB binding with Ni, which can be stated as follows:
As is proposed above, LI is linearly dependent on the number of free state promoter. That is to say,
Substitute 2.4 into 2.5, we can get the following equation:
Further substitute 2.6 into 1.4, now we have obtained the final expression of LI, in which time and the concentration of Ni2+ are the variables.
Discussion:
1. Luminescence intensity versus time curve with a constant concentration of Ni2+ ions
According to the relevant data in the literature and obtained by experimental measurements, we roughly made a function image of the brightness signal as a function of time, and the image is as follows.
2. Relationship between final luminescence intensity and Ni2+ ion

Aix Marseille
     “No more gun on our streets” is the motto of Aix Marseille team. Acknowledging the problem of accumulation of chewing gum as the second urban pollutant on the streets of Europe. Beyond economical aspects and a rather negative visual impact, the accumulation of gum represents a real danger to the wildlife (such as birds), often choking to death. This issue motivated their team to create a synthetic-biology based solution that can degrade rubber polymers. No need to say this project is very similar to our own, and we were very happy to know that the idea of degrading rubber was driving another team! The basic mechanism behind their solution is indeed very similar to ours: in special, they also wanted to use Lcp enzyme to degrade rubber polymers. For this reason, we have been in contact with Aix Marseille team to share experiences and technical information.
Freiburg
     The Freiburg team proposed an exciting project to scan for various diseases only using few drops of blood. In the beginning of the year we have met via Skype to exchange experiences, especially regarding funding, how to manage tasks in order to organize the team and our modeling approaches. We also discuss about team management and how to get the best of each member.

BIT-China,2015,".  From this result BNU-China concluded that the differences exist between the bands of controlled plasmid and the experimental ones, whereas it seemed that these differences had nothing to do with the objective product. Hence, it came out as another failure.
Relevant agent formula:
protein lysis buffer
Tris-HCl (pH=8.0)      85 mL
Sucrose             25.67 g
β-mercaptoethanol   15 mL
membrane solution buffer
protein lysis buffer : urea solution (8M) = 4 : 1 (volume ratio ))
Therefore, it was a pity that BNU_China failed to detect those two proteins, but they were able to give some opinions to us about protein detection through their experience: 1. Changing the expression strain for overexpressing of NhaA and NhaB according to the citation [1], the details are in Table. 2.
2. Make western blots if possible.
The experiments gave us lots of information about membrane proteins. What’s more, the experience helps us two teams communicate frequently and therefore develop a tight relationship eventually.

TJU is our old friend in the iGEM stage; we had collaborated with them in experiment, modeling in past two years.
P170 is a kind of acid-induced promoter, and can be bound by rcfB protein activated by lactic acid. To verify the relationship between concentration of lactic acid and promoter, P170 was linked with RFP gene, and strength of fluorescence was measured. Fig.8 shows the circuit with promoter P170.
Fig.8 Genetic regulation circuit of promoter P170
We firstly made assumption of the circuit:
(1) mRNA and combination of mRNA-rib had reached steady state
(2) all enzymes activities were not affected by acid concentration and could be regarded as constant
(3) concentration of rcfB protein was assumed unchanged.
The reaction processes are described as:
Here we list the parameter names and descriptions:
Basing on reaction processes above, equations are constructed as followed: Concentration of induced RcfB and combination of RcfB and lactic acid are written as:
Where KLa and K are constants and n is hill coefficient.
Promoter P170 can be activated in two ways. The first pathway is to bind to the dimerization of lactic acid and RcfB. The other pathway basing on our assumption is that a proportion  of P170 can be activated"

Both of our projects deal with the detection of  a microorganism in a food product. They aim to detect bacteriophages in milk while our goal is to detect V. cholerae in water. We had a talk about GMOs legislation in food product and exchanged our ideas about the way we would keep our engineered microorganisms away from human consumption (filter membrane for instance).
Surveys
During this year, our team created a survey in order to better know how far is the knowledge of common people about cholera and to start doing a market research/study. Beside that we filled surveys for other teams:

Collaborations
The Tokyo Tech team and our team.
Our team received mentoring from team TokyoTech when we met up on September 23rd. We received feedback and advice about the modeling of our data, as well as helpful guidance for how to best represent our project motivations and research.
Outside of other iGEM teams, we also heavily collaborated with other schools across the world through a virtual pre-medical club. Conducted through Global Online Academy, we shared our research and knowledge of colorectal cancer with other students, facilitating discussion about this cancer and inspiring other outreach programs among their respective communities."

We exchanged suggestions to each other on problems encountered in experiments, modeling, human practice framework, etc. In addition, they also led us to visit their laboratory, as well as SynCTI, Asia's largest synthetic biology center. Through this meet-up, we have a better understanding of synthetic biology and our project, which will make our goal much more clear.
Collaboration with XMU-China
We offered XMU-China the information of our team, including team introduction, project description, etc, which will be used to record on the Newsletter edited by XMU-China. Through this platform, more people could learn about our projects and we have more opportunities to exchange and cooperate with the external world.
Biosafety Collaboration
Since we are conducting the experiments associated with “High Titer” and “Broad Spectrum” of viruses, which is identified to have some potential dual-use biosecurity considerations, we deeply understand that we need to be more sensitive to these concerns. Following the advice from The Safety and Security Committee of iGEM, we have contacted with Fangzhong Wang, who is at the Center for Biosafety Research and Strategy at Tianjin University. Through the exchange and discussion, Prof. Wang kindly offered us lots of quite pertinent suggestions and we recognized that we need to take more safety issues into consideration. Therefore, we followed his advice, increased management training in experimental safety, and implemented many safety measures, which would all ensure the safety and the security of our project.
Industry
Collaboration
This year, our project is dedicated to reduce the excessive cost of producing cell-based animal vaccines. This problem was identified by our strategic collaborator, Beijing DaBeiNong Company. Thus, we are financed by them to carry out virus related experiments in this project. The outcome of our project can greatly help the factory to reduce the cost of producing a series of vaccines by using MDBK cell line.

During the project, of course, it is indispensable to communicate with other iGEM teams. Therefore, we exchanged opinions with many other iGEM teams to solve the problems we encountered together. Among them, we have carried out further cooperation and communication with the two iGEM teams: Sun Yat-sen University and South China Agricultural University. We finished an indispensable part of each other’s projects and made critical work.
SYSU-software
SYSU-software is a friendly and open team. We had a meetup and exchange our project. With a presentation, they introduced their software to us, a multi-functional collaboration platform. Their software amazed us and we thought it can be useful in genetic circuit collaboration design. However, they ignored a fact that experimental protocol was also an important element in collaboration. So, in the meetup, we came up with this idea. They took much amount of it and verified their software based on our suggestion, adding a new function of editing protocol. Also, SYSU-software took a lot of time help us make the navigation bar of our wiki.
South China Agricultural University
The team from South China Agricultural University is also friendly and accommodating. In our project, they helped us determine differences in yeast growth and tested for its activity. At the same time, we helped them extract the Acetobacter xylinum genome. Both of us have made a contribution that cannot be ignored to each other."

Original Text: To make the process more time efficient, it would be useful to improve the layout of the office spaces. The same principle can also be implemented in enzymatic cascades by bringing the enzymes into closer proximity using so-called surface layer proteins. [Efficiency!!!] Surface layers, or in short S-layer, are prokaryotic protein membranes, which assemble into two-dimensional lattices. Depending on the organism, the S-Layer proteins have different symmetries, like oblique, squared or hexagonal, resulting in specific structural patterns of the assembled lattices. These characteristic properties allow the fixation of enzymes to the surface in a regular fashion. Regarding the office space metaphor, the S-Layer proteins determine the most efficient layout of the office spaces, that allow the employees — the bound enzymes — to work more efficiently.

While exchanging knowledge with Saint Joseph Istanbul iGEM Team from Turkey,  we talked about our projects and since it’s their first                  year experiencing iGEM, we gave them advice mostly on how to characterize a part. We also helped them in the means of medal criteria and                  how to finish their work on time; we suggested them to start filling both their wiki page and pages in the registry. In order for them                  to interact with us any time they are in need, we exchanged our phone numbers and kept in contact at all times.

With the attendance of all iGEM 2018 Teams from Turkey, we held a meet-up in our school's conference center on the 8th of September, 2018.
Our goal in this meet-up was to get to know iGEM teams from Turkey, to gain helpful new insights, polish everyone's presentation skills,                  and to exchange advice, tips and thoughts.
Since it's the first time that another high school iGEM Team from Turkey  will be participating iGEM this year, we were especially enthusiastic                  to have Saint Joseph HS iGEM Team as a guest, and share our experiences with them.

Concordia,2016," in vivo).
We were informed that UofT had performed an analysis of the ability for GolS and GolS_P118A to react to copper ions in solution, using a CPRG assay, which yielded strange results. We thought we would test their constructs for copper and gold binding, as well as silver and aluminum, in order to offer more data to them for better characterization of GolS and GolSP118A.
We initially wanted to determine if our DH5ɑ E.coli would express GolS constitutively, so we set up an preliminary reaction of untransformed cells, cells transformed with GolS, and cells transformed with GolS_P118A, in liquid media with X-gal and different concentrations of gold. We were excited to see that, following day, the cells containing gold and X-gal had blue precipitate, while untransformed cells had no blue product. Due to time constraints and lack of material, we were unable to perform a CPRG or ONPG assay with our liquid cultures. However, iGEM UofT informed us that we could send them pictures of our liquid cultures since they were developing a mobile app that could relate color development to GolS activity. We decided then that our liquid X-gal assay would be acceptable.
We grew untransformed E. coli cells with no antibiotic, E. coli cells transformed with GolS grown in chloramphenicol, and E. coli cells transformed with GolS_P118A grown with chloramphenicol to an OD of 3. We diluted our cells into a final volume of 600 µL of M9 media, having an OD of 1.5. We used Au (III) ions at 1 µM and 5 µM, Cu(II) at 1 µM and 10 µM, Ag (I) ions at 1 µM and 5 µM, and Al (III) ions at 1 µM and 5 µM. Pictures were taken at different time points after the addition of ions, shown in the pictures below. Reactions were incubated at 37℃, 300 RPM. M9 indicates just M9 buffer, M9X indicates M9 buffer with 4.8 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal. All wells with indicated ions contained M9X.
Throughout the entire process, none of the DH5ɑ cells constructs expressed any blue color, indicating that blue color formation was due to the presence of GolS and P118A. Blue color seems to have appeared in the GolS M9X"

We’ve worked in generating a document that contains the most relevant information of our projects, along with a section in which that reports the main problems we have had to get to iGEM. The idea is to disseminate this document widely through our networks in order to let know other countries not only how Synthetic Biology can bring great benefits to society, but also the great complications that we must go through to reach the Giant Jamboree to present our ideas and projects.
4.- Collaboration with iGEM Chihuahua
Unfortunately, we didn’t get our kit on time because of border control issues, and even worse, it seems to be damaged. Therefore, we weren’t able to carry out the InterLab and do the necessary transformations to meet the bronze criteria. However, the iGEM Tec-Chihuahua team collaborated with us by helping us with the transformations we needed: BBa_I744204 -plate 3, well 20F-, in E. Coli BL21B3, BBa_K137055 -plate 4 and also well 13I- was transformed in E. Coli BL21B3. The transformations were successful and they were shipped to Guadalajara so we could continue with our work.
Collaboration with Tec-Chihuahua
5.- Collaboration with iGEM CEM
CDMX team designed and developed a new method for siRNA production in BioBrick BSLA, which encodes for the reporter gene of the Blue Chromoprotein, the sense strand of the siRNA, a loop, and the antisense strand of the siRNA.
As the protocol stayed E. coli HT115 was used in the presence of plasmid L440, which confers resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline. When transforming this BioBrick in pSB1C3, the bacteria is resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Due to the risk of using multiresistant bacteria in research and to optimize BSLA expression, they asked us to determine the influence of multiple antibiotic resistance in the expression of BSLA.
In order to achieve this, the received strain was cultivated in luria broth with 1) chloramphenicol, 2) chloramphenicol and ampicillin, 3"
NCTU_Formosa,2017,"iang Chen invited the gifted students from TCFSH who decided to learn about biology to our lab. NCTU_Formosa then gave them a series of training, the SOP of                 our wet lab protocol, which includes:
- Cultivation of E. Coli
- Miniprep
- Digestion
- Ligation
- Transformation
- PCR
- Gel Electrophoresis
Figure 1: The photo of the students from TCFSH taking a course
     These are basic experimental skills for people who study biology and so as every iGEMers. Especially for the digestion part, while it is one of the most important parts for iGEMers, we also taught them about the concept of biobrick assembly, the design of EXSP, different kinds of parts of biobrick… and so on.
     And in this summer, we were glad to know that some TCFSH students decided to participate iGEM, new iGEMers were born. There are more things that a new team need to know, more knowledge to learn. NCTU_Formosa members taught                 them more about :
- Useful databases, such as NCBI, Uniport
- Useful tools for protein, such as BLAST, COBALT, CD search
- Biology experiment design and debug
- Writing Biobricks for synthesis (in sequences)
Figure 2: The photo of  the students discussing about tools for protein
     We hope they could get more information in a short time and see the power of bioinformatics, it’s also a concept of our project. Some of our members spent days with these high school students discussing their ideas and helped them to design experiments to realize their ideas. Later, they finally came out with their own biobrick sequences.
     Through practicing and discussion, they completed many experiments on their own, including purification of plasmids, digestion with restriction enzyme, and conducting gel electrophoresis. They even came up with more outstanding thoughts about the project they’ve schematized this year. We are looking forward to the great shine of the team in Boston this year and get valuable experiences

1. USTC
USTC and BIT focus on measurement this year and we face the same difficulty so that we set up the collaboration for dealing with the problem. We are really glad that we can have collaborations in the aspect of experiment, hardware and modeling.
Process
Both of teams took part in 2015 iGEM Asian Conference in NCTU (Hsinchu, Taiwan) at the end of July and both of us are interested in each other’s projects. In the middle of August, USTC attended the Conference of China iGEMer Committee in PKU (Beijing, China) and we had a chance to communicate the details of our collaborations face to face. In this meeting, we determine that we can cooperate in the aspect of experiment, hardware and modeling. After that, we assist each other by internet and make some progresses. Ultimately, USTC help BIT to build a more perfect modeling and BIT assist USTC accomplish the experiment of bacteria freeze-drying. Because both of us had demand for hardware, we all put forward some comments and advice for each other to make a better hardware.
Details
The Experiment of Bacteria Freeze-drying
Purpose
We all hope the ideal product could apply to reality. The method of bacterial powder help the idea come true result from following features:
1) Portative: it will be easier for hardware, like detecting device which is made by BIT or CACCI which is made by USTC, to carry bacteria.
2) Easy-to-store: the condition for storing bacterial powder is simple to achieve, that makes it convenient for users to use the product.
3) Recoverable: the bacteria will recover within normal water solution so that it will not bring extra burden to the users.
Protocol
1) Strain
Reserve it at -20℃.
2) Preparation of culture medium
Prepare: tryptone 5g, yeast extract 5g, NaCl 30g, glycerol 3g, Na2HPO4·12H2O 12.5g, KH2PO4 1g, and add distilled water 1L ;then split the liquid in different test tubes,"
Toronto,2016,", we will continue to improve these tools so that they are easier to use and more teams can benefit.

We want to thank all our collaborators for sharing their iGEM experience with us and trusting us for this year's competition. We had an amazing time discussing, working and collaborating with all of you.
Collaborations with other iGEM Teams
iGEM WPI Worcester – Biofilm assay protocol
Because we both worked on biofilms disruption, we exchanged with iGEM WPI Worcester on our methods. They develop antifreeze proteins that have anti-biofilm properties. On our side, we also integrated into our interface a strategy to disrupt biofilm formation. To test the effect of our proteins on biofilms, we both performed biofilm assay on microtiter plates and decided to exchange our protocols of biofilm culture and quantification in order to compare them.
iGEM Sorbonne U Paris – Interlab
We also collaborated with the french IGEM team Sorbonne U Paris. They graciously offered us some E. coli DH5-α for the Interlab study. We also helped them when they started their experiments for the Interlab by responding to some of their interrogations.
iGEM UNSW Australia – Law
We collaborated with iGEM UNSW Australia who was looking to produce a discussion about patenting for science at a global scale.  They contacted us to see our interpretation of EU law since they have a training in Australian law. Our legal team, composed of 2 Master students in Intellectual Property law skyped with their team to share on problematics surrounding patent law, such as reconciling new biological inventions with the law, the issues with diagnostic technology, the European legal system concerning patent law, the organization of courts in France, etc.

Validating stress in mammalian and bacterial cells with iGEM UC Davis
We contacted iGEM team UC Davis via twitter after we found out that our projects were both involving similar ideas. While our project focuses on finding           bacterial cell           stress, iGEM UC Davis is focusing on detecting mammalian cell stress.           To discuss our approaches, problems within the lab, human practices and other aspects of our projects we set up several skype meetings and maintained extensive email contact. While keeping in touch during the summer, we eventually agreed           on a collaboration:           Leiden would test the toxicity of H2O2 on bacterial cells and UC Davis would test the toxicity of nalidixic acid on mammalian cells. To ensure our exchanged results would be beneficial for each other, we discussed the           exact protocols           beforehand and fine tuned them to each others wishes.
We first proved the potential of our system using a pSoxS-GFP construct, containing a promoter of the E. coli DNA-damage pathway, and nalidixic acid, a known DNA damaging antibiotic. Therefore, we requested UC Davis to test multiple           concentrations of nalidixic acid on their mammalian cell lines. With these experiments it would be possible to determine whether this antibiotic only stresses the bacterial cells, or also the mammalian cells. In the future this could be a           very important follow up test of the screening method developed by us. This way, potential antibiotic candidates can quickly be tested to ensure they do not stress mammalian cells.
The results of UC Davis’ experiment are shown in figure 2. Unfortunately, no dose-dependency was observed and from this data alone we cannot conclude that nalidixic acid induces a stress response in mammalian cells For more information view UC Davis' wiki under these conditions.
Figure 2. Induction of mammalian stress responses as measured by UC Davis. A slight increase in signal is observed, but the error bars are too high to draw meaningful conclusions from this data. For more information about             the experiment and relevant protocols, visit the wiki of UC Davis.
In return, iGEM UC Davis requested us to test the effects of hydrogen peroxide on bacterial cells to allow iGEM UC Davis"
TU-Eindhoven,2016," asked us about the topic of our project, the worst thing that happened in the lab and what our secret is to get a good team spirit. Curious about the whole interview, you can read it here.
Translation of protocols
iGEM team METU HS Ankara invited us to work with them and other iGEM teams on translating protocols from English into different languages. This way, general protocols like making LB broth, transformation and plasmid isolation will become more easily accessible for people who do not have a great understanding of the English language. These protocols are available at their WIKI .  It was a nice collaboration and we hope we delivered a valuable contribution to their project. Thank you for inviting us for this collaboration!
Collaboration Badges
The iGEM team from Virginia asked us to fill out their survey regarding biocontainment, which we gladly did to help them with their research. For doing this Virginia has send us this collaboration badge as a token of appreciation. Check out the results of the survey on their WIKI . (Try hovering over the badge!)
The iGEM team from Evry made a survey about synthetic biology and asked us to fill this in. Moreover, if we could help them get more people to fill in the survey, we would earn a collaboration badge. And so we did, after asking our friends and families to help them out. Good luck with analysing the survey and we hope to hear the results !

Imperial_College,2018," Thessaloniki aimed to decouple the gene of interest (GOI) transcription rate from the plasmid copy number in cells. Their project was inspired by the results of the 2014 and 2015 iGEM interlab studies that aimed to identify and correct the sources of systemic variability in synthetic biology measurements. As part of the collaboration they sent us four devices that they assembled, which we transformed and characterised in the DH5α strain of Escherichia coli. The results of this collaboration can be found by following this link to the Thessaloniki Team’s wiki . We would like to thank the Thessaloniki Team for involving us in their noble study on trying to improve and standardise the field of synthetic biology.
Characterising Nottingham's promoter library
The Nottingham team is working on tackling the development of antibiotic resistance via phage therapy. As part of their experiments they required characterisation of a library of promoters, which we helped measure using our plate reader, the data for which can be found on their collaborations page . We wish Nottingham all the best and hope that we may have contributed to the success of their project.
Team communication App: Let’s Talk About This
The theme of communication is present all throughout our project and has been something on the forefront of our minds the whole time. We understand that working in a team, especially one that is formed of members who may not know each other, can be quite stressful and awkward at first, especially when it comes to raising issues. For this reason, we took the initiative to develop an app, ""Let’s Talk About This"" , that allows the initiation of difficult conversations in a fair and mature manner. The development of the content for the app couldn’t have been possible without all the help from the iGEM community, who gave us their valuable time and attention by answering some awkward and even difficult questions regarding their own team communication issues. Specifically, we would like to acknowledge UCL, KCL, Oxford, Warwick, Edinburgh, Bielefeld, Valencia, Thessaloniki, METU HS Ankara, HebrewU, UIUC Illinois, NCTU Formosa and KUAS Korea for helping us broaden our perspective on team communication issues and helping us create a tool to take a step towards addressing them.

Science communication collaboration
Communication from scientists to non-scientists can have its challenges.                              Communicating scientific information is one aspect,                              but sometimes words are not enough to help the audience understand our work                              or inspire them to help us in our endeavours as synthetic biologists."

XJTLU-CHINA,2018," this opportunity for iGEM community in China to showcase a variety of synthetic biology projects,                             we found that LZU-CHINA possesses a similar project concept in the sense of exosome.
During that conference, we then had a deep discussion on the mutual projects,                             which later facilitated our collaboration .                             In addition, NJU-CHINA showed great interests in our project for they have worked on exosomes for years.                             After sharing our progress and experimental design, they would like to offer us additional help in refining experiments.
In addition, during the poster session,                             we visited several team booths and provided advice to their project interpretations in casual conversation.
Eurasian Meetup
On July 25, 7 members of our team went to Shenzhen to attend the iGEM2018 Asia-Europe Meeting held by BGI-CHINA and TU Delft.                             After three days, we are gratified that our design ideas have been recognized by friends from all over the world.                             During the presentation and poster session, we received a lot of support from other university’s iGEM teams.                             There were professors from TU Deft, one of the organizers,                             who provided valuable experience and ideas for teams participating iGEM. At the same time, we, fortunately,                             had personal guidance from one of the professors during the break,                             which benefits to made adjustments to the integrity of the experiment.                             It is worth mentioning that this participation laid the foundation for our cooperation with the University of Hong Kong.                             They are also committed to the design of the carrier and we are paying attention to each other. After the meeting,                             we will continue to discuss technical questions about the experiment and explore the common development of our two projects.

We carried out an extended, 18-hour experiment , monitoring cell density through absorbance measurement and promoter strength by fluorescence emission. The results are shown subsequently.
Figure 5: Absorbance at 700 nm of E. coli DH5α-strains with transformed Anderson promoter familiy members
Please note that we monitored the optical density at 700 nm wavelength, because the UC-Davis team was concerned about interferences of OD600 measurements with the fluorescence measurements.
To determine the relative strength of the used promoters we looked at the fluorescence signal of RFP. With increasing promoter strength, transcription should be enhanced and more RFP will be expressed. This results in a higher fluorescence signal.
Figure 6: Fluorescence emission at 615 nm of the stronger Anderson promoter family members (excitation at 588 nm). The values in brackets indicate the relative promoter strength compared to J61100, which was given the value 1.
Figure 7: Fluorescence emission at 615 nm of the medium Anderson promoter family members (excitation at 588 nm). The values in brackets indicate the relative promoter strength compared to J61100, which was given the value 1.
Figure 8: Fluorescence emission at 615 nm of the weaker Anderson promoter family members (excitation at 588 nm). The values in brackets indicate the relative promoter strength compared to J61100, which was given the value 1.
The results show very clearly that strains containing a plasmid with a stronger promoter are fluorescing earlier than those with medium and weak promoters. Also, the fluorescence intensity is significantly lower for weak promoters in comparison to the stronger ones. The DH5α-strain with an inherent J23101 plasmid (relative strength 0.7) did surprisingly not fluoresce the strongest. This might be due to a problem with plasmid stability in this strain. Also, the unmeasured J23119 BioBrick seems to hold a promoter of medium strength.
The widely plausible results show, that the protocols for promoter BioBrick characterization work quite well. Comparisons to experimental results from all over the world can be carried out using this method and promise a well characterized and frequently validated parts registry.
This collaboration was a great chance to communicate and discuss data in an international outreach and taught us a lot about other teams work routines and standards. It was a pleasure to contribute in their project to find a way to effectively share complex experimental data and to work out routines for BioBrick characterization

Collaboration for silver medal
When we met so many difficulties with the site-specific genomic integration via the pOSIP plasmid collection, we looked for a possible collaboration partners among the other iGEM teams. We found the Edinburgh UG iGEM 2017 (SMORE). Our new friends were so kind to help us with sending new constructs for use in our genomic integration efforts. We obtained the Serine Integrase Bxb1 under T7 promoter and the recombineering plasmids pSIM7 and pSIM9, so now we have the so needed alternative methods of chromosomal integration in E. coli. We were able to help the SMORE team back with their human practices. To do so, we found students and engineers to answer their detailed skill-exchange questionnaire, giving a better understanding of communication between biologists and engineers.
You can visit their Wiki by clicking here .
Other collaborations
We participated in number of iGEM surveys in order to exchange both knowledge and experience.
One of the first surveys we took part in was submitted by the Minnesota team. It was a Biological Safety Collaboration Survey. The team was doing a booklet on different safety systems that they used to ensure the safety of the synthetic biology systems they were working on. They provided us with a form which we filled with our answers on topics such as potential hazards of our project and what precautions we are going to be put in place to avoid them. This survey was very useful and could help everyone considering a hypothetical release of GMOs in the future.
The UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team kindly sent us another survey which was also very interesting. It was about reducing methane emissions from cows. They were interested in what degree were we familiar with this problem and what are the ways it could be avoided. We filled the 10 questions hoping we contributed to their cause.
Our next filled survey was about Directed Evolution and Artificial Intelligence by the Heidelberg iGEM team. They wanted our opinion on different questions regarding their project. We found them very interesting and innovative. Our general opinion was in support of"

In July, during the Delft meetup we have had the opportunity to get in touch with many different teams from all cross Europe, especially with the team from Center for BioTechnology ( Bielefeld ). This german team is a veteran of the competition and, since they knew it is the first time for Florence to participate, they kindly offered us a collaboration in the form of a mentorship. They proposed us to Skype once every week to talk about all the aspects of the iGEM, so that we could learn from their expertise, and in fact we can retrospectively say that we knew very little on how to deal with all the tasks before we started the mentorship. We Skyped almost every week from the 17th of July with Christopher, Lennard and Markus and in a few words they opened our minds on how deep and challenging iGEM is, giving us a chance to get fully involved in such challenge. In particular we talked about medal criterias and human practices, two of the hardest tasks, they gave us suggestions on how to organize travel to Boston and, last but not least, they shared with us many useful lab tips, protocols, for example the “magical” Aquacloning, and they helped us solve some of the problems we encountered during our experiments.
Since the beginning we have been very grateful and thankful to the Bielefeld team, and in return for their favour we were able to help them with the characterization of two of their parts. Those two parts consist of two different version of a heterologous transporter (PtNTT2), used by Escherichia coli to take up an unnatural nucleotide, and the N-terminal truncated version without the signal peptide is less toxic for the cell than the complete transporter. Thanks to an automated reader we were able to evaluate the OD600 within a time of 24 hours with measurement every hour, leading to an accurate characterization of those two parts with particular attention to the toxicity of the complete version of PtNTT2. Maximilian has lent us a helping hand to fix some problems we had with the creation of our wiki by giving us many tips in a Skype session and by sending us via wa a very useful guide.

Why do we collaborate
Collaboration is one of the core values in scientific pursuits. Famous Biologist and evolutionist Charles Darwin once said, ""Those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed"". Thus, neither science nor human progress should be constrained as the responsibility of an isolated group of people. As high schoolers, this is our first year to delve deep into synthetic biology and doing iGEM project. We have encountered multiple technical problems. Thanks to two collegiate problems that the problems in the end were resolved with their enthusiastic help
1. team ""ShanghaiTech 2018""
Because our laboratory was super closed to the lab of the team ""ShanghaiTech 2018"", it was very easy for us to ask for help when we realized we happened to lose the PSB1C3 plasmid.  Not only did ""ShanghaiTech 2018"" provide us with PSB1C3 plasmid, but they wholeheartedly provided us assistance in molecular cloning.

Collaborating with these teams allowed us to achieve our goals. It was our pleasure to help them to the best of our ability.

Team Macquarie
How did we help them?
Team Macquarie had constructed a hydrogenase gene capable of converting glucose to hydrogen gas. The plasmid BBa_K2300001 consists of the genes for hydrogenase enzyme (Hyd1), ferredoxin, ferredoxin-NADPH-reductase (FNR) and maturation enzyme (HydEF and HydG). Their expression levels are co-regulated under the pLac promoter.
This year, our team helped Team Macquarie to evaluate each of the gene expression levels using RT-PCR.
The results of RT-PCR are shown below:
Formula: 2^-(ΔΔCt) is used to calculate the fold change of gene expression after induction, in which
ΔCt(control)1= Ct(uninduced operon genes)- Ct(Chloramphenicol gene)
ΔCt(test)2 = Ct(Induced operon genes)-Ct(Induced Chloramphenicol gene)
Finally, use ΔCt(test)2- ΔCt(control)1 to get ΔΔCt.
IPTG and 20mM of glucose were used to induce gene expression. Comparison of 1mM IPTG and 20mM IPTG was made and it was found that 1mM IPTG has a higher gene expression level. It is worth noting that the RT-PCR efficiency might be different for different genes due to varied sizes of PCR products and the formula used above assumes that the PCR efficiency is 100% such that 2 copies of products are eventually obtained.
How did they help us?
In our gene activation experiments, we observed that our truncated dCas9 generally exhibit poorer gene activation compared to full-length wild type. We had hypothesized that this is likely due to poorer target DNA binding, and hence shorter dwell time at the promoter for the VPR transcriptional activator to work effectively. One key weakness with our experiments was that we were unable to"
TUDelft,2017," the simulation results, we deduce that the crRNAs specifically target the different bacterial species.
Figure 4: On and off-target effects of Munich crRNAs on different bacterial targets. On and off-target effects of designed crRNAs on different bacterial targets. A) crRNA 1-3 yield 7 on-target hits (blue) on the E. coli DH5α genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in 10 million per site. B) crRNA 1-3 yield off-target probabilities below 1 in 10 million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome. C) crRNA 2 yields off-target probabilities below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the E. coli DH5α genome. D) crRNA 4 yields 10 on-target hits (blue) on the B. subtilis genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome.
We establish that the two designed crRNA sequences target their designated bacterial species specifically. crRNA 1-3 contains 7 on-target hits on the E. coli DH5α genome, while crRNA 4 contains 10 on-target hits on the B. subtilis genome. From this it can be concluded conclude that the designed crRNA sequences allow differentiation between the (Gram-negative) E. Coli and (Gram-positive) B. subtilis species. Arguably, designing one crRNA that targets both strains could be beneficial in distinguishing between for example a viral and bacterial infection by requiring less experiments, however a Gram-positive or negative distinction could is already very helpful.
We also compute $P_{FP}$ (the probability of a false positive output, provided that there is a positive output, for the four simulations (Figure 5). For all simulations, the probability of acquiring a false-positive result was found to be low: in the order of one in a million times. Moreover, having multiple on-target sites on the genome of the bacterial species to be detected decreases $P_{FP}$ on the targeted genome. The $P_{FP}$ on the non-targeted genome, however, is unaffected. This implies that having more on-target sites intuitively also increases the sensitivity of the assay. However, the off-target probability on non-target species remains unaffected by this.

During the time we designed a flow chart for our CO2 utilization system for                                     application. We were lucky to find our friend, UESTC-China , to work together and                                     end up building a completely eco-friendly system with negative carbon footprint.
We tried to figure out another way in carbon utilization as an                                         contribution of carbon reduction and save energy. However, we face some problem                                         when we tried to apply our Engineering E. coli into industrial scale. Cost                                         evaluation and carbon footprint are big challenges                                         When we were designing the whole CO2 utilization system. We were delighted when                                         we found out someone who will be able to resolve our problems. UESTC-China mainly                                          focused on degrading straw into useful raw materials, including glucose, xylose,                                          ferule acid, and lignin. In addition, they aimed to convert glucose into butanol                                          and hydrogen. As xylose is the main carbon source for our                                         engineered E. coli, we came up with a collaboration idea by integrating our                                         system at the downstream of their system. Xylose is one of the side product                                         produced during straw degradation, it can be extracted and utilized in our                                         system. Concerning the synthesis of xylose may produce greenhouse gas and                                         chemicals, we would like to obtain xylose produced via biological method.
Through UESTC system, xylose will be produced in their fermentation broth as well as                                          other three raw material. In order to calculate the amount of xylose production,                                          they tested the ferulic acid which yield by gas chromatography (GC) after 12 hours.                                          Basically, ferulic acid cover for 1.15% of straw.                                          Then, the enzyme activity of ferulic acid degradation can be calculated.                                          Next, we assume that the rate of xylan decomposition is the same                                          as that of ferulic acid while 30% of xlyan composed of straw.                                          Finally, through derivation, we can get 0.0348 kg xylose from 1 kg straw.                                         "

TU Delft iGEM
Partnership Program
We did not only organize the Eurasian Meetup with TU Delft iGEM team, but also we collaborated with them through the Partnership Program. As we are participating in iGEM for the first time, we went over their bios and chose our favorite partners. For example, one of the Human Practice captains in our team chose the Human Practice manager in TU Delft team. During the program, the Human Practice manager in TU Delft gave us some advice on how to extend and advertise our product by sending out posters or messages on social media. We also helped them by translating their gene-doping surveys in Chinese so that they could gain more responses. Overall, they gained 130 responses in China.
Bio-Safety Video
Two members--Alexander Armstrong (TU Delft) and Jerry Cheng (BGIC-GLOBAL) worked together and created a biosafety video, which incorporated interviews of participants at the meetup, as well as expert's opinions/attitudes on biosafety and bioethics.
Fujian Normal University (FJNU-China)
After our project presentation during the Eurasian Meetup, we received some advice about the design of our final product. Due to our goal of family-used terminal product, smelling of E.coli should considered as a problem need to be eliminated. Luckily, we found FJNU-China, whose project is aiming to produce a kind of E.coli that emits rose smelling and who have tasteless tnaa E.coli that is knocked out its smelly gene. Meanwhile, FJNU-China expressed their needs for sequence analysis from GBI. As a result, we build up a collaboration with each other. FJNU-China will send us the tasteless E.coli, and we will help them analyze sequence provided by them.

    This is the first time for us to participate in iGEM. As a young team, although our current ability is limited, we still positively try to              cooperate with other teams and carry out various exchanges and activities              to propel both side of the teams better. As a new member of the iGEM family,              we are committed to the spirit of collaboration advocated by iGEM. We              cooperate with other teams in the following areas:
As a Beginner, Be a Learner.
    As the first time to participate in iGEM, we lack experience.             In order to be more effective in preparing for the competition,             we actively contacted with other excellent team, visited their             school to ask how to prepare for iGEM. These teams include: Peking, HZAU-China, HUST-China, FAFU-CHINA, WHU-China (2015).
We took photos with Peking team for memorial after the visit.
     In addition, we also participated in the 2016CCiC (Central China             iGEM Consortium), and exchanged ideas with the participants of             the 30 other teams, receiving a lot of valuable experience and advice.
All the participants took a group photo after the closing ceremony
     In view of the overall design and experimental design of the project,             we contacted with Jiang Huifeng, a researcher of Tianjin Institute             of Industrial Biotechnology of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Kang             Peng, a Proffessor of Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry CAS.             And we went to the laboratory to study the related mature theories and             experimental techniques of Blue Leaf.
As a Beginner, Be a Communicator.
  As a sponsor and the main planner, we held an innovative activity,              named ""Talk with LanZhou, Talk about iGEM"" to live online communication              with Lanzhou team. Through the web platform, our team and our audiences              whether on the spot or in front of a phone’s screen all could take part              in the exchanges with LanZhou team and their audiences. Less an hour,              our live video had already obtained more than 1,100 clicks.              For details, please click: https://"

Canadian iGEM Newsletter
This year, the iGEM Calgary 2017 Team set a goal to increase collaborations amongst teams across our country and did not limit ourselves to teams from iGEM. During our journey, we reached out to many organizations as a part of our public outreach. For more details, please visit our Engagement page. To help promote communication between teams, we pioneered the first Canadian iGEM Newsletter. The purpose of this initiative was to foster an avenue through which teams can share their project updates and seek collaborative assistance. Because this newsletter was distributed by all participating teams, universities and public communities across Canada can be engaged. Additionally, we increased public awareness of iGEM and synthetic biology.
Canadian iGEM Newsletter Volume 1 Issue 1
Wet Lab Collaboration
Through the connections we made in the process of publishing the Canadian iGEM Newsletter, we were able to connect with the iGEM McMasterU team. One of their team members, Dhanyasri Maddiboina, had an internship in Calgary this summer. Our team was able to meet with her, and together we brought a between these two collegiate teams to fruition. This year, the iGEM McMasterU team is working on a project called Glowzyme, a fluorogenic DNAzyme that cleaves RNA and detects pathogens. As a proof of concept, they synthesized a DNAzyme that fluoresces when E. coli is present. Because our bioplastic synthesis system utilizes E. coli on Mars, the DNAzyme may be integrated into our containment system as a method for containment. By assessing the possibility of incorporating the DNAzyme into our system, we can evaluate the properties of the DNAzyme and provide possible areas of improvement to iGEM McMasterU . Check out their Collaboration page here .

Besides organizing our own meetup at the embassy in Boston , we attended several other meetups!
European Meetup
The iGEM teams of Munich (LMU & TU Munich) took the initiative to organize the European meetup of 2018. The meet-up was held from the 20th – 22nd of July at LMU Biozentrum, located on the edge of Munich. The event was split in four parts; the symposium, poster presentations, workshops and night events. With around  200 participants, a lot of posters and various lectures with different topics there was put a lot of effort in to running the congress so smoothly. The congress was an excellent opportunity to get a feeling about the different projects of the teams, the state the projects were in and to build bridges with teams for potential collaborations.

Austin_UTexas,2016,"ingomonas paucimobilis bacteria required to make gellan gum plates and answered additional questions about the competition, deadlines, trip details, and medal and wiki requirements. We believe we have provided the Texas Tech team with mentorship throughout the course of the summer and fall that should help them be competitive in their first iGEM jamboree. Texas Tech in turn helped our team by testing our team's protocol for creating gellan gum plates with S. paucimobilis.
Texas iGEM Meet Up
Texas Tech, Rice, and UT Austin iGEM team members at the Texas iGEM Meetup.
As scientists, synthetic biologists rely on collaboration to develop their ideas. Recognizing the value of feedback from our peer iGEM teams, we reached out to teams from Texas Tech Lubbock, Rice, and Monterrey to see whether they would be interested in organizing a meeting before the jamboree. On Saturday, September 24th, 2016, at the University of Texas Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium, iGEM teams from Rice University, Texas Tech University, and the University of Texas met to discuss their projects and exchange feedback and advice for the competition. As a part of the Natural Science Undergraduate Research Symposium, each team first formally presented a part of their project to an audience of professors, graduate students, as well as undergraduate students. Following this formal presentation was an informal meeting of the teams to strictly focus on each of our iGEM projects. During this collaborative discussion, the teams critiqued each other’s projects. Multiple members of each team organized the meetup via email, phone, and Facebook. Teams enjoyed an early opportunity to discuss their projects with other students enthusiastic about synthetic biology.
Monterrey Collaboration
A skype call between UT Austin and Monterrey in which UT Austin helped the Monterrey team with their conjugation protocol.
The iGEM team from Monterrey, Mexico also reached out to our team as we are their closest iGEM neighbor. UT Austin helped the Monterrey team troubleshoot their conjugation protocol.  The Monterrey team also discussed trying to attend the Texas iGEM meetup, but were unable to make the September meetup.  The teams also discussed helping each other out experimentally, but given the international border, there were some uncertainties on how best to send biological organisms and other materials.  Unfortunately, nothing was sent."

We also were wondering what your plans were for implementation of the biobrick into the real-world, and safety precautions to be taken outside the lab through implementation.  Looking forward to hearing back from you soon and we understand if you can't answer some of our questions.
Thank You,  Sincerely,   Our Lady Of The Snows Catholic Academy 2015 iGem Team.
Hello Our Lady Of The Snows Catholic Academy iGEM Team,
Nice to receive your email. I'm Kevin, and I'm the president of our student organization on campus here at UChicago. Our entire team during the school year is larger, but our summer team consists of me, as well as three other undergraduates (CC'd here on this email, in case they have anything to add that I forgot). So obviously this is not the project we are currently pursuing, but I and others did quite a bit of background research into what we could do with this project before deciding against it. I can answer some of your questions hopefully, as well as describe issues that made us stop pursuing this project (that you may be able to overcome). As you know, our 2013 team pursued the Keratinase expression idea, primarily with a focus on digesting feather waste. We didn't get very far, but that year we aimed to express KerA in B. subtilis. Obviously, ideally you would want to express in E. Coli if you're doing it on an industrial scale due to growth rate, but as you may have read on our website, the issue is with KerA getting trapped in the periplasm since it's not endogenously expressed. On the other hand, B. subtilis has the export machinery required to  So here is the format for a couple of theoretical functional systems you could think about that we were deciding between when considering this project, as well as a brief evaluation of each approach: 1. Express in B. Subtilis: Advantage: You don't have the problem of it getting stuck in the periplasm like E. coli since B. subtilis actually recognizes KerA. The Disadvantage: B. Subtilis growth rate is majorly terrible compared to E. coli and people have reported difficulty getting it to grow on an industrial scale, which is why it would be extremely great to get it in E. coli. Also, when we tried it with B. subtilis, the reason we didn't get very far with the 2013 team is because we"

NTU Singapore iGEM Team Collaboration
Revisiting our successful collaboration with the NTU Singapore team last year, we approached them to see if this year’s team would be interested in partnering up again. After discussing our respective projects, a joint decision was made on how to best help each other.
Knowing that we have expertise in protein purification and in vitro assays, NTU incorporated His-tags into the constructs that they wanted to test and requested for us to purify and test their dCas9 constructs in vitro.
In return, knowing that the NTU team is experienced in quantitative PCR from our collaboration last year, our team was interested to know the different transcription levels of the genes within our functioning Hydrogen Gas Producing Gene Cluster plasmid this year (HGPGC) as it contains a few lac promoters within the gene cluster. We asked NTU Singapore to perform RT-qPCR after induction using IPTG to study the expression of our proteins in the gene cluster.
Our instructor delivered our HGPGC plasmid to perform RT-qPCR to the NTU team during his holiday in Singapore, and brought back the plasmids containing the clones that they were interested for us to test on his return trip.
The in vitro assay was performed on four truncated dCas9 mutants: wild type dCas9 (WT), 3P, 5P and HNH. This project used the dCas9 enzyme to form a Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with gRNA, and subsequently bind to the target sequence in our PCR product (similar to what we did last year). The results from the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) show that the dCas9 mutants (WT,3P, 5P and HNH) were successfully truncated (Figure 1), and no longer retain their nuclease activity (see Figures 2,3). This is evident from the gel shift present, the shift of the target sequence protein and the presence of gRNA, indicating the mutant dCas9 has bound the target sequence of DNA from its slower migration through the gel (see Figure 2).
Summary:
Through their RT-PCR expertise, NTU Singapore aided us in"
BroadRun-Baltimore,2016," of continued collaboration. We prepped hard for our meeting at Armstrong global headquarters in Lancaster, PA, knowing we had one hour to make our presentation and pitch before senior staff, technical experts, and a VP. This was a new experience for us. Armed with our PowerPoint presentation, we focused our pitch on our approach to their problem, corroborated it with experimental results, and ventured into ideas and rationale for further work towards a future implementable solution. The Q&A and discussions that followed contributed to the strong impression we left them with on the potential for exploring synthetic biology as a viable solution. Later, this was followed up with an year of collaboration; with written funding proposals and Armstrong’s generous support of our iGEM team with $5,000, email communications with Mr. Paul Hough our main contact at Armstrong and communications with other technical experts, Mr. Craig Hoosier, Mr. Thomas Woolley, and Mike McCarty.

As we were researching the butyric acid problem at Armstrong’s plant in the context of the use of recycled and renewable materials, we sought insight on the extent of this problem in the rest of the industry; we wanted to know if this problem was limited to Armstrong or if other manufactures also experienced the same issues, or if they had a different set of problems. It was important for us to know this as we were looking for solutions that had industry-wide applications. Consequently, we reached out to United States Gypsum, the second largest manufacturer. Explaining our iGEM research that was associated with Armstrong and our overarching goal for finding biological solutions, our communications with Dr. Paul Shipp (see Industry Communication) provided valuable information that we did not previously have, thus providing affirmation and guiding us in the focus of our solution design.
Collaborations in Education
Much of the details of the content presented here has been covered in the Human Practices section of our wiki, but we recap the main points here with a focus on the collaborative relationships and joint work.
Farmwell Station Middle School
Our collaboration with Farmwell Station Middle School evolved from last year when we made presentations of our iGEM research in science classrooms. Our own experiences through middle and high school led us to believe that the ideal target age group for engaging students to explore the sciences by inquiry and doing, is middle school. Middle school students have gained some exposure to scientific experimentation and are eager to try new things. We first contacted Farmwell’s principal, Mrs. Sherri Loya, who is always seeking ways to benefit her students. Mrs.Loya was fully supportive of incorporating Building with Biology activities"

All images were captured using the Webshell on 15.09.15 and are unedited.
Conclusions:
The first objective of the collaboration was to confirm the phenotypes of the bacterial strains and the expression of fluorescent proteins. Due to the technical limitations of OpenScope (see below), RFP could not be visualised. Hence a commercially available microscope was used to confirm RFP expression. In addition, GFP was reliably confirmed using the same microscope. Across the board, expression of the fluorescent proteins was as reported by Glasgow and W&M iGEM teams. This confirms the functionality of the plasmids.
After successful visualisation of fluorescent beads labeled with GFP (Fig. 1), it was expected that OpenScope would enable visualisation of E. coli expressing GFP. However, results indicate that reliable detection was not possible using the standard set-up (single LED illumination, GFP epi-cube). Possible reasons are:
The fluorescent beads used are far brighter than biological samples, and therefore can be visualised with low-brightness LEDs
Bacterial cells are widely dispersed on a microscope slide when prepared from a liquid culture. Fluorescence can only be detected in clustered bacterial cells and colonies, therefore OpenScope cannot resolve individual fluorescent bacterial cells
Replacement of the 100mW LED with the 3W LED allowed visualisation of samples with reduced fluorescence intensity in the case of the p126.1, p126.+p56.1 and p126.1+p80.1 cells. The 100mW LED was sufficient only to image the J23106+I13504 samples. Overall, the results suggest that in order to reliably detect fluorescence the 3W high-power surface-mount LED is more appropriate. However, this is still not sufficiently reliable to make OpenScope useful for fluorescence screening at this stage. In addition, the artefact (image of the LED itself) seen when using the 3W LED means that the uniformity of illumination must be improved.
RFP is more challenging to image, as it has a narrow"

Lethbridge High School
For the 6th consecutive year, we collaborated with the Lethbridge High School iGEM team providing mentorship and assistance with wet lab work, while also working together on the educational aspects of our projects. The high school team worked on creating STEAM (Science Technology, Engineering, Art, Math)  related courses for the Alberta curriculum while the collegiate team designed Professional Development day workshops for teachers using our system as a teaching aide. We worked together on developing relevant questions to ask teaching staff during interviews and a member from both teams was present for each interview. Our team also had high school members read over our protocols developed for teachers and students to see if they understood the concepts or had suggestions for improvement. In terms of mentorship, collegiate team member Chris Isaac hosted a coding workshop for the high school team to teach them coding skills and web design, collegiate team member Taylor Sheahan assisted with wet lab work and collegiate team member Sydnee Calhoun acted as an advisor for the high school team.
Validation of BBa_K2481401
The goal of the Lethbridge High School team is to create environmentally friendly pigments in E. coli as an alternative to current production methods. Our team tested their melanin construct ( BBa_K2481401 ) to see if it could be produced using the PURExpess system, providing further characterization of their part. Production of melanin in a cell-free system provides a scalable and safe method for large-scale pigment production. In theory, our system would be able to produce pigment as well. Although, initial attempts at synthesizing Melanin in vitro have not been successful.
Florida State University
In 2015 and 2016 our team had the privilege of working with Dr. Cesar Rodriguez. Over those two years, he worked with us remotely from Florida as an advisor, giving us project guidance through numerous video conference calls and visits to Lethbridge. When we heard that he would be starting a brand new team this year out of Florida State University we jumped at the opportunity to collaborate with them. We have helped each other through continued mentorship and project guidance via video conference calls. FSU was also able to"

4. Prepare 1:100 dilutions, with a total volume of 1 mL, with desired media for each liquid culture.
5. Plate 100 μL of each dilution in sets of 4 wells in a round-bottom 96 well plate.
6. Shake the plate out over a tray to remove all planktonic bacteria.
7. Rinse the 96-well plate in a large beaker of water and shake the water out over the tray.
8. Lay a paper towel out on the bench top. Hit the 96-well plate against the covered bench top until no liquid remains in the wells.
9. Stain all wells used in the assay with 125 μL of 0.1% crystal violet for 10 minutes.
10. Shake the 96-well plate over the tray again and rinse out the crystal violet in a large beaker of water.
11. Cover the bench top with more paper towels and hit the plate against the bench top until all wells are free of liquid crystal violet. Note: Make sure that the only crystal violet remaining is bound to a biofilm at the bottom of a well. Rings of crystal violet around a well are not indicative of biofilm formation and should be rinsed again, as excess stain will skew the results of the assay.
12. Leave the plate face up on the bench top overnight to dry.

SYSU-Software,2017," has been under the regulation of “ Robots Protocol ” file stated by the official WEIBO company on their website.
After couple of online discussion, the total 17 emojis related to the three words on microblog database were classified into 5 sorts: “Happy”, “Sad”, “Upset”, “Helpless”, and “Others”.Two conclusions can be drawn from the data. First is that 53% of people tend to use negative emojis when they mentioned “losing weight”, “body weight” and “fat”, which reveals about half of the population dislike the process of losing weight. Second is that the emoji “crying” is the commonest emoji, about 17% among all types of emojis, when people’s microblogs contain words related to losing weight or fat. This conclusion reinforced the first conclusion that losing weight is actually a quite annoying process where half of our people may have trouble on different levels.
This background analysis laid a solid foundation on their project motivation this year. By confirming with positive relationship between bad emotions and loosing weight, they conducted a project for producing weight-reducing drugs by engineered organism which may greatly innovate the way we deal with the weight losing matter. Also check on NJU-China's wiki page.
Figure 1. Data analysis in pie chart. We can see from the chart that “crying” is the most mentioned words when it comes to losing weight.
Figure 2. Another pie chart reveals that about half of the emojis are negative when it comes to the three words.
Bi-direction collaboration
During the collaboration, NJU-China tried our software when we released our origin version to them and gave us helpful feedbacks based on which we improved our UI and operating logic of design platform. Additionally, they also give us valuable advice on Interlab Study.
Hong_Kong_HKUST
Background & Demand
HKUST from HongKong University of Science and Technology posted their requirements on visualizing the map on the iGEM official websites community and we happened to share similar interest on their requirements. So we met together and collaborated with each other in Sep and Oct.
Figure 3. : Collaboration with Hong_Kong_HKUST.
Solution & Results
Serving for the goal to help everyone who is interested in Synthetic Biology generating their idea rationally, we managed to provide a visualization tool for presenting the relationship between projects and hot topics. Each blue node stands for a topic key word and other nodes in different colors stands for team’s previous work in different tracks. Teams who shared the same key words of topic would be connected to the same blue node where the words of the topic will emerge"
Freiburg,2017," (100 µg/ml) has a stronger killing effect on HEK cells. Hereby, viability goes down to 18 %, which indicates a possible working concentration for further experiments.
During our Human Practice efforts, we often faced the question “How far can a T cell migrate after being activated in a tumor microenvironment?”.  Finding an answer to this question proved to be challenging as the prediction of T cells migration is not trivial. Looking for a possible collaboration with the iGEM team from ETH Zürich, they offered us to answer this question with their modeling expertise.
As a basis for their modeling literature values for the migration behavior of T cells were used (Miller et al., 2003).
Animated simulation of CARTELTM cell behavior in- and outside the tumor microenvironment.
At the beginning of the simulation, CARTELTM cells, depicted by dots, are randomly distributed inside the tumor microenvironment (grey circle). Blue indicates a fully activated cell and yellow a cell close to deactivation. It can be observed that after leaving the tumor microenvironment fast deactivation of the the CARTELTM cells takes place. This basic model indicates that cells migrate on the average 6 mm from the tumour before getting inactivated. This on the one hand underlines the increased safety of our CARTELTM cells and on the other hand this model provides a perfect basis for further refinements.
Heidelberg
Mutagenesis rate
To improve current directed evolution approaches, iGEM team Heidelberg set out to make use of their newly designed method called PREDCEL (phage-related discontinuous evolution). For the collaboration with Heidelberg, we analyzed the mutagenesis level in E. coli containing different mutagenesis plasmids (MP1, MP2 and MP3). The plasmids  enhance the mutation rate by the inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms (Badran & Liu, 2015).
It was assumed by team Heidelberg that the mutation rate, which is several magnitudes higher in E. coli containing these mutagenesis plasmids, might vary between laboratories.
According to the data provided by team Heidelberg and literature (Badran & Liu, 2015), MP3 was supposed to have the highest mutagenesis rate, followed by MP2 and MP1. Due to these plasmids, E. coli is able to rapidly develop antibiotic resistances. To test this ability, E. coli cells were transformed with one of each of the mutagenesis plasmids and plated onto 2xYT (Yeast Extract Tryptone) plates, containing various antibiotics. After 21"
Hamburg,2017," solving it in detail they gave us valuable tips. Their ideas were a raise of the annealing temperature to 72 °C, adding 0.5 M betaine, try adding DMSO in 3 %, 5 % or even 10 % concentration or a combination of both DMSO and betaine. We gave a try to all these suggestions, unfortunately without having a hit. We expected a lane at about 1100 bp.
The PCR was tested with a Q5-High- Fidelity polymerase and a Phusion polymerase but neither led to a positive result.
We discussed the result with the iGEM Team Heidelberg who did not want to give up and gave us additional tips to try. Their next suggestion was to design new primes, as ours had a very high GC content in the middle part and were therefore prone to the formation of secondary structures. Also, the new primer pairs should be designed to anneal at 72 °C. They offered to design to take over the design for us. These were the original primers:
Fw: CATTATGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGA
Rv: GATAATCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTA
These are the newly designed primers by the iGEM Team Heidelberg:
Fw: CATTATGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGATGACCATCACCATC
Rv: GATAATCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTATTAG
Unfortunately, we did not have enough time at this stage of the project to order and test new primers. Therefore, we will only add the primers to the gene to facilitate the work for the next group who wants to work on the gene.
Even though the gene amplification was not successful in the end, we are very grateful for the help of the iGEM Team Heidelberg, especially Pauline for her advice and not giving up on our problem. Thank you very much!
Harvard
The iGEM team Harvard offered the opportunity to participate in the design process of a set of questions for human practices partner in politics, economics, and science. The questions were targeted to set standards for future surveys so that the results become comparable. And that future teams can easily navigate through interviews with highly qualified personnel originating from the respective fields.
Many teams came together working on the questionnaire, however we want to mention one team especially: Aalto Helsinki, adding a ton of good questions while also fueling the discussion.

TJU,2015,"utes appear, the sensors can produce riboflavin to improve the voltage. We are very pleased to find both of us work on the MFC system so that we can share many experience and problems. In this year’s project. LZU-China try to develop a system based on MFC to sense the pollutes. They constructed a series of heavy metal sensors used in MFCs (microbial fuel cell). When pollutes appear, the sensors can produce riboflavin to improve the voltage. Through our research, we find that F- is also a remarkable pollute which have a potential risk to human beings so we advised them to construct a F- sensor and the sensor can be constructed based on BBa_K911003. Through our advice, LZU-China then constructed BBa_K1755024, the F- sensor.
F- sensing part
To prove their part BBa_K1755024 can work normally, we tested their part in our own lab under our MFC system which had similar culture environment. The BL21 with K1755024 was cultured added with NaF and the production of riboflavin was measured.
Figure 3. The relationship between OD600 and time (K1755024, BL21)
Firstly, we measured the riboflavin concentration produced by BBa_K1755024. 3ml bacteria solution was taken every 12 hours(0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h）, their absorbance (OD values ) were measured in the 600 nm wavelength. The absorbance of supernatant (OD values ) were measured in the 444 nm wavelength, which suggests the concentration of riboflavin.
Figure 4. The relationship between riboflavin production and NaF (after incubation of 20 h, K1755024, BL21).
We can see from the figure that though the background expression is relatively high, the concentration of riboflavin shows a good linear relationship with that of NaF when NaF ranges from 0 to 40 μm. However, 80 μm condition, through our speculation, may inhibit the expression of riboflavin.
Cu2+ sensing  part
Apart from the F- part, we also helped them characterize the Cu2+ sensing part in our MFC device.
As for BBa_K1755301, the voltage in MFC was documented. The MFC‘s anode was added with Cu2+ from the very begging (0 min), and their voltage (with BL21-K1755301)"

PCR Machine Inspiration and Design
We attended the University of Maryland meet-up in June. We had been working with the idea of a cheap DIY PCR machine because we had discovered one of the main barriers to colleges, community labs, and high schools getting into biotechnology was the price of the equipment. While at the meeting, we talked to the William and Mary team and discovered they had to get up ridiculously early to use a PCR machine in an advisor’s lab because they didn’t have their own machine. Upon hearing that, we agreed to sell our low-cost thermocycler that had not even been fully designed yet to William and Mary’s iGEM team. At the conference, we also spoke with the University of Maryland team about thermocyclers because they were also in the process of building a one for themselves. We discussed and, after the conference, continued a dialogue about the best, lowest cost options for design, Peltier chips, and code for the Arduino. The results of the collaboration can be seen on the Project Overview page.
Another point of collaboration was our meet-up with UNC’s iGEM team. This is the first year UNC will be going to the Jamboree, and we wanted to discuss our ideas and see if there was any way Duke iGEM could offer them support or collaboration with their project. Our projects were in different areas, but we enjoyed learning about their projects and answering questions about the structure of the Jamboree to the best of our ability."

TU Darmstadt - Exploring the German Community Lab Scene
At the 12th of June, the iGEM Team Darmstadt came to visit us. Quite soon it became apparent that they seem to be in tune with us. As a consequence, collaborations on several levels arose. Some weeks ago, we had offered them to use the first version of our lab organization software tubefront . The feedback that we got from team Darmstadt helped us to understand how we could improve our software.
Beyond only presenting and discussing ours as well as their project, the members of the iGEM Team Darmstadt stayed the night within the scope of their Labsurfing journey. For the second day, we invited them to have a deeper discussion about the growing Community Lab scene in Germany. Together, we had a first evaluation of the general pros and cons of community labs.  The elaborated protocol of our discussion is shown here . Since both teams were very interested in the respective development, we agreed to stay in contact throughout the year and to have a final joint conclusion .

High School Tours in Tianjin
Responsibility comes with the ability. As main iGEM teams in Tianjin, we are entrusted with the duty of spreading our concept and advanced knowledge.
With the same wish, we easily reached a consensus with NKU-China  and TUST-China . We held several meetups to discuss the appropriate approach to advocating rational analysis and creative thoughts during the CCiC. Eventually, we decided to take the first step in high schools.
We firstly listened to experts in education and contacted several high school in Tianjin. Teachers warmly welcome us to display and explain experiments for students. We hit it off with each other immediately. All three teams cooperated tightly, presenting a wonderful schedule containing: the concept of synthetic biology and its influence in reality, introduction of classic iGEM projects and example of our program, non-toxic yeasts which showed different beautiful colors.
To our great surprise, we received countless fans of synthetic biology and they showed great passion about the amazing field. They listened carefully and asked questions actively. The energetic and creative thoughts provided us valuable inspiration about our program. It was our pleasure to expose them to shallow biology research and we sent them the most sincere invitation to our next Open-up Day.
Joint Report
In our practice with people outside biology, we gradually found that production falls so far behind research that the public cannot understand its extraordinary meaning and scientists have difficulty in proving the value in their achievements. Hence, we initiated a joint research on how to apply a new technology to actual production.
In line with the principle of ‘To be more responsible and reflect more’, we jointly conducted a research on the transformation of biotechnology achievements with the iGEM team of Zhejiang University ( ZJU-CHINA ), the University of National Defense Science and Technology ( NUDT_CHINA ) and Ocean University of China ( OUC_CHINA ). Through the clear division of labor, we explored the general mode of the transformation in basic research results, and developed a series of HP activity guidelines and put"

Collaboration with Synbio-tech
Synbio Tech is an innovator in the field of synthetic biology in China, having a wide range of cooperation with both international companies and universities. It aims to provide customers with a perfect technical platform of the synthetic biology. For now, by applying their unique self-established technical platform Syno? involving sound chip-based gene synthetic and high throughput gene sequencing service, it already develops the technology of constructing recombinant antibody libraries as well as highly-purified vaccines, genome synthesis and DNA storage.
As a major sponsor of XJTLU-China 2015, they provided a lab equipped with all apparatus and reagents needed and directly gave a hand in the de novo gene synthesis in the circuits’ construction. At the beginning of iGEM project, the company offered us a training program including both theoretical basis of synthetic biology and practical skills useful in later wet experiments. Also during the collaboration this summer, they were active in supervising our experiments and giving valuable suggestions on experiment protocols and result analysis.
Guidance from BIT-China
We express our sincere gratitude for the contribution of the iGEM team BIT-China. They provided us a biobrick design: BBa_K1824000 after knowing the difficulties of our project and the biobrick was synthesized by us. This biobrick is a RNA thermometer that induces a translational activation at 42 celsius degree which is a vital part in performing color changing process in our project."

COLLABORATION
UNIVERSITY OF LETHBRIDGE COLLEGIATE TEAM
We are collaborating with the University of Lethbridge Collegiate Team for the 7th year in a row. The collegiate team members have assisted our project by providing us with mentorship and assistance in the lab. It was easy for us to collaborate with them as both our projects contain protein capsids from viruses, and therefore we were able to help each other design these constructs. We were also able to have connection to collegiate team members who have had previous experience with tailings ponds in their past iGEM projects, which helped our project greatly. Sydnee Calhoun, Chris Isaac, Luke Saville, and Kristi Turton, members of the collegiate team, were advisors for our team and provided valuable assistance and help for our project."

NAU-CHINA,2017," designs were going to be very different, they gave us some very useful tips and feedback on how to choose the final peptides. We brainstormed ways to progress and discussed the difficulties we had encountered and the solutions we had tried to find thus far.
Two Skype calls with NTHU_Taiwan：
NTHU_Taiwan’s goal is to deal with EDCs (Endocrine isrupting Chemicals) in farmland. For detection ,they modified E .coli to express estrogen receptor ,ERα on the surface of E .coli. In our project, we choose a yeast-based biosensor. We manipulate the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to express estrogen receptor. During this process, we learned a lot about their projects and helped each other out with experiments and ideas. Every team has its own unique way of designing circuits and perceptions to deal with current situations.
CCIC Conference of China
iGEMer Community
This was a very educational and unique day that helped us direct our preparations for the contest and practice speaking in front of a large crowd. 
Through the oral presentation and poster session, we found that students from different universities have different ideas for our project. And we also think of their insight to be a valuable opportunity to learn or conceive questions we have not thought of. What is notable is that a team Fudan invented a game relevant to synthetic biology and their project.
Collaboration with BIT  Beijing
Institute of Technology
We received positive feedback regarding the applied design of our research. They helped us make an effective treatment to detect the mycotoxins.

We conducted meetings with AHUT_China iGEM team to discuss our projects so far, and to share any advice and learning experiences that we’ve had. 
Video Collaboration
Furthermore, we shot episodes to promote and discuss “Biosafety”. The episodes then converge into one film. Also, in the film, it integrates multicultural topics. The diversity of cultures is what we want"
SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017," engineering project.
In their protein-engineering project, they found their interested protein was mostly in inclusion body by BL21. So they couldn’t extract enough proteins out of engineered bacteria. With the help of structure biology professor Hongmin Zhang at SUSTech, we held a seminar with them to discuss how to deal with inclusion body. Prof. Zhang introduced the protocol of inclusion body washing, dissolution and renaturation, which helped solved their technical problems.
Seminar with Prof. Zhang and Shenzhen_SFLS
We also held a workshop with them to exchange project ideas. And we were invited to give some instructions on their modeling.

TU_Delft,2015," presentation about physics and modeling behind the iGEM project, and how you had to ask the right questions to use modelling as a tool. He also gave information about how the judges evaluate the modeling tract. After taking up so much new knowledge, it was time for a lunch provided by the TU Delft.
After lunch Anne Meyer continued with a lecture about all the things the jury like and dislike in the iGEM competition. Since she had participated as a judge in the iGEM competition, she was able to gives a lot of useful information that we definitely would use. The last item on the agenda was a practical course in modelling, where we were given some exercises with matlab to see how modelling worked in practice. This gave a lot of insight for students who had never worked with matlab or modelling before. To close the two day lectures, everyone was invited for drinks afterwards in one of the popular bars.
All in all the two days were very informative, we got a lot of useful tips and tricks. Besides that we have a lot of fun. It was also very nice to meet the other teams and hear their project. We would like to thank all the participating teams, old iGEM members and lecturers for their time and energy in organizing and joining the educating and informative subjects.
Cooperations
Throughout the year we cooperated with a number of national and international iGEM teams
Team Aalto-Helsinki
We received a request from the iGEM team Aalto-Helsinki to fill in a questionnaire. This questionnaire was about modeling in combination with experiments. Because our modeling is quite extensive, this questions gave us a lot of insight in how we can best implement modeling with science. So we were pleased to help them.
Chang Gung University
On the 12th of June we had contact for the first time with a team outside the Netherlands. We arranged a Skype meeting with them for an hour. We explained our project, and they explained their project. We had just started in the lab, and it was           very interesting to hear how far they were in the process and what their experience was so far. CGU team was further in the development of the plasmids. In their iGEM project they try to develop an organism that can detect Oral squamous cell           carcinoma (OSCC). They use the idea of the TU Delft team of 2012, the snifferomyces project.
Unfortunately our projects are now too different, so there was no reason to exchange plasmids. They had some questions for us about the modeling, because our model was already quite developed at"

Cooperation with ZJU iGEM team
We were in close contact with ZJU iGEM team and talked about our progressivity and experiences in labs from time to time. We used to help each other out when we run into problems with our experiments. We offered them a bacterial strain they needed.
Apart from this, we also kept in touch with multiple iGEM teams all over China, offering them various help including tips on delivering the sample package to the iGEM headquarters and offered suggestions on modeling to OUC iGEM team.

AHUT_China,2018," the team. So we participated in this cooperation. This is an interesting collaboration, as it may be boring during the experiment, but the stories that happen in the experiment make the experiment fun.And by organizing these stories, we learned more about our experiments.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 3 . Callobration  with NEU-China
On August, 2018, our team established a connection with iGEM group of NEU-China-A and thus a couple of video conferences have been made so far. The two teams introduced their own projects in detail; the project of NEU-China was to design a biological system against IBD and prevent CRC by using engineered probiotics. Since the concentration of NO in the intestines of IBD patients was about 100 times higher than that of normal people;  NO molecules were chosen as inflammatory signals, and probiotics (Nissle 1917) were selected as chassis organisms. The project consisted of two sets of devices, one of which was an anti-inflammatory equipment, including a sensor for detecting inflammatory signals, an effective enhancer and an effector secreting interleukin 10 (il-10). Another one was an anti-cancer device,which is able to express a kind of myrosinase from cruciferous vegetables by virtue of engineering probiotics. Meanwhile, it can transfer glucosinolate, a natural ingredient in cruciferous vegetables into sulforaphane. Such a kind of product was a type of organic molecule with cancer-fighting ability and at the same time it could inhibit oxidative stress. Similarly, it could work against intestinal inflammation. In addition, we used cold shock kill switches (cold shock expression Lysis and maz-ef) to prevent our engineer bacteria from escaping into the environment and causing DNA contamination.
During exchange of project experience with each other, we learned that NEU-China-A had a little bit of a problem in one of the plasmid insertion experiments, so they asked us for help and wanted us to conduct the construction experiment of secreting the yebf-homoil10 plasmid. Our counterpart and we made it clear about what we were going to cooperate followed by three video meetings. NEU-China-A helped us carry out experiments on optimizing the conditions of prokaryotic expression of CSCA protein and purifying expression. In a similar way, we helped NEU-China-A perform fragment-linking experiment. NEU-China-A provided us with original plasmid of PCDF-Duet1 (dry powder tube), taught us to overlap the secretion label Yebf (from BL21"

iGEM community
A fundamental idea in the iGEM society is to increase knowledge within the field of synthetic biology as well as sharing this knowledge with other students and scientists internationally. The participants of iGEM will in the future end up as scientist or in the industry, and hopefully retain the sportsmanship that exist within the iGEM community and spread it even further. By focusing on iGEM community in our Human Practices, we hope to raise awareness of the importance of sharing one's knowledge, both for solidarity reasons as well as making the research more accessible. One example of how we reached out to the iGEM community is our ongoing collaboration with team Czech Republic. We also participated in the Nordic iGEM Conference, and shared thoughts and ideas with other nordic iGEM teams.
Our friends in Team Czech Republic
During the course of the summer we have been in contact with first time iGEM participants, team Czech Republic. They initially contacted us because they were interested in our previous project (iGEM 2014 Team Gothenburg), which brought to our attention the fact that their project was similar to the detection part we had designed. Due to those similarities we believed that it would be beneficial for everyone if we could help each other out through the duration of the summer. Our contact has mainly been through e-mail and Skype and the collaboration encompassed different parts of our projects. We helped them out by giving some general advice concerning the competition for instance where to find the free parts we get from the competition and also providing them with our survey so they received something for their Human Practices. In return, they have been helping us with some simulations of the detection system and the modeling people from both teams have been talking to each other during the summer as well. We are very pleased that we got this opportunity to get in contact with another team! It has been really nice and we are all looking forward to meet the Czech Republic"

Sharing with IONIS Paris
IONIS Paris gave us an insight into their project, fundraising technique, and human practice. We conducted a Skype call on 10th July 2017 in our beloved genetic labs. Discussion started with an introduction from both teams. They shared their project idea which mainly concerns on temperature changes cell detector. Further, they applied the project on Meteorology Centre and farming by forming a collaboration. We shared our project idea as well and also expressed our concern on fundraising. Our team received a valuable advice to search a sponsor. In the end, the discussion closed with a photo session and a social media account exchange to keep us stay in touch. Moreover, they asked us to participate on their survey.

GMM Legislation Document
Click Here!
iGEM event has provided us a competition as well as collaboration. As a synthetic biology enthusiast, we have a responsibility to make our work safe and comply the law and regulation. Therefore, we collaborated with 137 iGEMers from 10 teams, 10 countries, 7 different iGEM tracks, and 5 continents to compile a worldwide GMM legislation document. Our role was to provide an Indonesian GMM regulation based on Peraturan Pemerintah No. 21 Tahun 2015. This is most probably one of the biggest collaborations in iGEM!
The compilation of GMM legislation is very useful in a lot of different ways for practitioners of synthetic biology and other related fields. Many information can be inferred from our collaboration result that will be able to help many parties.
Aside from significantly contributing to the whole collaboration which helps every team in its own ways, we also the gain some insights from the collaboration. Our take on the compilation of GMM regulations is that the use of GMOs especially as a bioremediation tool directly applied to environment is still very strictly prohibited in most areas of the world. While our project grand design in the long run is to directly applying our bacteria in the ocean, this collaboration led our project to develop new alternatives and safety measures modules to cope with the regulations so that our project can be of use in the near future.

The University of Warwick
We sent the University of Warwick water samples from our local river- the River Trent. These samples were then tested in their fluorometer and they return the data to our team. This was a very meaningful collaboration, as it gave their team a wider range of results to analyse in their attempts to improve water safety using their flurometer. By having a wider range of data, the team were able to have more confidence in their device and final conclusions. This data can be accessed via this link .
Team BioMarvel- Korea
Our team offered our grammar checking services, as native English speakers to Team BioMarvel for their wiki. We collaborated intensely over the summer months, reviewing their team’s drafts and sending redrafts of their wiki submissions. We edited their drafts over and over until the grammar was perfect! This was an incredibly meaningful collaboration, as it ensured their team had an outstanding wiki, with accurate grammar. This ensured that regardless of English not being their first language, their efforts in iGEM could still be fully recognised and understood with a grammatically correct wiki.
The University of Warwick and Imperial College London
We sent 8 samples of our promoters, including a negative control, with the same 3 day protocol we followed for our GFP assay. Please find a link to the protocol below.
The data we acquired through this collaboration emphasises the importance of the standardised approach that iGEM promotes through their inter lab study, as both teams used the same standardised method as us and all achieved similar results. This increases our confidence in our data, and reassures us of our decision to use PCac_thl in our constructs.

Modeling for Toulouse 2016
In collaboration with the iGEM team Toulouse , we conceived a model of plasmid loss for the Toulouse team.
Data recovery Bordeaux 2016
In order to help the iGEM team Bordeaux , we extract data from the paper « Dynamics of plasmid transfer on surfaces » [1] and organize those data about their experiments on plasmids transfer. Thanks to this, the iGEM team Bordeaux can compare those results to their own computationnal results.
Here is a summary of this article.

Tec-Monterrey,2015," biological activity than graphite. Some authors have demonstrated that DNA can adhere to the CNTs by simple electrostatic interactions between positively charged groups on the surface of the CNTs and the negative charges of the phosphate groups of nucleic acids. Studies have also shown that the CNTs do not interfere with the mobility of DNA adhered to its surface and have a protective effect against cellular nucleases even after a 60 min digestion, as well as poor enzymatic degradation thereof. So this team used this principle to improve the DNA transformation protocol, increasing the efficiency of it by using DNA attached to CNTs. Our lab work collaboration will be to perform our transfection protocol using DNA-CNTs complexes (Team Tec-Chihuahua will attach our DNA samples with their CNTs and functionalize them) to transform our Sf9 cells. We will evaluate the efficiency of transfection using CNTs by electroporation of insect cells and liposomal reagents methods."

Meeting other teams
iGEM UGent
It is always a pleasure to collaborate with our compatriots. Indeed, both of our teams were very pleased with this collaboration. We tried to review each other work as much as possible and one week before the Jamboree, we also met in order to discuss each other presentations and posters.
Finally after this incredible adventure, we plan to organise a conference on synthetic biology, here in Belgium. This would be the perfect opportunity to fill in Belgian students about what is iGEM and how this contest brings so much hopes to synthetic biology.
Aalto-Helsinki
One member of our team (Pierre-Antoine) spent his second semester (January-May 2016) in Helsinki for an exchange. He made the most of it by contacting the Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team to organize a meeting with them. It was rewarding for both teams as they could discuss about ideas and organization in general.
Meeting other scientists
One conference from the UCL research institute ‘ISV’ which stands for Institut des Sciences de la Vie (Life Science Institute)  was dedicated to our iGEM project under the theme ‘Our First Scientific Adventure’. It was presented by Antoine Godeaux and Joaquin Guzman on the 7th of October 2016 .
Meeting other students
Short presentations about iGEM and our project were organized before or during the break of several courses at the University. The purpose was to inform and draw the attention of students to iGEM and synthetic biology.
Meeting our sponsors
One of our Sponsor provided us with Corn Syrup (See Homemade product ) used for our test of selection for our leaky porins. We could also work with them in order to analyze the different products through chromatographic analysis.

iGEM Paris Saclay
We collaborated with the Paris Saclay team by sharing with them how we implemented the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) ideology into our project. The Paris Saclay team saw an opportunity in iGEM teams to spread the concept of RRI through the scientific community and the general public as well, thanks to our involvement and compromise with our community. This collaboration helped them to assess the level of implementation and awareness of responsible research worldwide, and it also helped to spread the importance of taking into account the duty we, as scientists, have with our society while doing research.
Thanks to this collaboration we were also able to asses the impact of our project in our society, and what actions we were taking in order to make our research useful for solving the problems that our community faces nowadays. We believe RRI should be an essential aspect of any scientific project and it should be implemented from its core. Spreading the RRI ideology will undoubtedly have a great impact in the development of society as a whole, because by doing research with this concepts of responsibility in mind we will be aiming scientific research and technological development towards society’s needs.
iGEM Toulouse
We collaborated with the iGEM Toulouse team while one of our team members was studying abroad in France. She got in contact with the team and organized a meeting in which they discussed several important issues about both projects. They shared the progress of each individual project, the issues encountered so far, talked about sponsors, and gave each other feedback in all of these aspects. They also talked about the support each institution gave to their respective teams.
The final resolution of the meeting was to clarify the misconceptions that both teams had about the way research is facilitated in both, Latin America and Europe, and mainly discuss the development of iGEM projects in each one of the continents. Something great about this collaboration is that, as several members from the Toulouse team were going to the European iGEM teams meeting in Paris, they took the opportunity to share some of our struggles with the other European teams."

Virginia iGEM
The Virginia iGEM team conducted a survey about the awareness and use of biocontainment in iGEM projects, which our members completed, giving them many more data points for their analysis!
HKUST iGEM
Building upon the collaboration we started in 2015 as the joint HKUST-Rice iGEM team, we hosted a number of HKUST students at Rice this past summer. They traveled to Rice to construct gene dosage-tuning devices that would 1) tune the effective             plasmid copy number, and 2) involve antisense RNA interference; additionally, they studied the approach toward modeling used in our project and helped establishing mathematical equations we used in our model.
The Rice and HKUST iGEM students interacted with each other in lab, and in Team Rice’s group meetings. Beyond the lab, the HKUST students also attended events on Rice’s campus, including a BioSciences Department retreat, the Rice Biosciences             Summer Research Institute (SRI) journal club, and the Rice IBB Summer Research Poster Symposium!
UT Austin & Texas Tech
iGEM teams Rice, UT Austin, and Texas Tech had a state iGEM meet-up at the 2016 UT Austin Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium (FURS).

European iGEM Meetup organised by TU Delft
Two of our teammates participated in a European iGEM meeting in the Netherlands in Delft as the only high school iGEM team and also the only one from Eastern Europe. It was held on the 7th and 8th of July and we had the chance to meet several iGEM teams and scientific researchers there. Participants had the opportunity to attend lectures held by university professors about synthetic biology and responsability while working on a synthetic biology experiment. It was a great pleasure for us to talk to others with similar interests about our scientific research work. Every team brought a poster to this excellent meeting as a result of which we could have a deeper insight into other iGEM teams' project. In our experience, the TU Delft team provided a great chance to make friends from the iGEM world and collaborate with other participant teams. We extremely appreciated all of the precious, practical and helpful collaborations given by others. In the name of the Methungeny team, I would like to thank you the possibility to show our project to others, TU Delft! (https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUDelft )"

Being Mentored by the Veterans
With their prior experience with iGEM, the NYU-AD team was able to help with insights on our project, interlab doubts and an overall understanding of how iGEM works. Our team                     member, Sahana visited them and had discussions related to possible collaborations. The NYU-AD team was very friendly and enthusiastic about their mentorship and made sure that                     we felt like family.
Wiki Workshop
The NYU-AD team conducted a wiki workshop that covered a lot of necessary points that we could keep in mind while designing our Wiki. Basics of HTML, CSS AND Java and many other rules pertaining to iGEM were also discussed.By covering the iGEM Wiki rules and resources,the workshop indeed gave us a clearer picture of how to organise our content. NYU-AD Virtual Conference
An online conference was conducted by NYU-Abu Dhabi, on 15 th September, where six teams, including ours, participated in this virtual conference from India, Abu Dhabi, Australia, China and Turkey.
Google Hangouts was the preferred medium of communication for the conference. After the initial introductions, each team shared what their idea and project was about, what challenges were being faced, human practices, tips and suggestions to other teams and much more, and this virtual presentation was kick-started by the host team themselves. Each team was given a 15-minute slot to present their project and we were able to share the presentation (if any) through the google hangouts screen sharing feature. Then there was a round of questions to the team presenting.
On the whole, it was a very enriching and educative experience as we learnt a lot from the teams who participated. A big thanks to the host Team NYU Abu Dhabi, and the participating Team HKUST from Hong Kong, REC Chennai from India, Team Saint"

Vagineering : A New Non Hormonal Contraception
Abtract
Modern hormonal contraceptive methods have been revolutionary for women in developed countries; however, they still exhibit a variety of challenges. Developing countries lack consistent access, hormonal contraceptives can produce harmful environmental effects, and some women are unable use them due to health problems. The Vagineering project looks to solve these issues with a novel, non-hormonal method. Our team aims to engineer Lactobacillus jensenii, a bacterium from the vaginal flora, to produce two proteins to prevent unintentional pregnancy: antisperm antibodies that inhibit sperm motility and anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) that produce spermicidal effects. The goal is to create a lasting contraceptive using only bacteria, which can later be reversed by engineering the strain with a kill-switch. Additionally, our studies of this strain have produced a toolbox that will help other teams to further engineer this less-characterized bacterium.

Léa Meneu and Léo Carillo, two students from the iGEM 2018 Montpellier team are pursuing their master’s degree at Sorbonne Université in Paris. So we invited them to help us introduce synthetic biology and the iGEM experience to high school students. To do so, practical sessions were organized. Several meetings between our teams were set to prepare the slides and purchase the equipments. Teaching students was a very nice opportunity to learn how to explain our project with simple words.

Vibrigens - Accelerating Synbio
: Establishing Vibrio natriegens"
TU_Darmstadt,2017," service is really easy. Now lets check the interesting part: Search for projects similiar to ours. Enter ""Chitosan"" into the search mask yields promising results.  We see great potential in the search mask. Just a short search yielded results as good as a long Google search. Also lovely, the possibility to have an overview of the total project of other teams, their parts and their final position. This is a realy good tool to get an overview of old projects without the need of reading their Wiki.  Unfortunately, a small sample on teams related to chitosan showed many empty fields. Using the feature ""Project"" and designing custom parts is a  little bit buggy . The select'n'drop feature is an awesome idea for sequence design, but the resulting sequence was shown at the top of the window, It is also a bit confusing that some parts have quite good informations in the information box right, but other ones have none or they are not dislayed. In addition it is noch really clear how one can select special parts. This is just a small test of your tool. We see tremendous potential in the searchable database for  related projects and we want to encourage the next-year's iGEM TU Darmstadt team to use your database as a possible start of their research.
Optogenetic seminar in Düsseldorf
On September 1st 2017 we were invited by the team of Cologne-Düsseldorf to participate in a seminar about optogenetics. Since we were looking for regulatory systems for our chitin deacetylases, we gladly followed this invitation. We saw a great opportunity in the use of optogenetics and wanted to learn more about the laboratory routine in this field. The seminar started with an introduction to the currently available optogenetic switches by Patrick Fischbach. The iGEM Team from Cologne-D üsseldorf presented their project and shared their experience on common mistakes in optogenetic laboratories. Each team was given the opportuni-ty to present their project to the audience and to throw light on the optogenetic aspects of their project. We presented our project and our plans to establish an orthogonal regulatory system for our chi-tindeacetylases. Optogenetic switches represent interesting tools for this purpose. In the aftermath of the presentations Cologne-Düsseldorf gave a guided tour through their optogenetic laboratories, illustrating general handling of optogenetic tools. Cologne-Düsseldorf further provided con-struction plans for a light-box, used to store and specifically induce optogenetic systems. Our future team can easily rebuild it and will be able to work with optogenetic circuits. We"

Background
Team Aachen has consistently been successful in the iGEM competition, winning three gold medals in a row. I wanted to see how, as part of a team that had just won its first gold medal in 2016, how we could improve our team. Our main obstacles this year were fundraising and group dynamic.
Project Discussion
We held a short interview over the summer (find date in journal) where we went over a general summary of each other’s projects. They described to us the following details: The Aachen team will be taking ion channels from plants and yeast and overexpressing these in order to lead to hyper sequestration of salts. They wanted to see the effects of using each channel as well as in tandem. They mentioned use of mRFP in vacuoles for colocalization of ion channels. We suggested looking at increased salt tolerance with using seawater bacteria. The Aachen team had actually concluded from literature that yeast was more effective at salt sequestration than bacteria. They integrated these parts into the genome and were trying to implement a kill switch to prevent the organism from running loose.
Team Improvement
To improve the group dynamic, Team Aachen suggested that we try to understand the team more on a personal level. They did this by hanging out together, playing video games, and cooking meals. This allowed the team members to bond with each other and understand each other to a point where they could work better together to accomplish a common goal. Also, they suggested that all new recruits must be made aware of the commitment required for iGEM, so that they could leave the team before the research process began. This would result in a smaller team at the end, but the team would have highly committed team members that would be sufficient to accomplish the goal.
Our team struggled greatly to secure sufficient fundraising to cover all costs. We did fundraising throughout the summer whereas Team Aachen tackled fundraising much earlier in the process. Our team members were assigned several"
DTU-Denmark,2016," Denmark!
The weekend was a great success and gave the Danish teams a great foundation for collaboration and fun during other meetups and during our projects. In order to assure that next year's Biobuilders could make it even better, we asked everyone for feedback and had a follow up presentation:

Uppsala University
In July, we received a request for help from team Uppsala. Team Uppsala wanted to test their microfluidic devices in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. However, the team did not have a yeast lab at their university and lacked some necessary components in order to work with yeast thus we sent two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, W1588-4A and W1588-4C, in order to help the Uppsala team with the testing of their method in a eukaryotic organism.
Furthermore, we sent the team two shuttle vectors, pRS415 and pRS423, a high copy-number and a low copy-number vector, respectively, which the team has used to perform their tests in yeast.
SDU-Denmark and UNIK-Copenhagen
In August, the bioinformaticians from DTU BioBuilders, SDU-Denmark and UNIK-Copenhagen arranged a meeting for discussing ideas on how to apply mathematical modelling to each other’s projects.
SDU-Denmark and UNIK-Copenhagen explained their issues, and the DTU BioBuilders suggested suitable models based on systems of differential equations, that were well-received by both teams.
Furthermore, the DTU BioBuilders explained the genome-scale model (GSM) concept and received reasonable questions and suggestions from the other teams.
Getting help ourselves
Uppsala
We tried to insert chromoproteins into the chlorampenicol backbone pSB1C3, but without success. Therefore, we contacted team Uppsala in order to get some help. Since the team had chromoproteins in stock from prior iGEM Uppsala teams, they helped us moving one of the chromoproteins from the pSB1A3 backbone into the pSB1C3 backbone.
SDU-Denmark
We also contacted SDU-Denmark about expression of chromoproteins in pSB1C3.      SDU-Denmark"
ZJU-China,2015," phage chromosome and host chromosome. This recombination results in the reverse of the sequence between attB and attP, changing the two sites to attL and attR at the meantime. This inversion can be reversible by appropriately controlling the conditional expression of integrase and an excisionase in Bxb1 named gp47 at certain ratio. We change start codon ATG to GTG for a appropriate expression quantity.
The second one contains a switch, two reporters, two RBS and terminators. At first, the plasmid expresses GFP, when gp35 is expressed, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.

The second gene circuits we built for BNU.
Map of those two circuits are shown above. And figures below show us circuit 1 and 2 using Agarose Gel Electroporesis.
We performed experiment to see whether our circuits work. From the figure above, we can find out that when only circuit 2 is transformed (A), GFP is expressed, when both of the two circuits are transformed, the switch turns and RFP is expressed.
HZAU
HZAU-China is going to design a device to control the light intensity of LED beads going as a specific function and can communicate with matlab. In the beginning, their team members were not familiar with SCM ((Single Chip Micyoco) , so they turned to our Dry Lab member for help. we shared them a basic program which can change the brightness of LED through controlling PWM as a reference and other suggestions online. Learn more about our friends here .

NCTU Meetup
In Formosa, we shared our ideas to each other, here is photo of ZJU-China and NTU.
In Jul 19-24, we attended in the Asian Conference in the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu where we made our presentation in that conference to share our idea and project to many Asian teams so that we could get everyone know our idea. In addition, we brought every team gift, the special candy named “Big Termite”, which made everyone feel great about that. We did a lot of work to prepare our presentation and poster to make sure everyone there can understand what we’re doing even get inspired by us.

1. Collaboration with SHSU_China
a) What they did for us
DNA Kit Plate. The SHSU_China team provided our team with their DNA Kit Plate 1 after we used up all the plasmid in well 4L (part BBa_K325909 which contains the pSB1C3-Lux plasmid) for transformation that unexpectedly ended up in failure.
Ligation. They helped us ligate 2×20μL of our part BBa_K2836001 (pSB1C3-LuxG) using a Quick Ligation system from New England BioLabs (with the Quick Ligation Enzyme, Stock No. M2200), as this system can complete the entire ligation process in 10-15 minutes.
Competent cell. They provided us with three tubes of E. coli DH5-α competent cell after our lab ran out when we needed to transform our BBa_K2836001.
Troubleshooting. When one of the forms in our first submission for the InterLab was rejected, SHSU_China and our team worked together to find any errors in our submission. Eventually, we found out that it was only a misinterpretation of the requirements (there was a section where we multiplied our Abs600 values with the conversion factor which was unnecessary). With their help, our second submission of the InterLab was successful.
b) What we did for them
Laboratory and equipment. Thanks to their help, we gladly shared our lab and equipment with the SHSU_China team in order for them to complete their InterLab study. Their laboratory lacked a suitable equipment to measure absorbance and fluorescence in a 96-well plate. We also utilized this chance to aid each other through the entire process of InterLab, helping out during experiments and eventually comparing our results.
Transformation. We helped SHSU_China transform and amplify part BBa_K1321200 from well 16E on DNA Kit Plate 5 which contains their desired VHb protein.

Cornell,2017," education affect how they feel about the impact of synthetic biology? Each bar represents a different level of education and each color represents their feelings about synthetic biology, where the more positive feelings are towards the bottom of the bar and the more negative feelings are towards the top
Education Level: We found that education level did not significantly affect a person’s answer (p = 0.10). When we compared the percentages of positive responses and negative response across the bars, they stayed relatively the same for each education level.
Figure 7: Do political affiliations affect how people perceive synthetic biology? The bars represent different political affiliations and each color represents a different feeling about synthetic biology, where the more positive feelings are towards the bottom of the bar and the more negative feelings are towards the top.
Political Affiliation: We found no correlation between people’s political leanings and their view of synthetic biology. Our analysis comparing the percentages of positive responses and negative responses resulted in a p-value of 0.8.
Altogether, there appears to not be a significant impact of education level and political affiliation on the survey responses.
Multiple Regression Analysis
We continued our analysis by conducting a multiple regression analysis, to test the impact of several factors on a person’s understanding of synthetic biology. Our results are shown below.
Our regression analysis suggests that there is no significant correlation between any one individual variable and the perceived potential of synthetic biology. However, by considering all variables simultaneously, we observe a significant correlation (F = 1.23E-10). This has important implications. In order to encourage the population to support and make informed judgments on synthetic biology, we must address multiple factors simultaneously.
We also determined the degree to which our independent variables were correlated with each other:
Our results reveal that most of our independent variables are not strongly correlated in a pairwise manner, which bolsters the statistical strength of our multiple regression. The two variables that have significant pairwise correlation are perceived understanding of synthetic biology and perceived understanding of genetically modified organisms. This is reasonable, given that genetically modified organisms are deeply tied to synthetic biology.
Accounting for Error
We acknowledge that multiple biases that may have influenced our statistical results. First, there is some degree of convenience sampling. For the Stony Brook responses, the majority of responses came from college students who identify as politically liberal. This skewed the data, since college students do not represent the general population. We also recognize the existence of reporting bias, which may be especially significant in the current political climate. It is likely that those who align with conservative policies are less likely to reply out of perception that manipulation of genomic information is associated with more liberal policies"

UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB
We established a collaboration with the IGEM UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB team , after realizing that our two projects had one component in common: we were both targeting air pollution.
We first organized Skype meetings and discussed through Facebook to improve our projects.
In a second time, we collaborated on our questionnaire. Indeed, we noticed that some of our questions were similar, so we sent the results of our respective polls. We then reflected together on how to analyze these surveys and defined a common method of analyzing these surveys.
We have gone further in the areas of law and entrepreneurship. Thus, we carried out for the Chilean team a study on French regulations and laws concerning air pollution. In return, the Chilean team informed us about Chilean regulations. We used their answers to improve our report on air pollution. Finally, the Chilean team helped us for entrepreneurship by carrying out the SWOT analysis of our device. We also had discussions on the development of a business model in the field of depollution.
Paris_Bettencourt
We had a very fruitful collaboration with Paris_Bettencourt iGEM team. We invited them to take part in the 3rd iGEM Parisian Meetup (see below) we organized in early July. In return, we took part to the great escape game they created. We betatested it and gave them feedback !  It was a wonderful opportunity to enjoy the view from the Montparnasse tower ! We also helped them by providing them with the silicatein biobrick our team designed last year. It was quite a struggle to locate it in our freezers but we are sure they made the best of it !
3rd iGEM Parisian Meetup
We decided to host an event where French teams could have the opportunity to present their project in front of a public and jury, just like at the giant jamboree! The goal of this meeting was threefold: 1) we both wanted to place teams in competition-like conditions; 2) we also wanted to socialize with the French teams and have a great time and 3) we wanted to work together and"

Firstly, we exchanged our impressions about both projects (BactWars and WormBusters). What helped us most was to learn more about the internal organization of their team.                 This summer, we had some problems with our results of the InterLab too and the Uppsala team gave us advice regarding the Interlab. It’s mainly thanks to them that we were able to obtain valid results for the InterLab part.
To thank them for their help, we shared on the social networks their french form about their problematic. Indeed, one of the official languages ​​in Belgium is French. And it allows them to check if their problematic affects only                 their country or if their project could help farmers from other countries.

Collaboration with Laval University (Canada)
We wanted to work with overseas teams for our European Conference. It was important for us to not only work with European teams. So propose to other worldwide teams to organize a                 rediffusion of our event. In this perspective we got in touch the University of Laval. As they were very enthusiastic we planned together the logistic details and talk about some content details. They book a room and invited over 20                 students to watch and interact during our event.
