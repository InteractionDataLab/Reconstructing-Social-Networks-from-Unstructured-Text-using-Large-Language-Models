The spark for our collaboration was the fact that we had an idea for a microfluidic device and the Boston University iGEM team had the expertise to turn that idea into reality. Our initial concept paved the way for the Boston University team to incorporate the role of electronics in microfluidic devices into their narrative.  See the microfluidics page on our wiki for a detailed description of the device.

This year, we decided early on to try and reach out to other iGEM teams who we might be able to help, or could help us. Of particular interest to us was a BioBrick and iGEM-internal system for non-canonical amino acid incorporation, because even until now our pEVOL AzoPhe incorporation plasmid remains something of a black box to us.
We ended up reaching out to and collaborating with Bielefeld-CiBiTec, whose project focused on the development of new non-canonical base pairs to try and expand the genetic code. While we were not ultimately able to test out their new system, we did provide them with some of our ncAA (AzoPhe) and the incorporation plasmid so that they could test it against their own system for ncAA incorporation. We also sent them a number of plasmids from our own project, which they graciously validated in their own lab as working as intended, and also provided us with some beautiful imaging data you can see below.

Coloring book
Scientific research is not always a dull work, it can also an interesting experience that everyone could share. In order to spread the fun and attractiveness of synthetic biology, we designed a coloring book. In this way, synthetic biology drew more attention by showing its fun part, following the idea of combining science and art. To our delight, the public were in favor of color painting and they praised our activity for being a good chance to broaden their horizons. Finally, we collected more than 200 painting works. Most surprisingly, kids loved our coloring book very much. With their creative imagination, they developed interests in synthetic biology and at the same time, gave us much courage and inspiration.
We were inspired by the recently popular coloring book Secret Garden, and we learnt from its design. In our coloring book, we simplified several important scientific items into simple stick figures, including DNA chains, viruses, bacteriophages, bacteria, so that people would understand some basic concepts of synthetic biology by painting them. Drawing itself is relaxing and thought-inspiring, and in the form of drawing, we presented our work and popularized iGEM. Hopefully, this coloring book will be a carrier of the spirit of scientific research and our wish to bring benefits to the world.
We have brought our coloring book to the Giant Jamboree, hoping that all of you could have fun with it and know more about us. We also want to discuss with the organizers of iGEM abut the perspective of publishing the coloring book, so that the spirit of iGEM could be spread out and keep encouraging more iGEMers to devote their talent and passion.

Stop, collaborate and listen!
Collaborating with other teams is a core part of iGEM. We spoke to many different teams, exploring a variety of different possible collaborations, however most of our collaborations involved IDE, a software tool we developed to aid Wiki building.
IDE
We created iGEM Development Environment (IDE) , a tool which allows faster and easier Wiki editing. We shared this tool with the iGEM community and spoke with a lot of teams           who were interested in using IDE. We Skyped many of these teams, explaining how to use IDE as well as gaining valuable feedback. We collaborated with the following teams, who used IDE to help build their Wiki:
•  University of Nottingham
""The IDE was not very difficult to get set up and this was coming from someone who has only just learnt html coding (I have used           python before). Using it was slightly more difficult however this was more due to me having gaps in my knowledge of html coding. With that said, Albert was extremely helpful with helping me use it so I could design our wiki page how we had planned           it. There were a few problems due to the IDE being coded in Linux while I am doing all my editing in Windows but I think these may have been fixed in an updated version of the IDE.
""It helped me by allowing me to test creative ideas,           animations, layouts and much more without editing our actual wiki. This means I was not interfering with what anyone else was doing on our wiki by making big changes to the css files or navigation bar.""
•  Munich
""All in all, the IDE is a helpful tool to develop the wiki faster. The strongest feature of it is how fast changes actually come through.           At least for our team, whenever we changed the code in a template on the iGEM servers, we had to delete the cache to see the changes on pages using the templates, which was bothersome. With the IDE we only had to edit the code, refresh and were           able to immediately see the modifications. That made the implementation of the css files and specially templates for menu and footer easier and more convenient. We also liked the possibility to, at least to a certain extent, work without internet           connection,"

Characterization of Tec Chihuahua’s BioBricks
We characterized Tec Chihuahua’s BioBricks (T7 promoter + RBS) + (epsE) + (T1 terminator), which can be found here as a whole [BBa_K2471002], the individual parts being (BBa_K525998) + (BBa_K143032) + (BBa_B0010). This was a relevant collaboration that will allow the team to report an essential feature of their part. The collaboration developed as follows: On October 15th Tec Chihuahua shipped the BioBrick to us. They shared us protocols to characterized by SDS-PAGE. Once the results were obtained, they were shred with the team for their evaluation and report. The complete protocol including the results can be seen below. Tec Chihuahua Collaborations
STEM Manual
We developed an experiment manual for use with elementary school children alongside iGEM teams Tec Chihuahua and Tec Guadalajara. A complete description of this collaboration including the results can be seen on our Education and Public Engagement tab. In addition to this, we had several smaller collaborations with teams for around the world, which are listed below:

BIT-China,2015," several professors in this field, on which basis they tried various protocols to express, purify and detect NhaA as well as NhaB.
Initially BNU-China did the SDS-PAGE of the whole protein of bacteria, and the result was not as expected. The first time of result is not shown here. To put it in detail, they centrifuged 5 mL bacterium solution under overnight shake culture at 4 °C, 6000 rpm for 10 minutes, which was boiled for 10 minutes, then protein loading buffer was added. Afterwards they did the SDS-PAGE of the mixture with the running gel concentration 12%.
Because the whole cell was too stick, BNU-China couldn’t make an accurate estimation from the result, but anyway there was no sign of expression of the objective proteins whose molecular weight was about 46 kDa. Then they tried a normal SDS-PAGE of the homogenate and supernatant and the result is shown in Fig.6
Fig.6 Normal SDS-PAGE of NhaA and NhaB
Lane 1, molecular weight standards (kDa); Lane 2-4, the homogenate of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB; Lane 5, 6 and 8, the supernatant of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB, Bacteria transformed with plasmid pSB1C3 as a negative control.
The bands were clearer this time, but there was no significant difference between the empty vector plasmid and the transformed ones.
After two times of unsuccessful attempts, BNU-China reviewed some articles of reliable protocols for membrane extraction and detection. With the protocols collected, they processed the experiment the third time(Fig.7).

Bacteria transformed with plasmid pSB1C3 as a negative control.  From this result BNU-China concluded that the differences exist between the bands of controlled plasmid and the experimental ones, whereas it seemed that"
Botchan_Lab_Tokyo,2017," continents. By researching GMM legislations and comparing those legislations between countries, we aimed to understand the depth and diversity of laws, and also the impressions of GMOs in each country and area.  We compared the following 6 contents of GMM legislations.
What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?  The institutional bodies that enforce the laws regarding the use of GMMs differ a lot across the world. In many countries in Asia (Japan, Indonesia, and Korea) and Canada, ministries and departments are responsible for enforcing the laws of GMMs. The kinds of ministries enforcing the laws as well as their numbers vary from country to country, but usually the large organizations are in charge. On the other hand, countries like India, Brazil, the United States, and Australia have more specialized committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.  In the European Union, the European Commission is responsible for enforcing the GMO laws to be followed by all member countries. Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology, but has responsible institutions when commercing or trading.
Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?  We can distinguish two different administrative ways in which countries decided to regulate the use of GMMs. One way government regulate GMMs is by establishing a special, often non-governmental, organisation, which usually also acts as an information center in the field of synthetic biology. The other way involves assigning conventional ministries to regulate the use of GMMs in their respective fields.  The European Union, Australia, and Indonesia belong to the first group. For example, in Australia, Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee takes charge of making decisions on products’ approval. Competent authorities in the European Union and The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety in Indonesia have similar roles.  Brazil, Canada, Chile, Korea, India, Japan and the US belong to the second group, where conventional ministries are responsible for their respective fields. Even though the names of these ministries might differ amongst the countries, it seems to be a more prevalent way to regulate GMO. Additional information centres might be present to help the ministries make decisions, nonetheless.
What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?  The legal requirements in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and India are very similar. All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production. The exact procedures related to obtaining permissions to use GMOs in"

In order to benefit from the situation, we have talked to our physics teachers at school and asked whether we could improve and then borrow the magnets we use at school and lend them to UNAM. After a few days, we have prepared the magnets to help them characterize their parts. The next day, we met in front of our school and lended them the magnets and further discussed the status of our projects. At the moment we are looking forward to our next collaboration and hoping to hear good news from them and their experiments.

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015," the iGEM parts registry we discovered your project, as well as one other project, both of whom attempted to solve the keratin issue. With this research and the exploration of previous iGEM projects, we decided to create a construct that would express a Keratinase enzyme to break down the keratin in the hair and feathers, thus solving the issue.  Because iGEM requires collaboration between teams, we decided to try contact you due to your decision to tackle this problem last year. As much of our project is based on building on, and optimizing previous constructs, we are looking for some more in-depth information concerning the cleaving process, and some issues you tackled there, and how you have dealt with them. We know that Keratinases are difficult to express in E. Coli, due to it getting stuck in the periplasm when expressed, because the Keratinase folds, and because when expressed, the export tag does not always get cleaved properly, so if you could give us any insight upon this, as that is an issue you have faced, that would be appreciated. We have worked with our mentors to optimize the Keratinase cleaving issue, but haven't yet managed to express it, due to problems with our lab work. We think that the cleaving issue should be fixed, but are not sure yet.  We would also like to get some of your current opinions on the issues, if you have any advice for us that could make us more successful at the competition and if you had devised a way in which you would have deployed your construct outside of the lab, if you had been successful. We also were wondering what your plans were for implementation of the biobrick into the real-world, and safety precautions to be taken outside the lab through implementation. We have been thinking bioreactor implementation for wastewater treatment plants, but regarding poultry farms, it is not a very applicable implementation. Looking forward to hearing back from you soon and we understand if you can't answer some of our questions.
Thank you sincerely,  Our Lady Of The Snows Catholic Academy 2015 iGEM Team
Hi Freya (and team),
In regards to the Keratinase results we saw - once we had colonies that we'd confirmed contained the Keratinase via PCR, we went straight to assay via incubation of feathers/nails (grim I know) into cell culture during growth. The paper we'd taken the construct sequence from had a great set of images of feathers being degraded over a period of 24h or a few days. We had no luck there which is why we chose to"

Question 4: The sustainability of the project needs to be improved. Answer: Apply for Entrepreneurship Project in NAU and industrialize this project. With the development of school’s Entrepreneurship Project and financial support, this research can be carried out more consistently. If you can find a company to collaborate with, the project will help the community even more, which will lead to deeper research by teammates.
Question 5: When using drones to monitor whether or not the wheat crop is infected with the virus, it requires a high quality of camera pixels. And the characteristics of the wheat are from a top view, which has a large difference in the picture of the diseased wheat in database.
Answer: Set up automatic cameras on the ground around the wheat field. This change has four advantages: The camera is close to the wheat plant so that the camera pixel required is not high; The picture in the horizontal direction is coincident with the picture in the database, which can improve the accuracy of the recognition;  
3. The plan is continuous monitoring so that the whole wheat growth cycle can be monitored for its disease;
4. Compared with drones, it is more more economical which is very helpful to the industrialization of this project.
 
  
Video-based collaboration:

  1.Background  
  We were connected by Shanghai University of Science and Technology. The lack of teaching materials in the field of bio-safety education in China, the obsolete of the laboratory-safe instructional videos and the disconnection between the content and the actual work of today's laboratories caused us making some educational videos. We aimed to strengthen students' bio-safety awareness and correct students’ operation which do not conform to safety standards. We hope to improve the level of bio-safety education in China and the safety awareness of people with the help of the Yale Laboratory Safety Handbook and other foreign bio-safety education materials.

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015," if they have a working prototype at the giant Jamboree, I personally wish them the best (-Joshua Lamb)
Consort’s Collaboration Write Up for Canmore: Canmore’s project deals primarily with the issue of hair and feather build up in the water treatment systems. This is clearly a major issue and can use extensive amounts of money and time to remedy. There is an extreme amount of inconvenience to unclog the water treatment systems once they get to this point. Creating a BioBrick to produce keratinases could be an effective and cheap solution to the problem and also in preventing the problem. Our concerns for Canmore lie in the prototype and safety. The specific engineering and prototyping of a bioreactor is extremely important. The conditions required to keep the bacteria alive, the amount of  keratinases that would need to be produced and what kind of a time span are all aspects to look into when designing the bioreactor. Their plan to use the membrane bioreactor is a very good and easily applicable idea but the research as to optimum conditions concerning the production of the gene are incredibly important. Having a viable analysis of the cost, time and resources required to make this something we can implement is society is also an important consideration. The time frame of how long it takes to break down the keratin is also something to look into. The comparison of the time requirements to break down other pollutants in the bioreactor chamber compared with the time to break down keratin. Knowing this will allow a design maximizing potential.  Other thoughts for them to consider include: what types of bacteria are already being used in the bioreactor? What are they breaking down? Is there a way to genetically modify bacteria already in use to contain the kera or karus gene? This would eliminate the need to introduce another species and readjust conditions while allowing maximum productivity.  Overall, I believe this project could introduce a valid and much needed solution to the issue of hair build up and could be quite effective, quick and safe. As the bioreactor is not connected to the main water line and is completely contained, contamination of water with E. coli would not be an issue. The proposed prototype also utilizes the current system and technologies used making it as easy as possible for implementation. Canmore has done an excellent job in looking at the practical portions of their project and with more research, their project could do a lot of good in our world. (-Sam Davies)

The phage therapy and bacteriophages are a serious alternative at antibiotics that are less and less efficient against bacterium that is why there are often used in iGEM competition to solve problems. At this occasion, iGEM Grenoble-Alpes worked with two teams, iGEM Nottingham and iGEM LMU & TU Munich .
Collaboration with iGEM Nottingham:
iGEM Nottingham  developped the Clostridium dTOX project. The goal was to use phages to avoid the toxicity of a bacterium which causes diarrheas in hospital sector. iGEM Grenoble-Alpes collaborated with them on the phages/bacteria interaction modeling .
Working with Nottingham on the study of the toxin released by bacteria depending on the strain (C.difficile, C.jejuni), on the initial bacteria and phages quantities and on the analysis delay helped us implementing our own modeling.
Collaboration with iGEM LMU & TU Munich:
We worked with T5 phages and their host E. coli F during our experiments. To help the iGEM team in their Phactory project, we sent them T5 bacteriophages (at around 108 pfu/mL) and freeze-dried E.coli F !

Lund,2017,"cidentally, we had just finished a similar analysis of our project and all parties collectively agreed that we would attempt to model their system. After a few additional skype-sessions and email correspondence, we were provided a clear understanding of the organization of their genetic circuits and we set out to design the set of differential equations. Upon completion, we provided them with a document that presented the differential equations, an explanation of the derivation, the potential limits of the model and friendly suggestions on how to approach the estimation of the conformational rate change constant between the sequestered SD site and unfolded mRNA chain. The document can be found here .
We are very grateful to the 2017 SVCE Chennai iGEM team for introducing us to the exciting world of mRNA regulation and its applicability in translational control and for allowing us to be a part of their iGEM experience.
Technical University of Denmark
The DTU team generously provided us with transformed DH5-ɑ colonies for the InterLab study due to our initial struggle of successfully transforming the competent DH5-ɑ cells acquired from the Department of Biotechnology at Lund University. However, as no fluorescence was detected after overnight inoculation of the colonies as per DTU’s suggestion, we were unfortunately unable to use their samples to gather the necessary data.
Chalmers University of Technology Gothenburg
After discussing our limited success in transforming the competent DH5-ɑ cells that were provided by the Division of Biotechnology at Lund University, Chalmers Gothenburg courteously offered to supply us with enough cells to make a bacterial glycerol stock.

During the process of creating a cohesive strategy on how best to approach the outreach component of our project, we concluded that a public seminar would be a good medium. This would allow us to both communicate the importance of sustainability as well as discuss the seemingly endless applicability of synthetic biology. This would in addition give us an opportunity to open up a dialogue with our local community. Coincidentally, Lund University is celebrating their 350th anniversary this year and offered an impressive range of public lectures throughout the year and upon request, we were allocated a slot. To ensure depths and flavor, we asked Chalmers Gothenburg to co-host the seminar which they readily accepted, much to our delight. Together, we hosted a two-hour long public seminar discussing various topics of synthetic biology. It was well received and we are beyond pleased with"

Duesseldorf (Lab)
The iGEM Team Duesseldorf, that was just founded this year, contacted us, because they were planning to work with yeast and were interested in a vector that we made RFC compatible last year ( BBa_K1680014 ). We had not only this particular vector, but also some sisters of it, as well as some of the pTUM vectors that were generated by Team TU Munich in 2012, in our freezer and were happy to provide them.
By sheer coincidence, two of our members were travelling to Duesseldorf a week after Team Duesseldorf had contacted us, so we could even bring them our collected yeast vectors in person and make sure that they could immediately use them for their experiments.
Our team member Nicolai von Kuegelgen hands over our parts and vectors.
Duesseldorf (Human Practice)
Collaborations are not only useful in Lab environment when the use of specific tools and materials can be shared, but also in Human Practices ideas can be realized much quicker and easier when teams are collaborating. To reach more people about synthetic biology, the iGEM team Duesseldorf approached eight other German iGEM teams, including us, with the idea to design different kinds of postcards which cover specific topics of synthetic biology, especially those that have or may have an influence on our everyday life. This format was excellent for collaboration with many other teams as each team only had to design one postcard, but these postcards reach a much bigger audience as they are distributed among eight iGEM teams all over Germany.
Post cards educate about different interesting topics of Synthetic Biology.
The covered topics are very diverse, from the recombinant production of Insulin to transgenes. All postcards together show the range of possibilities in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Our postcard covers the topic of gene editing (see below) and shows probable applications of genetic engineering today and in the future.
In summary, this collaboration achieves multiple goals of human practices. The series of postcards can educate a broad range of people with"

Westminster & UCL: UK iGEM Meet-Up 2017
Together with The University of Westminster and University College London, we co-hosted the UK iGEM meet-up for 2017, which was a great success!
https://2017.igem.org/Team:UCL/Collaborations https://2017.igem.org/Team:Westminster/Collaborations
Day 1
18/8/17
The first day of the meet began at 10am with team registrations at The University of Westminster. Each of the thirteen teams handed in their posters and then we all introduced ourselves to the other iGEM members over breakfast. Many of us had travelled from far and wide with very early starts, and so coffee was consumed in abundance!
We then heard from different speakers, who gave interesting, insightful and varied talks about different areas within synthetic biology.
After lunch, each group had the opportunity to present their poster and peer-review the other teams. It was fascinating to see such a diverse range of project ideas, conveyed and presented in all sorts of different ways. We can’t speak for the other teams, but for us it was a really useful opportunity to put together a draft poster in preparation for the Jamboree. We were inspired by the other posters and have since altered our layout and design to make it more eye-catching and accessible for readers.
The day ended with an iGEM social event, kindly hosted by Westminster in their SU building.
Day 2
19/8/17
After a well-earned rest, we all assembled at UCL in time for a morning of debating! Each team was split up and their members mixed with other iGEMers. These smaller teams of 4 or 5, were then given contentious ethical issues linked to the field of synthetic biology. We were given some time to prepare arguments either for or against the topic in question, before embarking in heated debates! The topics chosen by UCL made us all take a step back and really think about the ethics and safety of the field, which in turn helped enormously when we came to look at our own Human Practices.
After lunch, everyone travelled across the Thames to meet at the iconic tallest building in the UK"
BIT-China,2016," our model.
After constructing the primary model, we met some difficulties in proving the accuracy of these equations, as well as simulating these equations by software. Some members of Jilin_China majored in physics, math, computer science and chemistry, they were familiar with solving these problems and kindly provided us with much useful advice.

We provided them with the condition and equations of each stage of chemical reactions. They added some chemical reactions to improve our model and got the analytic solutions of the linearized equations.

Korea_U_Seoul,2016,"odul which didn’t have much lab experiences before.
More than filling the requirements and essential preparations, we could deeply communicate about difficulties in running such a big project by our own as a student. Especially in the sense of handling a whole project, we discussed about how Korea_U_Seoul is dealing with our own team management and organization. Dividing team into smaller groups and having weekly communication session where each group exchange their group’s progress could harden the teamwork and help Korea_U_Seoul to be a long-lasting team, which was the most important thing in overall.
2. Experimental exchanges
The members of KoreaSonyeodul came to our lab to look around and have a meeting with our PI. They consulted us about their project, and we helped them to schedule their experiments. Since they did not have their own lab, they shared the lab with us. They never had any experience with lab work such as cloning, so we taught them how things are done. We taught and helped with their part cloning(Restriction enzyme cloning) and LIC cloning. We also helped the with their part registration and submission.

Collaborations
To fulfill the silver medal requirement, we collaborated with the Texas Tech and Rice iGEM teams. We reached out to discuss ways in which all parties involved could cooperate and assist each other in order to enhance each team project.
In the spirit of collaboration, the UT Austin team reached out to both Rice and Texas Tech to formally invite both teams to participate in the University of Texas 2017 Fall Research Undergraduate Symposium. Upon this invitation, each team began electronically communicating with one another in order to brainstorm ways in which collaboration could benefit and improve each of the team projects.
On September 23, 2017, iGEM teams from Texas Tech University, Rice University, and the University of Texas met at the Undergraduate Research Symposium in Austin, Texas.  Here, each team formally presented their projects to an audience and panel of judges as part of the program. Andrew Ly, Milki Negeri, and Andrea Martinez presented on behalf of the University of Texas, while Catherine Dunway and Darron Tharp presented for Rice University and Texas Tech University, respectively. After the symposium presentations concluded, all teams met to discuss specific collaboration details and provide feedback to one another. As a relatively new team, Texas Tech received extensive constructive criticism from us because we have more overall experience participating in the iGEM competition and completing the requirements. Texas Tech presented a draft of the initial PowerPoint presentation they were planning to showcase at the iGEM Jamboree. Darron Tharp, newcomer to the Texas Tech team and the iGEM competition, was the main presenter. Tharp showcased the research slides in their entirety, and afterwards, we critiqued each slide to help improve content, formatting, and presentation technique utilized. Texas Tech asked several questions about the jamboree  itself that we clarified to the best of our ability. This series of feedback with the presentation was repeated with team Rice. After we critiqued Rice's and Tech's presentations and vice versa, the joint effort was continued by discussing a more direct means of collaborating.
At the meetup, a GroupMe chat was created with the student leaders from all teams. This was the main source of communication throughout the weeks ahead.  We collaborated with Rice for our modeling. Eve"

ARCHAEAL COLLABORATION STUDY: HOW WE DID IT
STEP ONE: THE IDEA
We were interested in signing up for the E. Coli. collaboration study earlier this year, but were disappoint to learn that our archaeal study could not contribute to the Interlab’s framework. This led to our idea to create a new InterLab study of our own utilizing our labs methanococcus mCherry stocks.
STEP TWO: INITIAL PROPOSAL
Since early 2015, the University of Georgia iGEM team has been working on establishing a sound, effective, and universal protocol and logistics system to circulate mCherry samples on a largescale circuit for fluorescence measurements. We decided to contact iGEM headquarters officially early June 2015 with a formal proposal to motion for a new Archaeal InterLab study modeled after the current E. coli InterLab administered by iGEM. We suggested that we send out our own collection of mCherry protein extracts from our methanococcus experiments. iGEM Headquarters and the Measurement Division advised us to pursue a sort of ‘pilot’ InterLab, which we began calling the Archaeal Collaboration Study.
STEP 3: PREPERATION
After a few weeks of carefully refining our proposal, gaining proper clearance from the biosafety office, developing the shipment system, creating registration and data input forms, and creating a universal protocol for measuring mCherry protein florescence, we were ready to contact an assortment of iGEM research teams across the United States gauging general interest in our collaboration study.
STEP 4: GAUGE INTEREST
An assortment of teams across the United States were contacted with our proposal and an invitation to join the collaboration effort. We were truly inspired by the level of interest we received from the feedback and began to slowly build up the network of participating teams we have today. Slowly but surely, we built up a network of 9 participating teams: University of Georgia, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stony Brook University, University of California at San Francisco, Carnegie Mellon University, College of William & Mary, Genspace, Columbia University, and Vanderbilt University. We can’t thank our participating teams enough for their support and efforts toward our study.

Participating at iGEM Meetups
To integrate ourselves into the iGEM Community and exchange ideas to the point where laboratory work and art intertwine, we visited the german national iGEM meet-up in Marburg. The Marburg iGEM Team did a great job in organizing the symposium, and we lived through the weekend, to tell the tale of barbeques, pub rallies, inspiring conversations, great scientific talks and bubble soccer.
Laboratory Collaborations
Working together with iGEM Toulouse, we created biology tutorial videos with protocols for standard practices in molecular biology (such as ligation, digestion and restriction), for future iGEM teams and other interested parties.   We also joined forces with iGEM Sydney, who are developing an ethylene biosensor to measure ripeness in produce. We developed and designed a 3D printed reaction chamber for their glowing sticker, making it easier for workers to detect reporter expression via smartphone. They in turn designed a prototype app for statistical diagnosis by comparing fluorescence levels in the microreactors of our microfluidic device.The collaboration extended to exchanging data for molecular mathematic modelling from our reporter signalling pathway, from the biosensor affinities to the EnvZ-Kinase activating OmpR and the subsequent activation of GFP reporter expression.

Mutual Help
Although some unexpected difficulties arose in the course of our experiment, mutual help among teams can help us get through. We got help from other iGEM teams and professors and overcame the difficulties, we also gave a helping hand to iGEM teams in need of our assistance.
We were extremely fortunate to become friends with the Xiamen University (XMU) iGEM team, they were very generous and gave us plasmids E0020,E0040 and E0010 which we were looking for in our previous preparatory project.
This is Shandong University (SDU) 's first time to participate in iGEM, and Tongji has already participated in 3 years. We shared information on team management，the iGEM requirements and what iGEM really is. In the process we became very good friends.
This year SDU's project focuses on the treatment of tumors by replacing the mutated p53. The 2016 Tongji iGEM team also focused on cancer therapy with some parts containing p53. Therefore SDU team asked us for BBa_K1922003(wt p53) and BBa_K1922006(htERT-p53) for their experiments. We shared what we know and our experiences using p53 in experiments. We sent two samples fugw vector and htERT-GFP plasmid containing htERT promoter in them.
We checked the samples carefully and wrote instructions in order to make their work easier. Some of the information are as follows:

TEC-Chihuahua
The iGEM TEC-Chihuahua team in Mexico has also been working on a project to help save honeybees this year. Though our teams are working on different threats to bees, we saw our common goal as an awesome chance to work together, and reached out to TEC-Chihuahua early in the iGEM season. We shared our first abstract with TEC-Chihuahua, and stayed up to date on their project and goals throughout the season.
In our communication with TEC-Chihuahua, we shared that we were working with live bees in our project. As their team was not keeping bees, our access to bees and the knowledge we gained from working with them became a valuable asset that we could share to help with their project. One question that TEC-Chihuahua had not been able to figure out on their own was how long it would take for a bee to secrete a substance it was fed. Because of the use of bees in our project, our team had made an effort to learn about the care and physiology of bees, and built connections with a bee researcher at our institution, Courtney McInnis. We used our resources to find an answer to TEC-Chihuahua’s question, and were able to send them information drawn from Courtney’s first hand experience. The information we sent to the TEC-Chihuahua team will be used to determine the path of nanocapsules fed to bees at different timepoints.
OLS Canmore Canada
We also collaborated with a local high school team from Our Lady of Snows High School in Canmore. One of our team members is an alumnus of the OLS high school team, so we connected with them to learn about their project and see if there was any way we could help. We were able to meet with them in person at the aGEM provincial meet up hosted at the University of Calgary in September, and learned more about what they working on and how we could be involved. Their team told us they were having trouble determining what direction to take an ethical evaluation of their project. UAlberta team members had an in person brainstorm with the Canmore team at the meet up to share our knowledge and experience of ethics based on what they said they needed. We shared"

Numerical Simulation
Due to time constraints, we were not able to measure some parameters in experiments. However, since we are primarily interested in the qualitative dynamics of the system, the estimations in the above table can still provide reasonable conditions for our simulation.
We ran a numerical simulation of the differential equations using MATLAB for a time period of 100 hours. The simulation results are as follows.
Figure 1 The simulation result of $c_{m,eq}$, the concentration of heavy metal ions
Figure 2 The simulation result of $c_{p,eq}$, the concentration of proteins
Figure 3 The simulation result of $c_{h,eq}$, the concentration of hydrogen ions
Figure 4 The simulation result of $m$, the population density of PSB
We can see a steady drop of heavy metal ion concentration which drops to more than half of its initial value over less than 5 days, which confirms the plausibility of FAFU’s design.
There are also some other interesting points in the graphs. We can see an almost constant decrease of pH from about 7 to about 5 in 100 hours, which shows the PSB’s ability to improve the soil conditions. Changing the pH also affects the population density of PSB. As pH goes below the optimum value 6, $m$ begins to decrease, making $c_{p,eq}$ decrease along with it.
Conclusion
Our model gave a schematic description of the dynamics of FAFU’s design in real-life application. The results confirmed the feasibility of their work.
Furthermore, the framework provided above can be used in further analysis. With some modifications, the model can also be used to simulate the case where secreted proteins are used instead of displayed ones, and where the original PSB (without the specifically designed proteins) instead of engineered PSB is used. Comparing these results can help guide future efforts in experiment and application.
BNU:Protein Structure
Our fellow collaborators at FAFU asked us to analyze the tertiary structure of some of the proteins they are using with their sequences. We used Swiss model to predict their structures and obtained the following pictures.

VIT_Vellore,2018," also gave us the opportunity to get various problems troubleshooted and get a whole             new perspective from iGEMers who are facing the same problems as us. The meet-up was             not only all work though. It also provided a much-needed fun break from the monotonous             everyday life in college and lab.
Aided with Mathematical Modelling
We collaborated with IISER Mohali when we had difficulty figuring out the various                 simulations for the synthetic modelling of circuits for our project. The team helped us with                 the mathematical codes for MATLAB software and we were able to successfully finished the                 mathematical modelling of our genetic circuit with their generous help.
Trying out BBrickIt!
iGEM VIT collaborated with the iGEM team from ICT-Mumbai. The collab consisted mainly                 of us trying out their debutant software BBrickIt! which eases the process of Biobricking                 gene sequences among other things, and providing feedback on problems faced by us, and the                 flaws and highlights of the software as observed by us.
According to our team, the software could also include certain features like the 3A assembly simulation, have the facility to explain what RFC [10] standards are and maybe even add a                 function that can be used for Directional cloning. All these suggestions were conveyed to the                 team."

-Modeling collaboration-
Our team collaborated with iGEM 2016 team Tokyo_Tech(Tokyo Institute of Technology).
We requested help from them to create a mathematical model for our project. We felt so thankful to our collaborator for bring such strong contribution to our project.
In our project, we planned on increasing the production of Bacterial Cellulose (BC) produced by the bacteria A. xylinum. To increase the production of Bacteria Cellulose, we take the cellulose synthesis pathway into account.
Fig 1. Cellulose synthesis pathway of Acetobacter  Based on the mechanisms of this pathway,
We planned to increase the amount of the production of cellulose by decreasing the amount of G6PDH and PGI enzymes by using the antisense method.  In order to create a mathematical model for our project, team Tokyo_Tech took the principal reactions taking place in this production into account.
When antisense genes are expressed, an mRNA molecule is produced that is a mirror image of the targeted gene. The two, opposite mRNAs bind to one another, disrupting their function and making protein synthesis impossible. In effect, the targeted gene is blocked and transcription is prevented.
Therefore, we are using the antisense method to prevent the production of the enzymes G6PD and PGI. So, by representing the binding of the antisense mRNA to the nucleotide sequence with a Hill equation, they got the equation below.
Where αn,Kn and nn are constants from the Hill equation, And the concentration of the mRNA depends on the conditions of the experiment.
After applying the mathematical model above, they got the following graphs.
(a) Concentrations without applying the antisense method
(b) Concentration while inhibiting G6PD enzyme
(c) Concentrations inhibiting PGI enzyme
(d) Concentrations inhibiting both G6PD and PGI enzymes
(e) Concentrations strongly inhibiting both enzymes
The graph above shows that the more we inhibit the enzymes G6PD and PGI, the more the production of BC increases. Therefore, we can assume this model is correct. However, we cannot assume that this is the most appropriate result since it has not been corroborated with the experiments.
At last, we would like to thank our collaborator (Tokyo_Tech) once again for"
WashU_StLouis,2018," to a collaboration session, we watched a seminar focused on constructing the wiki from which we gained advice on making the provided iGEM template unique to our team. During the collaboration session, we presented our project and listened to presentations from other teams. An important question posed to our team was regarding how we planned to dispose of our polystyrene discs. As a result of the question, we decided to reach out to other teams working with polystyrene degradation to propose a solution to the waste and contact professionals who work with non degradable waste. One project that made us reconsider our project design was focused on different methods of modelling. It helped us define our roadmap for kinetic modelling and design the direction of our experiment from our modelling efforts. We decided to expand beyond traditional kinetic models to include spore travel and expand the scope of our project data.
iGEM Midwest Meet Up with University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
On August 17th, some of our team members attended the iGEM Midwest Meet Up at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The University of Illinois's iGEM team gave us a tour of their campus, buildings, and lab facilities. Their PI presented about his research in synthetic biology, and we each gave our presentations as well. After our presentations, we recognized that our teams were using very similar plasmids for work in S. cerevisiae. At the time, our team was having issues with our PCR primer design for our plasmid (pRS424), which the University of Illinois's team helped us to fix. We compared protocols and tips, particularly for competent cell transformations, and our team recommended several opportunities for fundraising and discounted supplies. Their team also tried to help us acquire the S. cerevisiae EBY100 strain, but because of material transfer issues and issues growing the strain, was ultimately not able to provide it to us (however, we greatly appreciate the effort!)."
Evry_Paris-Saclay,2017," developed a biosensor production platform this year. Their system is aimed at characterizing biosensor-based screening systems and to generating variants in terms of reporter genes, promotors and sensitivity tuning. To test their platform, they needed to be provided a functional biosensor based screening system ( See their work on the iGEM Newcastle Wiki and the result here ).
We, the iGEM Evry Paris-Saclay team developed a biosensor-based screening system, so we got in touch with iGEM Newcastle and sent them our one of our biosensor, composed of PsiR transcription factor from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and a synthetic promoter we engineered, pPsiTac2 ( BBa_K2448050 ), derived from pTacI ( BBa_K864400 ). Sensynova has been able to generate variants with signal amplification properties, fine tuner modules as well as different colour outputs.
iGEM UPMC Paris (HP/HP)
We were contacted by the iGEM UPMC Paris team whose project was to provide developing countries with access to healthcare through their project called the BioMaker Factory. A software able to produce fragments of antibodies in Bacteria to develop therapies for multiple diseases. This time again, our lawyers were needed to dissect legal issues around the development and distribution of such a project. Diversity of our annual team helped to provide multiple service and develop every aspect of a project development from the design to its placing on the market and this was very enjoyed by other teams and in particular iGEM TU Delft that contacted our photographer to be provided pictures of the event ( See details on our Education & Public Engagement page ).
In return, we worked alongside iGEM UPMC Paris to the framing of practical work in a scientific course in Montrouge High School in Paris. Through our experience students could see what students in biology can actually do. We helped them to observe the relation between genotype and phenotype with Ade2- yeast strain that turns from red to white by UV exposure mutagenesis ( See details on our Education & Public Engagement page ). Setting the protocol and making it understandable for students was a great exercise. Scientists have to find simple ways to present complex ideas they find in their research to ease the understanding of complex phenomenon. This experience allowed us to practice simple and effective scientific mediation. Presenting iGEM was the conclusion of this meeting with students pushing them to explore and go beyond their abilities to grow and evolve. Students enthousiasm was the best reward we could expect. Even today, they ask us for questions around Biology to learn more about it.

The Tufts iGEM team worked together with a number of other iGEM teams this summer, building connections and helping to bring all of our projects closer to our goals.  Tufts iGEM worked with many other teams from the New England area for each NEGEM meetup, giving feedback and constructive criticism for other projects, presentations, wikis, and outreach work.  One of our suggestions  for the Boston University team’s project, specifically that they apply their protein control system to gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9, actually became a whole new direction for their project!
We were also able to put University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in contact with a number of experts in the field of bacteriophage engineering.  Their project involves the genetic manipulation of bacteriophage in order to create a therapy for H. pylori infections.  Having previously worked on a project that involved an engineered phagemid system, and having held a conference last year titled The Future of Phage and Synthetic Biology, we had experience and connections we were able to share with the Umass Dartmouth Team.  We put them in contact with the PI, as well as postdocs and PhD candidates, for a lab working on bacteriophage engineering; a professor who worked on bacteriophage genomics (and who discovered the CRIPSR/Cas system within a bacteriophage); individuals from a company (Sample6) working on bacteriophage engineering; a Harvard law professor with expertise in the healthcare system, and finally a scientific journalist who had written a book on the history of bacteriophage therapy.   We also spoke with the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth team about the difficulties that can arise from bacteriophage engineering, namely that phage in general must be very optimized and streamlined to survive and proliferate, and thus extensive modifications, or large additions often pose a tremendous selective burden on the phage.  Thus, making lasting modifications to phage populations can be difficult unless you build a very precisely controlled environment in which to grow them.  We also spoke with the team regarding the ethical and safety implications regarding the engineering of bacteriophage.

UNSW_Australia,2018," just beginning their project, we gave them advice surrounding the more challenging aspects of group laboratory work and iGEM requirements. We then continued to support each other through meet-ups and Facebook Messenger group chats, and both teams agreed to inform each other of any funding opportunities that we discovered.
Our major collaboration with Macquarie was hosting a meet-up as part of running our well- attended symposium ‘Challenges for Synthetic Biology in the Australian Innovation Landscape’. We invited Macquarie to present their project for 10 minutes at the beginning of the evening as well, in order to practice their presentation skills, which they did. It also gave both teams an opportunity to get feedback on their presentation, and speak to industry and academic experts for further extension of the human practices requirements. Matthew Kearnes, one of the panellists, gave specific ideas and feedback to both teams about how they might incorporate philosophy and ethics into their human practices. Through our symposium, Macquarie were also able to introduce themselves to one of the panelitst, Hugh Goold, who they later went on to interview for their human practices.
Macquarie have also supported us in the lab, providing us with two of the transformed cell lines for the InterLab study (with BioBrick Parts 2L and 2N) due to technical issues on our end with our transformations. We also offered them help with the modelling of their project.
Towards the end of the competition, Macquarie asked if we could perform Confocal Microscopy for their project. Unfortunately, after looking into the facilities at our university our mentors and supervisors with experience using the equipment advised us that the required training to operate the equipment would take time both teams didn’t have.
ZJU China
Skype Call
Our team also spoke to the ZJU team over Skype on the 25th of July, after contacting them because we noticed the similarities in our projects. ZJU are also developing a scaffold which uses a Tag/Catcher system.
Our team sent ZJU the FASTA sequence files of our alpha and beta prefoldin proteins with attached Spy and Snoop catchers, and they sent us back sequence files for SdyTag/SdyCatcher, SpyTag/SpyCatcher, and SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher systems.
Our teams also agreed to collaborate by sharing relevant purification and Tag/Catcher protocols and discussing the use of these Tag/Catcher systems. We also discussed possibly sending our scaffolds to each other, but this was not possible due to the strict Australian biosecurity regime. Lastly, we shared suggestions for increasing expression activity in our similar"
WPI-Worcester,2015,"a_J23117 plasmid and two separate strains with the curli bacteria transformed with two separate antifreeze protein plasmids developed by WPI (TiAFP and BclA). The plate reader results can be seen below. The loading order in the wells was:
A1 - A4) delta B
B1 - B4) WT CsgA
C1 - C4) Curli #1 BBa_J23117
D1 - D2 and D4) Curli #2 BclA-TiAFP (D3 was left out due to a loading error and likely became contaminated

The Harvard results indicated that on average there was more biofilm formation on the positive control (WT CsgA in row B) than on the curli bacteria strains that had been transformed with the antifreeze protein plasmids developed by WPI (rows D and E), while there was also greater average biofilm formation in the positive control than in the negative control (delta FimB in row A), both of which we expected to see. Repetitions of the assay will have to be done in the future to verify our results."

Biosafety education video in Chinese
Biosafety is one of the most important issues everyone should be aware of before starting any biology related experiments.  However, the biosafety education in China is far behind the fast development of modern biological research.  In some places, students are not trained properly because of the outdated education material or the language barrier that prevent them from reading biosafety guidelines written in English.
We’ve participated in an intercollegiate collaborating project to produce a series of biosafety education movies, all in Chinese.  This video collection has been uploaded online and is freely available at our homepage on YouTube and Bilibili , a popular Chinese video-sharing website.

1 SFLS
We met the Shenzhen Foreign Language School IGEM team at the Shenzhen IGEMers meet-up and presented our projects to each other. Both teams applied CRISPR system in the projects, so we contacted the SFLS team and hoped to receive some insights on how to model our project. The modeling process was arduous, but we helped each other out and got satisfying results. At times, their projects were facing a crucial problem of off-target effects, and after comparing several articles on predicting off-target effects in mathematical ways, we recommended them a better method named ""Cutting Frequency Determination (CFD) scoring method"" to help improve their model. We also supported their modeling group by introducing biological theory to the math-work members. In addition to modeling, we also engaged with them on safety and integrated human practice. We shot a BSL videos: SFLS provided the Chinese scripts and edited the videos while BGIC-Union provided the English scripts and resources for the content of the footage. The video was posted on bilibili .The SFLS team also kindly offered us the chance to join them in the several lectures educating high school and primary school students on synthetic biology, cancer and CRISPR, and was able to present our project to more promising teenagers that may become future IGEMers and contribute to the synthetic biology community. See human practice session for more info.
We appreciated the responsible and capable members from Shenzhen Foreign Language School () and the constructive help they offered very much. And we were glad to be able to help them with uploading the wiki and answered some questions on the details of the competition such as poster design and plasmids drying and delivering.

Franconia,2017," at the Germany-wide and European Meet-Up as well as posted a collaboration request on the official iGEM Collaboration Side looking for other teams that could translate the basic set of cards and rules to other languages or create new cards for the set. Luckily, many teams got in touch with us wanting to contribute to this project. So first of all, we want to thank all of these teams for making these collaborations possible and the game very versatile. We think, that every single one of these collaborations was very pleasant because we could not only broaden our and the game’s horizon, but also received a lot of feedback on the concept and implementation of the game as well as suggestions for improvement.
Our card game was translated into many languages.
The following teams had a part in the development of our card game:
Team Peshawar:
The team from Peshawar contributed the card “Treponema pallidium” to the English basic set of cards. This was a very good addition, because it causes a very severe and still wide spread disease. Thank you!
Team Cologne-Duesseldorf:
The team Cologne-Duesseldorf made a great effort and translated the game into five different languages, which is amazing and for which we are very thankful. Adding Greek, Portuguese, German, Hindu and French to the repertoire, they contributed a very broad spectrum of languages. Also, we discussed the card game in a skype session, receiving different suggestions for improvement.
Team GIFU:
Team GIFU from Japan helped us improve the card game with very constructive suggestions regarding the execution. They also translated the basic set of cards to Japanese, whereby they adapted the concept of the game to common Japanese games. We think that this is very helpful, because it enhances the playing experience by making the rules and the procedure of the game easier to understand. Therefore, thank you!        Download the card game in Japanese here!
Team Eindhoven:
As Eindhoven is located in the Netherlands, the team Eindhoven collaborated with us in translating the game into their national language Dutch. So now every German can play our game with our Dutch neighbours. Thank you, Team Eindhoven!        Download the card game and the rules in Dutch
Team NYMU-Taipei:
The iGEM team from NYMU in Taipei translated the basic set of cards to Traditional Chinese. Chinese is the language with the most native speakers on the globe, making this translation a real enhancement for our card game. Thank you!        Download the card game in traditional Chinese !

The Ontario Genetically Engineered Machine Network (oGEM)
Queen’s Canada attended the annual oGEM meeting hosted by the McMaster University. We had the pleasure    of being in the company of iGEM teams from the Universities of Toronto, Guelph, Waterloo, Brock,    Ottawa, and Western Ontario. McMaster iGEM Team directed the conversation on the awareness and    challenges faced by the synthetic biology community in Canada. The lack of self and social awareness    in the community was thought to be caused by the fact that synthetic biology is indeed an    interdisciplinary subject and it requires expertise in all branches of science and engineering.    It is quite difficult for such a large multidisciplinary group to recognize themselves, and other    members as one of their own, leading to the absence of communication and combined resources. On top    of that, as a newly emerging field of study, synthetic biology has yet to be clearly defined. The    general public might have the foggiest idea what this community aims to achieve, and misconceptions    about genetic engineering continue to cause fear and resistance in the society. The rest of the    conversation was dedicated to devising solutions to these challenges. Firstly, it is important that    the synthetic biology community finds a suitable definition"
UAlberta,2017," to pose a health or safety risk to consumers, in which case full disclosure of GMOs is mandatory. The Brazilian government, which has until now required companies to label transgenic products with a T symbol, is (as of 2017) currently considering removing this law. Chilean government might be a notable exception as it prohibits the introduction into the market of any products containing GMOs.
In contrast, most of Europe, Asia and Oceania have strict guidelines surrounding labelling of GMO products. The European Union, Australia, India and Indonesia all require the packaging of such products to be bear the label “this product contains genetically modified organisms”, although exceptions do exist in the form of medical products (in the European Union) and foods produced by animals fed with GMO foods (in Australia). Japan and Korea follow a percentage scale, with GMO labelling required if a product contains more than 5% and 1% genetically-modified ingredients respectively.
6. What are the most important documents related to GMMs?
The documents related to GMM concern a wide range of issues like Manufacturing, Transportation, Safety, Environment, Health, etc.
When it comes to Biosafety, places like European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea, India, and Indonesia clearly have got laws and regulations concerning biosafety and documents are supposed to be submitted in this regard. US and Canada do not seem to have any separate regulation regarding biosafety. However, in the US, Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology (1986) ensures the safety of the public.
For GMMs products (food, drugs, cosmetics etc.), places like the European Union, United state, India, and Canada have a policy and law for the use and regulation of GMM products. To use GMM products in these countries, the government formalities should be done before use, as stated in their laws and policies. In Brazil, there is a registry for biological products. In Japan and Korea there is no such law for GMM products. In Indonesia, supplementary documents must be submitted to use GMM biological foods and products. In Australia, there is no such law for GMM products.
In terms of international trade (export, import), countries like the United States, India, and Korea have clear laws detailing the procedures. They have taken permission and submission of documents to the law regarding this export and import of GMM uses. In European countries, these directly come under the laws of regulations of GMMs. There seem to be no specific laws regulating international GMM trade in Australia, Japan, Korea and Canada.

      Before the iSWU meet-up, team “SiCAU-China”,                                     a new iGEM team, contacted with us for some parts in 2016 DNA distribution to                                     prepare for their preliminary experiments. And we took those plasmids to them at the                                     meetup.
b.LUDOX
      Caused by our carelessness, we put the LUDOX                                     in the -20 degrees centigrade as we did last year, leading to all of LUDOX in 2017                                     kit precipitating. However, we wanted to participate in this year’s InterLab study,                                     which should use LUDOX as materials. Thus, we sought help in the Wechat group of                                     “iSWU”; thankfully, team “SiCAU-China” provided us with LUDOX in their measurement                                     kit immediately, which is vital for us to finish our InterLab study.

a. Project Discussion
      We had video chat with team “Purdue” to                                     introduce our respective projects. In this video chat, their real condition                                     simulation inspired us to do some experiments to simulate growth conditions in the                                     environment of gut.

Madrid-OLM,2018," this was the activity that closed the meet up, since the attending teams had organized to return to their cities after this tour.
Conclusion
It was an event that few people could attend, due to the conditions explained above, but from which the attendees took many advantages. Holding such an event in September could be much more crowded if it was announced from the beginning of the summer and allowed the rest of the teams to organize around it. As it provides a series of very useful tools for the presentation of Boston.
iGEM guide for new teams in Spain
This initiative emerged in the meet up of Marseille with a view to carrying it out in the meet up of Barcelona. In it, we agreed with the team of UPF-CRG-Barcelona organize an activity in their meet up.
Spain is a country with a low participation of teams in iGEM compared to other European countries. We have been the first team that has emerged in the city of Madrid. At the time of forming the team and carrying out all the activities of the contest, we usually find ourselves with a lack of knowledge. To promote the emergence of new teams in our country and facilitate the resolution of the problems they have at the beginning we decided to create a guide. In this guide, the main aspects of iGEM will be collected and explained and a series of tips will be given to face them. These tips would be a sharing of the way this year had each team to deal with them.
With this idea in mind, we presented the collaboration during the meet up to the rest of the teams and they were all happy to help. The participating teams in this collaboration besides ours are:
- UPF-CRG-Barcelona.
- BIO-IQS-Barcelona.
- Navarra BG (High School).
Initially, we have an index of main points of iGEM and we made a brainstorming where each team could contribute their ways of solving these aspects or could suggest new sections. For this part of the activity, a glass of the centre where the meet up was made was used and each participant was free to put the ideas in the section he wanted, writing on the glass.
After the great participation of all members, a large amount of content was collected and recorded. This content served as the basis for information for the drafting of the final guide. With which we hope it will help the teams of years to come and that, thanks to the availability of this guide, will emerge in more cities.
The final guide can be downloaded at the following link

Track: Environment
Our project is tackling two environmental problems: eutrophication and phosphorus reserves depletion. We have designed bacteria which can accumulate phosphorus from water, thus killing two birds with one stone.
As part of our Integrated Human Practices, we have created a business model for our project. This document helped us to decide where our potential business could be most easily set up from a legal point of view.
Virginia Team
Track: Environment
Our project focused on improving the wastewater treatment process through uniting the functions of nitrification and denitrification in a single chassis. This system is more energy-efficient as less water oxygenation is required.
Knowing what legislation within the United States regulates the use of GMOs within the environment and with products such as drinking water is important if we want to make our project usable outside the laboratory.

Tokyo_Tech,2016," PGI enzyme,        (d) Concentrations inhibiting both G6PD and PGI enzymes,        (e) Concentrations strongly inhibiting both enzymes
We can see that the more we inhibit the enzymes G6PD and PGI, the production of BC increases; so we can assume this model is correct. However, we cannot say it is the most appropriate to our case since it has not been corroborated with the experiments. We managed, though, to create the basis for a future more precise model.

4. Developing an application
4-1. Abstract
We developed an Android application based on the suggestion from iGEM 2016 team UT-Tokyo of turning E. coli cultivation and genetic modification into an application so that more people can know about synthetic biology.
4-2. Explanation of the Application
When a player taps the main screen, E. coli in a medium increases. Additionally, the more E. coli increases, the more experience points a player gains, which increases the player’s level. Leveling up also gives the player access to gene ligation techniques.
This application is distributed"

Members from the IIT Delhi and IIT Kharagpur teams came to IISER Pune for a two-day program that turned out to not only be great fun, but also very helpful with all our projects!
Together with the PhD student mentors Manasi Gangan and Neha Khetan, three sessions were held, one for each of the attending teams. The first day began with an introductory session by Dr. Chaitanya Athale, the PI for our team followed by us presenting our project idea “Mycobacterium revelio”. After a question and answer round from all the participants of the meetup (including IIT Delhi and IIT kharagpur teams, students of IISER Pune and faculty members of IISER Pune) the first day came to an end.
IIT Kharagpur started Day 2 with their presentation “Detection of Food Spoilage Using  Quorum Sensing Systems in E. coli ”. After another question and answer round and the much needed lunch break, IIT Delhi presented their project “Eco.coli- A novel pollution crusader      system ”.
These presentations gave us a new perspective of our project and helped us prepare for the Giant Jamboree. The discussions with everyone helped us discuss problems we all were facing in the laboratories and possible solutions. Overall, the meetup gave us inputs on our project and enhanced our presentation skills. We also got an opportunity to interact with other iGEM teams and have a great time!
We collaborated with Paris Saclay team in their safety survey"

Collaboration with Utrecht
The Biotechnology Conference in Utrecht
We first met iGEM-Utrecht at the European meet-up in Munich, where this team already set its mind on the organisation of a conference,      but was still looking for some support. After a short brain-storming it was clear:      We loved the idea of co-organising the conference to give people the possibility to gain insight into different fields of biotechnology      and so we got started with the organisation.
Figure 1: Front page of our flyer for the conference
The responsibilities were split between the two teams of us: iGEM-Utrecht arranged the venue and facilities,      catering and ticket-service, as well as companies for serious networking, while we were responsible for the design of flyers, posters and the powerpoint presentations.
Figure 2: Back page of our flyer for the conference
Together we arranged talks about Single Cell Sequencing by Dr. Mauro Muraro, Metabolic engineering in E. coli to produce PHB from Sucrose by      Dr. Aljoscha Wahl and Dr. Karel Olavarria Gamez, and the construction of artificial kidneys by Dr. Silvia Mihaila.
Co-organising the iGEM Biotechnology Conference with iGEM-Utrecht was a worthwhile experience, as it gave us the      possibility to not only learn how to work together over distances and how to organise an event, but also it was a perfect opportunity      to share our passion for synthetic biology with interested people and to exchange opinions, contacts and ideas.

Being supportive of a newcomer
For a successful project, a critical and objective review of progress and problems is necessary. If it is not possible for a team on its own to find a solution for a specific problem,     then it is probably time to ask the community. Sharing and collaborating is the policy of iGEM.     People"

Collaboration with NTHU_Taiwan
Collaboration with NTHU_Taiwan
As a team composed of members from biology background, we gladly offer help and troubleshoot the problem on making constructs for team NTHU_Taiwan , being insufficient with members from biology department. Since August 3rd, we had several meetings with 2018 iGEM team NTHU_Taiwan.
Earlier before the meeting, NTHU_Taiwan designed the gene of insert for their experiment. After getting the synthesized gene part from IDT and digesting both the inserts and the vectors, they proceeded to ligation, which failed after times               they tried.
We went through details from their design of the gene, cutting site and protocols. Later we concluded that the major reason for failing to make the constructs is due to low concentration of the inserts left following digestion and purification.
We re-designed primers for NTHU_Taiwan and suggested NEBuilder Assembly kit, so that they can avoid the loss of their inserts while digesting and purifying the DNA. The kit requires lower DNA input and can save time by avoiding PCR amplification               steps.
A few weeks later, we were informed that NTHU_Taiwan still failed to make the constructs. Therefore, we provided our lab for their experiments and kept an eye on them through out their experiments to make sure that there’s no man-made technical               false.
Gladly, after several meetup with us and our assistance in lab, team NTHU_Taiwan successfully made all three constructs they needed-- pSB1C3 - AHL snesor - Anti – STAR, pSB1C3 - pLac – STAR, pSB1C3 - pLux – GFP. It was very pleasant experience               to work with NTHU_Taiwan.
Since we urge to seek help in building wiki page, in return, NTHU_Taiwan also give us host a meeting with us teaching coding and giving us tips that help making wiki page easier for us. We took the wiki pages designed by previous teams as examples to learn and practiced basic coding skills(Fig. 1).

Collaboration with other iGEM teams
When doing research every single help can make a difference. Therefore, sharing is caring and iGEM TU Delft Leiden team 2014 believes in this. Below you can find all collaborations we had this year with other iGEM teams:
Wageningen iGEM 2014
The Wageningen iGEM team asked us to characterize 4 of their BioBricks (M1, M4, M5 and M17 according to the nomenclature of their protocol) in order to have a duplo of their own results. To accomplish that"
UAlberta,2017,"ries of Agriculture, Health, Food, Fisheries, Forestry, Environment and many more.
In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a payment of a examination fee that costs 4000 dollars. In the USA, GMO plants are considered equivalent to non-GMO plants and do not require much further approval; only if the plant express a protein that is significantly different from any protein originally expressed, will a respective institution be required to approve of such use. In Chile, on the other hand, it is forbidden to commercialise GMOs as only seed exportation is allowed.
4. As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?
It can be noticed all countries participating in this collaboration, share the standard protocols of good practices in a laboratory, which includes the following:
Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
Identify the level of risk.
Use of necessary safety equipment for each activity.
Maintain the necessary information and supervision with trained personnel.
Maintain an infection prevention protocol and equipment in case of emergency.
Good hygiene of workers.
Special conditions and restrictions on air circulation.
Waste disposal protocols, among others.
In the United States, Australia, Brazil and Indonesia, these protocols for the manipulation of biological agents are all that is required to protect the workers involved. On the other hand, the European Union, Japan and India also require medical records of all workers exposed to biological agents to be kept for a specified period of time. Japan additionally requires the employers to hold medical check-ups every 6 months for the exposed workers. The legislations of EU, Korea, Canada, Chile and India group biological agents according to the risk they might create. These groups, in turn, determine what safety measures are to be taken in each case.
In Korea, Canada and Chile, the facilities must also be located in an isolated or secluded location. Chile only requires it for biosafety levels 3 and 4. Finally, Korea and India require the existence of a decontamination room between the work area and the outside.
5. As a consumer, how do I know if a product I want to buy contains GMO?
The legal requirements for disclosing GMOs within food and other products differ across the world. Some countries within the Americas have little to no laws in place regarding GMO labelling. In the USA, there are no official obligations for companies to label any products containing GMOs. The same applies to Canada, unless the food is likely to pose a health or safety risk to consumers, in which case full disclosure of GMOs is mandatory. The Brazilian government, which has until now required"

Chemically Induced Dimerization of Nanobodies for the Development of Versatile Biosensors
Chemically induced dimerization (CID), in which two proteins dimerize only in the presence of a small molecule, has been widely used to control cell signaling, regulatory, and metabolic pathways, and used as logic gates for biological computation in living mammalian cells. However, few naturally occuring CID systems and their derivatives are currently available. Creating a CID system with desired affinity and specificity for any given small molecule remains an unsolved problem for computational design and other protein engineering approaches. To address this challenge, we have used a novel strategy to select CID binders from a vastly diverse combinatorial nanobody library. We have created new CID systems that can sense cholecalciferol and artemisinin. We are validating CID biosensors by a yeast three-hybrid system and built structural models to understand the small molecule-induced dimerization. Our work is a proof-of-concept that can be generalized to create CID systems for many applications."

UESTC-software,2016," the web and put all necessary contents into HTML files, with related models and views in Python files.
The main work
1. Setup the Web;
2. Fullfill all need in front end;
3. Implement file upload and download function;
4. Turn TMMU’s Matlab software into C to handle input;
5. Implement the parameter passing and result display.
Fig.1.The file tree.
The web app
This web app, Protein Calculator, needs three inputs:
1. Experiment parameters
2. Cnism value
3. Time
The first one is fulfilling our standard file and uploading the experiment parameters, and then TMMU_China’s algorithm can plot a result curve to simulate the growing situation.
Then, users type the specific cnism value and demand time, they can get a specific function curve at this point.
The whole workflow is the combination of 3 modeling:
1. Gene expression model;
2. Colony growth model;
3. Protein diffuse model;
The details of their modeling are in TMMU_China wiki . You can also browse this web app in their modeling part as a symbol of our cooperation.

Future
Cooperation is always the main topic of iGEM. The interface and logrolling can really make a difference in our work progress and the friendship between different teams.
We hope this friendship can live from iGEM2016 to a far future, and hope the web app stemming from this friendship can really help researchers to achieve their purpose easily.
Development of Data-Processing Tool for UESTC-China
Background
This team’s goal was to degrade plastic and produce isobutanol. As a result of the ever increasing serious issues on plastic pollution, greenhouse effect and energy shortage, UESTC-China came up with an idea to try solving these three problems. That was to use genetically modified bacteria to achieve their goal. With their work going on, there was a stumbling block related to data processing simulation.
Fig.3. The experiment of UESTC-China.
Needs
In the course of experiment, there was a stage where team members should complete the drawing of the enzyme activity curve, through which to compare the work effect of each plasmid vector, so as to select the best one. A sea of data made it difficult to finish the data processing by manual method. Owing to the lack of programming ability, they had to use procedural means to solve the problem which took up lots of their time and energy.
So they sought for our support of programming expertise. We carried forward the spirit of collaboration to solve their problems relying"
TU-Eindhoven,2012," also arranged recordings of the day, which were streamed live. They are still available online: presentations part 1 , presentations part 2 .
All in all, the day was an unique experience. It was a first opportunity to test presentation skills and a first chance to set up collaborations. But most importantly, the day warranted a bond between the Dutch iGEM teams. Friendly contact with your competitors can provide perceptive understanding of the competition. Besides, isn’t there a saying about keeping your friends close, but your enemies closer?
Matchmaker NTNU-Trondheim
The NTNU-Trondheim team had an excellent idea this year: a Matchmaker for collaborations. We soon posted two offers on the matchmaker:
The iGEM team of TU Eindhoven offers help with the BioBrickTM characterization. For instance, we can measure the behavior during cultivation, response time, the kinetics of the expressed BioBrickTM and, of course, other ways of characterization can be discussed.
And:
We're going to make you an offer you can't refuse... Only lab geeks in your team? No modeling experience? Getting stuck with all the differential equations needed to describe your problem? Or do you just need a check for the correctness of your model? At Eindhoven University of Technology, the modeling part certainly is not new for us! Contact us!  Programming languages: MATLAB, MATHEMATICA and (if needed) Python and Java
Unfortunately, no one responded to our characterization offer, but two teams responded to our modeling offer. The Queens_Canada team requested help in setting up a model for their project and the Trieste team wanted help in verifying their model.
Offering modelling help - Queens_Canada
The Queens_Canada team contacted us for help in setting up a model for their project. After a few emails, we decided a Skype-meeting would be the most efficient way of discussing a model. The Queens_Canada team had no plans yet for their model, so we gave them input on what they should be able to model and what options they could consider. Their wiki-freeze is a week later than ours, so we have not seen any results of their model at the moment of writing. We hope our suggestions led to some inspiration and that the team was able to create a working model!

The Trieste team contacted us for help with verifying correctness of their model. After a few emails about their project, we raised some questions concerning their differential equations. Soon the deadline approached and we have not seen any model results, but we hope we helped them along and"
UiOslo_Norway,2018," some of our poster suggestions and we got feedback from professors and students from the University of Oslo for both the presentation and the poster. After a helpful feedback session, we organized a seminar with Eline Melteig, who taught us more about public outreach for human practises. Overall, this collaboration was a meaningful learning experience teaching us not only how to improve our projects but also how to have fun while doing it. Both teams agreed that it was a great opportunity to practice presentation skills, learn more about what an academic poster should look like and how to reach out to the public with our projects. Thank you iGEM Tübingen for joining us!
8th-10th of June 2018 Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund, Sweden
Team(s) in the collaboration:
DTU-Denmark, UCopenhagen (University of Cophenhagen, Denmark), Uppsala (Sweden), Linkoping Sweden (Sweden), Stockholm Sweden (Sweden), Lund (Sweden), Chalmers-Gothenburg (Sweden), Aalto-Helsinki (Finland)
In June, we participated on the iGEM Nordic meetup. The conference was perfectly organized by team Lund and we had an opportunity to practice and learn many new skills. We had a chance to present our project in front of a larger audience and also a panel of judges, who provided us with constructive feedback. Later on, we also presented our project poster and were questioned on it both by the other teams and the judges, this enabled us to practice answering quickly unexpected questions and also helped us realise the weak points of our project. During the lecture session with the expert on team building, we learned how give each other constructive feedback and learned more about group dynamics and its progression. In our free time, we participated on scavenger hunt around the city and a gala dinner. During the gala dinner, our project was nominated for the Judges Award. Overall, this was very meaningful collaboration, where we provided and also received many useful tips on how to improve our iGEM project. Thank you iGEM Team Lund.

BostonU Hardware survey
We completed a survey for BostonU Hardware iGEM team regarding the synthetic biology and microfluidics.
Dalhousie survey
We completed a survey for Dalhousie iGEM team to aid in their understanding of the conception of science literacy. Later a brochure will be created to raise awareness of science literacy, the distribution of scientific information, and the validity of such sources.
University of Washington survey
We completed a survey for the University of Washington in order to help them create a global iGEM server for easier communication among the teams.
uOttawa survey
We completed a survey for the University of Ottawa. The purpose of their survey was to gather information on how much people know about what genetic engineering is and what their opinions are on the type of research that's going on in their community. Genetic engineering technology has implications for more people than just those affected by diseases; it has the potential to revolutionize our way of life. However, misconceptions on how its used and misinformation spread much quicker than facts. This is largely due to the lack of communication between the scientific and nonscientific community, leaving the media to bridge that gap.

Ionis_Paris,2016," and “Synthetic Biology: a new economic world”. The aim of these roundtables was to make everyone learn more about Synthetic Biology straight from professionals, along with knowing more about what they could do once the iGEM is over, how they can transform their project into a professional activity. This was also for us the occasion to host professionally an international-class event: we took that in consideration and organized a special VIP cocktail area where we were able to meet them after the roundtables.
We also decided to ask all the teams to come with a poster, and to be able to present their project to everyone. This would be very useful as a training fort the Boston Jamboree, and would allow every European team to meet and discover each other’s projects.
Thanks to the IONIS Education group, we were able to find the perfect place where to host our event. We also managed to get a discount on a local hotel and provide a cheap housing for every team who wanted one. This way, we would be able to host as much teams as possible, in the same place! After sending our invitations, we got a confirmation from 30 teams scattered all around Europe, coming from 11 different countries.
We also wanted this event to be fun for all iGEMers, along with an opportunity for them to discover Paris and the French culture. For this reason, visits and activities in Paris were planned for the second day. We also managed to get a partnership with Paul, allowing everyone to discover French breads and pastries.
The whole event was really amazing all along, whether when we were preparing it (announcing it and receiving messages from people all across Europe was a blast), or when we were living it: we finally got to see all of the teams we have been in contact with, and meeting everyone in such an atmosphere was very exciting!
We also had the occasion to communicate with teams, through communication tools like Twitter and Facebook, and also through a dedicated app the iGEM IONIS team developed: this « companion app » was the perfect road book  a map of the event, a schedule with every major event planned, and even a selection of nearby restaurants and places to eat.
The whole event turned out very well and we received tons of positive feedbacks, which really comforts us in our idea of making it a periodic event. With the Evry Team, we created a common association, called iGEM ESOC (European Symposium Organisation Committee), and are hoping that in next years some teams will choose to organize it again! This structure will aim to provide a frame to the event. This would"

Collaboration with Stony Brook iGEM team
In the beginning of June Stony Brook iGEM team from New York contacted us with an         offer to participate in iGEM Photo a Day Instagram challenge. From our side we shared         interesting photo themes for their challenge! The idea of the collaboration was to share         photos featuring the project idea, supervisors and other images, which would relate to the         corresponding photo descriptions and hashtags. We enjoyed participation in this         collaboration a lot, because it united our team more and we were also happy to share our         iGEM work creatively with the whole Instagram world!
Collaboration with Tec de Monterrey iGEM team
In the beginning of July we got in touch with Tec de Monterrey iGEM team from Mexico         via a video conference and discussed our projects. Tec de Monterrey team kindly agreed         to gather information on sunscreen usage, popularity in Mexico, while we provided them         with information concerning the amount of pollutes in water in Estonia!
Collaboration with Ecuador iGEM team
In July, we also contacted an iGEM team from Ecuador via a video call and discussed         how Ecuador locals protect themselves from the sun and whether they are aware of         commercial sunscreen harmfulness. Furthermore, we exchanged project overviews and         discussed experience in collaborations with other teams. Ecuador team also shared their         experience concerning relationships inside the team, how the work has been distributed,         and gave us useful advices on how to distribute our work most effectively.
We interviewed Ecuador iGEM team members about sunscreen usage in Ecuador. From         the interview it can be concluded, that people in Ecuador are more than supposed to wear         sunscreen, because the UV index is extremely high and sunlight lasts for a long time         during the day. In addition to it being the only tool to protect themselves from the sun,         they are required to wear sunscreen throughout the year.
Most of the population does not know about the harmfulness of the sunscreens to the         environment. However, it is forbidden to use sunscreens in water on Galapagos Islands.
We have also discussed an issue of gene technology field oppression in Ecuador by         GMO-free trend supporting government. That is why we discussed the importance of         organizing seminars, lectures to school children in order for"

ATP Measurements with WashU_StLouis iGEM
Over the past few years iGEM teams from WashU in St Louis have been investigating methods to transfer the nitrogen fixing ability of cyanobacteria Synechocystis into E. coli. This year they are looking at increase electron donor and ATP production with the idea to improve nitrogenase activity. To increase ATP production they wanted to introduce phosphoenolpyruvate kinase (PCK) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) genes to E.coli. From us they wanted some sensitive supplementary analysis of ATP synthesis by their PCK and PGK constructs.
WashU sent us two plasmids to us for test using an ATP-Luciferase Assay with our FLUOROstar Optima luminometer.
We transformed these plasmids to obtain E.coli that contained eith pBAD-PCK or pBAD-PGK and then followed this protocol:
> E.coli were grown o/n. Subcultured 1/10, grown for 2hr before arabinose (at 25mM, 200uM, 1.6uM) was added for 5hr. This was repeated in triplicate.
>Centrifuge cultures, resuspend in 100ul PBS. Add 900uL 0.1M Tris pH7.5, 2mM EDTA. Boil for 5minutes, centrifuge to remove cell debris. Freeze samples.
Luciferase reactions were set up as follows:
>Reaction buffer: 50ul Luciferase, 50ul 600uM luciferin, 50ul sample (containing known [ATP] or 50ul PCK/PGK sample)

We collaborated with Yale on their handout collating information from iGEM teams that have worked with non-model organisms; the handout being meant to guide and offer future iGEM teams considerations they may utilize if they choose to work with non-model organisms. Our 2015 team was contacted by Yale's iGEM team for input as we used Lactococcus lactis as the organism for our project. We also managed to get members from our 2014 team to fill out the survey as they had experience working with  non-model organisms such as Chlamydomonas reinhardti,Chlorella kessleri, and Chlorella vulgaris for their own iGEM project, Clean Green Lipid Machines."
Concordia,2016," school’s community how they felt about a project manipulating cells. And much like us, most members of academic institutions did not have issues with our projects, going as far as calling them cool and innovative. However, asking members of the general public seemed to arise some worries, relating our goals to potential bioterrorism and genetic mutation.
Both of our teams came to an agreement that a grave problem lies in the media, the middleman between science and the common public. The way scientific endeavours are presented by the media and received by the public can help or hinder the trust that people have in any subfield related to biology. iGEM NAWI-Graz’s “The Last Colinator” has potential for future studies in new metabolic pathways and alternatives to antibiotic use. iGEM Concordia’s “Combat Cells” has potential for future studies in bio-nanotechnology and single-cell-to-single-cell interactions on microfluidic chips. Yet, for people without an educational background in biology, the first thought goes to germ warfare, leading to superbugs and a threat to the human race. Even though our team made clear to the public that there are dangers associated with working with nanoparticles (as we’ve addressed in our SOP, LINK HERE), we had to emphasize to people that our work was controlled and disposed of carefully, and there is no chance that our work dangers people outside of the laboratory. For iGEM NAWI-Graz, although their toxin-antitoxin system is a heritable trait, they emphasized that the work is only performed in a lab strain of E. coli that cannot grow outside the lab.
The enlightening ethical discussion with iGEM NAWI-Graz helped Concordia’s iGEM team form a better understanding of topics that biologists do not always care enough to address during their work. It also helped us to shape our SOP in a manner that, we hope, anyone can clearly approach our project in a safe manner.

Experimental Design
Another goal we had set out for our collaboration was to somehow incorporate NAWI-Graz’s toxin-antitoxin battle system into our nanoparticle-coated-cell battle system. After some team brainstorming, we came up with an idea to characterize the efficiency of our nanoparticles protecting E. coli from toxin invasion.  Here is a general layout of the experimental design:
NAWI-Graz had sent us their “Blue plasmid"
Elan_Vital_Korea,2015," but we are familiar with E-coli engineering and sequencing.  When they had questions relating to their project or iGEM, they reached Soojung Lee, and vice versa. We maintained friendly and productive relationship.  As an alum of iGEM, we were happy to share our personal experiences with iGEM.  We could provide meaningful advice on lab techniques, such as making LB broth, cutting DNA, and isolating gene, etc.  Originally, we planned a joint Human Practice activity, but weren’t able to resolve schedule conflicts and time budget issue. We will try again, when opportunity arises.
Regional Meet-up: August 15
We hosted regional meet-up of Korean iGEMers at Lotte Hotel, Seoul on August 15.  It was a great success, and all iGEM teams in Korea attended: Korea University Team, HAFS Team and us as a host.  We are proud that it is the first regional meet-up in Korea, and we hope it will stick as a tradition.  Next year, we hope more iGEM teams will be organized, and come to the regional meet-up for friendship, cooperation and celebration. For the meeting, we have posted the following invitation:
Elan Vital Korea
Combining resources and skills for the benefit of all is nothing new. For centuries, people have been using this formula for success. We generate great power when we share idea as iGEMers. Elan Vital Korea cordially invites Korean igem teams to a dinner gathering on 15th of August. from 5 to 10:00 pm at Athens Garden of Lotte Hotel Seoul. It will start with a press interview at 5:00 pm. For the remaining four hours, teams will exchange exciting summer experiences at the lab and the process of the project, and have fun with chats and inquires. It is a great opportunity to practice presentation and get feedback on their projects. We are sure that after the gathering, all Korean iGEMers will know each other as well as their projects better,filled with joy of sharing igem philosophy together. All Korean teams are most welcomed!! If you are interested, please contact Young Chan Kim by chankim27(at)gmail(dot)com.
We exchanged chats, and shared ideas and opinions with each other over delicious food. Each team was given an opportunity to give a presentation on their project, and Q&A session followed.  Incidentally, all three teams have projects that belong to different tracks, which helped us broaden our horizon and perspectives on diverse ways of exploiting the possibilities opened by the synthetic"
NYMU-Taipei,2017," able to acknowledge the pros and cons of our own project while seeking for possible collaborations. For example, we were able to establish a partnership with National Chang Gung University -- allowing us to collaborate on the presentation brought forth to Wego Billingual High School. Likewise, we also got to know the members of NTHU_Taiwan; they introduced us to NTHU Professor Yang, who taught us how to use photobioreactor to detect algae growth curve.   Still, this conference was extremely valuable not only because we were able to learn from each other, but more importantly due to the fact that we had the privilege to talk and spend time with people of same interests!
Taiwan Conference
On July 17, 2017, we attended the conference hosted by National Chang Gung University. Teams all around Taiwan attended this conference. This was the first iGEM conference we attended, on top of it being the first opportunity we had to meet other teams. We were extremely thrilled to be able to share our project and listen to other teams' projects. We spent the entire day talking to other teams and getting to know their progress. We started off with an icebreaker where teams were asked to describe their project in less than 1 minute. This was a fun activity as it encouraged members to simplify their projects to the basics. In the afternoon, we presented our project and received feedback from the other teams. As a result of the conference, we were able to establish friendships with several teams that we later met at The Asia Pacific iGEM conference. Also, we were able to brainstorm on possible collaborations by getting a glimpse of what each team's project is about; for instance, we learned that National Chang Gung University shares a similar denitrification mechanism as us, eventually, this led to a successful collaboration between the two iGEM teams. This was an important milestone for NYMU-TAIPEI iGEM team because it was our first contact with the public and, overall, we were exhilarated to meet teams from all over Taiwan."

Protocols
Preparation of electrocompetent cells
Introduction
This protocol was provided by the Marburg iGEM team to perform their InterLab study.
Materials

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample."
Manchester,2017," amino acid, fatty acid, minerals, and vitamins) content of the GMMs have to be substantially similar with the non-GMMs, the content of any toxic substance and allergens have to be substantially similar with the non-GMMs, the protein product expressed by the gene need to be non-allergenic.
A. If you use GMMs in an open system (e.g. agriculture use, bioremediation use)
In the use of open system, first, you have to apply for the approval of use regulations with the evaluation sheet of biodiversity influence to Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment. Once you got approval, you can start using GMMs. At the same time, you have to report the results of the information collected after using GMMs. And you will also get site inspections by Ministries written above as well as independent administrative institutions (FAMIC, NARO, NLBC, FRA). As a result, you will get administrative orders and you have to follow these order by re-submitting information or change/annulment of the use regulations.
B. If you use GMMs in closed system (e.g. using GMMs for production of enzymes/catalysts, using GMMs for production of reagents/ industrial materials)
If you use GMMs inside faculties and prevent GMMs to diffuse, first you have to check if the GMM you're using is on the GILSP list. If it is on the list, you have to follow the steps to prevent diffusions that are prescribed and start using GMMs. Then, you have to report using situations and you will get inspections and orders. If the GMM is not on the GILSP list, you have to fill in a diffusion prevention measures sheet and send it to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Once those measures are approved, you will follow the same steps above.
For the usage of the GMOs, an individual has to submit the examination application form for Biosafety, with 4000 dollars of examination fee, to the Ministry that is in charge of the usage. Which means, if you are willing to use the GMOs related to agriculture, it is the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs that you have to submit the application to. The examination of the GMO is done in two different aspects. One is the human body risks and the other is the environmental risks. The Ministry of Korea Centers for Disease Control and prevention proceeds the former test, and Three institutes, including The Ministry of Environment, Rural"

HebrewU / HujiGEM
Purpose of collaboration:
We collaborated with HebrewU in lab work and by hosting the team for a mini-jamboree.
Description:
In addition to our lab work, it was important for our team to contact other teams in the iGEM community.  Our team initially participated in the Synthetic Biology Conference at the Weizmann institute that inspire us to use and develop synthetic biology tools to address unsolved problems. Furthermore, a special session was devoted to the iGEM and we had the chance to hear and talk with previous iGEM team members and judges. We were very excited and encouraged about the achievements of previous iGEM teams. At this conference, we also met the HeberwU iGEM team the additional Israeli team participating in the 2018 iGEM contest. As the HeberwU is the first iGEM team of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem that was initiated by students, we reached out thier team members and help them how to build a iGEM team based on our university's iGEM experience and resources. From this point on, we had a constant and efficient collaboration with the HebrewU team.
We provided reagents, advised on how to organize the team, where to look for funding, and how to prioritize tasks according to the given timetable.  For example, the HebrewU team was unable to complete the Interlab task, as they were missing competent cells for the necessary transformations. We invited the HebrewU team to our lab and a team member was hosted by our team. We taught him\her the relevant protocol, and gave several Eppendorfs filled with competent cells Dh5a, so they were able to complete their Interlab task.
HebrewU organized a wonderful Safety Poem competition, to which we gladly added our submission:
This is not a song about safety, this is a song about love!
It's all started when you first wore your gloves
Small, nitrile, in the color of blue
That’s when I realized - I love you
The way that you said 'always use goggles'
Like warm LB my heart turned into a puddle
It's kinda funny how you read the MSD"

Freiburg,2017," mutagenesis plasmids and plated onto 2xYT (Yeast Extract Tryptone) plates, containing various antibiotics. After 21 hours of incubation at 37°C the number of colonies were counted.
Protocol
Plating of the bacteria onto agar plates containing 100 mM glucose and 34 µg/ml of chloramphenicol.
After 12 hours of incubation at 37°C single colonies were picked and inoculated overnight in 4 ml 2x YT medium (with 200 mM arabinose and 4 µl of 34 mg/ml chloramphenicol) at 37°C for 21 hours. For each E. coli with a different plasmid negative controls were inoculated with 200 mM arabinose instead of glucose.
2x YT agar plates with 100 mM glucose and different antibiotics were prepared:
a. 9 plates with streptomycin (50 µg/ml)
b. 9 plates with carbenicillin (50 µg/ml)
c. 9 plates with kanamycin (30 µg/ml)
d. 9 plates with tetracyclin (10 µg/ml)
e. 9 plates without antibiotics for the negative control
50 µl were plated onto the matching plate undiluted, 10x diluted and 100x diluted, all done in triplicates.
The plates were incubated for 21 hours at 37°C and the number of colonies counted.
The protocol was kindly provided by the Heidelberg iGEM 2017 team.
Results
As expected, we could observe that E. coli gained resistances and grew on almost all of our plates. Only on those containing kanamycin, there could not be any or very few E. coli colonies observed.
Due to the fact that most of our plates were overgrown, we could not see any difference between E. coli containing one of the three plasmids (Tab. 1).
To see the final results, check it out on the homepage of Heidelberg .

Overview
The 2016 Macquarie iGEM team participated in a total of five collaborations with other iGEM teams around the world. These teams include: Paris Bettencourt iGEM Team , for whom we collected two soil samples from a vineyard here in Australia and sent these samples to the team in Paris for their project.  The Pretoria South Africa iGEM Team offered their assistance with the MatLab program, aiding us in the production of an interactive graph for our ALA to chlorophyll a model. We sent the NTU-Singapore iGEM Team our Mg-chelatase operon plasmids and primer designs for each gene for the RT-PCR.  We also purified and characterised their Cas9 mutants of interest. They sent us their Cas9 mutant plasmids after cloning in a His-tag and performed RT-PCR of the genes in our Mg-chelatase operon. Furthermore, we completed surveys for the Virginia iGEM team and Munich United iGEM team to help them with their projects.
Our team also participated in meet up of Australian iGEM teams at Sydney University. All four participating Australian teams attended; Macquarie University, Sydney University, University of New South Wales and Melbourne University. This was a chance to meet the other Australian teams and find out what they had been working on. It also gave all teams an opportunity to practice a preliminary version of their jamboree presentation and receive feedback."

The collaboration with BIT-CHINA
After we met and exchanged ideas with BIT-China during the meeting in Beijing, we confirmed our collaboration relationship. In the light of helping each other, we assisted them for a new gene circuits.
At the same time, they helped us finish the pre experimental the fish experiment.
The LANZHOU iGEM 2016 team consists of 1 graduate students, 14 undergraduate students and 6 instructors. The main part of our project was finished by students from LANZHOU iGEM. We would like to thank our 6 instructors sincerely, for their time and efforts of helping us improve our project. Our work can be divided into 7 parts which are shown below. Each part of work was finished by several student members.
We helped them finish the “another inhibitor” system (arac+pBAD+B0034+TetR+B0015+pTet+B0034+RFP+B0015).(Fig 1)
Fig 1 Inhibitor system construction.
In this system, pBAD is one of the inducible promoter (from BBa_K808000) which can be induced by arabinose. B0034 and B0032 are two kinds of strong ribosome binding sites (RBS) and the strength of B0032 is only 33.96% of B0034. pTet promoter is constitutively ON and repressed by TetR repressor.
We were very glad to help them because this “inhibitor” system is vital for their project. They use the concentration of inhibitor proteins as a signal indicating the plasmid numbers, and it can trigger the downstream reaction by activating the killer gene while the plasmid concentration reduce to the threshold.
At the same time, they helped us finish the pre experimental the fish experiment.
There are three crucial components, INP, GFP, and Metal Catcher (Fig 2). INP (Ice Nucleation Protein) is an extrinsic membrane protein of E.coli and acts as an anchor. GFP acts as a reporter while metal catcher can bind heavy-metal ions. This is how we assemble the crucial elements.
At the same time, they helped us finish the pre experimental the fish experiment.

TUDelft,2017,"eningen UR
This year’s project of Wageningen UR consisted in a device for the diagnosis of tropical diseases, which featured sensitive perishable material in the form of engineered cells.
As TU Delft also aimed to manufacture a device intended for the broad audience, we were aware that one of the biggest challenges to both of our projects was the shelf-life or storability of the biological material. To circumvent the previous issue, our team dedicated a part of our project to research the applicability of tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) in order to enable the stabilization of all fragile material with just a simple drying step.
Consequently, TU Delft shipped three of his developed plasmids encoding for the production of the TDPs that conferred the most protection (CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094 and SAHS 33020) to Wageningen, so that they could test it with their cells.
Figure 2: Bacteria desiccation tolerance with TDPs. Number of colonies remaining after desiccation and rehydration for the empty vector,  TU Delft’s BioBricks for the production of CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094 and SAHS 33020 in BL21(DE3). Experiments performed by iGEM Wageningen UR.
As depicted in Figure 1, the survival of the bacteria upon drying overnight and resuspending is greatly enhanced for all the samples featuring the BioBricks with respect to that of the empty vector. In addition, Wageningen resuspended the samples with both Milli-Q water and PBS buffer, achieving additional results that indicated that the survival of the cells producing CAHS 94205 was improved in PBS while that of the cells with SAHS 33020 was instead worsened.
In return, TU Delft iGEM tested an additional preservation method researched by iGEM Wageningen UR, consisting of drying cells in combination with kaolin clay. In the experiments, TU Delft dried BL21(DE3) along with different amounts of kaolin in a laminar flow cabinet overnight
Bacteria desiccation tolerance experiments with Kaolin. Kaolin tube forwarded by iGEM Wageningen UR and resulting plates dried and resuspended with Kaolin.
After plating the resuspended kaolin and colonies and incubating overnight, the results were unfortunately inconclusive:  the plates were either overgrown or had no colonies at all. Furthermore, after performing Wageningen's  protocol, TU Delft shared a list of suggestions for its improvement"
Yale,2018," cloning, the RHIT team seemed to be having trouble getting their plasmids to transfect successfully into competent cells. We completely understood their frustration and cloning difficulties, having struggled ourselves quite a bit. To help troubleshoot their issues, we suggested two alternative cloning approaches that seemed to work fairly well for us: (1) Gibson Assembly and (2) Ligation-Independent Cloning. Both of these methods had worked well for us in the path whenever we faced problems with traditional restriction enzyme and ligase cloining.
All in all, we had a great experience working with the RHIT team and getting to known their team members. We found our meet-up with them to be extremely intellectually-stimulating and fun. During the Giant Jamboree, we plan on finding time to meet them in-person and talking more about how our projects are going.
NAWI Graz 2018 iGEM Team
While looking through postings for Team Collaborations on the iGEM Website, we saw a listing from the NAWI Graz Team looking for “Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 support”. Since our entire Objective #3 revolves around engineering A. baylyi ADP1 to metabolize TPA, we immediately reached out to the NAWI Graz team. We also planned to send samples of A. baylyi ADP1 to them so that they would have a lot more flexibility working with the strain for future project directions. We are currently finishing up the paperwork and regulatory procedures required to mail biological samples internationally.
Since our projects utilize A. baylyi in completely different ways, we decided to host a virtual meet-up to discuss our projects and learn more about their team. Since we had not yet interacted with any iGEM teams outside of the United States, we were especially excited to experience the “i” for “international” in “iGEM” for the first time by collaborating with a European team.
Despite the six hour time difference that made scheduling a virtual meet-up a bit challenging, we were able to find a time for both our teams to talk. We began with a quick discussion about our respective projects. We learned about the innovative approaches that the NAWI Graz team was taking in order to produce palm oil using microorganisms. It turned out that the reason they were interested in using A. baylyi ADP1 was because A. baylyi ADP1 has some interesting metabolic pathways that could potentially help them optimize their production of palm oil. We found it incredibly cool that even though both of us were interested in utilizing the unique metabolic pathways found in A."

NKU_China,2016," practical. However, we have still discovered some obvious bugs by actually using this software. For example, the scroll bar could not function properly. Also, the position of the navigation bar was incorrect, which greatly affected the normal operation of the software. Meanwhile, we suggested them to increase the quantity of the data in the background database as well as improve the quality of the data. Moreover, we suggested that the real-time updating capability of their database should be enhanced.
Team SJTU_China designed a piece of software used for laboratory management and instant communication. The design style of this software is natural and delicate and the systems of laboratory material management and instant communication could very well meet the requirements of iGEM teams. When we actually tried out this software, however, we still discovered some problems. For example, in order to use the instant communication function of this software, users must register on service offered by certain commercial companies first, which would presumably lead to the disclosure of personal information.
We have submitted reports on user experience to both of the teams.
Team HUST_China
Many iGEM teams have participated in the Interlab Study this year. Unfortunately, however, materials from the 2016 Interlab Kit such as plasmids failed to function effectively due to problems in the manufacture, transportation, storage and experiment process. Team HUST_China was encountered with such problem. Due to some unknown issues, they failed to successfully transform the plasmid for Positive Control group into Escherichia coli DH5
and they turned to us for assistance. After we had learnt their situation, we immediately cultured the Positive Control strain that we had successfully transformed and send the plasmid they had required to them. With our prompt help, team HUST_China eventually obtained the Positive Group strain.
Team JSNU_China
This year is the first year that team JSNU_China participates in the iGEM Competition and we have had a close cooperation with them. We have provided them with detailed suggestions on composition of team members, selection of project focus and establishment of their team wiki etc.
Team NAU_China
One part of the project of our team this year was to design AI-2 Response Device that could respond to different concentration of environmental AI-2. As a result, we could test the regulation ability of AI-2 Controllers by directly measuring the GFP expression. In this part of our project, we had the honor to receive significant help from iGEM Team NAU_China on mathematical modelling.

INSA-UPS_France contacted us some time later to test the maze design software too. Using their highly creative approach to design several chambers, we were able to correct mistakes and validate our results even more.
Fig. 4: The really creative mazes & chambers of INSA-UPS_France. The iGEM mazes could be solved, but our Thymio had some problems with the other chambers.
Support by sending our Promotor Construct
We contacted SVCE_Chennai after reading their collaboration proposal on the iGEM Collaborations page. We realized we had many similarities in our project as both of us were working on pH as well as temperature regulated systems. The alkaline inducible promotor alx was actually the same. A Skype conference between both teams was organised, which gave us the chance to talk directly to each other and express any difficulties we were faced with so far. Since they had some issues with changing pH in their media, we helped them out by giving them some useful suggestions, like our protocol about what base we use and the concret amount of it to raise the neutral pH of LB and M9 media to 8,5 to induce the promoter.  Since they had some amplification issues with their gBlock, we also shipped them our alx gBlock so that they could work with it. At the end of the summer, they send us their data about how the promoter activity increased with the pH and as we had similar results, we came to the conclusion that our experiments were successful.
Augmented Reality at the Giant Jamboree
After seeing the post of the iGEM team Franconia on the official Collaboration Site, and declaring it as a very creative, interesting and amusing one, we decided to support them. They organise an augmented reality game for smartphones with the help of QR codes distributed throughout the Giant Jamboree. A ""plague"" breaks out at the event and the QR codes represent either ""cure"" or “infection” for the respective scanning smartphone. The goal of the game is that at the end of the conference, all virus outbreaks are cured. With little effort, this game can create a very special component of the Giant Jamboree 2017 and this is why we want to support and be part of it."

Collaborations
Throughout the development of our genetically engineered machine we have also collaborated with other mexican and international teams in different ways to enrich each other's project.
1.- Meetup
The three mexican teams met in July to present our projects, get feedback from each other and plan a collaboration. This was the start of a Science Experiment Manual collaboration; a handbook that aims to introduce elementary school kids to science. This meetup helped us realize our areas of improvement to get better prepared for the Giant Jamboree. This event helped us establish closer relationships with the other iGEM teams, which consequently led to more collaborations.
2.- Science Experiment Manual Collaboration
Focusing on the importance of spreading science to the general public, and most importantly to those in their early stages in life, we collaborated with the two other mexican iGEM teams; team TEC CEM, and team TEC Chihuahua. We created a fun science experiment manual for elementary school students in which we aim to get children involved with science by creating science. This manual is intended to be presented to the Mexican Ministry of Education. Each team collaborated with the proposal of 10 different experiments according to the national education plan, making a total of 30 experiments. We validated them in public and private schools in the cities of Chihuahua, Guadalajara and Mexico City where we got feedback from teachers and students. We aim to awaken the children’s curiosity and to bring them closer to scientific activities through the manual and in the long term, to increase the scientific development in Mexico and to make progress in our country.Focusing on the importance of spreading science to the general public, and most importantly to those in their early stages in life, we collaborated with the two other mexican iGEM teams; team TEC CEM, and team TEC Chihuahua.

According to the results we collected, the Harvard strains with modified pili do not form biofilms under the conditions we subjected them to. These strains may be able to form biofilms under different conditions. Further investigation would have to be done to determine if different if different media types, incubation periods, or transformation into different strains of E. coli  could induce biofilm formation. Determining optimal biofilm formation conditions could allow the Harvard team to use the biofilm assay to gather quantitative results for their various binding assays. However, it is possible that the modified pili interfere with biofilm formation. In that case, the biofilm assay would not be a valid method of quantification.
Harvard
The Harvard team tested our TiAFP and BclA-TiAFP antifreeze proteins in the curli strain , a strain of E. coli expressing modified CsgA fusion proteins. This strain, which forms biofilms, was developed by the Joshi lab and therefore readily available to the Harvard team. They followed our general biofilm protocol, linked above, with the exception of the following conditions:
1. Round-bottom plates at the Wyss were not sanitary so we used two flat-bottom plates.
2. Curli strain obtained from Joshi Lab was grown in 1 mL pure YESCA media (100 mg Casamino acids, 10
mg yeast extract dissolved in ddH2O per 1 mL solution).
3. Liquid cultures were also supplemented with 5 μL of carbomycin (strains were grown on chloramphenicol
+ carbomycin resistance plates)
4. Having been informed by the Joshi Lab that the bacteria would almost certainly perish if left in a 96-well
plate for 48 hours at 37 degrees Celsius, the Harvard team followed their advice and incubated the plate
for 48 hours on a room-temperature shaker (25 degrees Celsius)
Following the protocol (except for the above-mentioned differences), the Harvard team grew up the delta FimB strain (negative control), wild type CsgA curli bacteria (positive control), the curli bacteria transformed with the BBa_J23117 plasmid and two separate strains with the curli bacteria transformed with two separate antifreeze protein plasmids developed by W"

iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania
iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania
Aalto-Helsinki took part in a Vilnius-Lithuania team organized 3-day Biohackathon Lab Issues, which took place in Vilnius University Life Sciences Center in August 2018. This has been a great opportunity to meet other iGEM teams, scientists and the broader community and all together to work towards the same goal- help scientists solve problems they face in their labs every day.
Our Biohackathon team.
Collaboration overview:
Work towards a common goal: Improving the Lab Work. The topic of the biohackathon has made ourselves to step back and look at the issues we encounter daily in our work, think about the future developments and what improvements could be done. This has been a moment where we could apply our iGEM lab work experience for the common good of the scientific community, apply the learnings for the new developments making the lab more efficient, precise, and meeting the current needs.
Live the iGEM experience. This has been rather a unique opportunity to visit the hosting Vilnius-Lithuania team, it’s home university, workspaces and spend the time together. Also, other than the hosting team we met a couple of other teams (from Lund and Groningen). This has been a great chance to learn about each other’s projects, progress, issues encountered and help each other by sharing the knowledge, experience, contacts and establishing collaboration opportunities.
iGEM involvement in the local community. BioHackathon was hosted by Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team. Participants were both iGEM teams and the local community members interested in the topic. In our hackathon team, we were happy to have us join a non-iGEM’er, who brought us some fresh perspective and extra programming skills which were very needed at that moment.
Learning environment The BioHackathon gave us a chance for us not only to learn from each other but also from the experts. We have been mentored by the experts from the different fields and had a chance to hear the lectures given by a Scientist Urtė Neniškytė, Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius and an Entrepreneur Evaldas Pabrėža who have shared their insights gained through years of experience.

Tongji_Shanghai,2016," Team SJTU2016 is found. During the previous 2 months, we collect remarkable project from all of the teams in the season of 2015 and some even further, and summarize the basic principle of genetically engineering. We shared these precious files with Team SJTU at 12.28 to help them have a quicker and better start, avoiding the repeating work.
Both our team and SJTU have the part of mathematics model building, so we have some collaboration with each other. Concerning the heat treatment, Pro.Xuemin Xu, also known as vice chairman of SJTU, is the specialist in this field. Coincidentally, one team member of Team SJTU had had her class of heat treatment. He provided us the relevant articles, and helped us to build the path of this model. Meanwhile, the SJTU is working on relation of the ADH, GAL, CUP promoter and expression level of protein downstream. One of graduate student is right working on the problem of GAL promoter, so we make contact with both of them and build a bridge.
In addition, we help with testing their new system iMPA an inventive idea about promoting convenience and efficiency. Link below shows our test feedback
Feedback for iMAP
NYU-Shanghai ~ Tongji
At 6.5,2016 our team visited team NYU-Shanghai for changing ideas. NYU-Shanghai raised the project using a 10bp micro-RNA with hairpin structure linked with fluorescence to indicate certain sequence of gene. Since we had done the work of overview the previous project, we noticed that one team in 2015 have already done the same job. We raised it to NYU-Shanghai, helped them to justify their projects.

Summary
Collaborations
Beginning Research in Non-Model Microbes with Concordia University iGEM , Cornell University iGEM , Northeastern University iGEM , University of British Columbia iGEM , University of La Verne iGEM , and Utah State University iGEM
Over the past few years, iGEM has increasingly centered around non-model microorganisms—organisms which are less well-characterized and have fewer resources for genetic manipulation than the model E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Despite a prevalence of non-model organisms in iGEM competition projects and the potential impact which these projects may have, few resources exist for teams hoping to initiate research in non-model strains.
The 2015 Yale University iGEM team has collaborated with several other teams working in non-model strains to design a set of considerations for future iGEM teams in order to reduce the barrier to entry into non-model organisms. We synthesized the experiences of other teams into a handout, which has been made available on our team wiki and will be available at out poster at the Jamboree.

WPI_Worcester,2017," that the assay was not appropriate for our project, but we still worked with BU’s Hardware Team to see if it could be automated.
The BU Team came up with a schematic, and outline as to how the assay would work.
The only part necessary after the assay was scaled down would be a device that could read absorbance of microliters of volumes. A new device could be developed to do this or the assay could be sent into a 384 well plate instead of a 96 well plate to be read on a plate reader with the capacity to read a 384 well plate.

The Importance of Collaboration
The iGEM competition stresses the importance of collaborations between scientists and encourages teams to significantly collaborate with one or more iGEM teams. Collaboration is an important component of scientific research, as it teaches will-be scientists to exchange ideas and assist others in their innovations. Our team has collaborated with several iGEM teams as well as a team of undergraduate researchers outside of the iGEM Competition.
University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM Team
Our collaboration with the University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM team began with a Skype call. During the meeting, we discussed our project designs. Because of our extensive human practices efforts, we felt that we could best collaborate by providing information about extending their outreach. After attending the BMES Coulter Conference in August, our teammates visited the UM iGEM team lab in Minnesota. We advised their team to reach out to areas affected by their project (mercury ion pollution) and to speak with  environmental regulatory groups in Minnesota to gain insight about potential users. We also suggested they start a crowdfunding campaign so their entire team can attend the Jamboree in Boston, since they had not considered that to be an option.
iGEM Team in Montpellier, France
We heard about the Montpellier iGEM team through the iGEM Troubleshooting & Collaborations Facebook page created by iGEM Thessaloniki. Their project, Vagineering, aims to create a non-hormonal contraceptive. Our projects both address inadequate access to contraception, so we were interested in collaborating with them. We Skyped with their team and discussed our designs, human practices, and progress in lab. We suggested that the Montpellier team consider dosage of their final product, since it would be inserted into the human body, ways to switch off production of the contraceptive, or a delivery method.
iGEM TecCEM

TU_Darmstadt,2018," to the problems with NodB inclusion bodies, we recommended them to use COD from Vibrio cholerae instead. The team appreciated our recommendation and focused their lab work more on the COD. We were especially curious how they would solve the inclusion body problem and many other issues we had encountered the year prior.
It was a great pleasure to collaborate with iGEM Stuttgart and we hope we were able to help them with their project.
iGEM Marburg
This year, the iGEM team of Marburg tries to establish the organism Vibrio natriegens as a new biological chassis for the iGEM community. They reached out to various other teams in an effort to standardize V. natriegens for labs all around the world.
In context of standardization of V. natriegens we repeated the InterLab study for iGEM Marburg with V. natriegens as chassis.
Here, cultures of the transformed V. natriegens showed decreased growth rates upon induction of protein synthesis but no fluorescence could be detected. Decreased growth rates indicate metabolic stress probably caused by protein synthesis. However, since no fluorescence could be detected no matured functional fluorogenic protein were built.
Yet, the organism shows many interesting features. We were especially fascinated by their incredibly fast growth rate of V. natriegens revealing a great opportunity for scientists to save time and work more efficiently.
It was a pleasure to work with this novel organism and share our obtained data. We were thankful for the opportunity to try out a new powerful organism and we are very interested in implementing V. natriegens in our everyday laboratory life.
iGEM NCHU Taichung
Yu-Hsuan from the iGEM team NCHU Taichung contacted us in June. She was in Darmstadt for a semester abroad. For her team it is the first year participating in the iGEM competition. Thus, we arranged a meeting to exchange project ideas and share our experiences over the years. Since our team was inspired to restructure after visiting iGEM Stockholm last year, we wanted to pass on our experiences on how to organize a team, how to choose a project and lots of other important structures they should be aware of.
During Yu-Hsuan’s visit we talked about how we run our laboratory and which positions we have, e.g. our lab leader, who mainly organizes the lab and takes care of the orders, and our lab group leaders. The lab group leaders in turn are the ones who organize four to five members and work together"
