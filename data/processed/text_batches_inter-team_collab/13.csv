Collaboration with NTHU-Taiwan
Collaboration Emphasis: Human Practices and Dry Lab work
This year, our team was able to collaborate with the NTHU-Taiwan iGEM team over the course of the fall semester, during which time we had several Skype sessions with members of the NTHU team. The NTHU team’s detection method for EDCs in water also addresses an important aspect of water contamination in our world and as such we were well equipped to aid each other in improving our respective projects. In the collaboration between our teams, we were able to help each other survey American opinions and knowledge on EDCs as well as Taiwanese knowledge of bacteriophages and their concerns with E. coli contamination. With their help, we were able to use one of the software programs that they suggested and design a 3-D model of our water test kit. We improved each other’s projects based on these collaboration experiences and it was a pleasure to work with them!
Response: Combined Detection
Because both of our teams focus on water quality, we’ve planned to achieve a multiple detection integration system based on the NTHU teams prototype that has the ability to detect various pollutants and contaminants in water, like a Swiss Knife with many functions! However, it would be very difficult for our team to construct detection equipment and a 3-D model because of a lack of an engineering expert on our team. Fortunately, both of our teams focused on quantifiers, so it would be more convenient to transfer the NTHU teams techniques and continue working with them to create a functional integrated system. The NTHU team has also graciously offered to assist our team with learning how to assemble a working model that can be used with their informational systems and in the future, incorporated into their system as an add on design.

Duesseldorf
Purpose of collaboration:
Bring the topic of Synthetic Biology close to the public
Description:
Previous iGEM teams from the Heinrich-Heine university of Düsseldorf created a tradition of bringing Synthetic Biology to the public eye by sharing themed postcards.
Every year, many iGEM teams join this campaign.
This year, we designed a postcard and sent it to the Düsseldorf team for distribution.
We were inspired by this project and printed extra copies of our postcard that are posted in our human practice events.
US_AFRL_CarrollHS
Purpose of collaboration:
Increase exposure for our team on social media.
Description:
We happily took part in a marketing project spearheaded by US_AFRL_CarrollHS called “Mike the Microbe"". We created caricatures of ourselves with the Mike the Microbe character and posted them on Instagram.
This lead to further exposure to other iGEM teams and was a lot of fun!

Overview
This summer,we collaborated with two 2017 iGEM teams.We have been mentoring a new team, SiCAU-China.We helped ZJU-China detect the inhibitory effect of Trichoderma on the process of Phytophthora infestaning tobacco. SiCAU-China helped us build a expression vector. ZJU-China assisted us with the detection of the TCP(trichlorophenol) remnant in soil. Besides, we did a favor of constructing iGEM teams for Chengdu NO.4 High School and Chengdu Huaxi High School (University of Electronic Science and Technology secondary school). With our help, it’s likely that they will establish their own iGEM team next year.

ZJU-China (Zhejiang University)：
In order to help ZJU-China( Zhejiang University) detect the inhibitory effect of Trichoderma on the process of Phytophthora making inroads into tobacco, we did a lot of work as follows:
Respectively inoculated Phytophthora and Trichoderma into tissue culture tobacco with differentiated root, stem and leaf.
Specific method of inoculation: dig a some amount of medium (about 0.5cmX0.5cm), then use about 6ml up water to rinse its mycelia and spores, finally take 1ml solution from it, then pour it into the tissue culture"

Language Project
We would like to thank the iGEM Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras for providing us with an opportunity to collaborate on their project. iGEM IIT Madras has offered us with a language project, chance to translate the video from English into our native language, Korean. We have translated their video of Introduction to Synthetic Biology into Korean. Our group has translated the English script from IIT Madras into out language and put it with the original clip that had drawings of what synthetic biology is and their significance. They have generously provided us with the English script used for their video which has already been uploaded to Youtube. Through participating in this collaboration, we were able to proudly present our knowledge in our own language and to offer this amazing source of information even towards native Korean audiences. It has been a massive pleasure collaborating with them and their help has deeply lead to our team heading towards achieving a great amount of success.

      Nowadays, collaboration between                                 researchers plays a critical role in the process of making important breakthroughs in                                 scientific fields. It is more and more difficult to finish a research project by                                 individual group of researchers. As for us, helps from other iGEM teams were vital to                                 our project improvement, experiments and human practices. In the other hand, we tried                                 our best to gave support to those iGEMers in need as well.                                 This year, there are totally 5 iGEM teams, SCU-WestChina, Peking, SiCAU-China,                                 TMMU_China and Purdue collaborated with SCU_China, either through one directional help                                 or mutual collaboration between each other. The formats of our collaboration are                                 variable. The details of our collaboration are listed below:
01.  SCU-WestChina
      As two teams from one                                     university, we collaborated with Team SCU-WestChina closely and in depth in                                     different aspects such as team building, project design, experiment and human                                     practice etc.

Experiments
Materials
      Because SCU-WestChina didn’t have the 96-well                                     plate with black background for fluorescence measurement and trypsin for artificial                                     intestine fluid, which we happened to have some surplus, thus we provided them with                                     these materials for experiment.
Microplate Reader
      Because of regulations of microplate readers in                                     College of Life Sciences, SCU, we cannot do continuous measurement in our                                     laboratory. We asked SCU-WestChina for help and they found us a reader which could                                     do continuous measurement in State Key Laboratory"
TU_Delft,2015," in their survey were:
- How much bubble gum do we consume all around the world during a year?
- Does your country have a way of removing bubble gum from the streets?
- What is your definition of GMO (genetically modified organism)?
Where most teams ask for the opinion of other iGEM teams, this team wants us to go and ask around for other people to answer the question. The guidelines for doing the survey are below. On the 26th of August we heard that we provided enough answers to earn the Bronze medal. We are really glad to hear that we gave the team enough input and we are curious to see what they did with the answers for the progress of their project.

ITB_Indonesia,2017," the regulations so that our project can be of use in the near future.
Mini-Booklet Project
We were lucky enough to be able to collaborate with a team rich in iGEM experience like Manchester Team. As we got quite a few tips on how to strive on iGEM, we also would like to share those tips & tricks with fellow iGEMers. We therefore initiated a collaboration project with Manchester Team in the form of a mini-booklet project which consists of basic tips and tricks to compete in iGEM. The mini-booklet was developed by us with a very generous help from iGEM Manchester Team. Our aim is to provide Indonesian future teams and many more teams internationally with necessary tips and tricks from a more experienced university. This goal resides with our iGEM Booklet Vol.1 vision, to inspire Indonesian future teams. We plan to distribute this mini-booklet alongside the iGEM Booklet Vol.1."
Macquarie_Australia,2018," survey created by the Macquarie University iGEM team was sent to other iGEM teams to provide us with an insight into the resources used for the human practices component of their project. As seen on the map above, teams from around the world completed our survey and using their feedback, our team was able to incorporate this data for our customer discovery toolkit. Furthermore, we responded to several other teams’ surveys, many of which completed our own survey, in an attempt to aid them with their own projects.
UNSW symposium
We would like to thank the UNSW iGEM team for organising an event that provided the Macquarie University iGEM team with the opportunity to present our project for the first time. Hearing from other teams and scientists that spoke on the panel gave us a better understanding of our project and how we could improve before we present it at the jamboree.
Virtual Conference
iGEM NYU Abu Dhabi ran a virtual conference which enabled 6 iGEM teams (iGEM HKUST, iGEM Rec Chennai, iGEM VIT, iGEM Saint Joseph, iGEM NYU Abu Dhabi and iGEM Macquarie) to virtually meet one another to discuss their projects. The event had an emphasis on questions and discussion of each project. The conference gave us a chance to learn from other teams and discuss any issues that were unclear to help each team throughout their journey.
Additional Collaborations
iGEM Macquarie was contacted by a couple of teams asking to send science related photos to unite the science community from different countries. Two of the main highlights were when iGEM TecMonterrey GDL asked us to take a photo with a sign showing how far away we were from the Jamboree, showing that ‘science is everywhere’ and when iGEM Estonia created a huge mosaic of photos showing fashion and style in the lab.

NEPTUNE Collaborative Findings
Given that Neptune was built to provide an accessible, affordable, and convenient solution for designing, manufacturing, and operating microfluidic systems, it was only natural that we would test our toolchain by designing microfluidics for other iGEM wetlab teams. We were able to collaborate with both the MIT iGEM team and the Northeastern iGEM team. Through these exchanges, we were able to test the Neptune workflow while providing a wetlab team with microfluidics to test their biological systems.
Designing Automated Mammalian Cell Culture Devices
SEPT - OCT 2016 | A collaboration with the MIT 2016 iGEM Wetlab Team
Our collaboration with the MIT iGEM team involved designing, creating, and controlling microfluidic devices to culture mammalian cells on chip. The end goal of these experiments was to lay the groundwork for testing endometrial cell lines and their response to various levels of estrogen in an automated microfluidic setting.
PART 1
In our first on-site visit, we designed and fabricated a microfluidic device with specific parameters fit to trapping the MIT team's mammalian HEK293 cells. Our first iteration of chip included an input, cell traps surrounded by two valves, and an output, as shown. We automated the control of the valves using our servo-syringe combination pumps. To prepare the chip for the cells, first, we opened our valves to flow 1.2mL of ethanol solution inside the chip for sterilization. Next, we pulled 1mL of PBS (buffer solution) to clean out the ethanol solution for the benefit of the cells. Finally, we pulled 1ml of cell solution with a concentration of 1 x 10^6 cells/ml through the microfluidic chip. The two valves were then closed (trapping the cells and culture media inside) and the chip removed from the control infrastructure. From there"

For us it was a very significant day.
Team Mingdao
During the summer we held a Skype conversation with Taiwanese team and received tips from them on lab work with E.Coli germs. We told them what we think should be done in Human Practice. In the framework of our work we built a survey which we sent in order to enrich our knowledge base. The data we collected assisted in statistics to analyze the research.
At the same time we also helped the team by filling in a questionnaire to gather their data. Undoubtedly the mutual assistance for both teams made it possible to progress in their research."

There was even one person who contacted us on Instagram, who was interested in starting a new iGEM team after finding our meme page!
iGEM Memes has brought the old, the current and the future iGEMers together. Thereby, we consider that social media and humour should be a part of the iGEM spirit and community.
Lund
This year (2017), Lund participated in the iGEM competition with their very first team. To set up a team and the structure around it, is a challenging task. We were happy to help iGEM Lund in their initial steps of establishing an iGEM team by providing templates for sponsoring contracts and for bylaws of an association. Furthermore, we have been in regular contact throughout the project to discuss project development, arising issues and how challenges can be solved.
Human Practices Handbook
After receiving feedback about how difficult Human Practices can be for someone not familiar with it, iGEM Stockholm decided to create a handbook to help teams to master their Human Practices. We thought that the best way to accomplish this handbook was to collaborate with previous successful teams. We reached out to all previous winners and nominated teams for Human Practices and asked them for their help. The teams we collaborated with was Stockholm 2016, OLS_Canmore 2016, Imperial 2016, Groningen 2016, Bielefeld 2015, William and Mary 2015, UofC_Calgary 2016, Cornell NY 2016, Paris Bettencourt 2016.

Collaboration
This year, we are very happy to collaborate with a collegiate iGEM team, CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan. We are both from Taichung City in Taiwan and the distance between us actually are very close, that is, not far from 5km.
In the meetup, CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan knew our project design and the problem to get from IDT the synthetic gene expression vector carrying glucose transporter genes of Salmonella. They advised that we can try to clone the gene from the bacteria and then assemble with the promoter. However, in safety issue, Salmonella is recognized as Biosafety Level 2 organism, they helped us to contact a lab PI, Dr. Cheng-Yang Huang, in Chung Shan Medical University who has handled the bacteria. Luckily, the genomic DNAs of Salmonella has been prepared for their previous research and kept some stored in the fridge. CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan amplified the gene fragments we want by PCR using our designed primers.
And in the other way, we did them a favor by subcloning BioBrick parts. We have good training in the skills of gene cloning learned from our instructor, Dr. Phil Chen. We have actually completed total at least 28 basic and composite BioBrick parts this year. And due to the limited remaining time of iGEM competition, CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan sought help from us to subclone parts from the synthetic genes made by IDT.
MINGDAO
We helped CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan subclone one basic part of “F420-Dependent Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase” and one composite part of “T7 promoter & Lac operator and RBS from PET-29a”. We took two tubes containing DNA powder made by IDT from CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan. We dissolved the DNA and re-transformed E. coli DH5α with them. Then the two plasmids extracted from the bacteria have been cut by XbaI and PstI as inserts, and so did the pSB1C3 as a vector (Fig 1.). E. coli DH5α competent cells were transformed with the ligation products. The transformed E. coli  colonies were picked up and checked by colony PCR"

Due to the lack of equipment in interlab. UESTC-China turn to our laboratory for the fluorescent microplate reader. We offered the access to the equipment and the instructions in analyses of their experimental data.
Peking
We met team Peking first on the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC). After intense and deep discussions on our project design, team Peking proposed that it is necessary to consider the kinetics properties of dCas9 protein and sgRNA-dCas9 complex, especially in multi-sgRNA systems. Besides, we realized that dCas9 proteins would be saturated by a certain sgRNA with its high concentration, which would disrupt the entire multi-sgRNA system. To solve these problems, team Peking provided us a prototype based on dCas9 activator and binding period delay causing by RNAi which will help us improve and perfect our project modeling in the future.
CDHSU-China
On July 27th, 2018, our team went to Shishi High School in Chengdu, Sichuan province to conduct an interactive lecture. This lecture was prepared to give this new team some suggestions and share our experiences with them. And what’s more, this lecture could be counted as the beginning of a long-term cooperation between their team (CDHSU) and ours.                         We made adequate preparation for it, including consulting details in advance with related officials, understanding the needs of their team and determining the specific content and orientation of the lecture according to the feedback we had got. The lecture was held in the biology competition base of Chengdu Shishi High School. We helped them to be conversant with the competition rules and laboratory regulations. They used a species of plant that was not on the safety white list, so we advised them to have a check to make sure that their subject does not violate the rules. Since it is the first time for them to participate in the iGEM competition, there are many problems and obstacles in their experiments. Thus, it is necessary for them"

Collaborations
Inter-team collaboration is one of many exciting things about the iGEM community. Throughout our project, we have collaborated with many different iGEM teams around the world. We did not only benefit from each other’s expertise through collaborating, but we also formed invaluable bonds with many teams around the world, boosting the team’s creativity. With this in mind, we would like to thank all the iGEM teams who have collaborated and shared ideas with us.
iGEM BOKU Vienna
After attending a lecture about Pichia pastoris at KTH hosted by Professor Diethard Mattanovich, we got introduced to the iGEM team of BOKU-Vienna 2018. Being their primary PI, Professor Mattanovich helped us getting into contact with the team and their secondary PI Hans Marx, who we talked to about technical issues we encountered while working with P. pastoris. The team further offered to clone our laccase sequences into their expression vector for P. pastoris so we sent them our constructs.
BioBrick Tutorial
In April, we were invited for a weekend of Biobrick tutorials, organized by DTU Copenhagen Biobuilders. The aim was to learn more about how to work with BioBricks, and to perform 3A assembly. The event was a splendid opportunity for us to meet other Nordic teams, and it led to us getting into contact with iGEM Uppsala and iGEM Lund, which we later did a collaboration with. See the event ""Limits of Life"" on the Public Engagement page.
NiC- conference
This year, iGEM Lund was hosting the annual Nordic iGEM Conference, NiC. The conference was held in the beginning of June, and gave all the Nordic iGEM teams the opportunity to pitch their project idea. We were able to meet the friends that we made in the BioBrick tutorial in Copenhagen, but also to form new friendships. The conference included a poster session and a presentation, and we got valuable feedback from the judges and our newly found peers. Read more about it on the Public Engagement page.
iGEM Uppsala
After our participation in the annual Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC) held in Lund, we decided to meet iGEM Uppsala again during the summer to discuss a possible collaboration. To serve our great interest in public engagement and education, we came up with the idea of hosting a panel discussion. The event was called ""Limits of"

Collaboration with Newcastle team
Following our iGEM Northern Meet-up, we asked Newcastle to help us to convert our deterministic model of interactions between phages and bacteria into stochastic one. Although nobody from their team had previous experience in modelling using Python packages,   StochPy in particular, they received extensive training in modelling in general that proved to be very useful for us.
During over 2 hours long Skype session with Bradley Brown and his team members we worked thought our model together bit by bit trying to find a solution. We shared the basic principle behind StochPy and our draft models, whereas Newcastle proposed a   working solution. The result of this collaboration is reflected in our GitHub page with a commit title “Introduction of Newcastle help in stochastic model”.   This collaboration is also mentioned on the official Newcastle 2017 wiki Collaborations page .
Collaboration with Edinburgh UG team
Throughout the project we have extensively collaborated with the Edinburgh_UG team . The collaboration resulted essential for both teams to develop their projects.
Collaboration 1
2017 Edinburgh OG and UG teams worked together to deliver a presentation for the Synthetic Biology Society at the University of Edinburgh on October 11th. The main focus of our presentation was to raise awareness and promote iGEM competition through   an introduction to iGEM history and principles and the explanation of our projects.To achieve this, we explained how iGEM have helped us to develop practical and problem-solving skills, to come up with solutions to world problems and finally helped   us to collaborate and integrate our project and ideas into the real world.
The audience, 30 people from both under and postgraduate degrees, seemed to be very motivated to join the 2018 team, asking many questions about the detailed procedure of application.
Collaboration 2
We helped the Edinburgh UG team incorporate stochastic modelling into their project. Up until this point, they were having difficulty modelling the catalysis of recombination by site-specific recombinases. With our feedback they were able to develop   a complete model that allowed for their designs to be tested in silico.

RHIT 2018 iGEM Team
When looking through the list of project abstracts for the iGEM 2018 Team competition, we saw that the RHIT team was also working towards a very similar goal. They were engineering bacteria to produce PETase and MHETase to breakdown PET and then engineering the bacteria to metabolize ethylene glycol (EG) by overexpressing fucO and aldA. They had also done a lot of interesting mathematical modeling for EG metabolism. Since we had taken very different approaches in trying to work towards a similar end result, we thought that it would be incredibly enriching and beneficial for both teams to connect and discuss our projects. We immediately reached out via email and scheduled a virtual meet-up.
During the meet-up, we ended up covering quite a lot of ground and talked for much longer than we had anticipated. We began by talking about our respective projects as well as the logic and rationale behind our differing project designs. While our project was focused on completely eliminating PET by completely metabolizing all the PET degradation products, the RHIT team intended to collect the leftover TPA to be used for re-polymerizing into new PET plastic, an interesting idea we had not thought about before.
Next, although we were both working on engineering strains of E. coli to metabolize EG, we were using completely different methodologies, which we discussed at great lengths. Our approach was more centered on genomic engineering. Since two key enzymes (fucO and aldA) are known to improve EG metabolism, we had used Lambda Red recombineering to replace the native genomic operons for these two genes with inducible promoters, allowing us to control overexpression of each enzyme using IPTG and aTC induction. In addition, we had used MAGE to target the ribosome-binding sites of key genes identified from our Flux Balance Analysis modelling with the hopes of optimizing EG metabolism at the translational level. In parallel, we were also using a mutagenesis and adaptive evolution approach to gradually evolve an EG-metabolizing strain of E. coli.
The RHIT team, however, used none of these approaches. Instead, they were planning on expressing the two key enzymes (fucO and aldA) from a high-copy plasmid. By increasing"

   We get in touch with team Light Harvester in June through our instructor. Even though we've gone through the High School student handbook, we’re still lacking some biotechnology lab skill. And since our lab is specifically established for the iGEM project in this year, we are lacking equipment resources. As a result, we learned extraction and transformation of plasmids, standardized aseptic manipulation, the extraction and purification of DNA, and how to operate various instruments and so on. With all the knowledge, we needed for completing the Lnterlab, our team starts the Interlab in August. We finished our final measurement of Interlab with their assistants about plate reader and their help upon the cultivation of final. In the first week, we dilute the fluorescein and measure the fluorescein solution’s standard curve. In the week after that, we measured OD600 Reference point and fluorescein fluorescence standard curve using protocols. Other than communicating about the experimental design between two groups, our team help them to check English grammar usage.

We discussed and brainstormed the future tendency on high school level’s development of biotechnology also what we expected to create in order to establish a more harmonious science community in biotechnology field. As two distinct points of view which are standing from college and high school, we exchanged our ideas about the long-range outlook of iGEM, and generally we could conclude these into one key point: one was that the most serious problem that most high school teams faced is lacking experience of doing practical bioengineering and necessary professional scientific knowledge. Therefore, we expected to build a well-spread and influential network among high school teams, then all the teams could meet as a conference every year and attain help from each other. It also could create a big platform for collaboration among teams and provide opportunities for colligate teams to contact high school teams even offer certain help. What’s more, we also planned to produce a book for high school students for pedagogical meaning with Shanghai Jiao Tong University about synthetic biology, which might be more"

What help did we give them?
TUST_China shared their improved Tetracycline HPLC Protocol; They hope that we can help them take water samples and measure the concentration of tetracycline in water; further help TUST_China to improve the mapping of tetracycline pollution levels in waters in China.
After a few days of measurement, we obtained the results of tetracycline in the waters near the Beijing University of Chemical Technology and sent it to TUST_China. It can be seen that tetracycline pollution in Beijing still exists.
What did they help us?
Due to the lack of experience in measuring fluorescence values in our laboratory, we can't correctly grasp the time of fluorescence measurement, and the fluorescence plate is not enough. Our laboratory microplate reader is old and cannot guarantee accuracy, so in order to save time and less Taking a detour, we designed a quantitative experiment and then sent it to TUST_China to commission them to help us measure the fluorescence values of different fatty acid gradients. We designed four control groups. The first group only added 50 ul of 20% arabinose solution as a control; the second group added 50 ul of 20% arabinose solution, and after 1 hour, 100 ul of different concentrations of fat solution were added, and the fatty acid concentrations were 25 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, 400 mM, respectively. The third group only added fatty acid solutions of different gradients, the concentration was the same as that of the second group, and the fourth group was the blank control group.
TUST_China helped us to analyze the fluorescence values of the bacterial culture after eight hours of cultivation as follows:

This year we worked closely with the Vanderbilt iGEM team and the University of Maryland College Park iGEM team .
The Vanderbilt team asked us to help them with their Policy and Practices section. Their project concerning ways to minimize random mutation ""hot spots"" in DNA raised some important questions about the integrity of DNA and a limitation ""ceiling"" for any such device that helps counter evolution. In return, they offered to cater their kill switch project to make it suitable for our BioBrick. For further steps, we could add their time dependent kill switch as a backup to our concentration dependent kill switch, SacB (BBa_322921), in the event that our negative-selection system does not work as well as planned.
We also attended the iGEM meetup hosted by the University of Maryland College Park. We had a a fun day discussing our projects with the other teams in attendance and also enjoyed listening to talks by the guest speakers. The meetup was a good way to collaborate with other University teams as well as with researchers and government officials already in the field of synthetic biology.

Tuebingen,2018," ns. This can be explained by the fact, that we manually concatenated the isomerase protein with the crystal structure of the ovispirin protein, which in this initial fusion state is sub-optimally folded. The ovispirin domain undergoes some conformational changes, since it is now connected to the larger isomerase domain Figure 3.1/3.2). We also analyzed the RMSD value over the time of the simulation only for the isomerase domain, since the iGEM Team Paris-Bettencourt was particularity interested in the influence on this domain while being fused to the ovispirin. The plot indicates some minor changes, but the conformation remains stable overall, without the ovispirin domain interfering heavily with the isomerase domain (Figure 4).
Epitope Revomal
The second step of our workflow was the identification of the T-cell MHC class II immune epitopes for the three most prevalent alleles in central Europe and their removal by specific amino acid substitutions, which do not alter the tertiary structure of the protein. In our deimmunization workflow, we focused on removing the immune epitopes within the isomerase domain, since there are barely any known homologous of the ovispirin protein. This lack of related protein drastically decreases the accuracy of our deimmunization tool and chances are high to get a structurally unstable and nonfunctional protein. That’s why the following epitope related data are for the isomerase domain only. Initially, we identified a total of 126 immune epitopes for the three alleles mentioned above in the isomerase domain. Between residue 100-130, the isomerase domain has a cluster of amino acids which are part of many different epitopes. This makes the isomerase domain a good candidate for a deimmunization, since the substitution of single amino acids in this cluster, can destroy a large number of epitopes.
Our algorithm calculated the following three amino acid substitution, as a compromise between the maximum structural integrity and the minimal immunogenicity of the protein (Table 1).
These three substitutions reduce the number of immune epitopes to 85, which is a reduction by ~33%.

Collaboration with team Dundee 2015
Team Dundee 2015
Some aspects of our project were similar to team Dundee. They built a chromium biosensor based on the same system we used, the chromate inducible operon of Ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl1. Therefore, we decided to cooperate and exchanged ideas, plasmid maps and sequences. During our collaboration, we realized that they were comparing the original sequence of the repressor to one with the first 15 codons optimized, while our system is based on a complete codon optimized repressor. So we exchanged samples to test in each other’s systems and look for differences. We were able to measure a combination of our promoter and their repressor in CFPS.
Collaboration with team Santa Clara 2015
Joseph Ayar
As a part of our project, we provide a report about the dual use issue. An aspect of this report is the analysis of the legal situation in different countries, namely the applying laws in Germany, the European Union, and the United States of America. As an expert in the field of law, a member of team Santa Clara (Joseph Ayar, J.D. candidate from University of Santa Clara, School of Law) provided valuable insights in the applying laws and advisory boards in the USA. His analysis is marked as quotes in our report .
Collaboration with team Exeter 2015
Team Ex"
Aachen,2017," contamination of drinking water with lead in Germany and translated, among other things, the German Drinking Water Ordinance, the government's information material to     lead pipes in old buildings, and an opinion on the pollution of drinking water with lead in large German cities.
The iGEM Team Worchester collected information about the salt pollution of waters in the North East of the USA. They found that in many freshwater areas in these states the chloride     concentration could reach a toxic level, if there should be no political initiative to reduce the burden. The main reason for the load was the use of salt-based de-icing on roads, as     well as dense building and industrial pollution.
Through this collaboration, we realized that salinization of fresh water reserves is a problem not restricted to highly industrial regions in Europe, but a global challenge for the future.
iGEM Aachen - iGEM Dresden
German Meet-Up
The iGEM Team TU Dresden hosted the three-day German-wide iGEM Meet-Up from June 30th to July 3rd. Henri, Gerolamo and Fabian, three members of our team, joined this event representing      the iGEM Team Aachen. The event gave us the opportunity to get in touch with the 14 other German teams present and to exchange knowledge with them. Since each team presented its project      in a 20-minute session, we got an insight into the topics of the other German teams.
In addition to that, we could also present our own project and identify the areas and problems of      our project we still needed to work on together with the listeners during the subsequent questionnaire. In the free time on Sunday, we also had the opportunity to explore Dresden's      historic town together with the other teams and to talk about collaborations. The weekend also included the presentation of the” iGEM goes green” initiative of the iGEM Team Dresden.      In the workshop, detailed discussions about how each team can make the laboratory work more sustainable were conducted. Because we as a team are just as convinced of the importance of      this topic, we decided to join the “iGEM goes green” movement and work together to minimize our carbon footprint (-> Read more).
At the Meet-Up, we not only found a lot of new friends and gathered new insights, but we were able to develop initial ideas with the iGEM Team Cologne-Dusseldorf,      which resulted in our intense laboratory collaboration (->Read more). We would like to thank the iGEM Team TU Dresden for the great event and the excellent organization,      which enabled us to get to know the other German"

Collaborations
Since this was our first year in the competition, collaborating with other teams was one of the essentials for us. Through our Skype sessions and e-mails, we could understand what needed to be done and we learned the proper attitude that we should have in this competition. We would like to thank every single team who collaborated with us. You guys are the best. Good luck in the competition!
ACIBADEM University
Our biggest collaboration was with the ACIBADEM iGEM 2018 team. We have done the whole InterLab protocols together in their lab. We were together all summer. Even though it's their first year in iGEM as well, they are college students so they are more experienced than us therefore they helped us a lot during the InterLab. It's thanks to this dedicated team that we were able to complete the InterLab studies. Especially Yasin, Atabey and Ali Adem Bahar. They helped us with every single problem we had.
NYU Abu Dhabi
We have participated in a virtual conference which was organized by iGEM NYU Abu Dhabi 2018 team. The Skype session had 5 iGEM teams in total. Each team presented their projects and shared opinions with each other. It was a productive and beneficial collaboration for us!
Pasteur Paris
We have organized a skype meeting with iGEM Pasteur 2018 team. We showed our projects to each other and exchanged our views. We really enjoyed having a collaboration with an other francophone school team.
METU HS Ankara
We have contacted iGEM MetuHS 2018 team as we learned that they were joining iGEM for the third time. As they are the only high school team from Turkey other than us, it was a little bit easier to keep in contact. We believe we became good friends with the members.
2018 Turkish Meet-Up
We have participated in the Turkey iGEM Meet-up which was held by MetuHS iGEM 2018 team. We met with all other iGEM 2018 Teams from Turkey. Each team has presented their projects and asked questions to one another. At the end of the meetup as the only two high school teams, we stayed a little bit longer to share our memories throughout the preparations for iGEM. We had a great time and made new friends. It was great meeting other Turkish students who are passionate about science!

Collaboration
1. Survey interactions with many teams.
We contacted with many other teams through our own survey. First was with IGEM Greece and their project is pANDORRA – Engineering and delivering modular RNAi-based logic circuits to treat colorectal cancer. In order to design a multi-pronged treatment approach for colorectal neoplasia, this team is engineering a novel anti-cancer E.coli agent, facilitating selective adhesion and cell density-dependent invasion into cancer cells, as the delivery module for our classifier circuit. In the future, they envision their system to be employed in a variety of pathological conditions generating reporter signals or protein outputs of therapeutic potential. In response to their survey, we provided our survey to them, which is about the increasing demand of gluten-free food and general introduction of our project, Insertion of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP- 4) to Intestinal Gut Microflora: Free from“Gluten-free”. Not only from Greece, igemusp(Brazil) team, British_Columbia IGEM team, UiOslo_Norway team, and Bordeaux also participated our survey for information about the trend of increasing gluten-intolerance.
2. Mentoring from KUAS_Korea
We were mentored by another College IGEM team, KUAS_Korea. KUAS_Korea is the team from Korea University in South Korea. They looked through our overall project and we learned basic method of PCR, gene cloning, etc. We basically first meet through face to face to generally inform our project, what we are mainly using as our own specific method and what we are suffering through the experiment. They introduced the new solution of our deficiency by showing some parts of their project to us and what they learn as members of synthetic biology association in their school. They also advised us about wiki management, experiment ethics, medal criteria, etc. We also talked about each other’s possible application of our project for general people and improved our parts based on discussion.

Collaborations
Collaboration between iGEM teams is one of the most important aspect of the competition. Instead of competition where teams are struggling to out perform each other, teams are encouraged to work together for the betterment of synthetic biology as a whole. The Boston University team has taken this ideal to heart and has worked in several different ways to collaborate with other teams.
Wellesley
Through the NEGEM meetups we were able to interact with the iGEM team from Wellesley College and start a collaboration with them. We were so excited to go to Wellesley College and experience their iGEM project for a day.
The 2015 Wellesley iGEM team aimed to create a museum exhibit to teach visitors about synthetic biology and get them excited about potential applications. The team gave us an initial introduction to their project at NEGEM, explaining the premise that an explorer travelling to hostile environments (deep sea, Mars, etc.) could utilize synthetic biology to create products that would be necessary for them to live in these areas. The exhibit would be catered to engaging different age groups of children - as young as 8 and as old as 16. This project will ultimately be featured at The Tech Museum in San Jose, California when it is completed.
The Wellesley team invited our team to their campus and give them feedback on their initial prototype. When we arrived at their Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab, we were met with not only their prototype museum exhibit but also many other gadgets such as Google Glass and Oculus Rift.
The Wellesley team displayed their project on a multitaction screen, and allowed us to pretend to be explorers in their simulated harsh environments. We had to integrate bacteria with existing elements of the environment, such as soil, to help our bacteria create necessary products, such as food. It was a lot of fun!
We had the unique opportunity to give the Wellesley iGEM team feedback about their project, since we were an experimental team and they were largely a computational design team. We suggested that they include more pertinent information about synthetic biology, such as more about the science behind the key reactions occurring"
Austin_UTexas,2017," with the student leaders from all teams. This was the main source of communication throughout the weeks ahead.  We collaborated with Rice for our modeling. Eve Sharpee, from the UT Austin team, discussed different ways we could improve our modeling mechanisms on our presentation with Jack Terrell, head of modeling from Rice. He answered our questions and provided guidance in creating the graphics that would be used for modeling in the iGEM Jamboree presentation and wiki page. We have very little experience modeling and using SimBiology, so Rice was very helpful in this regard.
Texas Tech is most familiar with chemical transformations and has less experience with electroporation, so we thought it would be mutually beneficial for our teams if Tech attempted Lactobacillus plantarum electroporation transformations. We provided glycerol stocks of cells, 2mm cuvettes and MRS agar powder in order to make this happen. Rachel Johnson corresponded with Brandon Palomo to offer advice on how to successfully electroporate. Quick recovery of electroporated cells,  adjusting resistance and voltage on the machine and proper concentrations of plasmid and cell stocks were discussed as well as various pieces of advice that UT Austin has primarily learned through experience and routine use of electroporation. In addition to Tech working on new techniques with guidance from UT Austin, this greatly helped UT Austin transform Lactobacillus plantarum. Texas Tech provided assistance to us by attempting to transform Lactobacillus plantarum with a variation of the Speer (1) protocol we had previously worked with as a way to troubleshoot issues encountered during our initial transformation attempts. We felt it would be helpful for another team to work with the protocol and identify if the procedure was too ambiguous or if there was only an issue with how we performed the procedure. Texas Tech was unable to transform using the Speer protocol, leading us to adapt and work with a new protocol that ultimately led to successful transformation of Lactobacillus plantarum with pMSP3535.
Overall, team UT Austin helped successfully facilitate a collaboration between Rice and Texas Tech, through a university-hosted research symposium, which allowed for individual and team presentation critiques and improvements. By providing the necessary materials and protocols for conducting a transformation via electroporation, team UT Austin gave Texas Tech the opportunity to learn and utilize a new technique to broaden possible laboratory skills for future use. Finally, team UT Austin provided guidance and mentorship to second-year team, Texas Tech, by clarifying any questions regarding presentations, wiki development, experimental focus and fulfilling medal requirements .

I. With Peking University (PKU)
Some of our experiments were conducted in PKU old biology building. We shared the lab equipments with the         iGEMers from PKU. They offered us valuable advice on the experiment designing, and helped us with lab skills         training in winter holiday. Yihao Zhang, the advisor of PKU iGEM team, also lent us plate reader, so we could         conduct Interlab and A.hydrophila sensor experiments smoothly. Without their help, we would not complete all         the experiments with the same efficiency.
II. With University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)
In July, we visited UCAS and had a meeting with their iGEM team members. We communicated our team projects and         gave suggestions in experiment designing to each other. They offered us useful advice on the potential safety         issues in our project and helped us to fixed them. We asked them some questions related to plasmid construction and helped them to clarify the experiment design. Moreover, we helped them to complete their human practice by         using bacteria transformed with chromoproteins to paint pictures on LB plates.

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

Back again to our SynRT, we made an improvement that we did a site-directed mutagenesis of sfGFP (BBa_I746916) and got sfGFP（BbsI free）for Golden Gate assembly. We would like to constructed a standard part of sfGFP(BbsI free)(BBa_K2541401). However, after several trials, we failed in ligation, then we decided to request TUST_China to help us. We sent them our plasmid for fluorescence measurement and primers for the construction of sfGFP(BbsI free). Luckily, they finished the construction for us and provided useful suggestions in ligation: you can increase the ratio of insert to vector, from 3:1 to 10:1. After the construction, they sequenced and sent it to us, which was correct.

5.XJTU-China
This year we collaborated with XJTU-China from Xi'an Jiaotong University and we helped them measure fluorescence, so they could get the relation between the concentration of psicose and fluorescence intensity. Furthermore, the relation between different concentration of psicose and pPsi promoter activation efficiency was obtained. We helped them verify that their Device A  (figure 7) works.
Figure 7. The plasmid backbone of device A.
PsiR is a repressor protein that binds to the pPsi promoter, rendering it inactive. Psicose and PsiR repressor proteins are combined to form a negative regulation induction system (similar to the IPTG and LacI), and psicose is added to the system to induce EGFP expression.
When they measured the Device A, the results were not quite as expected. They suspected that both LB culture medium and psicose in the system may probably make the bacteria grow. What’s more, the amount of psicose solution added to the system is not consistent, so different osmotic pressure may lead different growth conditions of bacteria. When our team did the measurement, we cultured the bacteria to OD=0.6 and then re-suspended the bacterial precipitation with MM culture medium."

Teams participating were Stanford-Brown, UC Santa Cruz, Santa Clara University, SF Bay Area DIY Bio, and ourselves. We had the opportunity to present our work through talks and posters, and even had time to socialize and hang out!
This Meetup was part of a larger conference, the Sierra Systems and SynBio Symposium, which our group integrally co-organized with the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) and Synberc (see more on our Practices Page ). This two-day event gave the chance for undergraduate students from various class levels to present their findings and network with local iGEM teams. Students in lab positions (not related to iGEM) were also part of this opportunity. During this symposium, session topics ranged widely from “protein structure and degradation” and “drug interactions and genomics,” to “biosynthesis and metabolism.” We even set up a four-person graduate school panel for students to open a forum for questions and inspire the students to continue their education. Since there was ample time for us to communicate and spend time with other iGEMers, we were able to share ideas, help each other with concepts, and deepen our understanding of life around us.

iGEM Team Aachen
The collaboration with the iGEM team Aachen started at the German team meetup in Marburg. It was a perfect match as their problem of solubility of non-canonical amino acids is based exclusively on the chemical nature of the amino acids. So we conducted a literature club and discussed some important general aspects regarding solubility. The solubility of their amino acids could be simulated for aqueous systems. The results lead to a change in the solvent from water to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). In the end, we were happy to help them getting back on track with their project.

iGEM Team Munich
As we were also testing fluorescent proteins on their function as photosensitizers we tried a broad variety of them, which we could not produce on our own. Hence, iGEM Team Munich helped us with highly purified eGFP modified with a Histidin-Tag. We demonstrated a slight impact on the performance of the solar cells built with titanium dioxide cells. However, this impact may lie within our standard deviation. For ZnO no enhancement could be observed. Thus, we tested the fluorescent protein as co-photosensitizer for closing absorption gaps yielding better results.
Figure 2: Basic idea of co-sensitized solar cell. Fluorescent protein provides an emission maximum at the absorption maximum of the dye (red star). The excited dye can transfer its electron to the ZnO layer.
iGEM Team Marburg
Last year, we started our first iGEM Team and needed some help to familiarize ourselves with all iGEM standards. Team Marburg hosted the German meetup, so we decided to attend to get new ideas and perhaps some"
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016," to detect the siderophores of pathogenic bacteria, we came up with the idea that we could provide the team with highly pure Lcn2 protein. This was a fruitful collaboration as our team's main PI, Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra, is one of the leading experts in the field of lipocalins [1] . For this reason, the expression constructs and the protocols to produce this recombinant protein are well established our affiliated lab. The main challenge in producing the recombinant protein was that the Sheffield iGEM team required the apo form of the protein without the bacterial siderophore as they aimed to scavenge siderophores from samples and then determine the siderophore content. Thus, we produced the recombinant protein in E. coli such that it was free from the siderophore generated in conventional E. coli strains.

The iGEM team from FAU Erlangen was working on the development of a biological photovoltaic cell, for which they aimed to use fluorescent proteins to harvest the photons. We saw their presentation at the iGEM Germany meet-up in Marburg, and as we used the purified recombinant eGFP for our own project in any case, we proposed to provide them with eGFP for their experiments. Luckily, at the ""Biotechnikum"" of the TUM, an annual lab course for bioprocess engineering students produces a large batch of eGFP in E. coli at a bioprocess scale of several hundred liters of culture medium. For our project, we were provided with ≈50 g of eGFP that we subsequently purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation as well as immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), and eventually dialyzed the protein against PBS. At the beginning of October, we provided 1.4 g of purified eGFP to the FAU Erlangen iGEM team.

NCTU_Formosa,2016,". This year Mingdao iGEM team constructs a biobrick that can express enzyme, alcohol oxidase (AOX), on the surface of E.coli. The long anchor of the E.coli is from the concept of 2015 NCTU_FORMOSA.
Method: We cultivated E.coli BL21 3mL containing the biobrick selecting with Chloromycetin, and the other one is the control which doesn’t have the plasmid. Then we centrifuged 1mL bacteria solution and added PBS to adjust the OD values are almost the same. Then we added TMB, a substrate of oxidase and react in the dark. The product can be analysis by OD650. Ultimately, we proved their biobrick is valid.
On the other hand, Mingdao iGEM team also characterized our Biobrick is valid to express the target protein. They run an SDS-PAGE of our Pantide and no plasmid bacteria. The result shows that our Pantide is successfully expressed.

UVA Meet-Up
The University of Virginia iGEM team invited us along with William & Mary, University of Delaware, UNC-Asheville, and the University of Maryland to the Virginia Mid-Atlantic Meetup event. Each team gave a short presentation on their project. After every two presentations, there were break-out sessions. Most of the collaboration took place during the breakout sessions. Due to this opportunity, we were able to discuss and ask questions to the other teams about their projects.  The discussions helped us think about our project on an introspective level.  Through our conversations with William & Mary, we realized the importance of the rate of protein expression in a vector and its relation to our protein expression rates.  Analyzing how each group presented improved our overall presentation technique. After every presentation and break out session the Community Bio Labs from Charlottesville presented and then we had one final breakout session. This break-out session was the most important because we were able to speak directly with someone who had used HCG and pregnancy tests as a detection device. The conversation made us think about the concentration levels pregnancy tests detect and how we may need to alter our detection mechanism.
Emory
Emory, this year, had a cool project that focused on an issue faced by water refinery plants. Emory found during their visit to their local WaterHub that a primary concern was to come up with an efficient way to deal with constant fluctuating orthophosphate levels. Emory, to address this problem, decided to experiment on increasing the efficiency of organisms to eat phosphate. We assisted Emory in this endeavor by working with four strains of Bacillus subtilis. Two of the strains were wild-type isolated from water donated by the Emory Waterhub, and two of the strains were commercially available Bacillus subtilis. The goal of our work was to see which strain could uptake the most phosphate.  To test the bacteria we the protocol provided by Emory, see tab labeled Emory protocol. Then we modified the protocol, see modified protocol. And, finally, because we were lucky enough to visit the Georgia Aquarium"
SZU-China,2016," of both of our technology, the labs of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University have more mature methods in using Electroporation and gene gun bombardment to transform Algal chloroplast , whereas professors from College of Life Sciences and Oceanography Shenzhen University have improved glass-bead method（Expression and molecular analysis of phbB gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Chinese Science Bulletin 2004 Vol.49 No.16 1713-1717）. With our complementary technologies as basis, FAFU-CHINA hoped to transform different locus of algae cells using various transformation technologies to improve their results. Therefore, FAFU-CHINA sent their vectors to us so that we could transform using glass-bead method, whereas we shared our Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains with FAFU-CHINA.
At the same time, we encountered some problems in construction of biobricks. Our antibiotics were always ineffective when we did plasmid amplification on psb1c3 and some other experiments, so the monoclonal bacteria cannot be transformed successfully. At the same time, we did not have enough psb1c3 plasmid for the coming experiments. Fortunately, FAFU-CHINA helped us in time, providing us with psb1c3 plasmid and chloromycetin. They also helped us find out the reasons of our failure. After repeated verification testing using enough experimental materials, we finally solved the problem and continued our experiment.
Collaboration with SUSTech Shenzhen
We focused mainly on the exchange of experimental materials in the collaboration with SUSTech Shenzhen. SUSTech Shenzhen encountered some problems when they did Interlab experiments, so they could not obtain a result in a short time. Their reagents were also consumed. We decided to provide them with our reagents and helped them with continuous experiments.
When our antibiotics were ineffective in doing biobrick, SUSTech Shenzhen gave us their amplified psb1c3 plasmids and chloromycetin which they were currently using. With enough materials, we did many testings, discussed possible problems and verified them one by one. Eventually we found out that our lab’s environment caused the lost of chloromycetin’s screening effect, then we solved the problem and continued to do successive experiments.

Mrs.Loya was fully supportive of incorporating Building with Biology activities into Farmwell’s 7th grade biology curriculum. The 7th grade team of science teachers, eager and hardworking to support their students’ learning in new and different ways, was equally important to the collaborative work we have begun at Farmwell.
Incorporation of Building with Biology activities to supplement a new genetic engineering component of the school curriculum. The expected outcome are; to enhance inquiry into the topic of synthetic biology while learning about its basics, to further explore this topic through conversations about its applications from perspectives of societal and environmental benefits, safety, etc., and to encourage students to think about problems they see and consider solutions that may include genetic engineering.
Mentoring and Advising Program to support co-curricular independent science research projects of students. Already begun, we are supporting the teachers by sharing our research expertise through prepared materials to help guide the research process and by meeting with students. We seek to encourage, motivate, support and foster long-term interest in being thinkers and problem solvers.
Stone Bridge High School
When we reached out to our County’s Science supervisor’s office in early August requesting lab to continue our iGEM work, Mrs. Jennifer Chang promptly put us in touch with Dr. Janet Cascio, an AP Biology teacher and the school’s Independent Science Research teacher. Collaborating with Dr. Cascio to share her lab space at Stone Bridge and use the lab’s equipment has been an essential part of moving our research project forward. Additionally, working with Dr. Cascio has been invaluable; she accommodated our schedules for before-school lab work in September and October and always made herself and the lab available during the school summer holidays in the month of August. Together, we worked through a starch/yeast measurement problem we initially had, and provided us with additional aerators for doing prototype testing with the Armstrong samples. Our collaboration with Stone Bridge was characterized by our common passion for doing research, learning new things, and solving problems.

Networking
While researching together is not only important but fun, the pleasures of networking should not fall too short.
This summer we enjoyed the privilege to be hosts to two other teams, one being team Wageningen which sent a representative on 2016-06-08. By this, we got the chance to have a personal glimpse on their project and to present ours the first time in front of another iGEM team. We had a lot of fun together exchanging ideas and talking about the iGEM competition!
The other team was team Aachen on the 2016-09-23. We invited them for a BBQ after we got to know each other on the iGEM Meet Up Germany on which we sparked each other’s interests in our projects. While having a great time talking about the innovations we had taken in our projects we got the time for chatting about milder hindrances, mostly in practical work. After some troubleshooting we had, it was made clear that networking is an important part of the iGEM competition.
We appreciate the great days we spent together. ❤

Collaboration with  BUCT-China
We received an invitation from BUCT-China during the process of the experiment. We get some information from the E-mail that the laboratory of BUCT-China team lacked the experience to measure the fluorescence value and they could not accurately control the time of fluorescence detection, and the lab was short of the 96-well plates for fluorescence detection. So BUCT-China sends us the collaboration letter. Our laboratory has enough resources to complete this experiment, so BUCT-China has designed a quantitative experiment and entrusted us to help measure the fluorescence value under different concentration gradient conditions of fatty acids.
The collaboration experiment have designed a total of four control groups. The first one is as a control group that only add 50 ul arabinose solution with 20% concentration. And the second group added 50ul Arabic sugar solution of 20%, and 100ul fat solution of different concentrations was added one hour later. The concentrations of fatty acids were 25mM, 50mM, 100mM, 200mM and 400mM, respectively. We need to add different gradients fatty acid solutions in the third group, and the concentration was the same as that of the second group, while the fourth group was the blank control group.
The fluorescence values measured after 8 hours of culture were as follows:
We have sent those data to the team BUCT-China to analyse.

Collaboration with Tongji University
Since the beginning of 2016, we have been kept in touch with the igem team of Tongji University to exchange our idea of projects. This year, their project is in the field of tumor hyperthermia and in the first place, had problem establishing their mathematical model of the diffusion rate of heat in cancer and the temperature variation of the normal tissues surrounding the tumor. After they knew that, in SJTU, we have specific courses on the tumor treating therapy and have some literal resources on tumor hyperthermia, they came to us for some help. We accepted the challenge and began with our work.
At first, we spent some time with their team leader and made clear their requisition. In the following days, we referred to our teaching resources and searched previous papers for clues and inspirations to solve the problem. After days of researching, we found a literature named ‘A mathematical model for predicting the temperature distribution in the laser-induced hyperthermia. Experimental evaluation and applications’ of great help. Based on the model in the paper and requisitions acquired through the communication with their team leader, we accomplished a mathematical model instruction for them in which contains the details of the model they need and waits them to adjust according to their specific experiment conditions and sent it to their team leader. He accepted our idea and thanked us warmly.

eXplaY model in collaboration with team Groningen
When team Groningen visited Vilnius and participated in the life sciences BioHackathon, we have spent many hours together while friendly communicating, as well as exchanging ideas about modeling our project. We intended to design a liposome-surface display system and team Groningen was so interested in SynDrop idea, that they even offered some help. Finally, through this collaboration a molecular thermodynamics model, called eXplaY , was built that we are grateful being able to use.
Mathematical model for necessity of mRNA addition to IVTT system
While creating our cell-free system we had hypothesized the necessity of adding initial mRNA over single DNA into our liposomes. With the help of team Edinburgh, mathematical model proving our theoretical concept was designed. This model might be helpful for creating more efficient cell-free systems for membrane protein research.

BostonU_HW,2017," the protocol. In order to make the design easier to use for the BostonU team, the control layer’s inputs were shared as much as possible.
Stage 3
The final stage of the collaboration was having the BostonU team test the final iteration of their chip design. Prior to visiting our lab, they were sent our Microfluidics 101 educational material, assembly protocols and chip usage protocols to review. This was in order to simulate the experience of a synthetic biologist using MARS to understand how our chips work.
Following this, their members practiced assembling and testing two existing microfluidic chips - PCR and DNA Digestion. Over the course of this they were able to feed back on the relevance of the educational material we had provided them with. This feedback was extremely valuable as it came from synthetic biologists with limited understanding of our hardware. Their feedback was noted and then integrated into our existing workflow. Finally, the BostonU Wetlab team assembled, tested and graded their chip design using a preliminary Fluid Functionality checklist. The results they gained through this testing, and the ability of the checklist to accurately represent the failures during the test, have been used to improve our grading system.
The chip design has since been added to the MARS Repository under “Fluorescence” and has been categorized as Quantification. For more information regarding the chip’s design and documentation, refer to its chip page on our Wiki.
Lead Assay Microfluidic | July - September 2017 | WPI iGEM
Our collaboration with WPI involved designing a microfluidic device that could perform a portion of their lead assay. This chip would use primitives designed by the BostonU Hardware team such as metering. Working on this chip emphasized the importance of coengineering microfluidics and synbio.
Stage 1
We first met the WPI iGEM team at NEGEM1, an event hosted by BostonU that invites New England iGEM teams to present their project plans and ideas to other teams. We discussed the potential for a collaboration between our two teams, and soon after we contacted each other via email. During our first Skype call we discussed some potential ideas for their collaboration. We decided that the goal of the collaboration would be to design a chip that could perform their lead assay. With this in mind, they sent us a PDF copy of their full protocol and we began planning a visit to BostonU. For more details regarding this assay, please visit the WPI iGEM team Wiki.

Collaboration with Nanjing_China
This year, our iGEM team has developed cooperative relationship with the Nanjing-China team. We have reached an agreement of helping each other examine the effectiveness of biobricks.
Firstly, we excised the EGFP cDNA form pEGFPN2 vector using restriction enzymes KpnI and NotI. Secondly, we inserted this cDNA into a vector pHisx6 that is commonly used for prokaryotic expression vector.
The bands appeared at 720bp, equal to the predicted length of EGFP coding sequence. This gel graphic indicates that we had successfully excited EGFP cDNA. Then, we transformed the recombinant vector into E. coli. We observed green fluorescence from the transformed E. coli under a fluorescence microscope.See more details (Nanjing_China)

Hypothesis:
      According to a great amount of research paper, the weather condition influences the maturation of pests to some extents. Take oriental fruit fly as an example; rainy days lead to their maturation. In contrast, low temperature results in a small group of oriental fruit fly. As a whole, in building this model, we presumed that there exists the connection between weather and group size of the pest.
Features:
      The features we chose to utilize included average day temperature, the highest day temperature, the lowest day temperature, rainfall, pressure, wind velocity and relative humidity.
Model selection:
      We are using two famous and frequently used models, Supported Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) in building the prediction system. In processing and testing data, the member of NYMU discovered that SVM made an incredibly great prediction (~100%) when the datasets are big enough, while RF has an average score of 80%. However, in some cases, when RF model reached 60~70% of accuracy score, SVM has 50% or worse. Thus, we decided to build a simple ensemble prediction model, with different hyperparameters and classifier. Moreover, choose the pest population size that most classifiers agree.

INSA-UPS_France,2017,"To test their algorithm they created a tool that iGEMers can use. The idea is to let people draw different mazes so they can test them.
Our mazes:
The robot is mainly going in circle and can’t find the exit when the way is too small. It’s easily trapped. It would have been interesting to have a bigger space designed for drawing.
Combination of two projects about cholera
Done with: Grenoble Team
We met the Grenoble Team to talk about our respective projects as they are both dealing with the cholera disease.
We designed a device using synthetic communication between 2 micro-organisms to detect and kill Vibrio cholerae in water. This device is user-friendly and can treat water before consumption thus avoiding cholera epidemic.
iGEM Grenoble designed a pathogen sensitive detector: SnapLab, a portable kit that will detect cholera. The greatest advantage of this device will be its capability to communicate the results to its user and to map the cases of cholera. One of the biggest advantages of the project is the fact that it can provide an energy independent solution available for physicians and on-site helpers to provide a relevant diagnosis. On the other hand, this solution is ready to use, avoiding all the preparation steps required in a laboratory.
Both teams were really aware that the crisis management must be enhanced to reduce the lethal cases of a disease that shouldn’t kill anymore! Our solutions are complementary and can really help locals NGO. Indeed, we provided a really helpful solution to decontaminate infected waters (one of the biggest vehicles of transmission) beforehand, while iGEM Grenoble can detect and monitors the evolution of an outbreak by providing an easy way to diagnose that disease. Both projects are complementary as one act to avoid epidemic to start and the other one enables a precise detection of the bacteria.
We could imagine a whole device integrating both project: the Croc’n cholera project of the INSA-UPS_France team does not integrate any tangible detection that could be compensated by the SnapLab. On the other hand Croc’n cholera leads to Vibrio cholerae destruction while SnapLab remains a detection tool.
In the end, it appears that a combination of our projects can reduce the length of an outbreak because we propose to find the sources of spreading and on the other hands to facilitates the access of healthcare by providing a good diagnosis solution.
Survey
From: Greece team
We made a survey about the cholera disease to know if people are aware of this disease as it does not occur in Western Countries. We already had many answers in France and the Greece Team proposed"
TU-Eindhoven,2012," we raised some questions concerning their differential equations. Soon the deadline approached and we have not seen any model results, but we hope we helped them along and that they create inspiring results with their model!
Request iGEM team of Cinvestav
We also responded to a request on the Matchmaker by NTNU-Trondheim. The iGEM team of Cinvestav requested information concerning advices, experiences and other useful information for future iGEM teams. We answered questions posed by the Cinvestav team, such as 'How to create new projects and ideas?' and 'What is the importance of human practices?'. We hope they have received plentiful input from the other iGEM teams, so they can set up an introductory document for new iGEM teams such as ourselves.
iGEM symposium Eindhoven
All Dutch and a few other iGEM teams from neighbouring countries, Germany and Belgium, are invited to join a symposium organised by iGEM team TU-Eindhoven. They are invited on the 3rd of October to have lunch, listen to some guest speakers about synthetic biology, present their own work and to enjoy this gathering with some late afternoon drinks. The aim of this symposium is to get some late critical comments from other iGEM teams and to practice the way to present their own work before the real deal at the Amsterdam iGEM Jamboree. Of course this afternoon is also meant to be a nice way of getting or staying in contact with each other and to have a great day together. Moreover, the entire symposium is open to the public and fellow students and employees have also been invited. If you are one of the teams flying in early to the Netherlands and you want to practice your presentation and receive valuable feedback, you are most welcome to join our symposium!

BostonU_HW,2018,"
This initial chip consists of four inputs, one for the initial sample and the other three are used to dilute that initial sample by adding water. Following each addition of water are mixer so that the liquids are mixed into one homogenous, dilute solution. While the chip works in theory, for this design to work, the initial flow rate of the initial sample is 0.1 or 0.01 mL/hour. This slow rate alongside the larger dimensions of these channels made using this chip unfeasible. And it was redesigned with smaller features.
Version 2
In an attempt to solve the problem of multiplying flow rates faced by the last chip, this version tried to siphoned off three quarters of each dilution through varying resistance. The hope was to mitigate the dramatic increase in flow rates further downstream by only allowing a portion of the flow to continue through the chip, thus allowing faster initial flow rates then those used in the previous chip design. Unfortunately, by creating a path with an intentionally lower resistance, all the flow was redirected to this path instead of just 75% intended to follow this path. This left no fluid to continue through the rest of the chip.
Version 3
This chip is similar in design to that of the original version of this chip with the two primary differences being smaller feature sizes and the addition of more outputs and accompanying valves. The point of smaller feature dimensions is to decrease the wait time, even when using the small flow rates used in the initial chip design. The valves are used for two purposes: testing and timing. This chip was tested with a member of the 2018 BostonU iGEM team using a green fluorescent protein as the initial sample in order to determine the accuracy of each dilution.                 The valves leading to the additional output ports provides
manipulation of the fluid and the ability to collect a sample after each dilution instead of just the third. After testing the system, relying on visual cues to facilitate each dilution, it was determined that the some math modeling needed to be done to determine the timing needed for each mixer to reach a steady state before collecting each of the three outputs.

Waterloo
uOttawa has historically collaborated with Waterloo iGEM . This year, Waterloo helped us to construct and analyze a mathematical model for our genetic network. They also helped to compare this model to existing ones from literature, and to find parameters that make tri-stability possible.
We helped Waterloo by improving their DNA assembly workflow, and attempting to assemble a troublesome plasmid. However, a crucial DNA fragment chronically failed to PCR. Nevertheless, we continued to assist Waterloo by troubleshooting their own DNA assembly with particularily problematic parts.
Ontario iGEM (oGEM)
Five iGEM teams from Ontario (uOttawa, McMaster , Toronto , Queen's , and Waterloo ) continued an initiative to create a larger Canadian presence in synthetic biology and iGEM. This initiative, Ontario iGEM (or oGEM), helps each team to solidify their projects throughout the summer. oGEM also has crucial connections with all of its affiliated universities, industry, and the Ontario Genomics Institute, which helps with finding resources to fund each team.
uOttawa, being a rather senior team among oGEM, contributed with many years of experience to improve the work of the other teams. We mentored other teams on how to assemble DNA cheaply and efficiently, how to select protocols and chassis organisms, and how to present the project effectively to iGEM. In particular, we helped McMaster, a team new to iGEM, on how iGEM works and how to most effectively perform the cutting-edge science that we do all summer.

JMU_Wuerzburg,2018,": During our regular skype conference Team Munich provided us with useful information about the wiki the Giant Jamboree and the design of the BioBricks.
At first, we introduced a new project abstract to replace the outdated version of our project description. For an example they sent us their abstract. Several members of Team Munich conducted some final proofreading to shorten our abstract text and advised us for the finishing touches on it.
Our questions about the documents and texts necessary for the judges to evaluate our work were also answered in a following mail. Furthermore, they gave us some advice on how to process our protocols for the wiki. Our doubts whether to use screenshots of programs we used to analyse our data were also eliminated.
But the main part of the meeting was consumed by a conversation about the Giant Jamboree and how to conduct a good presentation. To keep these things in mind, Eni emailed us a list with all the aspects to consider for creating an impressive appearance. They also told us that a hardware demonstration during the presentation is not allowed.
In the end Eni explained to us how to design and dispatch the BioBricks and gave us the hint to use the program “benchling” for an easier design of the BioBrick.
Collaboration Team JMU_Wuerzburg and Team Tuebingen
We sat together with Team Tuebingen to discuss the most urgent issues in the first months of initiating an iGEM team: “How does this wiki thing work?”, “What is Human Practice?”, “Which university staff are the right ones to bother with certain problems?”, “And how in the world do you raise enough money to pay the registration fee?”. Team Tuebingen has answered all our questions and has provided plenty of information to us giving a first impression of how iGEM works.
We followed their advice on how to get in touch with biotech companies and visited the Analytica fair in Munich. As a benefit we were able to overcome all the initial lab material shortages. Besides gaining experience in talking to companies, we met iGEM team Duesseldorf for the first time. After getting started and managing to find sponsors for our emerging project, team Tuebingen continued to support us regarding further iGEM formalities. They also supported us with helpful advice for the submission of the Safety Form.
Furthermore, team Tuebingen has offered to review our website and invited us to participate in a presentation workshop to practice for the Giant Jamboree.

I.Collaboration with NJU_CHINA(CLICK)
NJU_CHINA helped us by constructing one of our TAL effectors (TALE1) using Golden Gate technique. They also edited the original vector pTAL1 provided by the Kit to add EcoRI, SpeI and PstI cutting cite, thus ensuring the engineered TAL effector can meet the RCF10 bio-brick standard. This new vector was then used when we construct the other two TAL effectors ourselves. We really appreciate their assistance in our experiment.
In return, we performed nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) for NJU_CHINA to help them to have a more precise determination of the quantity and size of secreted exosomes.
The use of Nanosight enabled quantification and size determination of the EV, as nanoparticles can be automatically tracked and sized based on Brownian motion and the diffusion coefficient. Because exosomes are more homogenous and generally smaller than most EVs with a diameter size ranging from 40 to 120 nm, the percentage of nanoparticles whose size ranges from 40 to 120 nm could be a good indicator of total amount of exosomes. The shift of peak of size distribution of EV from 170 nm to 120 nm and the significant raise of the peak indicated the increase of relative level of exosomes in secreted EVs after overexpression nSMase2 in HEK293 cells.
The result proved the feasible and effective improvement of manufacturing exosomes by overexpressing nSMase2.

Tuebingen,2018," this fusion protein is of smaller size, which allowed us to include longer MD simulations in our tight schedule for simulation on our hardware.
Structural Analysis
In the initial step of the deimmunization workflow, we required a stable protein structure to be able to  evaluate the influence of possible point mutations. For this purpose, we performed two 50 ns MD simulations, the first using the isolated l-fucose Mutarotase (PDB ID: 2WCV) domain and the second the l-fucose isomerase/Ovispirin (PDB ID: 1HU5) fusion protein.  To simulate the proteins of our collaboration partner, we used the MD simulation software GROMACS, as it is a widely used tool with an excellent performance. For the force field we chose AMBER99SB, due to the fact that it is generally applicable and well established.

The RMSD has been calculated on the coordinates of the backbone atoms of the isomerase domain
The simulation of the FucU isomerase protein for 50 ns without AMP shows a RMSD of about 0.25 nm which indicates some minor conformational changes in the beginning of the simualtion, stabilizing in the last 20 ns of the simulation (Figure 2.1/2.2).
The simulation of the FucU isomerase together with the AMP ovispirin as subunit shows more drastic changes to the tertiary structure of the fusion protein. The RMSD value reaches a value of 0-7-0.8 nm in the time span of 50 ns. This can be explained by the fact, that we manually concatenated the isomerase protein with the crystal structure of the ovispirin protein"

Model of the plasmid loss
We want to thank Aix-Marseille team for the great help they give to us.       The aim of the model they conceived for us is to assess the evolution of plasmids throughout the culture,       to determine which parameters can matter in the loss of those plasmids,       and to precise what are the probabilities for a bacteria to loose its plasmids during cell division.       As a plasmids can be a disadvantage for growth (energy spent into replicating processes) or a advantage       (protection against a toxin) this question is hard to answer.       But in this situation, where one type of plasmid can influence on the presence of the other type of plasmid in (and reciprocally)       in the same bacteria, the question become too tough to answer and only a mathematical model can resolve such a interrogation!

iGEM UPO Sevilla Collaboration
From our modelling and computational work came the wonderful opportunity to colaborate with another iGem team, UPOSevilla.  Both teams were working on metabolic analysis, and had developed a tool to facilitate analysis of complex enzymatic pathways. However, our two aproaches were quite diferent. Sevilla’s team focused on velocity and straight-forwardness with a C script that took the input as text files and displayed the output as another text file, a log of the different concentrations of the different compounds over time. Visualitzation or post-processing of the data was left to the user, which made the program more modular, albeit less user friendly. Our approach, Polyenzime, was a bit widder in scope, incorporating inhibition reactions and source/sink nodes, and consisted on a GUI where the user could intuitively create and run the pathways, obtaining the evolution of the system in handy graphics without further ado.
Comparing the two prespectives on the same problem gave us the opportunity to further develop our approach, strengthing its downsides (implementation of a runge-kuta algorithm to make the integration more robust), and reinforcing the advantages (improving the user experience in a variety of ways). We could also interchange valuable feedback that lead to some bug-fixes and improvements. This would not have been possible without intensive comunication between the teams, and we thank the collegues at Sevilla for the patience and support trough our programming endavours.
With the wide array of topics iGEM comprises, finding another team with a common front to collaborate with may be difficult. We were lucky to have that opportunity, and we belive that the project has improved and gained context as a consequence.
In the image we can see a model of UPO-Sevilla’s team represented in our software.

iGEM Stockholm and iGEM Aalto-Helsinki wrote collaboratively the HumHub report and it has been edited by iGEM Alto-Helsinki and iGEM Pasteur.
→ Here is the report written by iGEM Pasteur:
How does iGEM Pasteur imagine the HumBub platform? The iGEM Pasteur team imagined the HumHub platform to be a new and original communication tool for all iGEM teams. Indeed, every iGEM team will be able to communicate, share and discover different ideas and experiences.
WE IMAGINED A FEW RUBRICS ON THIS PLATFORM.
« First step in Igem competition » This tab is dedicated for every new iGEM team. In fact, our team is taking part in this competition for the first time and we admit that we had a lot of uncertainties about the proceedings of the competition, the organization, how to use different tools available… « Synbio tools » One of the major problem that we encountered was to determine a lab calendar of all the experiment we had to do. Also, we can imagine a rubric that will regroup all tools that are used by other teams and some video tutorials about how to use this tools.  This rubric would be a great help for new teams that are looking for some experiences and advertisements from experimented teams. « Collaborations » One of the philosophy of the iGEM is sharing. Communication and collaborations between teams is very important. However, it is difficult to start a conversation with a team without a real discussion platform! Sometimes, teams don’t answer our mails or it just takes a long time. Video conferences are possible by Skype, but we have to ask for a personal account from a team member to discuss. It would be easier to centralize all team and team members’ emails on a database that will be accessible in the HumHub platform. We could communicate faster. If possible, even develop a messaging app between teams and team members to facilitate the exchange. Here, teams would be able to talk about their project and to share with other teams that are working on a close field. Each team can use different tags in order to identify their projects and facilitate the  Private communication between two, three or as many teams will be possible. Public communication with every team will also be possible, for example to share the surveys. Moreover, any team would be allowed to share new ideas of project to create together. We imagine that someone will post an idea of project and interested teams would be able to be put in touch with them. « Forum"

    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed"
UChile-OpenBio,2015," team invited us to participate in a survey for their policies and practices work for researching how reporting of results is viewed in the iGEM community to discuss the concept of negative results; a negative result is one that indicates that your system does not work as you intended. Also they wanted to investigate the experience iGEM teams have had with reading older wikis this 2015 as a source of inspiration. The team was very worried about how scientists and iGEM teams emphasize some parts of a project and play down others to its convenience, occulting important information about a negative results that could be useful to other, for example, to next iGEM teams.
This survey incentive us to include a section of negative results in our wiki as a valuable report to a next iGEM team of our university; we are the first one!
Nankai iGEM Team from Tianjin, China
This team invited us to participate in a survey as a part of his human practice, where they hope to set up an all-round resource sharing platform called iShare. The survey had only 11 questions on the questionnaire. Its principal motivation was during the summer, where they ran into many problems working on their experiments. The lack of materials was one of the major difficulties for they, who had to acquire those materials from other laboratories. So they suggest a special webpage or a section on wiki for iGEM teams to list the materials they use in their experiments they are willing to share.
We had some similar problems when our enzyme digestion (EcoRI, SpeI) was lost. We guess this platform could be very useful to guide new teams. It had been helpful to us if this platform would have been implemented before.

Even cancer cells collaborate so that they can invade our bodies and spread their wrath. For us, collaboration is a superpower that has produced incredible discoveries in the medical and scientific field.And it is the superpower that we can all turn to to inspire us to create something bigger than ourselves,that will help make the world a better place. Collaboration is the superpower that our team turn to, to help us fight cancer. And we are confident that with the right collaborations, we will beat this terrible disease.
iGEM is a great platform for us to improve ourselves. Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. Not only we can gain experiences from our own project, but also by learning from other teams to spark more innovative inspiration. Throughout the course of our project, we interacted with many teams and helped each other out in meaningful ways. Here is a record of ours collaborations.
XI’AN JIAOTONG - LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY (XJTLU )
During the later half of the iGEM season, our team was fortunate enough to be able to collaborate with the XJTLU  iGEM  team. Together, we gave feedback on each other’s projects face to face in Shanghai’ s meeting.They helped us have a deeper understand of Model, and offered their suggestions about  our project design. And also, we proposed ours  idea about how to characterize their biobricks. Except the verbal communication, we do have experimental collaborations. As both our projects are related to exosome, which functions as a vehicle to carry target particles, we offered our exosome-booster biobrick when they get stuck in its construction. At the same time, they helped us finished our exosome-booster’s efficiency model. More details for model ,please click here
Nanjing Agricultural University (NAU-CHINA)
11th Aug, our two teams had a meet together in Nanjing Agricultural University, we negotiated intentions of two teams’ projects and discussed experimental undertakings. We soon realized that it would be more significant to use a model to predict the loss of inducers because of drug metabolism or biotransformation"
UCL,2015," genetic engineering and probiotics. As survey was translated into 5 different languages including Spanish, French, Portuguese and German we have collaborated with iGEM teams from all around the world to collect as many data as possible as well as see how people's opinion on these topics varies from country to country.
All our collaborators received a badge to express our gratitude for the joint collaboration.The teams that collaborated with us were:

2015 Oxford Team: short video assays on Synthetic biology and Health
In August 2015, members of the Oxford and UCL iGEM teams met up in London to get a grasp of the way people perceive Synthetic Biology applications in healthcare. The discussions worked as a platform for a collaboration between the Manchester-Graz, UCL and Oxford teams. In this joint initiative, they were able to gather some exciting new ideas on how to better develop an iGEM project that targets health conditions such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), schizophrenia and other mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.

Exeter,2016," toxic to produce, any cell which is producing less or no protein will grow faster than a cell which is producing the toxic protein. This means a mutated, non-functional promoter will have a proliferative advantage during transformation. So, as we were sending our BioBricks for registry for submission, we decided to sequence the minipreps of KillerRed and KillerOrange as well with the registry standard pSB1C3 sequencing primer VF2, to check for any mutations. The results are shown below in screenshots of a plasmid editor software called ApE.
Both plasmids had the BioBrick prefix, and the correct sequence for both KillerRed and KillerOrange open reading frame, according to the papers cited on the Exeter 2016 iGEM wiki. The sequence between the prefix and the ATG start codon, we checked against lac-repressible promoters in the iGEM registry. We found a match to R0184, which is a T7 lac-repressible promoter. T7 promoters require T7 polymerase to be transcribed, as they are not recognised by E. coli polymerases. This results confirms the result of the fluorescence measurements. No KillerRed or KillerOrange protein was observed by fluorescence, as neither gene was being transcribed by either DH5α or DH5α.Z1 as neither strain produces the required T7 polymerase. A protein overexpression E. coli strain such as BL21
which has the T7 polymerase gene inserted into its genome is designed to use T7 promoters would have been able to express these KillerRed and KillerOrange constructs.
Sequencing result for KillerRed:

Collaboration
This year FAFU-CHINA team has siginificantly collaborated with other universities in various ways, including lab troubleshooting, modeling, functional verification and so on.
Lab troubleshooting
There are loads of teams using Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis as their chassis this year. So do we. Compared with E. coli and many gram-negative bacteria are transformed easily by pretreatment with divalent metal ions before the addition of plasmid DNA, it’s notoriously difficult to manage the condition of transformation for those lack of experience. Nature transformation of gram-positive bacteria is only know to occur among Bacillus subtilis and few species of Staptococcus. What the point is many protocols now in use must be painstakingly adjusted for individual strains to achieve satisfactory results. Actually, we were stuck into the transformation of our chssis as well, before we made it, a lot of blank vector control experiments were done to find out the best condtion, electroporation by adjusting all walks of parameters. It took us so long time, finally we made it by protoplasting and the we helped SCU-WestChina and WHU-China . For more information about protocol, pleas click here .
WHU-CHINA also helped us to measure the organic acid secreted fromour hyperaccumulator qualitatively HPLC. Thanks a lot.
Modeling
Based on the data and information we provided, BNU-China helped us to construct a PSB-assisted phytoremediation dynamic system mathematical model for the implementation. The whole system was separated by three main processes——the phytoremediation process, the organic ptoduction process and the bingding of heavy metal ion with MBP secreted by modified Bacillus megaterium. The effect factors of the system are complex under lab condition not mention to physical circumstances which refers to the soil properties, the concentration of heavy metal ions, the population and equilibrium of bacteria, the degradation rate of protein and a series of chemical reaction. Although in this case, BNU-China helped us predict the feasibility of our project in almost perfect way. And according to the positive feedback done by them, our projected is worthy of further"
Edinburgh_UG,2018," valuable feedback. Moreover, it was one of the first experience to present our project as well. We attended a number of workshops and talks of speakers, some of them being Dr. John Collins, Dr. Tom Ellis, Dr. Piers Millet, and Dr. Karen Polizzi.
Hosting Meetup with Newcastle team
If you have ever heard about The Edinburgh Festival Fringe (the world's largest arts festival) you probably know how crazy it gets with hundreds of thousands of people hanging around. Thus, on 20th of August, we decided to step back for one day from wet lab work and invited Newcastle iGEM team to talk and discuss our projects and then to see some comedy shows afterwards. Both teams had some comments for each other, and we were very happy to share the experience.
Bits and pieces
Besides meetups, labwork, we also had talks and chats with many other iGEM teams, as it always nice to have a chat about something different.
Mike the Microbe
Mike the microbe from Carroll iGEM team visited us. It was so nice to have a picture of a beautiful sciency bacteria on our lab bench that kept reminding us of importance of lab safety!

NTNU Modelling Collaboration
After we came up with a model of DNA Origami arms and the sequences for them and how they would bond we wanted to model the probability of the E.coli arms forming fully and how this probability would change as length of the arms increased. We came up with a basic model but thought it would be beneficial if we sought outside help with the mathematics.
We got in contact with NTNU to ask for assistance and they came back with a stochastic method for calculating said probabilities. After discussing the problem further we came up with various equations such as S_i= Σ_j (K_i,j /  Σ_j K_i,j ) log K_i,j / E_j[K_i,j], where S is how well a zinc finger binds to an arm and P_i = S_i / W (S_i) where P is the probability of formation for that zinc finger arm.

Oxford Collaboration
One part of our project was create a DNA origami glue using a biobrick part from the distributed kit, specifically part BBa_K314110. Once we had designed it, we decided to collaborate with Oxford's iGEM team to help get it made.
Oxford's team sped up he production of our DNA origami by conducting a PCR using primers we had designed and sent to them to create seven PCR products, six of which would be directly used to create the DNA origami.
Once we received the PCR products, we combined and annealed them to form DNA origami structures, which could then be viewed under an electron micrograph.

We had one particular experiment which repeatedly caused an issue for us at the gel extraction stage. We found it difficult to get consistent results when using our gel extraction protocol, and thought it could be due to issues with the ethidium bromide gel we were using.

Collaboration
WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute
This year, the BU iGEM team collaborated with the WPI-Worcester iGEM team.
The collaboration became possible at the NEGEM meet up in June, where six New England iGEM teams presented their project ideas to the rest. During one of our small group discussions, a team member from WPI talked about how lucky we, the BU team, were to get access to a flow cytometer for single cell fluorescence measurement. Right then, the two teams decided to collaborate: we would test some of their constructs on our flow cytometer and they would view cells expressing our devices with their confocal microscope.
They gave us two copies of the same construct, one in a chloramphenicol resistant backbone and the other in an ampicillin resistant backbone. The device has BclA-YFP , which is a cell surface targeted protein to express YFP on the cell surface. We also ran one of our own single color YFP controls, which is listed at ""Internal YFP"" as this is not targeted to the cell surface. It should be noted that this control is in a kanamycin backbone.
The results our shown below. For details on how we converted the arbitrary YFP units to MEFLs, please see the TASBE Tools page for information about controls required to do that conversion.
Fluorescent measurements of three devices expressing YFP. The BclA-YFP parts were provided by WPI while the Internal YFP is one of the control parts provided by Boston University.
The WPI team took micrographs of cells containing tandem promoter- RFP testing constructs. We gave them media with two concentrations of arabinose (1 mM and 100 mM) and aTp (100 ng/mL"

Collaboration with CCA San Diego iGEM Team
During the 2017-2018 iGEM season, our team, TPHS-San Diego, collaborated with the CCA-San Diego iGEM team. During the collaboration, we discussed numerous issues such as part submission, team wiki troubleshooting, and safety precautions. For part submission, our team received help with the process of submitting the part on the part registry page. They were able to instruct us on this, and as a result, we were able to successfully submit the part. In addition, there were some aspects of coding the wiki that both of our teams needed to work out. Through our collaboration, both of our teams were able to improve upon our website design. Finally, we decided to make a compilation of videos that would be helpful to future iGEM teams, and our team created a lab safety component of the video included in the overall video for iGEM.

We believe that our experience in iGEM should go beyond our own projects to learn more from others and disseminate our ideas. Having received some generous help from other iGEM teams, we figured that we should also try our best to give a helping hand to those teams in need. Here in the Collaborations page, you will see the highlights of our interactions with other teams.
With Worldshaper-XSHS/Worldshaper-Wuhan/ASTWS-China
We were very lucky to work with these amazing teams to spread our ideas and engage with public in Zhejiang Science&Technology Museums. We successfully induced attention from public and evoked children’s interest in biology and biochemistry by performing some eye catching experiments in front of them. Our efforts were even on some local magazines after the successful event.
To learn more about the event, visit our Human Practice page.
With Team Worldshaper-XSHS
During our interlab study, we encountered difficulty attempting to extract enough DNA from the distribution kit plates to transform our competent cells. We have tried to optimize the standard transformation protocols by pipetting more diluted DNA into the competent cell culture and centrifuging the plate in order to promote further dilution, but still transformed cell colonies can hardly be obtained. Consequently, we suspected that the DNA plate could be contaminated or corrupted.
Under this circumstance, we reached out to several other iGEM 2017 teams nearby for help with the transformation. Eventually we got in touch Worldshaper-XSHS  which was willing to help us by providing transformed cells and hoped to use the plate reader in our lab for data collection.

Duke IGEM team
In iGem this year, our team has reached out to the Duke University and collaborated with their team. Members of Team Duke have visited Gaston Day School and held meeting with us to discuss our projects. We interchanged opinions about each other’s projects, and one of the members of Team Duke, who graduated from Gaston Day iGEM Team, volunteered to become a communication bridge between our team and Duke. Team Duke will provide us competent cells and help us with transformation of colicin from original stocks into plates that contain antibiotic resistance.
Building with Biology at Schiele Museum and Surveys
We received a grant from Building With Biology that allowed us to provide bioengineering knowledge in an entertainable way to local community. We communicated with The Schiele Museum of Natural History & Planetarium and cooperated together to hold some educational events. The Schiele Museum hosted our hands-on activities on Sunday Sept. 25 and the discussion-based forum on Thursday September 29.
We have received several surveys to fill out from different teams, including University of Virginia, Munich United and a program named “Enabling Factors in biotech”. By completing the surveys, we provide valuable information for their projects."

Overview
Science is a richly collaborative endeavor. Our achievements were also symbolic for the many important suggestions and contributions made by a cadre of talented team members from other universities of iGEM 2016. Meanwhile, we went great length to provide our help as more as possible. So glad we’ve received warm friendship with each other.

Team Fudan need tet-on or tet-of promoter to get tetO element and miniCMV as the promoter to drive their genes of interest. Vice professor Wenwen Jia in our school works on apparent heredity field, happens to have tet-on kit for his work. We made contact with Pro. Wenwen Jia and gained 3μl.
We also asked him for the associating kit that responses to panmycin and send the signal to promoter. Team Fudan used these two kits to PCR and continued their experiments. At the same time, Team Fudan had provided great help either. They built their kit ahead of us, and they generously provided almost all of the materials that we gonna need for kit submitting.(15 ml of chloromycetin powder,8 chloramphenicol resistance plates,80ml chloramphenicol resistance LB,Enzyme of XbaI and SpeI each 3μl)

Accessible Wiki - The Collaboration
We didn’t want to stop at designing our own wiki barrier-free to make the results of the iGEM competition accessible to everyone. Because, let’s face it, there are many  more amazing and interesting projects out there. This is why we decided to encourage other teams to design their wiki accessible, too. By participating in  this collaboration, all parties benefit. Firstly, people with vision impairment can access the web pages easily. Secondly, the teams create a broader audience for their results. Lastly and most importantly, this collaboration is spreading awareness to the issue of an inclusive society that is long overdue.
For this to happen, we put together a guide containing the basic criteria needed for an accessible website. Click here to get to our accessible wiki guide. After spreading our campaign over social media we contacted over 80 teams in personal messages. Interestingly, the majority of the other teams had never heard of accessible web design. Some did and had already implemented some criteria into their wiki.

A very special THANK YOU goes out to the iGEM team of the Sorbonne University of Paris! After the initial contact they were highly motivated to contribute. We were thrilled to have found a team that was equally excited about this project as we were and still are. Several long and substantial mails later, both of our teams could improve our wikis. The team of Sorbonne gave us tips on how to design our wiki as responsive as possible and introduced us to e.g. tags so that your browser can recognize the language you’re writing in and by this the browser can translate it to other"
NYMU-Taipei,2017," by assisting our characterization of shuttle vector with Holin- Endolysin- NrtA system ( BBa_K2350021 ), and measurements of growth curve with Escherichia coli DH5α, by adding lactose to induce kill-switch, in order to determine whether the suicide system works. With their assistance, we verified that concentration of E.coli significantly decrease after kill-switch functioned in different lactose concentrations.
Figure 1 TAS_Taipei independently tested the function of our lactose-induced kill-switch system. In different concentrations (0-250 mM) of lactose, it induced decreasing on bacteria population.
Teach about conducting site-directed mutagenesis
We have also shown mutual friendship for our long-lasting relationship by teaching them how to conduct site-directed mutagenesis as well as assay biofilm production. Also, two TAS students, Catherine Chang and Leona Tsai, are also NYMU team members. This year, they help us communicate with team TAS_Taipei, finish public outreach for Human Practice, and present our project at the 5th Annual Asia Pacific Conference and the Giant Jamboree.
Link: Safety
Oversea team collaborations, we gain advice, melanin, from Tokyo Tech and put it into our pigment project. With help from Peshawar, we ensure our transformed E. coli can produce our target protein, NrtA protein.
Pakistan: Team Peshawar
We sincerely appreciate the invitation from team Peshawar in Pakistan for team collaboration. NrtA part has been constructed by our team, and its sequence has also been determined. We submitted the part to team Peshawar for examination of protein electrophoresis in September. Team Peshawar has successfully transformed the plasmid containing NrtA gene sent by us, and the transformants were lysed and the SDS-PAGE was performed. Following are the step by step processes that team Peshawar followed to help us in confirming whether the protein is properly synthesized in the cell by running the protein on gel i.e. 45k Da.
The conclusion of our collaboration reminds us of modifying our design by taking signal peptide under consideration. In fact, we have conducted a functional test for determining the capability of NrtA with a semi-permeable membrane system. The function of NrtA protein has been proved valid but still had much to be desired. Taking signal peptide under consideration, we may transfer the protein to the plasma membrane or even to extracellular fluid. Therefore, the capability of NrtA-transformant may be enhanced significantly. The collaboration really inspired"
