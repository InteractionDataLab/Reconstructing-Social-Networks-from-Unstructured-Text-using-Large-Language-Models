Sorbonne Université Paris
One of our team members has a friend at Sorbonne , who kindly put us in contact with their iGEM team. As they knew we have architecture students in the team they asked us to produce a visual for their human practices.   They sent us over an initial sketch, once this was received we used our imaginations and attempted to visualise this part of their project for them. The image shows a semi-permeable membrane which would contain their genetically modified bacteria, anchored to the sea bed - but not so deep that they wouldn’t receive any light. This would prevent their bacteria from being released into the environment.
University of Warwick
To aid Warwick in their project we collected a series of water samples from bodies of water in areas surrounding Newcastle.

5th CCIC in Shanghai Tech University
During the summer vacation, our team members, Chang Yanqi and Tan Tianhao and Xu Jiaxian, went to ShanghaiTech University to        participate in 5th CCIC(Conference of China iGEMer Community).
Xu Jiaxian, one of our team members, took the position as a ‘judge’ in CCIC. He gave comments and advices to other teams.
We gave a presentation and showed our poster during CCIC, then we received a feed back saying that more focus should be paid on the        safety of U24 and our modeling is very well. Really thank you, Team ShanghaiTech!

2018 iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting
In May, our team members, Tang Yuluan and Ruan Shaolin and Xu Feihong, went to Shenzhen for the Southern China Regional Meeting.       At that time, most of the teams haven’t made many progresses in experiment. Eight teams from southern China, not far from each        other, decided to have a meeting to exchange ideas, experience and funny things.
Xu Feihong, one of our team members, lost her mobile phone on the taxi. Friends from Shenzhen University connected the taxi driver        and posted the mobile phone to Guangzhou.
Really thank you, Team SZU-China!

InterLab Data
Collaboration is an important part of the iGEM experience. Some teams may not have access to equipment that other teams may have freely available to them. Through collaboration, teams can accomplish more work together than they could on their own. During the course of our work, we worked with a number of teams, both in and our of the lab.
Boston University WetLab
We worked with Boston University for a lab-based collaboration. The Boston University team perform quantitative analysis on the fluorescence of our wild type and ACG mutant eGFP, both containing a plasmid for RFP to indicate the presence of our guide RNA. The flow cytometry data obtained from this collaboration was necessary to confirm two things: that our GFP reporter worked and that our method of microscopy analysis was valid. In order to confirm that our GFP based promoter and it's mutant ACG GFP protein functioned properly, we needed flow cytometry data on how much our normal GFP and mutant GFP fluoresced when compared to a non-altered eGFP protein. Secondly, we needed flow cytometry to confirm that the measurement method we used to analyze our fluorescing cells (imaging the cells at set exposure lengths) using a program that measured fluorescence values of the image, was a valid method of obtaining data.
Results of our Flow Cytometry collab are shown below.
The flow cytometry data gathered from the BU Wetlab team confirmed the differential expression of the GFP protein between the normal ATG GFP and our ACG GFP mutant. The collaboration also confirmed that our fluorescent microscopy technique for analyzing our cells was also valid, as the flow cytometry data closely matched the data from microscopy.
For our contribution to their lab work, we provided microscopy visualization of the transfections that they had done. We analyzed the fluorescence of several of their reporter proteins to confirm their findings. Specifically, we analyzed cells expressing different combinations of GFP,RFP, and BFP. Each set of cells was analyzed for green, red, and UV level fluorescence and their images were sent back to the Boston University Wetlab team for analysis.

We attended the China iGEM Southwest Union(iSWU) this year and have an overall assessment of the safety and feasibility of our project and the latest trend of iGEM competition including the newly added judging terms.
When attending to SCU-WestChina, we suggested that they could change the microbial chassis of their dialysis part from Salmonella Typhimurium to Bacillus Subtilis to better ensure safety. And we are glad it helped.

We offered some genes from 2016 iGEM Distribution Kit to SCU-WestChina when they turned to us, and it’s our pleasure to help.
2.SCU-China
a.iSWU 2017
When attending China iGEM Southwest Union(iSWU), SCU-China shared their 3 alternative projects, one of which is about oral vaccine of rabies. Our professor suggested that such immunology experiments are extremely time-consuming and the results of such experiments usually are non-predictable, which may be exceedingly hard to finish the project of oral vaccine rabies in no more than 3 months. They finally picked up the project Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E.coli, and hope they can make a great job on it.

This year, we aimed to build a quorum sensing tool kit based on the Agr system from the Gram-positive bacteria--Staphylococcus aureus. However, we had difficulties synthesizing the genes agrC and agrA in plasmids, and therefore, the experiments were not able to conduct. Fortunately, XJTLU-China had the similar construction and provided us with their group I Staphylococcus aureus’s agrC and agrA genes.

We also scraped data from past iGEM websites and saved into a csv file.
The file is initially used by the team to search for similar projects on CRISPR and RNA-targeting. It gathers various information, including title, abstract and content from project pages. The csv file was announced through the iGEM collaboration page, and we shared the file with multiple teams. We are glad that the file is used by Team Groningen for data visualization and analysis.

Introduction
As a team, one of our favourite parts in iGEM have been collaborations. They reminded us that iGEM is not only a competition but a chance to share and let other teams be a part of your project, and that is wonderful. Below is shown the different universities that have collaborated with us. By clicking in the index or in the images you can go directly to the explanation.

Team Project
When explaining Printeria to people, we see they are reticent to use it because of the genetically modified bacteria that we do. A part of our project is to fight the stigma against synthetic biology and Harvard was claiming for teams disposed to do so. 
Collaboration
Their collaboration was about doing a report of your project and then Harvard team would create a series of newsletters and articles to show how we are using bacteria and demonstrate that we are doing it taking into account demanding security measures. However, throughout the summer they changed their mind and now they are doing a magazine instead of a series of articles. They will distribute it in their university and of course in the Giant Jamboree. You can download our report by cliking in the button below.

BroadRun-NorthernVA,2015," of this and the fact that our school lab did not have the resources for an iGEM project, Marissa Sumathipala and Adriel Sumathipala, who had prior interactions with BUGSS through their own research activities, contacted Dr. Lisa Schiefele and Dr. Tom Burkett of BUGSS. BUGSS, a citizen scientist biology hackerspace founded by Dr. Burkett, that had sent an community lab iGEM team to the 2014 iGEM Jamboree, was very supportive. After working out various aspects of such an effort, from teaching an introductory synthetic biology lab course by Dr. Schiefele to those team members that had not had prior lab experience needed for the project,  safety and ethics aspects of the project, and logistics of doing the research at their lab, BUGSS came on board. We have since been mentored by Dr. Schiefele and Dr. Burkett and have conducted all our lab work exclusively at BUGSS. As BUGSS continues to grow and become known in the Baltimore and greater Washington area and also nationally, with a focus on synthetic biology, both as a place for creative engineering and educating adults and a generation of youth, our collaboration with BUGSS as an iGEM team is also advancing their vision for youth education and engagement. Together, we are bringing synthetic biology to the forefront of education, public awareness, and creative problem solving.
Rockridge High School iGEM Team, Loudoun County, VA
From the inception, we have been in continuous dialog with Mr. Saavedra, the instructor of Loudoun County’s only other iGEM team at Rockridge High school. Also being a first time team like us, we maintained communication and correspondence via phone voice calls, emails, texts, and at least two visits to Rockridge. These dialogs covered diverse topics from fundraising ideas for registration fees and jamboree fees, equipment, lab resources, research topics, project implementation approaches, and details of lab work.   On August 13, two of our team members, Marissa and Fionn, and our instructor, Nina Arendtsz, visited the Rockridge team at their school. We met and talked to the students working on the project, discussed issues with writing code for the wiki, and learned a lot more about their project including observing some of their preliminary results of gels. Their team offered us lab resources to incubate cultures and we offered them to use the electroporator at BUGSS lab, a piece of equipment not available at Rockridge. We spent over an hour and"

Reaching out to educate with Team Dalhousie
Team Hawaii collaborated with Team Dalhousie to better educate the public in scientific research. Every week, Team Dalhousie posts an article on their blog that summarizes scientific research in layman’s teams. Each article is written by a different team. Team Hawaii wrote an article about the functions of virus-like particles (VLPs) in medicine and research as delivery molecules and vaccine providers, uploaded October 15.
The scientific community makes great bounds in improving mankind and the world every day, but these accomplishments often go unnoticed by the public. Of course, scientists do not go into their respective field for praise, at least most claim that, but the public should be aware of what is happening in science. We encourage high schoolers to keep up with politics and world events, and we should do the same for science. Keeping up with the news allows for people to provide informed opinions on the matter, which in turn may shape public policy. When the public often hears of some new scientific breakthrough, most cannot comprehend the consequences or benefits of it. Either they fear it with no substantive reasoning or support it without understanding the ethical hazards it may spur.
VLPs, like any focus of research, holds the potential for violating our ethics. If tampering with the maize genome may pose health and environmental risks, should we continue this area of research? Is it ethical to continue our research with the possibility of helping many while also possibly endangering countless others?  As scientists, we are risk takers and optimistic. We try to paint over ethical consequences with the possible benefits our discoveries may reap.
If we bring in the public opinion into the scientific community, perhaps this “paint-brushing” will come with more restrain. As the public actively analyzes our research ambitions, they can, hopefully positively, shape the avenue in which we research. To do so, published research needs to be separately gifted to the public in a plainly wrapped journal, free of frilly scientific jargon or sparkly technical language. In doing so, we run the risk of losing detail, but these details are perhaps irrelevant. This allows the public to understand what we are crafting and provide input as to what future avenues we should explore.

Stuttgart,2017,"EM-Team Stuttgart meets iGEM Team Tübingen
The iGEM Team Tübingen invited us to their lovely town to spend a fabulous day together!    We had a nice barbecue and after being filled up with great food the Tübinger Team invited us to discover one of the highlights of the city - the famous Stocherkahn (sorry - I have no translation for this!) on the Neckar river!    We had lots of fun, laughter and a great time getting a lot of input, information and experienced advices for the iGEM competition!    As the iGEM Team Tübingen is already an succesful expert in the complete iGEM concept since years - we newbies ;) - were lucky to get so many passionated and ambitious help!    It's nice to see that iGEM is a competition where you meet so many great people that want to help each other out!    Thank you Team Tübingen and we hopefully can give you back your hospitality soon!

iGEM-Team Canmore 2016
Doing research for our project we were lucky to see that other iGEM Teams from the past worked with keratinases and the issue of breaking down hair in wasterwater facilities (Sheffield 2014, Canmore 2015, Canmore 2016). We saw that the iGEM Team of Canmore 2016 was able to submit two composite parts to the registry. These parts consist of a protein coding sequence for the KerUS gene and an IPTG-inducible promoter (BBa_K1717173) and the KerA gene with an IPTG-inducible promoter (BBa_K1717000). Given the fact that we were not able to obtain these parts from the iGEM registry we were in contact with the iGEM Team Canmore and one of their mentors Lisa Oberding from FREDsense who shipped us the required parts from Canada to Germany. Thanks to their former experiences with these two keratinases and already faced issues going along with them, we were able to avoid some troubleshootings.

5. As a consumer, how do I know if a product I want to buy contains GMO?
The legal requirements for disclosing GMOs within food and other products differ across the world. Some countries within the Americas have little to no laws in place regarding GMO labelling. In the USA, there are no official obligations for companies to label any products containing GMOs. The same applies to Canada, unless the food is likely to pose a health or safety risk to consumers, in which case full disclosure of GMOs is mandatory. The Brazilian government, which has until now required companies to label transgenic products with a T symbol, is (as of 2017) currently considering removing this law. Chilean government might be a notable exception as it prohibits the introduction into the market of any products containing GMOs.
In contrast, most of Europe, Asia and Oceania have strict guidelines surrounding labelling of GMO products. The European Union, Australia, India and Indonesia all require the packaging of such products to be bear the label “this product"

Interlab University of Pittsburgh University of Georgia
A core value of iGEM is collaboration. A core value of the CMU team is to help others in whatever capacity we are able to, whether it be with our equipment, knowledge, or filling our surveys. In the spirit of this, we’ve collaborated with several iGEM teams. Read about our efforts below.
Interlab Study
The interlab study is an international collaboration across all iGEM teams who chose to participate in the study. The goal is to obtain fluorescence data for three different genetic devices expressing GFP. We want to see the correlation between the values obtained for the genetic devices expressing such GFP and whether the measurement for such a synthetic biology protocol is consistent across all iGEM teams since the same samples were used.
iGEM Teams
University of Pittsburgh
We provided the data from last year’s estrogen sensor. They wanted to use an estrogen-sensitive T7 RNA polymerase which the CMU iGEM team designed in 2014 in order to activate transcription of a reporter gene in a cell-free extract. They want to generate freeze-dried cells on paper for easy transportation and detect presence of estrogen in water after freeze drying the cells. In the presence of estrogen, the synthetic T7 RNA polymerase will initiate transcription of a reporter construct. In addition, we met up with each other to give a short presentation to the TEC-Bio team at the University of Pittsburgh. After detecting the estrogen, we assisted them in modeling their freeze-dried system allowing them to produce a useful system.
University of Georgia
The University of Georgia invited us to a collaboration effort to obtain mCherry fluorescence readings for an archaeal RBS (ribosomal binding site) library they prepared. They studied this in order to control protein expression. Since there are not many tools involved in studying archaea, they wanted to collaborate in order to promote the utilization of methanogenic archaea modeling this behavior after interlab in order to analyze their measurements obtained from the study. In addition, they want to add on to the E.coli Interlab by adding another specimen to be used. The collaboration allowed them to assess the reproducibility of the data in various labs around the world and develop a"

Projects designed by one team is great, but with the help of others, it can become all the better.       We would like to recognize the following teams we were able to work with this year that helped       with the completion of our project! We hope that they enjoyed working with us as much as we did       with them.
iGEM Bilkent-UNAMBG Our team’s project consisted of inducing flotation in E. coli cells by expression of gas vesicle       proteins in the Arg1 operon (BBa_K2699000), which was modeled in a bioreactor system by our dry lab       team. iGEM Bilkent-UNAMG’s team project involved the engineering of a cell-surface Penicillin-Binding       Protein (PBP), designed to bind the beta-lactam ring on penicillin. In collaboration with this team,       we were able to explore the potential for a bioremediation platform for separation of penicillin from waste water, by       modeling constitutive expression of iGEM Bilkent’s PBP coupled with our regulated induction of the       Arg1 operon in BL21 cells in a bioreactor system, simply by updating binding rate constant parameters for PBP characterization.
iGEM Queens We collaborated with iGEM Queens by exchanging resources to help complete our respective projects.       In exchange for helping us complete the design the banner illustration for the landing page on our       wiki, we gave Queens our our pSB1C3 backbone with UNS that aided them with the insertion of their       parts into the required backbone for submission.
iGEM Tec Monterrey- Guadalajara We collaborated with the iGEM Tec-Monterrey Guadalajara and participated in their #ScienceEverywhere       campaign that solidifies the international spirit of the iGEM competition. In exchange we surveyed       the members of the Guadalajara team about attitudes towards genetically modified organisms and       were able to compare their responses to our survey responses from students who don’t study or       practice synthetic biology. Ontario iGEM teams (iGEM McMaster,"
Tianjin,2015," cell fresh weight reached to 200g/L, Nankai started inducement for 96h. What’s more, there is a higher production when dissolved oxygen was maintained at 15%-25% by turning up the methanol speed.
Follow is the figure shows the SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis of inJanus. And the inJanus molecule weight was 8KDa. In addition, inJanus in the broth was mainly monomer and dimer. The latter binds better with the primary antibody of Janus.

To measure the yield of inJanus, Nankai measured the concentration of inJanus by UPLC. And Nankai used standard sample of sJanus of different concentration (0.1, 0.05, 0.025 mg/mL) to get a standard curve of concentration with adsorption area of UPLC.

In order to meet the gold medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.
Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:
Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device
Characterize another team's part
Debug a construct
Model or simulating another team's system
Test another team's software
Help build and test another team's hardware project
Mentor a high-school team

McMasterU,2017,"ation step. They decided to use a thicker agar plate and plate a higher concentration of cells (108 cells/mL), which resulted in colony growth (Figure 2).
Next, 5 µL of 8µM DNAzyme was added to the quadrants containing bacteria. To check for background fluorescence, 1 µL of DNAzyme was added to the quadrant labelled as DNAzyme. The plates were left to incubate for 1 hour and viewed under UV light as an alternative to using a fluorescence gel imager.
Results
Unfortunately, the experiments conducted by Calgary iGEM proved unsuccessful. They were unable to detect fluorescence following the addition of DNAzyme under UV, let alone whether B. subtilis displayed a lack of fluorescence. Due to limited DNAzyme, repetition of the experiment was not possible.
There are a variety of improvements required if we are to continue with this collaboration. The first is checking the stability of the DNAzyme during the shipping process. The DNAzyme was pelleted when it was sent to Calgary, and they resuspended it before usage. Our team should check DNAzyme activity in our own lab using pelleted form to rule this out as a potential interferant. The second factor to consider is the use of UV vs fluorescence imaging. It would be optimal if Calgary gained access to a fluorescence gel imager (Typhoon Imager) to be consistent with our experiments and imaging.
Future Directions
Once the DNAzyme has been optimized, there is one big factor to take into consideration: use of the DNAzyme by non-specialists. If this collaboration were to proceed, our DNAzyme would need to be usable by Mars colonists and without the need for extensive bacterial culturing and plating. As well, a faster readout is required. The current 1 hour of incubation is quite long if the DNAzyme were to be used as part of a leakage monitoring system. The last aspect to consider is the activity of the DNAzyme in a variety of sample matrixes, without sample enrichment. Bacterial detection has to occur without pure bacteria, and in the bioplastics synthesis system there will a variety of molecules present that should not interfere with the DNAzyme. These are all considerations that would be taken into account when designing the DNAzyme for use in a Mars colony.

Hamburg,2018," think is “Well, may this little super organism can change the whole cloning workflow all around the world”!
This organism has a doubling time of under 10 minutes. It can be carried out easily in your lab work as a nonpathogenic, fast growing prokaryotic organism with a broad range of pH tolerance.
The iGEM Team Marburg wants to Establish Vibrio natriegens as a new chassis organism for synthetic biology. They designed three new strain, which make work in the lab much easier and more effective. Imagine you just need one day for a whole cloning process. If this bacterium were be establish last year, we (and we think almost every iGEM team) could achieve 3 times as much since everything works three times as fast as in Vibrio natriegens. We did the InterLab study to help them getting done with their establishment. We transformed the included devices in Vibrio natriegens and measured the growth with a plate reader. We hope they will be succsesfull and wishes them all the best.

Makerere
The iGEM Team Makerere University helped a lot by personally evaluating and discussing our project and its application in countries like Uganda. They distributed our questionnaire to people working with malaria on a daily basis. Thanks to them we got invaluable expertise and input from social workers, nurses, lab technicians and epidemiologists. In return we assisted them with the planning of their experiments concerning the expression of PETase and proposed a basic kinetic cell model for their project.

The same can not be said of the Pole or the Finn in the sauna, so it would be an interesting investigation for the future to test if there really is a difference in Dermcidin levels of the people living in different climates.
Tartu_TUIT
We were happy to collaborate with the first in history Estonian iGEM team - Tartu_TUIT from Tartu University. The team - consisting of science and technology students for the most part - asked us to help with creating and updating the Wiki. We soon organised a Skype call with the team, and exchanged possible collaboration ideas from our side: for example the chance to get access to a Biosafety Level 2 laboratory for testing the antimicrobial activity of our peptide with Propionibacterium acnes. Further discussions brought two students and their two instructors to Helsinki, to meet us, get help with the wiki and discuss our projects!
The team arrived in Helsinki in the late morning, and so for starters we had lunch in the city center. It was interesting to learn about how the first team in Estonia had been brought together and how their practices differed from ours. We proceeded to the Helsinki University library, where we had a room booked. We started with a wiki presentation. Meo explained how websites are built, what are some of the tools used and what .html and .css syntaxes look like. He provided the team with a handout, some useful links and a Python script made by Aalto-Helsinki iGEM 2016, with which all wiki content can be uploaded on the iGEM servers with one command.
Tartu_TUIT presents us their project.
After the wiki session, we presented the Tartu team our project and they presented theirs to us. We got very valuable feedback to our laboratory work from both the students and instructors of the team. As a special mention, they suggested using liposomes for testing the antimicrobial properties of our constructs, as we had not managed to acquire access to a Biosafety Level 2 laboratory. After the discussion, there was still some time to walk around the sunny Helsinki and discuss our universities, educational programs and iGEM in general. We are thankful for having the Tartu team visit us and exchange knowledge and ideas.
Most great advances have been a collaboration.
That is the joy of science for me.

Introduction
iGEM is all about synthetic biology and pushing the boundaries of the field to meet the needs of today with innovative solutions, and the spirit of iGEM has always been collaborative. We believe in adopting that spirit in our project.
It was important for us to collaborate with multiple research groups working on synthetic biology and cancer therapeutics during the course of our project. Our interactions with them were vital in the development of our project and we learned                 a lot from their input that allowed us to adapt and improve our project, shaping CAPOEIRA to meet the needs of the relevant stakeholders in the field. We have elaborated our story on our ‘Integrated Human Practices Page
Equally important to our project was collaboration with other iGEM teams. We were able to team up with teams around the globe on a variety of experiments that contributed to the mutual understanding and improvement of projects, exploring                 the ethical and regulatory landscape of a number of countries regarding synthetic biology as well as giving and receiving feedback where we can on the wiki, project, poster, presentation and other aspects of iGEM projects of our collaborators                 and of our own.

Our Collaborations
As the first stop, we went to Huazhong Agricultural University. We first discussed and exchanged our research topics. Although both of our topics are cancer related, we focused on finding a new biomarker while the HZAU team researched about induction of pyroptosis of tumor cells by carrying gasdermin D in Salmonella into the tumor cells. Due to our lack of experience at attending the final jamboree, we also learned a lot of techinques of making slide shows and presentation skills. We then explored team HZAU's laboratory. As the HZAU team leader kindly invited us for a lunch together, she proposed the possibility for us to try out multiple cell lines from different cancers to test out the specificity of our lncRNA.
The HUST team was the second team we visited. After exchanging our research topics. The HUST team members gave us idea of how to thoroughly write out the background and process of out experiment.
WHU team was the last team we visited. From the team's co-leader, we learned how does a university's team decides on a topic to research on and apply for reimbursement from the school. After discussing about team WHU's topic and its collaboration with team HUST, the co-leader surprisingly provided us an opportunity for a local community propaganda.
The WHU team and our team finally locked in on our presentation topics, which were synthetic biology and renal cell cancer information and prevention. On July 31, members from both teams arrived at Tienan Community in Wuhan in the morning. After doing some community services we presented in front of generally mid aged residents. The event was a success at the end."

iGEM teams are a big family. All teams register the competition are encouraged to help each other to make the projects better! Collaboration is really an important part in the process of competition.
This year, we built close cooperative relation to HUST-China , WHU-China and ZJU-China and helped each other to make our project better.
1、we offered help to HUST-China team in their genetic circuit construction. They failed when they used a reporter in their test experiment. We provided them with an essential reporter part we constructed (B0034+E0040+B0015)  and succeeded inserting the reporter part respectively to the downstream of the three ptrp mutants.
2、when dealing with the Interface Device, we met some trouble about the usage of SCM (Single Chip Micyoco) as we were not familiar with it. Thus, we turned to ZJU-China for help and they soon provide us a basic program which can change the brightness of LED through controlling PWM as a reference and later other suggestions online.
3、WHU-China team communicated with us frequently. Due to the lack of team member working on modeling, they turned to our team for help. After learning about their project, we analyzed the design of their genetic circuit carefully and built mathematical model for it.
In addition we also received assistance from WHU-China team when we decided to adopt a light control system in our project. They helped us to construct a section of light control system, saving our precious time.

UK iGEM Meetup
On 12th and 13th July, we helped host the UK-wide iGEM meetup at Worcester College, Oxford in partnership with SynBio UK. Teams travelled from across the country to attend this two-day event that promoted collaboration, offered project advice and gave an insight into what lies beyond the iGEM competition. Discussing our projects with other team members, and attending a collaboration workshop helped us to identify many opportunities for collaboration. It was here that we met the Imperial team and learnt of their intention to use the SoxR/SoxS promoter system, leading to a joint effort to characterise the strength of a range of promoters. We also arranged Skype meetings with the Warwick team to guide them on the modelling aspect of their project. These collaborations are discussed in more detail below.
Imperial College London iGEM - Wet Lab
Imperial constructed a promoter library using a BLAST search for the SoxS promoter which they characterised in response to an applied electrical current. To assist them, we characterised their parts in response to chemically induced oxidative stress. In return, they provided us with a range of constructs which we could match to the promoter strength, predicted in our model to give the highest sensitivity to NO.
While in our device, SoxR is used to respond to NO, the short half-life prevents isolation for fluorescence assays. SoxR is not only activated by NO but any chemical which induces oxidative stress. Initially aiming to characterise the promoter in response to the superoxide-generating herbicide, paraquat, we found that due to its toxicity, it was prohibited in the EU and required specialist clearance for research purposes. Hydrogen peroxide was chosen as a safer alternative which still produces reactive oxygen species in the cells, and thus activates SoxR.
Characterisation was two-fold. A plate reader assay was performed which measured fluorescence of the GFP from the promoter construct in response to 100uM hydrogen peroxide. In addition to this A600 ("

Team ECUST
As high school students, we were not so familiar with the competition and the techniques it requires. Thus the mentoring from Team ECUST contributed a lot towards our understanding of the whole process and necessary steps. Moreover, ECUST offered us instructions and experimental equipment for the interlab session, which is essential for medals.
In return, we joined the 3+ net initiative they started. 3+ net is a collaboration&human practise project for putting forward guidelines for better understanding of our situation and projects. Our major role is to help with the Society+ part which call for collected opinions from different groups. With the mutual focus of environment pollution, we constructed a survey about public opinions towards bioengineering approach of solving pollution. Within a week, we were able to receive more than 500 questionnaires filled out from all age groups. By helping with surveys making and data analyze, our mutual bonds for advocating the potential of bioengineering is solidified.
Meet up with SHSID_China and SUIS-Shanghai
On July 21st, 2018, we brought together two other teams, SHSID_China and SUIS-Shanghai to discuss our project progression. Within an afternoon, we exchanged ideas about our projects and share mutual difficulties for possible solution. With questions and suggestions, we were able to identify each others’ strengths and flaws, seeking improvements. Future collaboration plans were also raised.
Mock presentation with SHSU_China and SHSID_China
On October 14th, 2018, our team met up with SHSU_China and SHSID_China at Fudan University for mock presentations as preparations for the final delivery at the Giant Jamboree. Feedback from each teams is exchanged and we gained more insights into possible impurities of our project. More experiences about human practise, wiki building and modelling are also shared in order to help each other seeking more improvements."

This collaborative event was a huge success. 9 out the the 10 Indian iGEM teams(including IISER Pune) joined us in our Institute for a Mini-Jamboree. Team Peshawar Pakistan also joined us via Skype. The meet-up was 2 days of intense discussions and talks on various projects. Teams helped each other by posing potential problems with the projects and then brainstorming solutions for the same. We talked about safety, viability, usefulness of each project. This helped us a lot in improving our work.  We helped team Peshawar in selecting a topic for the project by discussing pros and cons of each topic.
(iii) Social media and whatsapp groups
We got to talk to many teams via our facebook page. We filled survey forms of many teams and also forwarded them to the others.
We had a very active iGEM India whatsapp group which was extremely helpful throughout the course of the project. Be it the Visa application or DNA ordering or troubleshoot of some experiment, this group always been of incalculable help.

Ben Gurion University: Beersheba, Israel
As it is our university's first time competing in iGEM, we found neighborly mentors in the team from Ben Gurion University (BGU) - only a two hour drive away from our own university! For one, they helped us design an overall yearly program for iGEM tasks based on their previous experiences, also sharing a detailed budget plan with our PI for reference.
BGU we instrumental in our completion of the interlab study, which was a necessity for our team to fulfil our medal requirements. Our team did not meet the Interlab standards by the first deadline, and as such it was critical that we did it right for the final submission in August. BGU assisted us by troubleshooting issues we had in our first try, helped us plan out the experiment well, and even provided is with comptent D5a E. coli, which we ran out of when we need them most.
Finally, BGU hosted a meetup between our two teams which included a quick tour and presentation by our hosts, help establishing good presentation structure for the conference, and a super-fun bowling game!

Evry Paris-Saclay : Golden Gate Assembly for HMWP2
We had problems from the very beginning with restricting/ligating and transforming one of our main genes. Namely HMWP2, this gene encodes for a fairly big synthetase that catalyzes the first part of yersiniabactin, which is identical to N-Pch, therefore we wanted to utilize the catalytic functions of HMWP2 to synthesize our main target.
However, since it is a fairly big protein with 6.5 kb encoding for it, we could not order it as a single DNA part from IDT, instead we had to break it up in 3 parts, inexperienced as we were we thought well, let’s split it up in three parts, as the maximum size we could order was 3 kb. This approach implied, that we would need to include restriction sites for single cutting enzymes, which we did, XmaI and MaubI where the enzymes of choice and we tried to ligate and transform all three parts into psB1C3.
As it turned out it is quite hard to achieve a ligation that complicated, still we tried our approach for several weeks, fueled by some false positive results we thought well we might make it. In the end though we gave up and admitted that we would need some help to finish our most important BioBrick.
So, we reached out to our fellow iGEM teams first we had a discussion with Heidelberg, which proposed to use the Golden Gate method as well as Evry did later then. The collaboration with Evry sprung from a personal conversation between our team leader Shanti and Evry’s head of human practices Yanis, who established the contact with their head of science Jérémy.
Jérémy showed us how to design a golden gate assembly, while also providing us an entire protocol to ensure our ligation step, with the planned assembly a transformation is almost guaranteed to work, however the correct order of the fragments is not therefore a relatively extensive screening process is needed to find the colonies that carry the designed fragment.                  Additionally, we had ongoing support by Jérémy to"
UChile_Biotec,2018, realized that they were working with an aptamer and lyophilization in their project called “RAPID”. We exchanged information about our projects and the Hong_Kong-CUHK gave us suggestions such as  explaining more clearly some things about our project in order to have a better presentation during the Giant Jamboree.
Concordia,2016,". coli from toxin invasion.  Here is a general layout of the experimental design:
NAWI-Graz had sent us their “Blue plasmid” construct. This plasmid contains the gene coding for a blue chromoprotein, constitutively expressed. It also contains the sequences for toxin ccdB and antitoxin ccdA. CcdB, which inhibits DNA gyrase, is known to be secreted in the media, while ccdA remains in the cell. The plasmids also contains the sequence for DAM-Methylase, which NAWI-Graz uses in their project as a mutation-inducer for their purposes.
The first step of the plan was to transform the DNA into DH5ɑ E. coli cells, followed by a colony PCR to confirm the plasmid presence. The production of the toxin and the antitoxin are induced using IPTG, and the toxin would be secreted in the growth media. Theoretically, this toxin could be isolated from the cells through centrifugation, as they would stay in the growth media while the cells would be pelleted. This media containing the toxin would be used for a different type of experiment, as shown below.
Our intention was to determine whether or not nanoparticle-coated cells would protect against a toxin.We hypothesized that our nanoparticle-coated cells would offer some sort of protection of cells from the toxin. We based this hypothesis on the idea that our silver-coated E. coli cells would have altered abilities to pump external substances into the cell. Our nanoparticles, which are citrate-capped and coated and neutralized using a cationic polymer, are evenly distributed in a non-selective manner along the surface of E. coli cells.
This experiment would be performed by monitoring the difference in optical density over time of our coated cells in contact with toxin. The necessary controls would be uncoated E. coli cells in contact with the toxin (to confirm toxin activity), and both coated and uncoated E. coli without toxin.
Unfortunately, we could not complete this experiment, as we had difficulty transforming the Blue Plasmid into E. coli. We likely diluted the received DNA in too much water since the measured DNA concentration was below the linear range of our spectrophotometer, leading to multiple failed transformations. Another possible reason for low transformation is that the toxin is under the regulation of a lac promoter and operator, which have some leaky expression. If the antitoxin is not expressed while some toxin is expressed, this may be killing the host cell, which does not endogenously"

OFF-CAMPUS ACTIVITY
Jiangnan University
During this iGEM year, Jiangnan University, for the first time,                             participates in iGEM competition and established two separate teams each having an independent project.                             As they are new teams, there was much information and requirements that they had little understanding.                             On this condition, this year we set up both a cooperation relationship and mentorship.
On April 1st,                             our team and the teams in Jiangnan University held a meetup for a more detailed assistance provided by our team leader on how to succeed in meeting cardinal dues in iGEM competition and which aspects should be given high attention.                             We also imparted several tips on team management. In turn, Jiangnan iGEM team promised whatsoever help they are capable of to us.
During Conference of China iGEMer Community,                             our team with them also gained a chance to have a deeper glance of our mutual projects.                             By this chance, both of our projects had undergone the test from questions come up by each other

University of Hong Kong
During the Asia-Europe Meeting in Shen Zhen, our team had a brief discussion about us projects with Hong Kong University (HKU). Both of us had a great interest in each other’s project and would like to seek further collaboration. On 27th July, we went to Hong Kong to have a thorough and impressive meeting with the iGEM team in HKU. We shared the experience of doing transfection experiment in HEK293T and discussed the possible ways to increase the production of the exosome. In addition, some problems encountered when conducting Interlab experiment were discussed, HKU iGEM team offered us some pressure suggestions.

Collaboration:
Throughout iGEM, we have communicated with a great many other teams via twitter and facebook, and a few through Skype.
We have corresponded with the Bielefeld iGEM team via email and Skype as, like our team, Bielefeld are focusing on cell-free systems as part of their project. Their team managed to build their own cell-free kit - they kindly calculated the price of each reaction for us and provided a table of contents. This helped us see how viable it would be for use in the further application of our project. We also had some early discussions regarding chromoproteins. Bielefeld were kind enough to provide us with details on their home-made cell-free kit, which was incredibly useful in terms of costing our TB test and reduced the price signicantly.
The Oxford iGEM team also got in contact to discuss stochastic modelling and simulations with our modelling team. We exchanged information on our project, finding Oxford’s gene expression model particularly impressive.
Another group we contacted was the Manchester-Graz iGEM team , a merge of two groups of students from the UK and Austria. We Skyped their team and discussed chromoproteins and a survey they are undertaking.
We provided an article for the iGEM newsletter Amoy iGEM team are organising. This can be viewed here .
We attended the UK iGEM meetup, hosted and organised by Westminster iGEM .
A highlight of our iGEM collaboration was the group skype we hosted. Seven teams were involved, although ultimately we were plagued with technical issues and ended up in a smaller Skype call. Thanks to the teams we spoke with: Sydney , Manchester-Graz , and Warwick .
We took part in Kent iGEM team’s survey on nanowires, bioreactors, and renewable energy, and we hope that the data we provided will be useful to them.
We also Skyped the NAIT Edmonton"

Oxford
The team at Oxford has been working on a method of cell-free detection of Chargas disease. Specifically, they are testing for the presence of cruzipain, which is known to cleave and release the peptide hirudin from the transmembrane OmpA precursor. To measure cruzipain activity, they are using the Spytag/Spycatcher system. First, they must attach Spytag, a short peptide, onto the OmpA protein. We have assisted the team by running a CG simulation of OmpA bilayer insertion and simulation with SpyTag/SpyCatcher. This simulation, performed on the supercomputer cluster at McMaster University, provided insight into protein conformations and system stability after the OmpA+Spytag fusion protein was inserted into a model membrane.
Collaboration on this project has involved sharing of information on the proteins involved. Below are the 3D images of the two proteins involved in the simulation, OmpA and SpyTag. Furthermore, communication has been required to create the most realistic bond between OmpA and Spytag on a computer. After discussing this issue, we reached the consensus that the optimal route would be to create a harmonic artificial potential between the two proteins.
Below, we have attached the molecular dynamics simulations we ran of their chimeric protein. We showed which residues may be potentially unstable in both the Spytag and SpyCatcher proteins. The root-mean squared fluctuations (RMSF) is proportional to protein stability, and is unique to SHARCNET supercomputer clusters in Ontario, Canada. With this, we were able to offer atomistic resolution.
Oxford provided us with the code for reaction kinetics, which we implemented heavily in our modelling section."

Helping team BIT-China
>>> Link to BIT-China
When meeting with iGEMers from Peking, BIT-China and Tianjin University, we were surprised to find that, much similar to our project, BIT-China was also working on a kill-switch based on TA modules. Characterizing varies toxins was one of the most important tasks for both teams. We measured growth curves by a 96-well microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek Synergy H5), while BIT-China used traditional methods of taking a sample from a shake incubator for every 30 minutes or so.
So we helped them measure the growth curves of bacteria harboring their toxin gene, MazF. They chose three different RBSs, and we measured the growth curves of those three different bacteria. Using the 96-well microplate spectrophotometer, the value of OD600 was measured automatically for every ten minutes, making the plot more continuous, accurate and smooth. Setting three parallels, we showed that the measurement was quite repeatable. The graph was drawn using Prism 6.0. Fig. 3 shows that if toxin protein MazF is induced when the value of OD600 lies between 0.5-0.7, it instantaneously halts the growth of the curve, indicating strong growth arrest. Interestingly, if toxin is expressed at the beginning of the measurement, as Fig. 4 illustrates, the growth of bacteria was not immediately suppressed, which is quite different from the toxins we used. The growth patterns in the first 200 minutes are not observably different from Control. This result is in accordance with BIT-China’s data.

During CCiC at SYSU this September, we talked about our hardware design, a miniature aeration tank from waste water treatment plants. To our surprise, we got some quite useful feedbacks from Nanjing-China. They generously shared their experience of building a similar device in their last year’s project. Such details as materials for fillers have never been considered by us before. They gave us information about the effect of different fillers, which did inspire us a lot, and freed us from fruitless trial-and-error experiments. So their suggestions saved a lot of time for us, for we can spare more time on improving the design and construct of our own device.

We then turned to more specific iGEM topics and explained in detail, how human practices ought to be organized and carefully implemented. We presented the medal requirements and explained what human practices activities we arranged in previous years. Lastly, we gave the most important talk of our mentoring-visit presenting the most successful iGEM projects and shifting the lecture to a discussion on how iGEM projects are built. We once again presented in detail the medal criteria and highlighted the most important steps of project development: from deciding on an idea to planning a work in the laboratory.
Discussed and advised on the initial Tartu_TUIT project idea.
Advised on arranging a timeline for project implementation. We already had valuable experience in planning iGEM activities and warned Tartu_TUIT when it is important to start developing a team wiki page, how to arrange time in October, when the most important deadlines emerge.
Tartu_TUIT:
Provided suggestions for our project.
Together:
We continued our collaboration throughout the year and members from both teams contacted each other when needed:
In May when both teams wanted to elaborately discuss the ongoing human practices work
In July, when Tartu_TUIT team had issues with the sequencing quality and asked for our assistance with sequencing their samples
Later in July we also discussed the progress of each project
In August, when Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team had a shortage of DNA bases
Virtual Meet-ups
Collaboration is all about exchanging ideas and we believe that collective thinking can do a lot of good for iGEM projects. So we have decided to arrange virtual meet-ups for teams to present  and investigate any bottlenecks or issues of their projects. The following teams participated in our virtual meet-ups:

iGEM Cornell
We collaborated with iGEM Cornell to design and distribute an anonymous survey that would help us analyze the attitudes of the general public towards genetic engineering and the usage of genetically modified products. This was done to analyze the possible perceptions people may have concerning our treatments and the resulting products. The surveys were distributed online and in person at events such as the New York State Fair and the Ithaca Farmer’s Market; this was done among individuals with differing factors such as age, gender, and educational background. To ensure responses relating to both teams’ projects, we decided to include questions that prompted individuals to consider different aspects of genetic engineering and the merits thereof. We were able to successfully design a survey alongside its distribution, as multiple discussions were held between both teams to analyze the factors that would most relevant to modern societies and the questions that would be subject to the most insight from individuals, regardless of their level of awareness for synthetic biology and genetic engineering. Through this process, we were able to learn more about the prejudices and controversies surrounding synthetic biology, and we used those considerations to design our final survey.
The results from Stony Brook revealed a larger percentage of people who claimed that they knew what synthetic biology was, as compared to the percentage of people in Ithaca. After running a T-test, this was confirmed to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.01. This was an interesting result, since Cornell is a larger institution with easy access to events, seminars, and programs. The results may suggest an extent of segregation between Cornell’s student body and its surrounding community. Many people viewed synthetic biology as a positive influence on the world. Although more people in Stony Brook viewed synthetic biology as a positive contributor, we found that there was an insignificant difference (p = 0.41) in how people felt about synthetic biology in Stony Brook aside from Ithaca. People also believed that synthetic biology should be more restricted to certain areas of science, but there was no difference in this view between Stony Brook and Ithaca (p = 0.21). Most people appeared to have an equal understanding of synthetic biology and GMOs, but as shown by our graphs, people tended to have a better grasp of GMOs than synthetic biology. While a few people answered that they had never"

 Motivation
Difficulties are inevitable in a project, but help from our friends would always bring us to cross the finishing line. We were fortunate to have met many teams and built much friendship through iGEM. We helped each other in different aspects of our projects, and much of our effort bore meaningful fruits in our laboratory work and beyond. Here is the documentation of our precious memory and our expression of gratitude for all of their help.
UI-Indonesia
This year, we were glad that we could collaborate with team from University of Indonesia ( UI_Indonesia ). Our extensive collaboration ranges from wet lab to human practice.
 How the Story Began?
We helped UI_Indonesia to clone their HT constructs as they faced great difficulty. The construct is a fusion of native Escherichia coli Tar chemotaxis receptor and human HB-EGF receptor which in the purpose of diphtheria toxin can be recognized by bacteria. This HT was designed and ordered in a gBlock from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).
Initially, UI_Indonesia ordered the HT gBlock as one fragment with a size ~1900 bp. However, they were informed that there was a problem during the construction, so they would need to change it and came up with ordering two separate fragments with one restriction between 2 parts, namely HT1 and HT2.
They planned to combine these two fragments together into a vector by ligation. However, when they tried to amplify HT1 to insert it in into a vector, they found out that the amplified product of HT1 was not specific. The size for HT1 was supposed to be ~1100 bp, but the band was very faint in 1100 bp. For HT2, there was a band at 800 bp, but it showed multiple bands, indicating low specificity. Because of this problem, UI_Indonesia sought help to ligate the two fragments together and put it in a backbone. Therefore, they asked us for help in ligating and cloning this fragment into a vector, so it would be easier to amplify and proceed for their assay.

Tec-Monterrey,2016," on a virtual discussion panel aimed to exchange information about the normatives and laws that are strictly applied nowadays in France and Mexico respectively. The laws we discussed focused on dumping costs of polluted waste, metals pollution, roads pollution and methods of treatment.
We mainly discussed issues about how efficient are the laws, how well are they implemented, how can we help to carry out the concern about how hazardous are they. However, we wanted to focus on how each project impacts the environment and the society, and how we can help to make real impact in both Europe and Latin America.
iGEM Tec CEM
We helped the Tec CEM team by answering their survey about self medication and public health for their Human Practice. All of the team answered the survey and we shared it amongst our community so they could have enough data.
iGEM Guanajuato Mx
Meetup
We attended the meetup organized by the Guanajuato Mx team. The meetup was attended by the following Mexican teams: Guanajuato Mx, Pumas México, Tec-Chihuahua, TecCEM, and us Tec-Monterrey. In the meetup, we exchanged points of view regarding the biobricks designed by the other teams, the uses and applications of each of the parts and we even helped debug some of them.
Moreover, we gave and received advice for our project and we also had the opportunity to practise the presentation, present a draft of the poster and, in addition, we gave and received feedback concerning all of these issues.
Also, one of the most interesting part of the meeting was the discussion about the current situation of synthetic biology in Mexico. Here, we talked about the ethical issues of having synthetic biology within reach of everyone and the impact it has in our society, and especially in our country, nowadays.

iGEM University of La Verne
We read about iGEM University of La Verne (ULV) and their project on the Team collaborations website. Since they were investigating toxicants like us, we were interested to hear how they gathered information and investigated the problem. We contacted them to exchange information and discuss our projects. iGEM ULV was very helpful in providing information about the severeness of our projects by reaching out to nearby wastewater treatment plants. Since ULV also used molecular modeling, we sent them our handbook created for other iGEM teams, to guide them on how to analyse and interpret their models.
Ocean University of China (OUC) iGEM
As our own Human Practices team focused on developing tools to communicate synthetic biology, we stumbled across a comic project produced by OUC. We contacted them and asked if we could participate in their project by translating it into Swedish. We hope this collaboration will make it easier for them to reach out in society, and that synthetic biology will become more accessible to everyone."
UMaryland,2015," Maryland dept. of Entomology gave a presentation entitled ""Designer Pathogens"" featuring a vast array of his research group's synthetic biology projects. The main project involved a series of experiments  that incorporated toxins from fungi and receptors from bacteria that would spread disease among mosquitos in Africa, combating the transmision malaria. Results proved effective enough to advance to open field trials.
Further Collaboration
Because of this meet-up, we were able to further collaborate in several ways with teams in attendance. We learned that Duke University was also attempting to build a DIY Thermocycler, We were able to offer some guidance to Rock Ridge High School, and had some collaboration on the Interlab Study with the College of William and Mary.
Duke and PCR
Our collaboration with Duke started during the regional meet up. We came to an understanding that our machines were heading down similar paths, at the time. We understood that our teams had the same list of hardware, peltier elements, Arduino microprocessors, and motor controllers. Seeing that our goals were aligned we thought the best probability of success for our teams would come from a collaboration. We set up an email conversation with Duke and began exchanging weekly conversations about how we were progressing and sending each other pictures of our progress. When we ran into issues with our peltier units we spoke to Duke and warned them of the potential issues, and through the subsequent conversations with them we were able to conclude that the peltier platform was not ideal for PCR. We therefore switched gears and moved to designing a hairdryer based unit. Without a collaboration with Duke and the ability to have an open forum to discuss ideas we might have failed to recognize the short coming of our first device.
Rock Ridge Virginia and Project Design
After Rock Ridge presented their initial project design at the meetup, several of our members collaborated with their team to discuss the feasibility and direction of their project. Fortunately, several of our members has already discussed the possibility of undertaking a project that was very similar in nature to Rock Ridge's project. As a result, we had already completed the necessary research to advise Rock Ridge on their project that focused on the causative agent of lyme disease. We advised them of possible gene candidates and alterations to their proposed constructs. Our team also offered our similar project proposal for a novel lyme disease biosensor to Rock Ridge as an alternative option for them to undertake.
W&M and Interlab
Due to unfortunate circumstances pertaining to the reliability of cloning, we were unable to acquire one of the interlab study parts. Fortunately W&M send us the construct to permit us to proceed to testing. We must remark that"

Collaborations
From exchanging lab protocols to making an instructional video, and even hosting our very own Instagram challenge, the Stony Brook iGEM team has collaborated with over fifteen teams across the world, sharing deep bonds and bringing everyone together. We knew from the start that an iGEM project is not just about pumping out results on our own, but is rather about a global community coming together, and mutually enjoying the ride. The Stony Brook iGEM team wanted to give every team the same enthusiasm and passion we gave to our project, for the goal of furthering the advancement of synthetic biology research. The collaborations have been extremely helpful towards our experiment, and we cannot be where we are today without them.
Directed Evolution Education with Queens University iGEM
We initially wanted to use directed evolution (DE) to select for cyanobacteria that produced large quantities of sugar. However, we had limited knowledge of DE techniques. Luckily for us, the QGem iGEM team also wanted to use DE in their project and reached out to us. We soon set up a video call and discussed ways we could collaborate.
We learned about how QGem wanted to use error-prone PCR to generate copies of their cortisol-detection circuit and produce a more sensitive detector. We told QGem about how we wanted to use in-vivo UV mutagenesis in combination with Megazyme’s Sucrose D-glucose assay to create mutations and screen variants with the greatest yields of sugar. As we were discussing our projects, we soon realized the breadth of DE techniques and the lack of simple, organized information on the topic.
We decided that working on a simple, organized Directed Evolution resource would be the best use of our time and a great resource for future iGEM teams. Both teams worked together on gathering information, script writing, and recording audio. QGEM filmed the video, and iGEM Stony Brook edited the video and added additional graphics. We hope that future iGEM teams can use these resources as a starting point and an encouragement for implementing DE into their projects!

GMOs‘s regulation in France
Our collaboration with the team Valencia_UPV started in August. We discussed about our projects over a Skype on the 3rd of August. Due to the different application areas, it was complicated to set up an experimental or model collaboration, but we could help each other on our Human Practices projects.                        We asked them to inform local winemakers and viticulturists about our project and get their opinion on our project’s potential impact using the survey we created. They contacted three winemakers from Utiel-Requena (Valencia) and La Rioja; they presented our project Softer Shock and asked them their opinion.  See feedbacks here LINK (to our wiki).                       On our side, we answered to the few questions they had to complete their Human Practices project.                      These questions helped them to have an overview about how their project will be seen in other countries depending on the regulation.
""The collaboration has helped us to define a part of our Human Practices. We wanted to know the social opinion about GMO crops and the current situation about their human consumption in each part of the world. That's important for us because our project depends on it social acceptation.""

Bioethics & Synthetic Biology opinion by experts
Our collaboration with Team Greece began with a mutual interest in our projects, which we discussed over a Skype call on October 16. Due to the completely different application areas there was little room for an experimental or model collaboration, but we could help each other on our Human Practices projects.                      We asked them to inform local winemakers and viticulturists about our project and get their opinion on our project’s potential impact using the survey we created. They contacted three winemakers from Krini and Trikala and another from Thessaloniki (Greece); they presented our project Softer Shock and asked them their opinion.                       On our side, we presented their project “pANDORRA” to some of our human practices contacts and forwarded their surveys, one to bioethics experts and regulators and another to synthetic biology experts.                     These surveys helped them get an overview of how regulation linked to their project works in France and also to have information about synthetic biology related to their project from French experts.

NTHU_Taiwan,2017," could affect our  degradation ability, as  the volume might not be great enough as to carry enough ER-alpha or GFP and the variability in a number of enzymes packaged in the vesicles could compromise the reliability of the system. Nonetheless,  we believe the method should still be tested in the future.
As time went by, we met some problems in the cloning and they helped us to inspect parts in detail and try to solve the problems. As a result, we changed the way of collaboration. Based on their advice, we transformed the plasmids of ER-INP and monobody into E. coli successfully(Figure.1.5-1) and we very much appreciated their help.

MIT,2016," due to a patent on ccdB and negative selection tools in Gateway, iGEM had to remove all ccdB-containing parts from their registry.  Our screening tool, pDEST mCherry, uses red fluorescence to pick successfully transformed cultures.  With this, we hope that iGEM will be able to distribute the parts that were discontinued, and mammalian work that relies on Gateway reactions will be significantly easier for future teams.  While we used the pDEST mCherry successfully in our lab, we needed to test the clarity of the protocol we had written, and whether they would work in other labs.
Collaboration
We were thrilled to work with the Tufts University iGEM team in order to test our protocol, and our construct.
Results
The ligation reaction was successful.  As can be seen on the plate that Tufts sent us, there are white colonies, and small red colonies.
Recombinases' sequences
Collaboration
At the begining of the summer, we had a discussion with the BU Wetlab Team to learn more about recombinases because some of their members and especially their graduate mentor - Ben Weinberg - had substantial experience working with recombinases. They specifically emphasized the issue of leaky expression of recombinase, resulting in high basal expression of output gene. Thus, during the conversation, we jotted down ideas for potential repressing systems, one of which were degradation tag and repressible promoters. However, the majority of their work with recombinase has been with tyrosine (Cre or FLP) family and done on E. coli. Thus, performing recombinase experiments in mammalian cell lines were unpredictable. Additionally, the BU Wetlab Team also helped us to obtain sequences for the recombinases and their equivalent recognition sites from Dr. Wilson Wong's lab.

OLS_Canmore,2016," the jamboree (October 13th) we discovered why were having so many issues transforming, cloning, and miniprepping.  Although we sent orders to the synthesis company and they confirmed that they were to be sent in the backbone pUC57, they were accidentally sent in a pet vector.  The problems in the lab were because we were using Ampicillin to screen for colonies containing the plasmid, rather than Kanamycin.  This seems to be a random error, and while it is unfortunate, we were still able to complete the biobrick parts.
We are very happy to have collaborated with the Lethbridge high school team this year. Our collaboration was very constructive for both teams.
Biotreks
This year our team was asked to participate in the publishing of the first ever edition of Biotreks.  Biotreks is a peer-reviewed startup journal created specifically to showcase high school synthetic biology projects. We chose to write two papers that focused on different aspects of our project and overall iGEM experience: one research paper and one perspectives paper. Both of our papers also required us to make videos to give short summaries of their contents.
Groups taking part in the Biotreks publication include:
Rock Ridge High School
Tuscarora High School
Brockton High School
Renaissance High School
Broad Run High School
Our research paper included background on the problem we are aiming to fix, the methods we used to construct and test our project, the results and what we learned from them, and what he  hope to do with our project in the future.
Abstract for ""Expression of Keratinase Genes in the Bacillus Genera for in Escherichia coli JM109 and DH5alpha for use in the Poultry and Wastewater Management Industries""
An estimated 8.5 billion tons of poultry feathers are produced from farms globally every year, in addition to the tons of human hair that is extracted from wastewater treatment facilities worldwide. Keratinase is a serine protease that primarily attacks the disulfide bonds in keratin waste—such as feathers and hair.  The expression of bacterial keratinase provides an opportunity to manage this degradation-resistant keratin waste. This study aims to provide a foundation for future management of hair and feather waste by reducing the negative effects that the current treatment methods have on the environment, and by producing a useful amino acid protein product of high quality such as animal feed and fertilizers. This is done through a semi-quantitative analysis of keratinase A (kerA) and keratinase"

Collaborations overview
The focus of iGEM is progress in research and the improvement of Biobricks to standardize biological parts for an easier application. To reach this ambitious goal and receive medals in the iGEM competition, teams must work together and establish solidarity and cooperation instead of rivality. The following text is an overview of our collaborations.
We asked team Bielefeld to help us with our first steps in iGEM. During our meeting they gave us a detailed instruction for the Gibson- and Biobrick-Assembly and many useful information about Sponsoring. Without their help we had not gained  such a good impression and we decided to finally sign up for iGEM. Read more!
Another important Team we cooperated with, was team Aachen . Like us they are working on a project with an optogenetic focus. We built a lightbox for the light-controlled induction of optogenetically controlled proteins for Team Aachen.  We already had a blueprint from our own lightbox therefore we were able to build an improved version which perfectly fits the requirements Aachen poses. So the box was ready to use for their testing phase. Read more!
We also received help from team Tübingen , as they sent us four yeast shuttle vectors. The vectors were not available from the iGEM HQ, but required for our project. We are thankful that we did not have to produce them ourselves, which enabled us to build and use our yeast constructs instantly. Read more!
OPTOPTOSIS also coordinated a Collaboration between eight german iGEM teams! For our postcard campaign we contacted all german iGEM teams and asked them to join us and create postcards showing and describing relevant topics of synthetic biology. They contain short descriptions so everyone can understand what synthetic biology is about. Most teams gave us a positive feedback and joined immediately.  After finishing the cards, we sent them to each other and distributed all cards on any events we organized like e.g. the NRW-Day. Read more!
We had"
EPFL,2016," end of October. Not only knowing a few teams before meeting them is an advantage, it also can be beneficial during the iGEM experience over the summer. We learned a lot from other teams, and attempted to help others in every way we could. We therefore also believe this platform has a great potential to remain implemented in future iGEM years. Finally, we succeeded in making a unique website improving teams contacts and also helping teams find other like-minded projects to provide mutual collaborative assistance.
So far we received a lot of positive feedback about our initiative and people were really happy to learn about what everyone else was doing. One aspect contributing to this, is that is meant to give a quick and easy understanding of a project, so groups can easily get to know about a team within five minutes!
With this, we want to thank all the teams that participated in igem.today . We truly could not have achieved it without them!
XMU China Newsletter
Continuing in our desire to communicate with other iGEM teams, we contributed to the XMU China Newsletter by sending a project and a team description.
Surveys
Whenever we can, we participate to other iGEM teams surveys to help them in the advancement of their project. We notably participate to the ones from Paris Evry, Paris IONIS, Münich and we even receive a collaboration badge from Paris Pasteur.
What other teams think about igem.today
“iGEM Today was very good idea. The website, acting as a bridge amongst teams from all around the world, was really fun to visit and to read. The idea of such a collaboration is something we definitely want to see in the future, as teams always want to know what other iGEMers are doing and who they are!”
Paris IONIS
“We loved iGEM Today! It was very fun to talk with you guys and we think that having a website where we can meet and read all about other teams' projects is a great idea. We think it is very useful for connecting all of the iGEM teams and get to know all the incredible things everyone is doing!”
Tec-Monterrey
“iGEM.today was a great way to let us meet each other. Sometimes it is very hard to find out who the other teams are and what they are doing, but the iGEM.today platform let us have easy access to other teams’ projects, and most importantly, the people of that team. We enjoyed a lot reading the interviews and the team descriptions. Thank you a lot for this gift you made to the iGEM 201"

Achievement
Igem Team Collaborations :
We performed our experiment at an open lab named “La Paillasse”. When we learned at the European Experience that The Ionis team also happened to use this lab, we were excited to start. Since the end of July, we share the same bench, exchanging protocols, advices,reagents and materials such as tips, mediums, antibiotics, cells. We helped them directly with their manipulations, nanodroping and sequencing some of their samples when they needed to and they gave us competent DH5α E. coli when we needed it the most.  When we arrived at “La Paillasse” , they were highly helpful as they showed us around, taught us different tricks for our experiments and how to use the various equipment present. We believe that exchanging ideas between our two teams, helped both going through the competition.
One of our team goals was to raise awareness about the IGEM competition and to maitain the IGEM culture as a tradition for the various universities. To do so, we invited the IONIS team in a conference at the UPMC University, for students from the Molecular and Cellular Biology Master, where we knew we would have a large audience. The objective was for students to see the diversity of projects present in the competition, but also to promote collaborations between teams. Together, we presented the competition, our individual projects and our experience with every aspect of the competition. It was a successful meeting as numerous students approached us at the end and long after the meeting.
We also participated in surveys from different IGEM teams including the Evry team (“Let's PLAy: Polylactic Acid Plastic Revolution”), Göttingen team (“B₁₂ - Another Brick in the Wall”) and Munich United team (“Enabling Factors in Biotech”). Concerning the Evry team’s survey, as it was a survey directed to the general public, we also motivated other people to fill it. We are looking forward to see the results of these surveys. We show here the badge code we received from Munich United team and the Evry team!

Botchan_Lab_Tokyo,2017," EU, Korea, Canada, Chile and India group biological agents according to the risk they might create. These groups, in turn, determine what safety measures are to be taken in each case.
In Korea, Canada and Chile, the facilities must also be located in an isolated or secluded location. Chile only requires it for biosafety levels 3 and 4. Finally, Korea and India require the existence of a decontamination room between the work area and the outside.
As a consumer, how do I know if a product I want to buy contains GMOs?  The legal requirements for disclosing GMOs within food and other products differ across the world. Some countries within the Americas have little to no laws in place regarding GMO labeling. In the USA, there are no official obligations for companies to label any products containing GMOs. The same applies to Canada, unless the food is likely to pose a health or safety risk to consumers, in which case full disclosure of GMOs is mandatory. The Brazilian government, which has until now required companies to label transgenic products with a T symbol, is (as of 2017) currently considering removing this law. Chilean government might be a notable exception as it prohibits the introduction into the market of any products containing GMOs.  In contrast, most of Europe, Asia and Oceania have strict guidelines surrounding labeling of GMO products. The European Union, Australia, India and Indonesia all require the packaging of such products to be bear the label “this product contains genetically modified organisms”, although exceptions do exist in the form of medical products (in the European Union) and foods produced by animals fed with GMO foods (in Australia). Japan and Korea follow a percentage scale, with GMO labelling required if a product contains more than 5% and 1% genetically-modified ingredients respectively.
What are the most important documents related to GMMs? The documents related to GMM concern a wide range of issues like Manufacturing, Transportation, Safety, Environment, Health, etc.  When it comes to Biosafety, places like European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea, India, and Indonesia clearly have got laws and regulations concerning biosafety and documents are supposed to be submitted in this regard. US and Canada do not seem to have any separate regulation regarding biosafety. However, in the US, Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology (1986) ensures the safety of the public.  For GMMs products (food, drugs, cosmetics etc.), places like the European Union, United state, India, and Canada have a policy and law for the use and regulation of GMM products"
ETH_Zurich,2015," their survey on the public awareness of and opinion on synthetic biology, which they had planned to conduct in Lausanne. Together we then went out to the people in Basel to find out about their attitude towards this scientific discipline. In our survey, we found that most of the people we asked had either not heard about synthetic biology before or in case they had, they did not feel informed enough. It seems that the idea of genetically modified organisms is something that causes a lot of discomfort in many people. You can find out more about the results of our survey on our Awareness page .  Despite Switzerland being a small country, there is a big diversity amongst different parts of the population. Therefore it was very interesting for us to compare the opinions we got from people in Lausanne, one of the bigger cities in the French-speaking and generally more liberal part of Switzerland, to the answers we received in Basel, located in the German-speaking part of Switzerland.

FREIBURG
Figure 1: kill-switch overview
We have been in contact with the Freiburg team since the beginning of the iGem  adventure. We quickly realized that our respective project were going in the same direction, as we were both focusing on Colitis ulcerosa and engineering bacteria to fight diseases in vivo. However unlike us Freiburg is focusing on finding a way to facilitates local activation of targetted drug-delivery, and uses spores of Bacillus subtilis.
After several Skype meetings we figured out that the best way to join our forces on the project was to share our experience in modeling. We designed and provided them a full deterministic characterization of the kill-switch essential to the circuit bio-safety. The kill-switch is design based on the MazE/F gene mechanism, and is activated under aTc induction.The MazEF system is natively found in E.Coli and Bacillus Subtilis. The system consists in two adjacent genes mazE and mazF located downstream the relA gene. MazE and MazF are co-transcribed under a Pmaz promoter.
MazF is a toxin while MazE is the anti-toxin. The MazEF complex also inhibits the Pmaz promoter. The idea  of the switch is to synthesize under certain conditions the anti-MazE protein which prevents translation of  the MazE protein. Thus it will prevent it from binding MazF. The concentration of MazF in the circuit will increase and lead to cell death.

Entente Interdépartementale de Démoustication (EID) Méditerranée
Interstate Organization for Mosquito Control. The EID (Entente Interdépartementale de Démoustication / Interdepartmental agreement for mosquito control on the Mediterranean coast) is in charge of the fight against mosquito epidemics, which is recognized as a mission of public interest for the Ministry of Health in France. Therefore, EID is acting by delegation of authority, in a similar level as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US. We had a skype meeting and mail exchanges with Dr. Gregory Lambert, a medical coordinator and entomologist at EID. These interviews have allowed us to gather the opinion of field experts and to design our project so that it would best address the needs of professionals. This input enabled us to better take into account the mosquito's lifestyle and optimize our device’s safety features with regard to local populations. Dr. Lambert's professional opinion on the current methods used in the field, the materials for trapping and detection, safety procedures, protocols, coordination with the state and the health representatives, prevention of the public, data processing, and much more was extremely helpful while working on the practical application of our project in the field. Every aspect we discussed was an opportunity for us to both enhance our project and to benefit from constructive criticism about our device. Dr. Lambert told us that the method they used has been adapted to the current situation in France, but that our Mos(kit)o solution could be used in addition, or even completely replace theirs in the future, because it would be more precise and more adapted to such epidemics. He proposed to test our device in the field as soon as we develop a functioning kit, and he said that he was eager to stay informed about our future improvements.

Protocol videos
Our team decided to create protocol videos in order to help young scientists to manipulate.       When people are working on Genetics engineering, there are several basic experiments that have to be controlled.       During our experiments, we filmed 4 steps of cloning: PCR, digestion, ligation and transformation.
Watching it, people could see how to manipulate safely.       We asked other igem teams to translate protocols in their mother tongue.       We obtained protocol videos in English with Imperial College team,       in Spanish thanks to the TEC-Monterrey team,       in Dutch with Leiden team,       in Chinese with BIT team,       in Portuguese thanks to EEL team,       in German with Hamburg team and       in French with the collaboration of the Bordeaux team.       We wrote the entire script and we added some guidance in red (minutes for each paragraphs for instance). Teams had to translate and record the script.      Now, we possess a lot of protocols explained in six different languages, accessible to everybody on Youtube and on our wiki.

Aachen (2014)
For controlling the efficiency of the newly developed methane biosensor, it was necessary to have an equipment as reference. Therefore, we looked for former iGEM teams who dealt with methane and might have a basic gadget which is able to determine the concentration of methane. The iGEM Braunschweig ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Braunschweig ) modified  E. coli in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. They intended to place these bacteria in cow’s rumen, which is a serious source of methane emission, where the bacteria would have transformed methane into non-greenhouse gases. They wanted to know how much their bacteria can reduce the methane emission, therefore, they created collaboration with iGEM Aachen ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen) , and thanks to this collaboration, they was given a low-cost DIY methane sensor ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Collaborations/Braunschweig ).
We liked the construct very much, so we asked Team Aachen for the plans and the program of the sensor and we received valuable help, which we appreciated very much. Thank you!
UNebraska-Lincoln 2017
Since all scientific work should be carried out at the highest level human and environmental safety, we found it important to spread the priority of biosafety. Team UNL 2017 (https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln ) aimed to teach other teams to form their Safety cases. They asked us to help creating their Safety case, and we advised them some further aspects how they could  develop their well-written work ( https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln/Collaborations#hungary ). We also received useful help from UNebraska-Lincoln team so we could accomplish the Safety part of our project.
To be able to finalize our construct, it was needed to have an effective promoter, which can be used in the bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus. We inquired whether they know a possible promoter, and hopefully it was not an unknown question to the UNL 2017 Team. Thank you very much!

Development of A Novel Blood-MicroRNA Handy Detection System with CRISPR
HomePage • TEAM • Collaborations
Collaboration with NJU-China
NJU-China performed a Cas9-digest assay to help us validating the effectiveness of their sgRNAs, since our team met some trouble in assessing the efficiency of the single guide RNAs we designed for our further experiments. Also, they helped us to optimize our own protocol for in vitro expression of sgRNAs, so that our project could be performed more smoothly.
In return, we performed TEM imaging of exosomes carrying KRAS siRNA and expressing iRGD peptide on their membrane for NJU-China, as well as nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to help them to ascertain the relationship between protein concentration and exosomes quantity.
Collaboration with NJU-China
After co-transfection of the two plasmids mentioned above, we performed a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize the iRGD-modified siRNA-loaded exosomes. The TEM image showed that the exosomes presented normal morphological characteristics after outside modification and siRNA loading, with a diameter of approximately 200 nanometer and a double-layer membrane. These characteristics indicate that the exosome properties won’t be affected by our modifications.

Nanoparticle tracking analysis to ascertain the relationship between protein concentration and exosomes quantity
We then performed nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) for a further evaluation of the quantity and size of secreted exosomes. The use of Nanosight enabled quantification and size determination of the extracellular vesicles, as nanoparticles can be automatically tracked and sized based on Brownian motion and the diffusion coefficient. The size of exosomes attained ranged around 270nm. Basing the particle size and relative intensity, we also created a 3D plot for a visual explanation. Under measurement condition listed, the exosomes extracted from HEK293 cells were assayed for 2.95 E8 particles each milliliter. Then the relationship between particle number and protein was determined that ex"

We also contacted SDU-Denmark about expression of chromoproteins in pSB1C3.      SDU-Denmark gave us some advice and told us to use another promoter in order to express the chromoproteins.
Meetups
Nordic iGEM Conference
In June, DTU BioBuilders went to the Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC) in Stockholm hosted by team Stockholm. During the weekend, DTU BioBuilders connected and shared their projects with the other Nordic teams. DTU BioBuilders presented their project at a mini-Jamboree, where the requirements set by iGEM Headquarters were in focus. The mini-Jamboree gave DTU BioBuilders the opportunity to get a feel of the big iGEM competition in Boston and refine their project.
Besides the mini-Jamboree and two workshops, Ethics and Speculative Design of Synthetic Biology, there was also time for barbeques and other social activities to get to know the other teams.
Human Practice Workshop
UNIK-Copenhagen hosted a Human Practice workshop in August where the DTU BioBuilders attended together with SDU-Denmark and Chalmers-Gothenburg. The workshop was very useful and a great success, and DTU BioBuilders were involved in patent reflections, public speaking, ethics, philosophy, and human practices in general.
The European iGEM Experience
In July, iGEM EVRY and iGEM IONIS hosted a big gathering in Paris for many of the European iGEM teams.
DTU BioBuilders attended this big gathering and presented and opposed their project to the other teams. It was a great occasion to share ideas and explore new possibilities about our project. Furthermore, the team had two interesting talks about synthetic biology, where they learned about challenges, risks and the economical aspect of synthetic biology.

Summary:
Through their RT-PCR expertise, NTU Singapore aided us in gaining a better understanding of the transcription rates within our composite Hydrogen Gas Producing Gene Cluster plasmid.
Our efforts have successfully purified their dCas9 mutants and suggest that all are functional in vitro. This has provided in vitro evidence for the NTU Singapore team that these four mutants are no longer functional nucleases, but retained their ability to bind the gRNA and targeted gene sequence.
Purification of dCas9 mutants
The plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli and expressed under auto-induction conditions. Cells were then harvested, lysed and purified using a Ni-NTA resin with standard His-tag purification protocols. Eluates were then ran on an SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 1). The largest band in each of the eluates corresponds to the various dCas9 mutants with its respective truncations based on NTU’s design, suggested that the expression and purification procedure was performing well.
Figure 1. SDS-PAGE gel of the His-tagged dCas9 constructs. Lane 1 contains a 198kDa ladder. The cell lysates and the corresponding eluates were loaded next to each other. Intact dCas9 proteins can be identified as the slowest migrating protein band in all the 4 constructs as the band with the highest intensity, showing a successful expression and purification of the His-tagged proteins. The 2 other bands could be observed in each of the eluate (and also observed in the previous year in Cas9 mutants) were suggested to be cleavage products during the protein synthesis.
In vitro CRISPR assay + EMSA
To test the dCas9 constructs, we adapted our in vitro CRISPR assay from the previous year to include in electrophoretic migration shift assay. As the dCas9 constructs were designed to not have nuclease activity, while retaining the ability to bind to the gRNA and target DNA, we set up variations of the in vitro CRISPR assay to track the progression of the target DNA, gRNA, cleavage products, and protein migration on a DNA retardation gel (6% acrylamide in TBE, ThermoFisher Scientific), while comparing to a commercial Cas9 with nuclease activity.
The four purified samples were subjected to three treatments (Figure 2, 3 consecutive lanes within the green lines for each sample):

This year is the first time we participate in iGEM competition. Given the little experience we had and the confusions regards to rules and regulations, it was extremely lucky for us to have ShenZhen University iGEM team as a mentor throughout the competition. Right from the beginning on team built-up, members selection, project formulation, to later stage of technical troubleshooting, project progress control, and eventually Wiki and poster formulation, etc. It is fair to say that our project would not even exist without the generous and timeless help from the whole SZU team. You guys are the stars!
In return, we helped them testing CA enzymatic activity and plotting standard curves using two different methods, as we have previous experience (interlab studies and our own project) of generating good results using plate reader in our lab. It was a great learning experience for us this year, and hope we will be able to pass on these invaluable experience to someone else in need in the future.
Besides SZU team, we also received great help and advice from other iGEM teams in the local region. For instance, by participating in Southern China Regional Meeting that was held in May this year, we shared our project idea with the participated teams, including SYSU-China, SUSTC-China, SCUT-iGEM, SZU-China, SCAU-China and SSTi-China, and received constructive suggestions on project formulation and technical approaches.
Through the discussion, we came up with fresh ideas and were able to locate solutions for problems encountered. Altogether it helped enormously to the following progress of our project. Furthermore, iGEM Organizing committee organized an Asian team leaders’ workshop that focused on team building, laboratory safety and practices. We have learned quite a lot about what’s on about iGEM, and how to make a meaningful and beneficial project. Organizer also invited experts from biotechnology industry to present us current developments in the industry, which really opened up our mind.

TecCEM,2018,"RHIT iGEM “League of Superheroes”
Science is a matter of inspiration, creativity, and imagination. These elements allow iGEM                         participants to create their project superheroes and turn to them for help in case of                         adversities. As one may imagine, evil is around the corner when it comes to obstacles during the project. For this reason, the superpowers of “Hacatto”, the protector of the Tec                         CEM team came in handy to inspire the team and help us with the project. Thanks to the                         collaboration proposed by the RHIT team, we transformed frustration into inspiration.
iGEM NEBRASKA SCRAPBOOK
Although the most optimistic iGEMers may believe that their project will succeed in the                         first attempt, truth is that it may take several attempts before even getting the first                         expected results. However, the best way to acquire experience and improve one's performance                         at a given activity is “resilience”. Embracing our mistakes and learning from them allowed                         us to overcome obstacles throughout the development of our project. Even though people may                         consider mistakes as a failure, for iGEM Nebraska, it’s all the other way around, or at                         least that is the impression we got from the collaboration they organized: A scrapbook that                         contained and displayed with pride the worst electrophoresis gels of the participating                         teams. Thanks to the scrapbook, teams like ours presented some of the mistakes made during                         the competition. This collaboration inspired us to do our best and changed our minds to                         understand mistakes as opportunities to improve.

Collaborations
For this year's competition we collaborated with Stanford-Brown, Yale University, and Santa Clara University. For all of the schools we completed surveys that they were distributing.
Stanford-Brown iGEM:
The Stanford-Brown iGEM team was looking into bacterial transformations. Their survey involved having us answer questions regarding our transformation efficiency, and the problems that occurred over the summer. By working with them to complete the survey we are helping Stanford-Brown create a novel method of transformations. If their transformation protocol indeed increases efficiency, then their technique will help future iGEM teams save time and allow them to get further into their projects over the course of the summer.
Yale iGEM:
The main chassis for iGEM tends to be E.Coli, as well as S. Cerevisiae for the eukaryote model. As iGEM continues to expand, more and more teams are beginning to use non-model strains in their work. Both Yale and our team were using non-model strains during this summer. Our work revolved around cyanobacteria, as did Yale's. By working with them to complete their survey, they are building a catalog to help future iGEMers be able to have more materials going into a summer with a non-model organism. Expanding the catalogs available will give more opportunity for iGEM teams to have novel ideas in new organisms that may have desirable characteristics.
Santa Clara iGEM:
Santa Clara University's iGEM team focused on a survey outside of the lab. They were getting in contact with teams to see if they were able to use their school's resources, or off campus resources, to help complete their project. We worked with a few departments on campus to help our project get off the ground, and so sharing our experiences can help guide other iGEM teams. Every iGEM team should have some sort of outside resource to help them compete their project, whether it involves math modeling or website design. Without the help of others to build the project many problems will arise, and we believe Santa Clara University is doing their best to showcase the benefits of using outside resources during the summer.
About Us
We are the first iGEM team from University of La Verne and La Canada High School. We are an interdisciplinary team with members from biology, math, computer science, art, and"
SJTU-Software,2015,"olerance mechanisms, among which sodium export is the most important one. Halorhodopsin is a light-driven inward-directed chloride pump from halobacteria. They functionally expressed it in cyanobacteria to drive the influx of chloride together with sodium, thus conferring cyanobacteria the ability to absorb salts to a significant degree. And the biobrick they used in their program is to control the expression quantity of HR protein which served as the pump.
Our goal is to evaluate their biobrick by scoring two parallel experiment results.
we got the new devices and its structure from SJTU-BioX-Shanghai and noticed that the parts was built by themselves not long ago. when we download the database data, they had not upload their new biobrick. So we could not find the parts' ID from the new devices in our database.
In order to evaluate the new parts, we use the blastn to find the parts in our database with most similar sequence compared to the new parts. Then we use the parts found in our database to evalue the the new devices. We found the coding parts in the device is most important, so our algorithm give the coding part a highest weight.
And the consequence of this collaboration is very ideal. The two devices got two disparate scores, one of which is scored 32.98 and the other is 3.542. In addition, this difference is also reflected by their experiment result that the one with the higher score is chosen as their final biobrick to control the expression of the iron pump.
so this collaboration prove that our algorithm can evaluate new device roughly on the base of existing part.
This year, China-Tongji used the optogenetics technology to control  the simple movement of nematodes. In the pathognostic motoneuron and muscles of nematodes, the opsin will be expressed, which is a type of photosensitive channel protein that will be activated at a specific wavelength of light. Then it will stimulate some neurons and ultimately achieve the purpose of nematode movement control.
However, during the evaluation, we found that some of their biobricks are so new that we nearly couldn't find them in our database which covered the data in the iGEM official website. The result showed that those biobricks were never synthesized before.
Beyond that, we also found the regulator BBa_K1634003 is almost 80% similar to BBa_K309026 which is made by a team from Canada. This result might be used to compare the function of their biobricks with the other team, and explored more useful information from"

Check out a ""snapshot"" of our results below and read our modelling page for the full story! Furthermore, Technion Israel helped us develop our Human Practices even further, participating in our skill-exchange questionnaire, spending hours writing about their experiences communicating with scientists from other disciplines.
iGEM Bulgaria
iGEM Bulgaria also responded to our collaboration request that was posted on the iGEM collaboration hub. In this instance, we were actually able to help them by sending materials for use in the wet lab. Specifically, iGEM Bulgaria wanted to try new means of chromosomal integration, so we provided them with the Serine Integrase Bxb1 and the recombineering plasmids pSIM7 and pSIM9, so they could attempt various methods of chromosomal integration in E. coli should any method not work. They were also very obliging in helping our team with human practices as well, answering our detailed skill-exchange questions, which helped us gain a better understanding of communication between biologists and engineers in particular.
Edinburgh OG
As a collaboration, we have helped the Edinburgh_OG team by giving them the E. coli BL21(DE3) and C600, essential to work with T7 and P1 phages respectively. We provided them the electroporator, used for the λ phage work to electroporate their constructs into the phage. Finally, we did a join presentation at the for 30 people through the Synthetic biology society at the University of Edinburgh to raise awareness and interest about iGEM by explaining the competition and our projects.
Our team is also greatly indebted to the Edinburgh_OG team for their help on giving advice and providing direction to our modelling, which led us into developing the stochastic model, a more accurate algorithm in describing the behaviour of our system."

Tart_TUIT Estonia iGEM Team
We started our collaboration with Tart_TUIT iGEM Team from an Interlab study during which we tried to help each other to verify the final results. Later, our collaboration expanded to the discussion of our projects through the Skype meeting, where we could share ideas about different aspects of the competition and suggest some improvements on the current issues.
San Diego high school team
We have arranged a Skype meeting with a CCA-San Diego high school team , during which we shortly presented our projects. Since both our of our projects were related to bioremediation of oil products and production of hydrogen gas, we suggested them possible methods for hydrogen gas detection and quantification. This team has truly cheered us up with their enthusiasm and the collaboration went mutually productive.

Collaborations
This year we have participated in 3 collaborations. All three of these were focused on seeing what other teams thought about our project, soliciting advice about the best usage for our construct and getting insights into ethical concerns regarding implementation.
Two collaborations were with the two universities that have worked on this project in the past. The University of Chicago 2013 iGEM team worked on a project aimed at breaking down feathers with the goal of turning the products produced by the keratin waste into useful products.  The University of Sheffield 2014 iGEM team worked on a construct that will break down hair as a side project to their main “fatburger” project. Our collaborations with these teams was centered around the sharing of information regarding their past constructs, as our project is based on troubleshooting and debugging those issues. Further, we hoped to characterize these parts, get input on ethical and safety concerns, and plan the future tests and implementation of our project.
Our third collaboration was with a high school iGEM team based out of Consort, Alberta. Their project they've been working on for the past three seasons has been working to detect oil spills in soil by first detecting xylene, as xylene is a good early biological indicator.  We collaborated with them in order to receive feedback on what they thought about our project as well as to give them feedback on their project. As geographically close high school teams, it was nice to have some face time at the mini Alberta jamboree we hosted in May 2015 at our school.  We shared a lot of initial feedback about the pros and cons of our presentations, and continued to be in close contact with the Consort team as we prepared for the Giant Jamboree!
The University of Sheffield 2014 Collaboration.
Our first collaboration was made with the the university of Sheffield, we connected with them with the goal of hearing their thoughts on our project and getting any advice that they were willing to give concerning our project, as one of our constructs is  based off their construct that was created as a side project to there “Fatburger” project, a project which was started as a solution to fats and oils build ups, which are caused when fats and oils solidified in the drains.

Army West Point
Our team had a video conference with team Cadets2Vets in late June. During the video conference we were able to discuss a few issues that the Army team was having with their project. Due to our teams past experience we were able to not only give advice, but we were also able to correct some of the minor issues they were having with their project. We were also able to give insight as to how to prepare for the jamboree and what they should expect.
Airforce
Our team also had a video conference with the Air force team in late June. We mainly discussed the interlab studies with this team. At this point in the summer our team was able to complete the majority of the interlab study, so we gave them a few suggestions. We were also able to answer a few questions regarding the project as a whole. As a team sponsored by a secure laboratory, it becomes difficult in some aspects for the team that are taken for granted by other non-military teams. For example, our team and the air force team was restricted in the ability to take pictures in the lab and even to bring our work with us at the end of the day. This was due to the level of security that was apparent at these military research facilities. As an iGEM veteran, our team was able to give them key advice on how to get around some of these restrictions.
NRL
We were fortunate enough to collaborate with the Naval Research lab to debunk a few misconceptions the civilian population might have about the use of synthetic biology in the military. We were able to contribute to a podcast that will be available on the NRL website sometime in November. In this podcast, we talk about the military and their use of synthetic biology, why as Midshipmen and Future officers in the Navy and Marine Corps it is important to be knowledgeable in these biological advancements."

Westminster iGEM 2018 team
Over the course of the summer we had the pleasure to meet and talk with teams from around UK. During the UK Meetup we learnt about an amazing project developed by the Westminster iGEM team, which was also tackling the problem of plastic waste!
Although we had chosen to use very different approaches we had lots in common because we were inspired by the same aim. We therefore chose to develop a collaboration with a focus on sustainability. As we had found Life Cycle Assessment an incredibly helpful tool in the design of our PHBV production process, we wanted to share the experience and knowledge gained during our summer and provide them with an LCA for their project. Westminster sent us with all data we requested and we used LCA as a model to identify the environmental hot spots of their process. Our work is detailed on our Life Cycle Assessment page under ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO – EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE . From our collaboration we learnt that perhaps in future, our own project could actually contribute in a new way to solve the plastic problem, by degrading the polystyrene and converting it into bioplastics as there is a monomer common to both processes. If you want to know more about the LCA tool, and how we successfully adapted it for another iGEM project please visit LCA page .

In addition, we got a lot of skills and realized our flaws from others'  presentation and the judges' evaluation on them. We believe that the other teams have a similar experience. Moreover, we harvested valuable friendship from iGEMers who have the same interest as we do. It was surely significant for the way ahead.

Overview
Because our project is a fundamental one, there were a lot of teams that were interesting to collaborate with. For the next years we expect that by making an organized biofilm structure, a lot of teams can use the method we designed this year. During the development of our project, we received a lot of ideas and input from other teams - what is useful for a biofilm and what not. Some of these can be seen on the Policy and Practice page under iGEM Community section. For this we collaborated with the Berlin, KU"
UGA-Georgia,2015,"pace, Columbia University, and Vanderbilt University. We can’t thank our participating teams enough for their support and efforts toward our study.
STEP 5: DISTRIBUTION
STEP 6: STATISTICAL TESTS ON DATA
We standardized all team data inputs based on the average UGA M3Z1 flourescence  unit data and created a matrix of this data. We then realized outliers were present in the matrix and ran an Extreme Studentized Deviate test to identify the outliers. After this was done, we created a new matrix similar to the initial matrix, with the numbers adjusted to ignore the outliers. Our data can be seen on our Measurement page.
STEP 7: WHAT THE DATA MEANS
From the collaboration study, we’ve gained priceless information about the reliability and reproducibility of our study, and cornerstones of the scientific method. Our collaboration study not only functions as a system of support that adds validity to our findings with the work we’ve done in the lab—it also only functions as an educational teaching tool that has brought awareness of the capabilities of methanococcus to anyone that read our proposal and knowledge of the methods of reading mCherry fluorescence. In addition, we believe it helps the scientific community as a whole. By creating the logistics and protocol schedule, we’ve created a system that can be used by anyone to distribute protein samples of any kind; provided minor alterations to the protocol be made if a group were working with another type of RFP or GFP. The information we’ve gained from this collaboration effort has been priceless and we’d encourage any team to try to implement our setup into their own study.
STEP 8: THE FUTURE
As for the future of the collaboration effort, we would like to send out recombinant cells for teams to observe the archaeal cells with a fluorescence microscope. Also, we would once again like to try to create an official iGEM Archaeal InterLab study to run side-by-side with the E. coli InterLab study. We strongly believe our ‘pilot’ collaboration study to be a huge success and would like to take it to the next step."
Jilin_China,2018," approximately linearly with increasing temperature. This is consistent with our own measurement. The results are vital to us because we need to use this positive control when we process the measurement data of each thermosensor. We are very grateful to Fudan-CHINA for the experiment, which is helpful for us to carry out the follow-up experiments and the data processing.
Here is the link to the wiki of Fudan-CHINA.
2.NPU-China
We cooperated with NPU-China this year, a team from Northwestern Polytechnical University in China.
Our team helped NPU-China characterized two parts because their team was short of staff to characterize all parts. The two parts are coding sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial genome. The cob codes cytochrome oxidase b which is the composition of the electron transport chain. And the introns of cob were all deleted. The var1 codes ribosomal protein. We helped them measure the growth curve to verify if the two parts are toxic to cells.
Figure 3. The figure’s horizontal axis represents the time, and the vertical axis represents OD value. The blue line is the growth curve of Blank, the orange line is the growth curve of cob and the gray line is the growth curve of var1.
As the results shows, the two genes almost don’t have influence on bacterial growth. The result indicated that the two genes are not toxic to cells.
NPU-China also helped us a lot. We designed hundreds of RNA-based thermosensors this year. We need to get their melting temperature, intensity and sensitivity. We have measured some heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensors by ourselves. Nevertheless, we know that at different laboratories and under different experimental conditions, the experimental results could differ. To ensure the accuracy of our experimental results, we sent 5 samples to NPU-China. They helped us measure sfGFP expression at different temperatures. (The 5 samples: RT1-4, RT1-33, K2541003, K2541004, K2541010 ).
Figure 4. The bar colors blue, orange and gray represent the temperatures 31, 35 and 39°C, respectively. The height of the bars corresponds to the normalized fluorescence.
As shown in figure 4, the fluorescence intensity of K2541003, K2541004 and K2541010 increase with elevated temperatures. While the fluorescence intensity of RT1-4 and RT1-33 don’t increase with elevated temperatures. This is consistent with our own measurement results (figure 5).

Our previous methods were similar. We promoted through the seminars, conducted campus exhibitions, and let everyone communicate with us face to face. We can also understand your thoughts and questions more clearly. It is mainly to hold activities that can reach more people and raise awareness of iGEM.
In the early stage, we discussed with the Xiamen University team about the norms and methods of the team selection process. Later, we also discussed how to train new players in the initial stage of team formation.
In May 2018, we conducted the 2019 iGEM recruiting seminar. After the presentation, we conducted the first round of team formation through the QQ group, and released our training and selection items in it. Everyone entered different groups according to their intentions. After that, the relevant leaders in the 2018 team will be trained. In the early stage, I met with you through the group meeting, and arranged and taught the tasks according to different contents, and conducted an assessment between September and October 2018. Different groups determine the way of assessment according to needs. The number module is tested by some models, the art team is initially selected by some design tasks, and the other groups are also performing corresponding tasks.
Throughout the training period, we also conducted unified training for the experimental part. At present, we are more likely to share the necessary bibliography, organize everyone to self-learn, and submit corresponding summary reports on a regular basis.
We have exchanged information with Xiamen University this year. They have put forward some opinions on our training. During the communication process, we found that the selection methods between our two teams are different. They will be the newly selected players. After the determination, the training is carried out, and we are gradually training during the entire selection process, and through the step by step assessment. At the same time, it was found that a large amount of literature reading was started at the beginning, which is a bit difficult for the initial selection. It may be necessary to provide some help, such as some training in reading skills and reading focus. After the discussion, we conducted the previous literature learning training in the second phase of the selection, and found that the literature review written by the second phase of the team was more logical, and also able to better grasp the key points.
Finally, we communicated with the daily management of the team, just like the problems encountered when starting the team. After entering the team, the basic aspects of the experimental part must be approved. After the preliminary determination of the project, each The tasks of the group are gradually"

Team USTC
USTC has been one of our traditional collaborators.
Focusing on the establishment and improvement of a online synthetic biology community this year, USTC, as                     potential users of our bio-hub, offered us opinions and needs in application design and homepage design.                     For example, they suggested adding an online forum named ""iGEMers' Notebook"" in which iGEMers can exchange                     important information and ideas concerning this competition .They also helped us with biological problems                     we came across, such as the biological background of comparative sequence analysis.
In return, we share them with some useful tricks. And we also help them in website making and modeling, which                     speed their work greatly. Besides, we held the annual Science and Technology Week and Science and Technology                     Exhibition, which spread the synthetic knowledge to the public.

Team SJTU-Software
SJTU is one iGEM team which concentrated on developing useful software for bio-brick researchers. Having                     met at Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan, we worked together for our target. During the collaboration,                     we help them removed some inaccurate parts inn bio-brick database. In return, they test our software                     Biohub 2.0 and offered some useful suggestions on safety and design.

BostonU_HW,2016,"ic chip. The two valves were then closed (trapping the cells and culture media inside) and the chip removed from the control infrastructure. From there, we observed masses of cells moving in the sealed area of the chip under a standard light microscope at 10x, as shown. Finally, we relocated the chip an incubator to grow the cells. Unfortunately, the device dried out a day after being placed in the incubator. This visit proved our fabrication flow's ability to create microfluidic devices capable of trapping HEK293 mammalian cells, and gave both teams great insight on the other end of the biologist-microfluidics bridge, and sparked ideas for further customization of microfluidics for the lab bench. Highlighting the rapid design and prototyping enabled with Neptune, not a week later we returned with an entirely new design and batch of two chips ready for further testing (while our design and fabrication flow allows for iterations to occur within hours, the schedule of both teams needed about a week). This further collaboration is detailed below.

PART 2
For our second on-site visit to MIT, we redesigned our chip to better observe the HEK293 cells under the microscope. Namely, this iteration replaced the cell traps and valves with a diamond chamber and an equivalently shaped window through the polycarbonate for facilitated microscopy on the otherwise empty control (red) layer. The valves were removed with the hopes of running fluid through the device while it was under the microscope, and not detaching it from its pumping infrastructure like in the previous iteration. The fluids pumped through the device were similar to the first iteration, starting with ethanol solution, then PBS, suspended cells mixed with culture media, and finally culture media alone. Evaporation, which occurred in the previous chip in the incubator, was assumed to not be in effect in the closed system of the microscope. To allow the cells time to adhere to the PDMS, the flow of culture media was disrupted; unfortunately the flow was disrupted for too long, and the fluid again evaporated out of the chip, likely through the viewing window due to the microscope not being an ideal closed system. This second visit gave timelapse evidence that the HEK293 cells were surviving and beginning to multiply in"

We collaborated with two teams as part of the Human Practices: Singapore’s A team NUSGEM and Toulouse’s team INSA-UPS. We worked on three aspects of the Human Practices that seemed the most important to us in regards of synthetic biology: bioethics as well as the impact of our projects on the economy and society. See Human Practices .
We collaborated with the iGEM team Dalhousie Halifax NS by summarising a research article as requested. We summarised a recent study describing the developmental delays affecting children born with the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) during the last Zika virus epidemic in Brazil. As a result of our collaboration, the team Dalhousie will publish selected articles, including ours, on the website Think of the PLOSibilities on October 18th. This web page was created in 2017 in an effort to promote open-access publishing. This publication thus provided the opportunity to inform the public about the social crisis emerging in Brazil and the special care those children are going to need.
We also collaborated with the team UCSC from the University of California Santa Cruz by sharing information and discussing extraction protocols. They suggested to use a riboswitch in order to detect our final products within our cell cultures. We, however, could not find one that allowed this detection for our products. Our team, on the other hand, suggested them to use HPLC to purify and detect their products. We also explained to them how we financed the HPLC column which is quite expensive and how we collaborated with a university laboratory which granted us access to their equipment to perform HPLC. Moreover, their team helped us get public input by sharing our ethical survey and answering it themselves.
We wanted to give the opportunity to the academic community to learn more about synthetic biology and its implications. To do so, we collaborated with UCLouvain to publicly present the conference Biotech4Change that was presented at the European Parliament. We scheduled a viewing session opened to the public on the campus and we were able to watch and interact during the event.
We initiated a collaboration with the team UAlberta from the University of Alberta. We contacted Julia Heaton in the interest of combining our technologies. The UAlberta team designed an adrenaline biosensor and we wished to use it to detect and quantify"

Science is an international community, that knows no borders, politics or race. When one embarks on a scientific journey, fellow scientists from around the world are there to offer assistance, guidance and a different point of view, all in the name of scientific innovation. iGEM is no exception, placing great emphasis on the collaborative aspect of every team’s project.
Our first interaction was with the Peshawar team from Pakistan. We were especially excited about speaking to them, due to our respective countries not being in diplomatic relations with one another. We exchanged emails for a while, until we finally scheduled a skype session
In the course of the session we discussed our respective projects and needs for the competition. Our new friends helped us gain a new perspective regarding our Wiki design, and offered wisdom about how to tackle this facet of our project.
Next, we reached out to team Bristol . They graciously offered us a tool they had developed for writing Wiki code, which proved to be immensely helpful. Up to that point we encountered setbacks with our wiki design and this collaboration came at an auspicious time. Thanks to this act of professional courtesy, we were able to make significant process on our wiki page.
Unfortunately, we hit a roadblock early on with our wiki design and decided to outsource the process to an external web design company.
Furthermore, we learned from the Lahore team that, from the first days of the project, they had allocated each area of responsibility to a student from the appropriate study field. Following this, we decided that next year’s team should have a computer science student onboard for the purpose of Wiki design.
The jewel in our crown is our collaboration with the Technion team , on the esteemed topic of ethics. We sought to profoundly investigate the ethical side of our project, seeing as how it deals with sensitive subjects spanning genetic engineering and the human food industry. One of our main objectives was to create a product that promotes ecological and sustainable food production, the basis for which is clearly ethics.  The Technion team compiled an ethics handbook, a succinct manifest spanning the world of ethics, covering subjects from the history of ethics to modern day implications. We read this text with guidance from Dr. Meshi"

iGEM Japan Kansai Forum
We participated in iGEM Japan Kansai Forum held in Kansai(West central area in Japan). In the forum paticipants made presentations about their team's project. After that, everyone filled in questionnaires and shared some advice for impriving their projects. In addition to those, we had a party, free talk, and free presentation sessions.
The team which participated in the forum were as below:
Kyoto
Nagahama
Kobe
Gifu
Botchan_Lab_Tokyo
With Botchan Lab Tokyo
Team Botchan Lab Tokyo was newly created this year. Last summer, one of their members, Ayumi Taga, met Yusuke Kishimoto, who belongs to our team HokkaidoU_Japan. Because HokkaidoU_Japan has many years of experience, he taught her how to start up an iGEM team, how to register, what making a project is like, and how to find sponsors. As a result, a new iGEM team came into being.
With Kyoto
We shared our presentation slides and movies to each other on 13th January. We studied their project “NORO CATCHER,” and vice versa: they studied our project “Self-AssembRing.” Furthermore, we studied their way of presentation. We are not good at making presentation slides, so we analyzed how they make slides using Keynote. Also, one of our members, Yusuke Kishimoto, was impressed by the presentation of team Kyoto at the Giant Jamboree 2016, so we all watched the movie of their presentation and it motivated us toward Giant Jamboree 2017."

Harvard_BioDesign,2015," ideas and have a chance to work with and learn from other iGEM teams in the area,                 we attended the New England iGEM (NEGEM) conferences, the first in June and the second in September! At the two meetups,                 we had the chance to listen to others' project presentations and give feedback, as well as receive insight on our own                 presentation and ideas. In addition, we had a good opportunity to begin to talk about collaboration opportunities                 (eventually leading to our own wet lab collaboration with WPI!) The opportunity to meet other like-minded young, eager                 researchers and to truly explore others' ideas gave us invaluable insight into the iGEM community beyond our laboratory,                 and also allowed us to learn more about the diverse possible applications of genetic engineering.

Kyoto,2018,"5) Providing Wiki Creation Assisting Software: KELN to other Teams
Based on last year's feedback, we improved our KELN software which automatically changes experiment notes to HTML-language and distributed it to Team Gifu and Team Botchan_Lab_Tokyo. The following is their feedback:
From Team Botchan_Lab_Tokyo
・It was easy to use even for people who are not computer-savy. So we could divide the work among many people.
・It was easy to customize the ""KELN"" software because the edit display is simple.
・Our experiment sample numbers was so many that we couldn’t write all sample data into a single cell.
・If we can use copy and paste in the software, we will complete the wiki more smoothly.
From Team Gifu
・ Without any special knowledge ,KELN can be used to get HTML code from a lab notebook, so we recommend this software to all iGEM teams!
We are very happy that KELN was helpful for you. All iGEMers can download KELN from here! All iGEMers can download KELN from here!"
Evry_Paris-Saclay,2018," with them about a nice initiative: sending postcards to other teams to share our project. We participated in this initiative and created our own postcard. We have really enjoyed receiving the postcards of the other teams and learning about their interesting iGEM projects.
iGEM MANCHESTER (SCIENCE)
The iGEM Manchester team worked on a model to predict promoter strength and needed new promoter sequences to test it. Since we were characterising a new promoter, pAimX, we happily contributed the sequence of this promoter.
iGEM METU HS ANKARA (SCIENCE)
Beyond the collaboration, we also brought our help to teams which simply needed it. At the beginning of their project, the iGEM METU HS Ankara team contacted us asking a number of questions about setting up and running an iGEM project. We encouraged them to use the 20 kb of free DNA gBlocks provided by IDT, we explained to them how to perform a cloning with Golden Gate Assembly and gave them advice for the design of their parts, especially on introducing appropriate restriction sites into them.
iGEM BIELEFELD CeBiTec (SCIENCE)
We met the iGEM Bielefeld CeBiTec team at the European Meetup, which was organised by iGEM Munich, and we learnt that they were using siRNAs to induce a temporary knockdown in a cell. They argued that they wanted to find an alternative to CRISPR-Cas9 which introduces permanent knockouts and has a high off-target activity. To simplify their project, we proposed to them to perform a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) using the dead Cas9 enzyme (dCas9). This kind of transcriptional regulation is more efficient than RNA interference (siRNA), it is inducible and reversible, and it minimises the toxic effects of off-target cleavage by Cas9."
