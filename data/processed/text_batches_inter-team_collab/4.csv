Unfortunately, Hamburg did not have enough time at this stage of the project to order and test the new primers designed by us. Therefore, they will only add the primers to the gene to facilitate the work for the next group who wants to work on the gene. Even though the gene amplification was not successful in the end, we they emphasized that they are very grateful for the help we provided and the effort we raised to getting fixed their PCR problems. It was also a pleasure for us to work with you.
iGEM goes green
Inspired by this years' iGEM goes green initiative launched by the iGEM Team Dresden , we designed a model that has provided us and will provide the iGEM community with a versatile tool to minimize the amount of medium used in the process of operating Phage-Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE) to develop enhanced proteins. With the help of this model, it is possible for everyone to calculate the appropriate amount of medium that is needed to operate a successful implementation by tuning all parameters. We also provide information about PACE applications conducted by others in the past to compare the values to. For more detailed information about our iGEM goes green activites and to get more information about our medium consumption model please visit our iGEM goes green page .
Mentoring Stuttgart
iGEM Stuttgart did not only participate in our mutagenesis plasmid inter-lab study but also we helped them according several issues. As they are participating in iGEM for the first time, we gave them general advice accoring time management and helped them to set priorites.
To reach their goal for ""lighting up the pipe"" they also needed to include safety aspects and asked us for some inspirations. They asked us to design a killswitch for their bacteria and we suggested to use an optogenetic-killswitch to ensure, that the E. coli are killed after they ""lighted up the pipe"" by secreting keratinases, lipases and esterases. We are happy that you integrated our ideas and suggestions into your project and that we hereby could contribute to make your project safer for the environment.
Translation Center
Bringing science closer to the public is a major goal in iGEM. As communicating scientific content can be challenging because complex issues need to be unraveled to easy understandable terms, one step could be translating scientific texts into many languages . Following this idea, the iGEM Team KU Leuven started a translation center and asked all teams to participate. Each team uploaded its project description"

Vibrigens - Accelerating Synbio
: Establishing Vibrio natriegens as the new chassis organism for synthetic biology
Abtract
Waiting for cells to grow is an enormous time sink for synthetic biologists. Cloning cycles with the current standard, Escherichia coli, typically take up to three days. In our project Vibrigens - Accelerating Synbio, we established the tools to turn Vibrio natriegens into the next generation chassis for synthetic biology, ready to be used reliably. By taking advantage of its unbeaten doubling time of 7 minutes, we substantially reduced waiting time and made one-day-cloning a reality. We built and characterized a flexible golden-gate-based part collection, consisting of more than 100 parts, which enables the creation of complex pathways in a short amount of time. Our engineered V. natriegens strains VibriClone and VibriExpress are designed for cloning and protein expression applications, respectively. Moreover, we established the first synthetic metabolic pathway in this organism by producing the platform chemical 3-Hydroxypropionate and along the way developed an accelerated workflow for metabolic engineering..
https://2018.igem.org/Team:Marburg
As a part of their Human Practices project, they aim to make the iGEM competition accessible to everyone. The iGEM Marburg team sent us a message to participate in the design of an accessible wiki to everyone. Through several emails, we helped each other to write the guide “Accessible webdesign”. We tried to write the guide with easy words and bring examples so that beginners can easily apprehend this wiki concept. The long-term goal is for all iGEM teams to design their wiki without difficulties. We also helped each other improve various parts of our respective wikis. They made a logo to indicate that our wiki is accessible and we put it in the footer of our wiki.

Collaboration with Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU-China)
At the beginning of our project, we met with the team from HZAU-China who have participated in iGEM competitions several times.  Since this is our first competition, they shared their experience with us.  They presented their last iGEM project to us to demonstrate the competition process, and also gave us useful suggestions on the construction of our wiki.
Because they are physically close to us, we were able to build a deep collaboration with them.  Very early in our project they supplied us with plasmid backbones and primers from the 2016 DNA Distribution Kit.  This enabled us to get started on our experiments before we received our 2017 Kit.  They made their plate reader available to us, collaborated with our interlab team, and helped us with procedures and with data comparison and analysis.
They also assisted us with modeling.  They helped us understand the SimBiology toolbox in MATLAB, and showed us how to use the computer for modeling.  They gave us the idea for the establishment of the dynamics model, and gave us a lot of advice about quasi-steady-state approximation and data analysis.

Interaction throught the Google Group - filtered.
Survey in Epicollect5 - filtered.
iGEM Networks of communication
Three main networks were analyzed:
The Slack interaction network is built from replies, mentions, invitations and reactions to messages.
The google group network is made of interactions and replies among Google group members as well as external collaborators.
The Epicollect network is built from regular survey data collecting information about the interaction in the lab with other team members.
In all networks, links are weighted by the number of interactions, and node size reflects the level of interaction (sum of link weights).
iGEM Networks of communication
Community detection was run on the whole aggregated network collapsing information from the 3 sources, resulting in two communities.
Complementary data has been collected using proximity sensors, and is still awaiting further analysis.
Summary
The three networks give a complementary picture of the interaction networks. In particular, hubs in one network are not necessarily hubs in another (showcasing communication channel preference).
The Google group data, which is the most active communication channel, reveals a variable engagement between a core active group and a more peripheral one. It also reveals a strong collaborative nature of the team with a high density of interactions.
The Epicollect data shows that the team members shared a lot of daily interactions with all other members
The Slack data is poorer in terms of number of events and is dominated by a few members who preferred this channel of communication
Comparison with the sensor based approach will allow to reveal a finer understanding of the underlying process

NEU_China_B,2018," teams each encountered in the experiment problem. The Q&A are as follow.
Figure 5. Meeting
NEU_China_B: How do you ensure that the integrative vector in transformation will not lose?
SCAU-China: The integrative vector we used is pFQ20 provided by the Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The homology arms in integrative vector for homologous recombination allows the target genes to be stably transferred into the genome of Microcoleus vaginatus. It has been verified through our experiment results.
SCAU-China: How to match the concentration of AI-2 expressed by the first plasmid pCFDuet-1 with the GFP concentration expressed by pet28a(+).
NEU_China_B: Our experiment was to release the AI-2 signal molecule after the pCFDuet-1 expression plasmid induction of lactic acid concentration, and AI-2 signal molecule can inhibit the lldr sequence on the second plasmid pet28a(+).
The lldr sequence is capable of producing GFP-deterring proteins. In the experiment, we verified that two plasmid copies were more similar, and that the O1O2 sequence could be started normally when the lactic acid concentration was lower (less than 1 mM), and then the GFP gene could be produced fluorescent signal.
Therefore, the expression of two plasmids is more matched, and the experimental results are not affected in this project.
Besides, as SCAU is famous for their tasty yogurt (Figure 6a), we detected, using our device, whether lactate is remained in their yogurt provided by them. We used their yogurt as inducer of our engineered E.coli, and green florescence could be observed under fluorescence microscope (Figure 6b).

We have sent those data to the team BUCT-China to analyse.
After testing the effect of different fatty acids on the fluorescence amount of chassis, we Shared our completed Tetracycline HPLC Protocol with them, and it is also hoped that BUCT can help us take water samples nearby their campus and measure tetracycline concentration in water.
After several days of measurement, we got the results of tetracycline content measured by BUCT-China in waters near BUCT campus.
It can be seen that the tetracycline content in Beijing area river is keeping in a low degree, but there still containing some other pollution substance.
We are very grateful for the cooperation of BUCT-China iGEMer, and we hope we our teams can keep in touch closely in the future.

Warwick iGEM - Modelling and Kit Plate Exchange
The Warwick team requested our help with modelling transcription and translation rates - a key process aspect in our system. Through Skype meetings, we guided them on how to use Hill functions to model transcription rate, including an explanation of the relevant approximations and the parameters that they would require.
In addition to modelling, we helped Warwick by providing them with a vector, resuspended from the kit plate. This was critical for their team as they had depleted their stocks and needed the part for their project. In return for this help, they provided us with kit plates for the Interlab after our own supplies ran out. This allowed us to complete the measurement study, for which we are incredibly grateful."

Collaborate with Nagahama
Gifu and Nagahama held a meeting on September 21th. We wanted to exchange opinions for each project. Nagahama aimed at improving the parts which they made last year, for FLAVORATOR . They had difficulty in protein assay. So we suggested that to use His-tag for assaying protein.
We planned to do a lot of expression about some enzymes. But, we troubled about what E.coli doesn’t release enzymes. So we thought we have to break E.coli to get enzyme. Nagahama suggested that to refer to iGEM Kyoto 2012 project . Because the study was E.coli’s secretion systems. This advice helped us for our project.

NPU-China,2018," due to the heavy burden of our experimental and academic tasks, there were not adequate staff     to characterize all the parts. At the CCIC, Jilin_China came to our aid and proposed to characterize the parts     after learning about our predicament. There existed low GC content in the mitochondrial genomes and a large amount     of replication in E. coli, which jeopardized the balance of four nucleotides in the cell, resulting in strong     cytotoxicity. Jilin_China helped us measure the growth curves of the two submitted parts: cob (BBa_K2707004) and     var1 (BBa_K2707008), the sequences of which were examined to determine if they were toxic to cells.
These two parts are two of the eight proteins expressed by the mitochondrial genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.     One is Cob encoding cytochrome oxidase b, which is a component of the electron transport chain, and another is Var1     that encodes ribosomal protein. Note that cob has been removed all introns.
Experimental results:
Figure 5. The growth curves of cob and var1
Conclusion: These two genes were constructed on pB1C3, the amplification of which after being transferred into DH5α     has little effect on bacterial growth, qualitatively proving that these two sequences are not toxic to cells.
Protocol:
（Link： Jilin-China ）
1. 5 μL of glycerol bacteria were transferred to 5 ml of liquid LB, adding appropriate amount of chloramphenicol     and culturing overnight;
2. Measured the OD value of the three samples and add a certain amount of each sample to 50ml LB (250ml triangle     bottle), with the final OD value being 0.05;
3. Measured the OD value of 0 h with a spectrophotometer;
4. OD value was measured respectively at 0.9, 2.15, 3.1, 4.2, 5.2, 6.1, 7.2, 8.3, 9.1, 12 h. When the OD value     exceeded 0.8, diluted before measuring.

Stony_Brook,2017," but as shown by our graphs, people tended to have a better grasp of GMOs than synthetic biology. While a few people answered that they had never heard of synthetic biology, no one answered that they had never heard of GMOs. This is likely due to the media attention placed on GMOs. When we tested for regression, we found that the difference in response was statistically significant (p = 3 x 10-53), indicating that people had different understandings of synthetic biology and GMOs. People generally felt more negatively about the GMOs compared to synthetic biology (p = 2 x 10-17). Education levels did not significantly affect a person’s perceptions of synthetic biology (p = 0.10). As we compared the positive responses and negative response across the bars, the corresponding percentages stayed relatively the same for each education level. We found no correlation between people’s political leanings and their view of synthetic biology (p = 0.8).
Most of our independent variables were not strongly correlated in a pairwise manner, thereby supporting the statistical strength of our multiple regression models. Perceived understanding of synthetic biology and perceived understanding of genetically modified organisms were the variables indicating significant pairwise correlation. Our statistical results may have been affected by multiple biases, such as high amounts of politically liberal college students at Stony Brook. Reporting bias may have also been especially significant in the current political climate and the resulting responses for this survey.

Collaborations with Team:BIT
The Background of Collaboration
It was in the NCKU IGEM Conference that we met BIT team. At first, we were just interested in the project they worked hard for. They built two separate circuits to produce two kinds of integrase. The integrase Bxb1 and FimE are seemed like two keys to open the “lock” which is referred to the terminators. Furthermore, their functions are series-wound. It was a coincidence that we have studied the modeling part of ETH:Zurich 2014 IGEM Team in the survey and investigate at the beginning of our modeling assignment. In the past studying, we had learned a lot of techniques of modeling from theirs and we were convinced that the project of BIT are very similar with that of ETH:Zurich 2014 IGEM Team. As we thought that we had known about some parts intheir ciucuits before, we proposed that we would like to assume some of their modeling work. And they accepted, also expressing that they would like to help our USTC Team with our device. Figure 1：The Circuits of 2016 BIT IGEM Team’s Project
Method
In the modeling for BIT, as the two circuits are nearly the same, we choose one of these two circuits to model. We applied mass-action law to the whole biology process, and acquired several differential equations. We used MATLAB R2014a to solve these equations and we got the relationship between the rate of flipping the terminator from on state to another and the GFP final concentration.

Also, we got the relationship between the Kmlac and the Proportion of terminators turned off.

Collaboration with Aalto-Helsinki
We collaborated with Aalto_helsinki team as well. We contacted them because they were working  on a similar project we were working on: producing boifuel with the tools of synthetic biology. While  they focused on producing propanol, we focused on producing butanol.
We kept in touch regularly trought e-mail, but also held a skype conference, where we talked about  our projects and the ways we could help each other. We both ordered gene fragments from IDT and  talked about that expreience and we gave each other tips on how to best accomplish other tasks of  iGEM. At the time, Slovenia HS has already done some work on our Human Practices, such as  presentations for students and appearences in media, while Aalto-Helsinki was just starting to  prepare their Human Practices, so we talked and echanged information and ideas about that. On teh  other hand, aalto-Helsinki already had experience creating wiki pages (their team won the award for  best wiki in 2014), while Slovenia HS was beginning to learn, so we were glad to also be able to ask  some questions about creating wiki.
We did some work for them in the laboratory as well. Aalto-Helsinki sent us one of their BioBricks (BBa_K1655001) for validation and to be able to compare their results with ours.  This BioBrick is a GFP that can be fused into any protein's aminoterminal. We first attempted to  validate this brick by fusing it with one of our genes (CtfB) that was already tested and proved to be  functional and active.
Our construct with CtfB and double terminator (K1669005) was first ligated as a back insert into their  plasmid pSB1C3 with GFP (BBa_K1655001) .
Restriction of plasmids with CtfB and double terminator as back inserts and plamids with GFP as back vectors. The inserts and vectors were isolated from the gel and ligated.

Duesseldorf,2016," at the campsite in Marburg where we stayed over the weekend. We were welcomed warmly by the local iGEM team and built up our tent while enjoying the marvelous weather. Naturally we brought a typical hospitality gift for a Düsseldorf team – top-fermented dark beer.
After being divided into colourful smaller groups we had to corporately master some tasks in the city, including drinking a “rusty nail” - a typical shot of the city and a hot tip for anyone visiting Marburg.
On Saturday, the projects were presented after a great breakfast and the teams could get to know the projects after getting to know each other the day before. After the presentations a grand bubble soccer tournament was held – the only competitive event on a very cooperative weekend.      After a tasty barbecue we went to the city again to party the whole night.
It was a very nice weekend! Getting to know all the teams and their projects, socializing and making friends is a really great part of the iGEM experience.
Many thanks to the iGEM team Marburg for superbly organizing the weekend and for making it possible to get to know everyone!

It was a fantastic experience where we could share our projects with other French teams, prepared ourselves for the           Giant Jamboree and talk with professors from the Aix-Marseille university. The MeetUp included an elevator           pitch, a poster presentation and also an after-igem workshop.
Other Collborations
Collaborating with Madrid-OLM
As our neighbour team, we have been collaborating often with OLM-Madrid iGEM team. They attempt to our           MeetUp ant there they held a very interesting workshop. The idea was to share and discuss about the problems           and inconvenients all the igem teams have suffered in Spain. Therefore, this guide could be useful for future           iGEM generations in order to know in advanced what they will face and, in this way, find an easier way to           solve it.
In order to build this guide, OLM-Madrid team prepared a previous outline that was discussed with the rest           of the teams. Afterwards, we split every point of the outline in a glass and every team could write their           contribution using different colored pens. This was a visual way to share experiences and doubts that every           iGEM team had suffered and a great opportunity to find a way to solve them all together.
On the other hand, they also helped us providing with some DNA constructs and we attempt to their MeetUp           sharing experiences and having the opportunity to listen to great scientists, for example Victor De Lorenzo.
Collaborating with BioIQS-Barcelona
This year Barcelona is presenting two teams to iGEM: our team formed by undergraduate students and the           Bio-IQS team, formed by Master students. Following the iGEM spirit we collaborate together. First of all,           they helped us giving us the transformed bacteria for the interLab study because we had some issues when           growing them. They also attended our spanish MeetUp. Finally, we helped them performing PCRs with the           saliva of a celiac person in order to have more data for their project and test the reproducibility of their            protocol.

Scandinavian iGEM weekend
Back to top
Like many other countries, we also wanted to have a regional pre-meeting. Since Sweden is a small country, we invited all Scandinavian teams to the first Scandinavian iGEM meetup, for a weeked with project presentations, lectures and a visit from Herbert Boyer. It ended with 35 happy iGEM:ers meeting during a weekend in Uppsala. Read more...
Parts sent to other teams
Back to top
The 2011 Uppsala team made some BioBrick parts that are very popular, but were not included in the 2012 kit. Work has continued on the chromoproteins this year. They have been sent to and further characterized by a number of other teams around the world.
Groningen
Team Groningen from the Netherlands is constructing the ""Food Warden"", a  project to get a visible output from Bacillus subtilis when rotten meat volatiles are present.  The recieved the amilCP (blue) and amilGFP (yellow) chromoproteins, and implemented them in B subtilis with wonderful results !
Columbia-Cooper
Team Columbia-Cooper in New York develops a method of etching circuit boards using bacteria. For this, the blue light sensor FixJ had potential to be very useful. They also requested the amilCP (blue) and amilGFP (yellow) chromoproteins, which we happily provided as agar stabs.
Copenhagen
Team Copenhagen works on darkness-induced bioluminescence in the cyanobacteria Synecococcus. They had use of our green light sensor, CcaR and CcaS, to control light expression. Team Copenhagen also participated in the Scandinavian iGEM meetup .

Mid-Atlantic Meetup
In keeping with the collaboratory spirit of iGEM, this year we were fortunate to participate in a mid-Atlantic meetup organized by The University of Maryland. In attendance were William and Mary, University of Virginia, Pittsburgh, Richard and Montgomery, and University of Maryland. Going into the meetup, we were focused on advancing last year’s project of creating a bacterial detection system by making a fusion protein of factor C – a protein in horseshoe crab blood that undergoes an auto catalysis in the presence of gram-negative bacteria – and HCG. We were excited at the potential of collaborating with the teams in attendance, especially as it pertained to possible protein detection systems. You can read more about the meetup on UMaryland's wiki .

Georgia Meetup
Rehmat and Christina went to Emory University at the O. Wayne Rollins Research Center to discuss project ideas and future collaborations with other Georgia teams who are participating in iGEM for this year. Each team discussed an overview idea of their project as well as what they have planned up until the Jamboree.
The number of people who attended this event made it possible for us to really connect and foster a more “at home” setting where we could each share some challenges we all faced. We all got to open up a little as we spoke about limitations of our labs and were able to get a full understanding of the inner working of each team’s lab.    After attending"

The collaboration with team TU Delft is a brilliant experiment, the Skype meeting and part correction not only helps our team’s lab work but also build a nice friendship between two teams. We appreciate the works and really look forward to meeting TU Delft in Boston!
．TU Delft Collaborate Memo :
After stumbling upon the description of our project, NTHU Taiwan initiated conversations with us via Facebook. Their project also consisted of a biosensor device, on this case featuring a series of overexpressed receptors and enzymes capable of both sensing and degrading EDC’s (Endocrine Disruptor Chemicals) that could be used on-site with sewage waters. A series of Skype meetings followed, in which the usefulness of the inclusion of any of our accomplished BioBricks into their project was discussed. Initially, vesicles and TDPs were deemed potentially interesting for NTHU Taiwan.However, after a closer study of our vesicles BioBrick by Taiwan, they came back to us with a series of points such as the variability in the content and size of vesicles, that made us aware of the weaknesses of our approach for packaging Cas13a and TDPs in our vesicles. Such a feedback resulted important for TU Delft iGEM 2017, as it made us aware of more aspects that should be addressed and optimised in our vesicles prior to its integration in our project.However, the collaboration took a different direction when Taiwan reported difficulties in the transformation involving their plasmids.
[ Figure. 1.5-3 ] Snapgene overview of NTHU Taiwan’s construct.
TU Delft offered to revise their SnapGene files featuring their construct to discard a faulty design as the cause and shared a series of recommendations on how to make their design clearer in Snapgene and how to achieve transformations with higher yields.
Nonetheless, a series of recommendations were still made by TU Delft as to eliminate redundancies and make their design in SnapGene clearer and more organized.
Finally, NTHU communicated the accomplishment of their transformation after reordering their plasmids.
We wish all the best to our fellow iGEMers of NTHU Taiwan and look forward to meeting them at"

Our University takes part in the iGEM competition for the first time, so we need(ed) a lot of support and advices.
Bielefeld - CeBiTec
The iGEM Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec invited us to their university and gave us information about the competition and presented us the foundation for a successful project. They not only provided us information and an overview about the whole project, they also provided us a culture of Escherichia Coli K-12 DH5 Alpha and 96 well plates for the Interlab-study. We are in contact all the time and very thankful for the support and the mentoring.
CeBiTec and HSHL students after a lovely afternoon filled with information and getting to know each other.
Erlangen - Video Project
iGEM Erlangen created an educational animation movie, which was published on YouTube. We are grateful that we had the opportunity to provide Viatnamese subtitles to this movie and therefor were able to help out iGEM Erlangen in their intention to ensure that anyone regardless of their linguistic background can enjoy this movie.
Networking
Collabarating with teams is great, but networking is a big part of iGEM, too. To interact with others to exchange information and develop e.g. social contacts is an enrichment for anyone involved.
June, 22. - 24. 2018 - German meet up in Marburg
The German meet up was our first opportunity to present our work to anyone outside of our University. It was a great chance to get to know the other teams and to meet some true iGEM experts.
July, 20. - 22. 2018 - European meet up in Munich
After the German meet up in June, we decided to join the European meet up in Munich as well. Six of us spend a few days in the beautiful city and got the chance to present our project idea and work to even more teams.

TU_Delft,2015," encountered and how they solved them. She gave us a few good tips how to approach problems and avoid stress moments. Clement Gallay continued with a general introduction about bio bricking. I thought that a lot of what she told was already known, since nearly everyone had a biology background. Yet it was a nice abstract about what we would be doing in the lab this summer.
Time flew by and at the beginning of the afternoon we got lunch in the canteen. It was a great moment to talk to the other team members and ask about their projects and experiences so far. After the lunch every team gave a short presentation about their project and their progression so far. That was a moment we could give comments and ask questions. Because we didn't have our final idea yet, it was a nice opportunity to hear different opinions about subjects we had in mind. Although the other teams were already a lot further than us, we are sure we can still catch up with them.
The day continued with a presentation by Anna Lauxen from the Groningen team 2014. She also gave us a lot of tips that were very practical. Maarten van den Nieuwenhof followed with an informative lecture about Human Practices in iGEM. Lastly Bayu Jayawardhana informed us about modeling in iGEM. He described the importance of modeling in Biology in general and the importance for iGEM.  After the last presentation of the first day, we stayed a while to have dinner with the team of Groningen. They ordered large pizza’s with beer and we had a nice time with the other teams about the long, but educating day. We went home satisfied. On the way back we had a little bit of troubles, but thanks to the beautiful singing voice of Hector we were able to come home without extra costs.
On the second day, the iGEM courses were hosted at the TU Delft campus. Unfortunately due to disruptions with the trains, the Groningen team were unable to join the gathering. Luckily, the team of TU Eindhoven was able to come to with the other half of their group, so there were a lot of new faces for us, and many introductions. At 10.30 we started with a lecture by Anne Meyer about tuning and troubleshooting engineered genetic circuits. It also included many tips and tricks to avoid problems. Aljoscha Wahls followed up with a presentation about Network Motives, a kinetic perspective. Timon Idema started his presentation about physics and modeling behind the iGEM project, and how you had to ask the right questions to use modelling as a tool. He also"
UNAM-CU,2015,"They were taught on the basics of molecular biology, techniques like competent cells, growing mediums, pcr, transformations and bioinformatics on how to design their biobrick. The focus here was on the direct wet lab work and biobrick design, we used space provided in the Chemistry Institute  and the Cellular Physiology Institute for giving them these classes.
Some members of the team, especially Lizbeth Bolaños, Alejandro Rodríguez and Xrysw Hernández, were closely involved in teaching our guests from the UNAH the following things during the second half of our guests stay in Mexico:
In our first session, we pointed out the requirements of the iGEM competition regarding the bioparts design, synthesis and testing.
In the second session, we checked with them some Molecular Biology principles, such as replication and transcription mechanisms as well as translation ones. We also covered some differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic ways of protein expression.
Then, in another session, we began checking basic proteins’ structures principles, the main challenges in Molecular Dynamics that research groups involved have, as well as the ones they could affront during their project, and the different ways to study and purify proteins.
We also had a special session in which we taught them how to use:  - Specialized softwares like PyMOL and Serial Cloner  - Databases like the Biobrick Seeker and the Protein Data Bank  - Servers online to run Molecular Dynamics programs
Finally, after these theoretical sessions, we began some practices at the lab in which we discussed with them the proceedings, what we expected and the possible results. The experiments done include competent cells and bacterial transformation. We also discussed some other techniques that would be useful for their project.
The feedback was good and they felt confident with being able to continue their work back on their home country.
Project presentation
The team got the chance to present their project on the IBT ( Institute of Biothecnology), CCG ( Center of Genomic Science), IQ ( Chemistry Institute), IFC (Institue of Celullar Physiology. They presented it in group seminars or in special appointments with the researchers, they got feedback and learned ways to improve their project and biobricks. The  researchers were:

Collaboration with SIAT-SCIE
In collaboration with SIAT-SCIE, we held a workshop to communicate about our projects. We also help them with molecular cloning biology.
After several online contacts, we invited SIAT-SCIE to our lab and held the first workshop in SUSTech. The first part of the workshop was introduction of our ideas and methods, and we prepared a brief speech on background knowledge about microinjection and microfluidics which we used in our design. After our presentation, SIAT-SCIE also proposed their idea about the project and possible related research literatures.
What’s more, we also deeply exchanged our ideas about managing a project. And we reached an agreement that working in smaller groups and having group meeting is a good way to coordinate working progress and form a good working pattern.

XJTLU-CHINA
Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University iGEM team hoped that we completed the following descriptions, but their model design changed later, and this program may be abandoned by them.
XJTLU would like to complete a model describing exosome carrying mRNA into the BBB (blood-brain barrier). It is necessary to construct a relationship about the parameters. We assisted them in the construction of the third model. Our main work is to establish a mathematical model that calculates the effective residual amount of mRNA that reaches endothelial cells after t at a certain size. The method is to read the material they provided and other material we found to understand their model concept, analyze the main factors affecting the remaining amount: secretion loss and degeneration loss, and then discuss the rationality of the model.
The overall purpose of their third model is to simulate the following figure. The purpose of simulating this figure is to obtain a range of effective values of mRNA that finally reaches the nerve cells by simulating the process by which the exosomes pass through the blood-brain barrier.
OUC-China
We have contacted Ocean University of China in the early stage to reach a cooperation. We will provide a PDF version of our Synthetic Biology comic book in our campus synthetic biology and iGEM publicity activities, which we will explain on the day of the event.
On September 28, 2018, the iGEM team of Nanjing Agricultural University and the Science Association of the College of Life Sciences jointly organized the iGEM science popularization activities on campus. The whole activity focused on “Going Close to the Laboratory – the Daily Life of the School Team"",""Going Close to the Competition - the Experimentation Task and Benefits, ""Going Close to Dreams - Recruiting Talents"" Three themes, using the panels to present synthetic biology knowledge, iGEM competition profiles and team composition, as well as new topics for this year's iGEM team.

Development of Mouse Movement Tracking Tool for NJU-China
During their project, 2015 wet-lab team NJU-China needs a tool that can track the dynamic movement of mice in the cage.
Demand: In their in vivo experiment, they recorded the movement of mice in the cage. The video was about two hours long. Then they needed a tool to fulfill the following three requirements.
The tool should be able to identify the existence of the mice in the cage. The problem is that the mice was always moving, and the tool must set a point on the mice to track their movement.
The tool should be able to record the coordinate of the mice’s current position.
The tool should be able to generate a heat map, to show how frequently the mice stayed in the light cage and in the dark cage.
Figure 1: Tracking of mouse movements in the cage.
Tools that can track the movement of mice exist; however, they can only track the movement qualitatively, without the detailed records of coordinates of mouse position.
Figure 2: Positions of the mouse at different times represented as coordinates.
Solution: According to their demand, we developed a tool in July. This tool can not only track the movement of mice in the cage, but also record the coordinates of mice’s position as well as accordingly generate a heat map.

AHUT_China,2018," into dry powder, which excludes the influence on the information storage of other interference factors such as the growth of α yeast . Secondly, since the main body of case is that the two kinds of yeast cultured in the medium ,and the growth of α yeast has some effects on the growth of a yeast should also be taken into account. So the competition model and the gun battle model are established. Finally, they provided a web-based, fully interactive modeling platform that provided information for wet experiments.
Model 1:
According to the case process we guess that : the amount of information stored (a growth time of yeast) is related to the initial inputs of two yeasts, The amount of α-factorsecreteby α yeast, and the promoting efficiency of the promoter. Therefore,  the information storage is set as the output value, and the other parameters are set as the input values.Then the partial correlation coefficient is performed to verify the accuracy of the verification and which input is most relevant to the output.
Model 2:
The relationship between the time of information storage and the amount of α factor, time, promoting efficiency, the amount of yeast, and amount of alpha yeast was determined by model 1. They divided the experiment into two parts. The first part is that:  a yeast and alpha yeast compete for growth without secretion of alpha factor. The second part is that: in the case of α-factor secretion, the two yeast growth for fighting, and the death rate of α yeast is the expression rate of Bax gene, and the expression rate of Bax gene is related to the start efficiency of the Fig2c promoter. In order to measure the efficiency of the start of the Fig2c promoter, the promoter efficiency of the promoter was measured by the amount of fluorescence by inserting the  fluorescent protein gene of EGFP.
Through the above experimental process, we have established two mathematical models:
1)Competition model:
The change trend of OD value of yeast with time was reviewed, taking the maximum value of the slope r1=r2
2) fighting model:
They putted in different proportions of yeast and calculated the information storage time by modeling. At the same time, the ratio of yeast can be predicted by different storage times. NEFU-China provided a web-based, fully interactive modeling platform that not only provided some information for their wet experiments, but also enabled future iGEM teams to build more efficiently based on our work.
In the laboratory,our team has simulated the exhaust gas ratio which can be found in literatures .The corresponding proportion of the gas was mixed manually and the gas was injected into water to prepare an uns"

We use the plate reader to detect the product of the reaction, pNP under 405 nm catalyzed by the expression protein, PETase and the results are as followed (Fig.1) and the enzyme activity was calculated (Fig.2).The results were proved to be good. Besides, we wanted to transform the Rfp part with our HU promoter to up-regulate the expression of Rfp in bifidobacterium so that we could detected the anaerobic environment in vivo by observing the fluorescent light. UESTC_China provided us with the Rfp part and linked HU, following the molecular cloning protocol.
3.With Tianjin
We communicated with Tianjin team about some questions on experiments. We helped them with the constructing of molecular model so that they could complete their project.
4.With HUST-China
In July of 2016, we attended the iGEM cheering meeting held by Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, and established good relationship with HUST-China. HUST-China also shared the J23117 device with us.
5.With NEU
We gave them information about how to apply for the visa and they shared us their J23117.
6.With Peking
We communicated many details about the InterLab experiments with Peking. They helped us with the amplification of the device J23117 from BIT-China so that we could finish the InterLab experiments.

Everyone need help
Collaborations in iGEM competition is very important because it makes connection between teams and it makes us realize how is important to help each other. This year, our team tried to help several teams and some team helped us in order to success our project.
iGEM Aix-Marseille helped us to validate our model. They worked on the paper « Dynamics of plasmid transfer on surfaces » writen by Lone Simonsen. They had to search and organize the papers data to compare it to our computationnal results.
After a Skype meeting with iGEM INSA-Lyon, they helped us on our model by suggesting us a mathematical model for bacterial growth. We also hosted two of their members during their visit for a conference related to aptamers in Bordeaux.
Because we were overflowed with work, iGEM Toulouse made a graphical representation on blender to illustrate our safety model and create a 3D animation of our logo (see our pages Home and Model ).
On our part, we participated to their video project where we have explained in french some essential protocols used in synthetic biology. Click there to their videos.
For their Human Practices part, iGEM EPFL created a website to highlight the iGEM team of the 2016 edition. We had the honors to be inside their site, check out our article there .
We helped iGEM Tel-Hai by participating to their project « 65 roses Campaign » in order to bring out Cystic Fibrosis. We have to post a photo of us holding a rose in order to raise awareness amongst the general public and raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Israel.

Working Hard, Together
Aachen
In a bid to obtain more samples to view under our microscope, we contacted a series of European iGEM teams to try to get things that they were working on. Unfortunately, many teams were using the same organisms as we were or had restrictions on what they could send to us. Fortunately, the Aachen team was using an organism on which we were not working. They were kind enough to provide us with samples of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their transformed strains for us to use. We used the S. cerevisiae (which were of a distinctly different size than the other organisms we had observed) to help us understand the versatility of our technique with respect to finding the size and shape of organisms in a sample. An exemplary hologram showing these organisms can be seen on the Human Practices Silver page.
ULaVerne_Collab
The ULV iGEM team reached out to us as we were both working on transforming the same organism, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We video conferenced each other, and exchanged ideas and offered guidance on how they should proceed forward with their transformations. After the meeting, we provided them with a copy of our transformation protocol, along with tips and tricks that we found helpful when conducting our own transformations.
TU Darmstadt
When we met team Darmstadt at the Delft European iGEM meetup, they were greatly interested in our microscope. The discussions generated some interesting ideas that we used during the design and construction of our microscope. In exchange for information and guidance concerning the software and hardware that goes into digital inline holographic microscopy, they sent us a laser. We used this as a back-up during our hardware design and testing phases.
Lund
In April, we were contacted by the first ever Lund iGEM team. They were inquiring about mentorship. We provided guidance as to what to expect from an iGEM project, such as timelines, workload and mentorship on their local level.

Mentoring the Rotterdam iGEM team
Early into the iGEM competition we were contacted by iGEM Rotterdam . At this point, they were just starting up the first Rotterdam iGEM team, which           in fact also is the first team of a Dutch university of applied sciences to ever compete in this competition. Amongst others, they were looking for pointers on how to choose their project. Of course we gladly met up with them to assist in           any way we could. This formed the foundation for our mentorship of iGEM Rotterdam during the iGEM 2018 competition.
Over the course of the competition we had several coaching sessions with iGEM Rotterdam in order to discuss their           progress and to pass on information that has been passed on to us from our predecessors. We also shared our own findings with them.
Sessions started with a general introduction concerning laboratory progress, fundraising, PR and human practices. After the introduction, the teams were divided into expert groups in order to discuss problems in more detail. This gave           both teams the opportunity to learn from the other team’s ideas on everything in the iGEM competition. We provided them with tips and tricks on ligation, social media and crowdfunding campaigns. During the second coaching session we delved           deeper into negotiations with the university and designing promotional material, notably the banner for the Jamboree. Moreover, the team managers remained in close contact throughout the competition in order to           address possible problems as           quickly and as efficiently as possible.
We consider it an honour to have gotten the chance to mentor such a nice and dedicated team of individuals and are grateful for all that we were able to learn in return. We know that they           will excel in Boston with their magnificent hardware project.
Dutch Meet-up and BBQ
After meeting the other Dutch teams for the first time at the National Institute for Public Health and Environment in April, we wanted to remain in contact. However, the next Dutch meeting - the Eindhoven mini Jamboree - was scheduled for           the end of October. Therefore, we were inspired to organise an informal meet-up opportunity during the summer. Laboratory work would be in"

To establish a simple and standardized methodology for applying CRISPR the iGEM Team Amazonas Brazil created a survey to communicate with other iGEM teams and exchange information about problems when working with the CRISPR technology. We participated in this survey and are eager to see your solutions for an easier handling of this method come into play in iGEM.
Diagnosis device survey from iGEM Team Munich
The iGEM Team Munich collected opinions about diagnostic devices in a survey that was distributed to people with different professional backgrounds. In certain countries access to regular medical care is limited, either due to regional fluctuation in the density of hospitals, pharmacies and doctors or due to country-specific healthcare laws. This issue affects millions of people world-wide, both in developing as well as modern countries. iGEM Team Munich aims at developing diagnostic devices, that could be used at home and provide people with diagnosis and hence medical care that would otherwise have no access to.

KU Leuven
Owing to our successful posters presentation at Exposciences
Midi-Pyrénées , the organizers asked us to participate in the International Exposciences which took place in Brussels, Belgium, between the 19th and the 25th of July.  We met four representatives of the iGEM KU Leuven team (Belgium).
For an entire afternoon, we exchanged views about our projects and particularly about the modelling part since both teams were using different software and methods to model cell behaviour. iGEM KU Leuven team uses (among others) the MatLab software to model various cellular phenomena and we are using Opflux software to evaluate cellular capabilities.
Meet-up in Bordeaux - 29th/30th August
The French-speaking meet-up took place in Bordeaux on the 29th and the 30th of August. Numerous teams were represented there: Bordeaux, Paris Saclay, Paris Pasteur, Leuven (Belgium), EPFL (Switzerland), Aix-Marseille and our own team.
The program of this meet-up was very complete, from the discovery of Bordeaux through a tour of the city to the presentation of each project and activities prepared by some of the teams.

We have been and continue to be, very motivated in taking Incell beyond the lab. The Incell podcast series has enabled us to draw upon diverse scientific, non-scientific, cultural and environmental perspectives from around the world. Incell is an abstract, foundational science project and we felt it important for development to be in the spirit of the humanity we hope to serve. Collaborating with other teams from Canada and India enhanced our content, multiplied our audience and maximised the public outreach and human value of our work.

Generate HemH knock-out using lambda-red mutagenesis method
Following this, our team is keen in helping Macquarie team to generate HemH knock-out bacterial strain by using another commonly used bacterial genome editing approach, known as lamba-RED recombination system. The HemH gene is knocked out by replacing it with a flp-flanked Kanamycin selection cassette. Due to the accumulation of protoporphyrin ring IX substrates, HemH knock-out resulted in light-sensitive bacteria that grow only in the dark.
Red: 50 nt Homology arms used for the PCR of KanR cassette. Purple: Primers used for colony PCR screening
Mutant screens were then conducted after 2 days of bacteria growing. The below gel image shows one of our screening results.
a) Colony PCR with primers on hemH. b) Colony PCR with primer Kanamycin gene.
After HemH knock out, there should be no bands appears for HemH gene in the gel image while a band size of 1000bp reflecting Kanamycin gene is expected to be shown. It is unfortunate that we failed to knock out HemH gene. We had screen for hundreds colonies but none turned out to be positive.To explain the survival of bacteria against Kanamycin resistance even though Kanamycin cassette is not inserted into their genome,might be that pKD4 that originally serves as template plasmids for flp-flanked Kanamycin cassette are not fully digested with DpnI.  The second possibility is due to random insertion of Kanamycin cassette.
Team Macquarie helped us too!! :))
Last but not least, we would like to acknowledge and thank Team Macquarie’s effort in helping us with tasks stated as follow:
1. With RT-PCR primer designed and sent by Team Macquarie, our team was able to finish characterising the gene expression for the Mg-chelatase plasmid on time.
2. Team Macquarie also helped us to characterise two SpCas9 mutants, 462( BBa_K2130001 ) and 459( BBa_K2130002 )  . p.s. They also footed the shipping bill too. :P
To do so, our team had changed the FLAG purification tag into 6xHistidine tag that associated with plasmid carrying mutated SpCas9 as Team Macquarie only has kits for His-tag purification. Following purification, an in-vitro assay assay was"

Tongji-China & SSTi-SZGD
To make our engineered bacteria safer, we want them to kill themselves after being expelled from the human body. The SSTi-SZGD team helped us solve this problem. They provided us with a light-activated plasmid expressing a protein which, when stimulated by blue light, promotes oxidative stress and apoptosis of the bacteria. Thank the SSTi-SZGD team for their help.
Tongji-China & SKLMT-China
We also hope to help other teams with their projects. During the fifth Conference of China iGEMer Communication, we found that team SKLMT-China needed other teams to help them evaluate the strength of their promoter. So we took over the job. We believe that our work can be of great help to their project.
Tongji-China & SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
In the course of the project, we wanted to find a suitable capsule for orally intake of our bacterial by visiting and learning from local pharmaceutical factories. We found that the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team had the same needs. Therefore, after contacting Shanghai Roche Ltd., we invited SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team to visit together. During this visit, we also shared some project experience. After the visit, we completed the capsules we wanted with the help of Shanghai Roche Ltd.. Besides, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team helped us to complete the production of bacterial freeze-dried powder.
The 5th CCiC
We hope to make our project more complete through extensive communication. So we participated in the fifth Conference of China iGEMer Communication held by ShanghaiTech University at the end of August. This exchange activity benefit us a lot. We learned some experimental ideas from other teams, sought advice from instructors on how to solve our problems, and found many opportunities for cooperation.

Collaborations
Collaboration is an important part for groups in IGEM to help each other and progress together. This year we formed the collaboration among Shenzhen Middle School，Shenzhen University(SU)，and Shenzhen Vanke Meisha Academy(SVMA). We lent each other laboratory help and share social network in order to collect more data for the human practice. Shenzhen University has helped us to through lots of problems during the year-long project.
SU->SMS
The Shenzhen University groups helped us greatly by lending their laboratories and materials to us. They also help us a lot on experiments, for example, how to use an equipment.
1. During the summer vocation, our school did not allow us to do experiment inside the school. Thanks to Shenzhen University, it lent us with a whole laboratory with sufficient materials and equipments that Shenzhen Middle School did not have, such as materials using to do protein electrophoresis.
2. Because of the mistakes we made during the experiments, we used up all BBa_J04500 parts on our provided sheet plates. Shenzhen University provided us the part while they also need it. They also instructed us clearly on how to do an experiment or improve your violin.
SMS->SZU
We desperately want to help Shenzhen University; However, it was difficult for a high school to help a university. But we still asked them if there was anything needed to help. At last, we found something to do for them.
1. we decided that we should spread questionnaire for SU to collect more data on people’s attitude toward their project for their human practice. Our endeavors multiply the number of data SU is able to collect. Our social networks make people from all around China are able to answer their questionnaire. Thus, our pairvirsus are able to get more precise conclusion from the data.
2.Because many of us are applying for university  abroad, we are more adroit with English writing. Therefore, we wanted to help them to write their WIKI. While writing the wiki, we understood the process of our partner’s project deeper and got inspired by some details. The SU also thanked us for helping them, and they were happy to see their wiki became better organized and fascinating.

Potsdam
With the iGEM team from Potsdam we had a Skype call, since their project showed some similarities to ours. In their first abstract, they were going to investigate two approaches for metabolic channeling, one of which included the usage of liquid liquid phase separation.
Excited about the fact that we found a project similar to ours, we decided to set up a Skype call. We talked about our projects and exchanged some ideas about Human Practices. Since the project of Potsdam is also more foundational, they also struggled somewhat with explaining it to people. They gave us the tip to work towards a good application, which makes it easier to explain it to people. Furthermore, we gave them some tips about working with the WIKI in HTML and CSS and offered to simulate their system with our modeling approach. They set us up with a contact person who delivered us as much information as possible of their system needed for the model.
After the summer we had some other Skype calls to talk about our progress and the WIKI teams also gave some critical feedback on each others WIKI sites, which was very helpful. After hard work from our modeling team, our model was up and running for our system. But, to really show the adaptiveness of our model we also modeled the project of the iGEM Potsdam team. For them, it’s also nice to have a model of their project, since they do not have much modeling experience. The model gave them a better and more detailed understanding of the inner workings of their project. Besides collaborating on the modeling and the WIKI, we also agreed to help each other during the Grand Jamboree by being present at each other’s practice session to provide some last feedback.

One part of our project is to design an online platform for team interactions. Since all the teams were having problems with communicating and sharing large files, we thought the Phabricator software is a great way to organize your team. This is why we decided it would be great if every team has the opportunity to use the same platform. Hopefully, it also simplifies the communication between different teams. We send the installation data to the iGEM team at Northeastern University in Boston. They tried it and liked our idea and the site. They did problems concerning organization and sharing ideas. Our Phabricator is a good alternative to other sites e.g. e-mail chains or online notebooks.
“Phabricator seems like a great platform for building a modular site that essentially does everything. If the site evolves in the future to include some other tools that iGEM teams will also need […], I can see how the site may be adopted widespread.” Joshua Timmons, iGEM Northeastern
Göttingen/Interlab Study
In Marburg, we also met the iGEM Team from Göttingen. Even though our projects have different focuses; because they are trying to create a B12 Synporter and we are working with TALE’s, we decided to collaborate for the Interlab study . The iGEM Team in Göttingen sent us their samples so that we could analyze them.
Newsletter
We were also a part of the iGEM Newsletter 2016, which was created by XMU-China team. They gave all interested teams the possibility to present their project as well as introducing their team in an online newsletter. The publication was then sent to all iGEM Teams to provide an opportunity for new collaborations or contact between the teams.

Perchlorate salts are found in the Martian regolith covering the surface of Mars at a concentration of up to 1 %. Perchlorate is a highly oxidising compound used in rocket fuels and munitions. It is dangerous and toxic to humans. Current disposal methods are via expensive bioreactors, or contained explosions. So, if humans are to colonise Mars, we will have to remove the perchlorates from the soil in order to have a chance of developing agriculture for our survival. The University of Exeter 2018 iGEM Team are developing a bioreactor that will remove perchlorate salts from soil, and dispose of waste perchlorate in a cheap, safe manner, by using genetically engineered bacteria with (per)chlorate and chlorite reducing enzymes.
To assist their project, we have recorded the affects of perchlorate on the growth of our free-living nitrogen fixing, soil bacteria. This has helped show the importance of their project in aiding the development of agricultural methods on Mars, as well as disposing of perchlorate in a safe, contained way so as not to harm the environment and affect soil ecosystems. The results of our experiments are displayed in Figures 1 to 3.

Leiden,2018," on its iGEM registry               page pCspA.
Results of exposure to HMF show no stress reaction for the pCspA-GFP (Figure 1A) and pRpoE-GFP (Figure 1C) strains. CspA is involved in metabolism related stress and RpoE is involved in protein synthesis stress.           Because both strains did not invoke a stress reaction, there is no indication that HMF delivers stress in these pathways. However, to firmly conclude these stresses are not being experienced, more extensive testing is needed, since these           are just two promoters involved in these stress pathways.
Both the pDnaK-GFP (Figure 1B) and pSoxS-GFP strains (Figure 1D) do show some response when exposed to 0.5 μg/mL HMF. DnaK is involved in the process of chromosomal DNA replication and SoxS is involved in DNA damage repair.           Therefore, these results indicate that HMF delivers stress to bacteria by damaging their DNA and disturbing their replication process. However, the stress being experienced at these HMF concentrations seems to be low.
Figure 1. pDnaK-GFP and pSoxS-GFP show a slight stress response to HMF Four stress detecting strains were exposed to multiple concentrations of HMF. Figure 1A shows little to no response of the pCspA-strain to all 5 concentrations of HMF. Figure 1B shows a reaction of the pDnaK-strain when exposed to 0.5 μg/mL HMF. Figure 1C shows no reaction of the pRpoE-strain for all 5 HMF concentrations. Figure 1D shows a reaction of the pSoxS-strain when exposed to 0.5 μg/mL HMF.
We have shared these results with iGEM Bordeaux. Hopefully helping them further with their project, providing them with insight into the effect of HMF on bacterial cell processes. We are very thankful for this meaningful collaboration and           look forward to meeting their team again in Boston.

In return, the iGEM Team Tec-Monterrey shared their opinion about phage therapy in other countries like Mexico, which helped us set a clear focus on our project. They also provided us with a lot of inspiration regarding the optimization of our cell extract and possible human practices projects. All in all, we had a great time collaborating, and we are looking forward to meeting our new friends from Mexico in person at the Giant Jamboree.

Assembling Genetically Engineered Phages From Grenoble
A class-average of TEM images of T5 bacteriophages
Plaque assay proved that the assembled T5 bacteriophages are fully functional.
The iGEM Team Grenoble-Alpes is creating a diagnostic tool for pathogenic bacteria. Adding upon the accomplishments of this project, we collaborated on expanding Phactory as a universally employable platform for production of  therapeutic bacteriophages. iGEM Grenoble supplied the necessary bacteria and their phage (T5). We then isolated the DNA from the samples and tested the assembly of this phage in our cell-extract.
The phage was produced successfully and is fully functional. We verified the assembly by plaque assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We were very happy to work together with iGEM Grenoble on advancing phage therapy and are looking forward so see their final results during the Giant Jamboree."
Bordeaux,2018,"
during the French meetup in Paris in July.We talked and exchanged a lot about our respective projects. They             were linked on some points, therefore they offered to attend a conference organized by themselves. This conference             took place on the 26th of September, in Paris, and was entitled « What synthetic biology will bring to the future’             IGEM Paris Saclay was also part of it. Each of us invited a researcher to talk about his studies all linked with             projects including synthetic biology to face challenges of the future. As we could not travel to Paris to attend             the conference, IGEM Sorbonne broadcasted it via Facebook where we could listen and participate to the debate             which ensued. Thank you IGEM Sorbonne ans IGEM Saclay for giving us this opportunity!
The collaboration with IGEM Toulouse
was aimed to test some lab products. Their project involves the production of cellulose, which we would later             use for our lab experiments. Hence, after producing cellulose in their premises they brought it in Bordeaux.             This exchange was meaningful in a sense that it has permitted them to test their bacterial cellulose production.             In the other side, for us, it was the opportunity to try different source of glucose to produce the HMF molecule.             Once again, we took profit of this meeting to spend good times all together in Bordeaux.

Paris:
We were invited to the 4th French meeting organized by the iGEM Pasteur team on July 4, 2018. Four of our team             members (Lorine, Yasmine, François and David) went to Paris to support the project. After a good breakfast offered             by the organizers, we attended the projects presentations of our colleagues from other French IGEM teams. The feedback             from the juries was a great opportunity to improve our presentations for the Giant Jamboree.
Lunch break provide us the ability to meet and discuss with the others iGEM team members. During the workshops in the             afternoon, we have discussed with scientists and exchange about diversified and interesting subjects. We were able to meet researchers in round tables (workshops) organized             in small groups. Various talks themes allowed us to defend ideas with people who have been invited by iGEM team             Pasteur. At night, we met in 'Place des Invalides' to continue to share and exchange about our experiences as iGEMers.

The Atlanta area iGEM teams (Emory, Georgia State and Lambert High School) met on the Emory campus on Sunday, Sept. 22nd. Each team presented their work to date, and everyone agreed that the teams should meet more often and collaborate more substantively."
XMU-China,2018," helped and instructed H14Z1_hangzhou team to fill out the judging form, and to offer some advice about the relevant representations of one of a previous year biobricks to meet the bronze standard four. In addition, we also assisted H14Z1_hangzhou to complete the design of the first level menu and the second level menu in the navigation bar, so that their results can be better displayed in front of the judges.
Second, XMU-China and H14Z1_hangzhou assumed the task of the experimental representation each other. H14Z1_hangzhou helped XMU-China measure the fluorescence characterization data of BBa_K2623025. XMU-China helped H14Z1_hangzhou complete the experimental curve of the number of engineering bacteria in the process of fermenting yoghurt with the change of time.
The experimental steps and results are as following:
Experimental steps:
1. The first day, Lactobacillus NZ9000 and GMCA respectively were inoculated into 50ml GM17 medium, fermented at 30 ℃ overnight (about 12h). (Place them in a 30 ℃ incubator, no shaker shocks required).
2. Next day, fresh milk was heated to about 55-60 degrees Celsius, and then adding some white sugar, 3000rpm stirring for 10 minutes mixing. Divided them into 250ml shaker, and the volume of liquid in every shaker is 100ml.
3. Sterilize the above solution at 90 ℃ for 5min, then cool it to 30 degrees Celsius to prepare for inoculation and fermentation. Then collect Lactobacillus acidophilus in shaker and clean them 1 times with sterile water. Add Lactobacillus acidophilus to the sample making the initial OD is 0.1 (600nm). Then let them ferment statically in the 250ml shaker at 30 ℃ (Place them in the 30 ℃ incubator, without shaker vibration)
4. Measure the OD value every two hours and count the corresponding number of cells to draw the curve. Simultaneously, test the pH of the solution (Measure for 14 hours)

Tasty-Style Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created an instructional video describing how to properly execute a serial dilution. In the video, we carefully went through the process and proper lab techniques needed when conducting a serial dilution. After filming and editing the video, we posted it to Youtube to expand the educational potential of our video. We proposed the idea of a “Tasty-style” video to other iGEM teams, and iGEM Peshawar 2017, UNBC iGEM, and TNCR Korea created videos documenting the lab techniques of transformations, agarose gels, and ligation prep. Our intention in creating these videos is to teach viewers about common lab techniques in a simple and engaging way to aid them in their scientific endeavors.
CloneCademy & Collaboration with TU Darmstadt
Under the instruction of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team, our team contributed to the educational program of CloneCademy. CloneCademy is a series of learning modules with the purpose of teaching readers about biology and related fields, including biotechnology and the ethics of scientific research. Our team sent our tasty-style video playlist to TU Darmstadt so their team would be able to incorporate our lab-technique videos into their teaching program.
Mini iGEM Convention
On August 4-5th, we collaborated with the Gaston Day School team to host the Southeastern iGEM Mini Convention for iGEM teams geographically close to us. Although there were not as many teams present as we would have hoped for (just Gaston and Duke), this event gave each of us the opportunity to get closer with all teams and focus our time and energy into giving thorough and in-depth feedback and analysis on each other’s projects. We were in charge of contacting guest speakers in the Biological Engineering field who would be willing to give a lecture on the emerging and flourishing field of synthetic biology, including its ethical implications. After sending out over a 100 emails, we finally got positive responses, thus finalizing the schedule for the first day of the convention.
The following speakers were in attendance:

1) Meetup with Botchan_Lab_Tokyo
On March 10th, we invited Team Botchan_Lab_Tokyo to Kyoto and exchanged opinions about each other's projects and how to proceed with iGEM activities. We specifically discussed the organizational framework of iGEM, fund-raising, human Practices and collaboration activities.
By taking advantage of their large number of members, Botchan_Lab_Tokyo established several departments for a division of work. They have a department specialized in a collaboration which is a strategy our team had not considered. This was a good example for efficient management of team organization.
We also talked about the financial support strategies of each team, such as how we started cloud funding, and they explained to us how they were raising money.
Interestingly, Botchan_Lab_Tokyo has only participated in iGEM twice so they were not sure how to meet all the standard iGEM criteria. Therefore, from our past experience attending iGEM competitions, we taught them how to interpret the criteria and design their project. For example, they were conducting science experiments for junior high and high school students so as to meet the criteria of “Education & Public Engagement” but they did not incorporate synthetic biology concepts, nor their specific project. We advised them that their Public Engagement will improve by taking in more lectures and doing practical work with DNA.
Finally, as they were having trouble looking for opportunities for collaboration, we told them about the existence of the “Meetup” page and suggested attending the Asia Conference. It was exciting to interact with other Japanese teams through our iGEM activities.
Thank you, Botchan_Lab_Tokyo!!!

Queens_Canada,2018," rest of the    conversation was dedicated to devising solutions to these challenges. Firstly, it is important that    the synthetic biology community finds a suitable definition for its work which would be agreed by    all of its members. The second focus shall be improving education at the undergrad level to increase student interests in synthetic biology. All the iGEM teams present were very eager to share their    experiences in recruitment and outreach, members from the University of Western have especially    shared their path of creating a program for synthetic biology at their university. The discussion    was concluded with remarks on actions to be taken to gather resources and suggestions for future    Canada-wide conferences.
Members of Ontario, Canada iGEM teams including representation from Queen’s University, The Universities        of Toronto, McMaster, Guelph, Waterloo, Brock, Ottawa, and Western Ontario. Hosted at McMaster University,        Hamilton Ontario, July 28th, 2018.
Team Stony Brook
Directed Evolution: Queens iGEM & Stony Brook iGEM Collaboration
This project sought to perform some sort of directed evolution on our constructs. While    reading about other team’s projects, we came across a fellow iGEM team located at Stony Brook University    in New York was evaluating the use of directed evolution of Synechococcus elongatus to create    sustainable sucrose feedstocks for ethanol biofuel production. This discovery created the basis for    further discussion about which protocols are most efficient when performing directed evolution. Upon    speaking with our fellow iGEM team, we learned about other directed evolution techniques, such as UV    mutagenesis and phage assisted continuous evolution. With these ideas in mind, we collectively decided    that other teams may also be trying to determine the most effective type of directed evolution for    their project and thought we could combine each of our groups’ knowledge and experiences to aid future    iGEM teams. We believe that an effective route to convey this information would be in the format of a    short, detailed video, that both of our teams could collectively contribute to, as well a pamphlet    highlighting a variety of directed evolution techniques, available resources and current literature.
Check out our Directed Evolution pamphlet below and download it here.

Botchan_Lab_Tokyo,2018,", a kind of cell-free system. They said that the largest benefit of the production of protein in cell-free system is that purifying produced protein is much easier than protein produced in vivo such as in E.coli. Also, they taught us how to meet criteria for iGEM, since this is the second time for us to participate in iGEM Jamboree and we were not so sure about the criteria. On the other hand, we introduced our project to them and gave advice about the methods of efficient cloning.
PI of iGEM Gifu, Prof. Iwahashi was once studying nitrogen fixation. So, they offered us a scientific article written by him. Referring to that paper, we discussed our project, including nitrogenase, culture conditions, cloning methods with them. It was very meaningful and productive collaboration. Thanks! iGEM Gifu!

Team IISc-Bangalore: A Machine Learning Algorithm for Cell Counting
Team IISc worked towards developing a machine learning algorithm to count cells in a hemocytometer.
The objective of the collaboration was to provide the IISc Team with  sufficient data on the growth curve characteristics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to enable them to train their machine learning algorithm. Optical Density(OD) measurements to monitor the growth curve becomes unreliable due to the large sizes of yeast cells (which distorts the linear correlation between OD and biomass), it was necessary to measure the cell count of yeast cultures. Haemocytometry is the most common method used to monitor the growth rate and biomass of yeast cultures. This process is very time-consuming and involves tedious labour in counting cells for each measurement. Our team performed two growth curves each spanning 16 hours and the images were generated which were to be used by their algorithm to analyze. Using Haemocytometry, a manual cell count of the yeast cell samples at each timepoint was performed and this data along with their corresponding images were submitted.

London iGEM Meet-up
On the 31st of July, Birbeck and UCL hosted an afternoon of talks and discussions with iGEM members from the Birbeck, UCL, London BIohackspace, Westminster and Kent teams. Followed by poster presentations, the goal of this event was to bring iGEMers together along with members of the academia to discuss collaborations and issues of relevance in the development of the projects.
Shuffle Festival
Shuffle Festival was a week long festival held in Mile End. The week-long festivities involve film, science, storytelling, performance art, architectural installations, walks, food, comedy and music.  Members from London Biohackspace had an opportunity to run a stall on July 26th at the Migration Pavilion.  We ran a “Beer Simulation Workshop” where we provided visitors with Vanilla, Lemon and Miraculin flavour.
2015 London iGEM Bootcamp
The UCL iGEM boot camp is a week long event designed to provide iGEM participants with a crash course in the skills necessary to compete in the iGEM competition. This years boot camp was attended by team members from University College London’s own 2015 undergraduate team along with team members from Birkbeck University and the community-run London Biohackspace laboratory. The camp primarily consisted of a number of technical workshops designed to help iGEM newcomers (and a few grizzled veterans) develop essential iGEM lab skills such as biobrick design and construction along with bacterial culturing and transformation techniques. Further workshops were also available on topics such as how computational modelling can lead to iGEM success, constructing your own spectrophotometer and how to build an award winning wiki (without having to stay up all night on wiki-freeze deadline day). Previous iGEM participants were on hand throughout the week to provide assistance as well as offer invaluable advice on how this years teams can excel in the iGEM competition (step 1:rob a bank). The week concluded with a mini-jamboree in which each team presented their chosen project and current progress to the rest of the group in a format similar to the iGEM giant jamboree held in Boston at the end of the competition.

We have a good time working with other teams this year ~ :p
1.University of Science and Technology of China : USTC
We went to the School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China(USTC) to meet up with USTC             and USTC-Software.
In their laboratory, the team members of USTC showed us the using methods of some biology experimental devices,             like centrifuge, shaker, PCR machine, electrophoresis bath, etc. We also learned how to use a pipette. Since             there is no wet lab in our schoole, this introduction gave us a clear recognition of how synthetic biology researchers             work, which make us more interested in synthetic biology.
To make our software more user-friendly, we asked how they would search for information once they had determined             the topic of their project. We introduced our project to them and asked for the most needed function or content             that they are expecting in our project. They have provided much information to us, which is really helpful.
The team leader of USTC interpreted the composition of gene chains for us and the process of assembling a gene             chain. Furthermore, they gave us some advice about the information we provided and thought it could bring a lot             convenience for them.
2.University of Science and Technology of China : USTC-Software
Since we both are software teams, we kept communicating with USTC-Software all along. We made a deal to test             and give feedback each other’s system after finishing it. They pointed out some defects existing in our system             in a professional view and we also made some changes according to it. In return, we tested their system and also             gave some suggestions.
3.Northeast Forestry University : NEFU_China
As software teams, we take advantage of our software techniques and provided support for their wiki, especially             the format of their wiki. In return, they helped us to test our software and gave us some suggestion. One of             the team members thought that the searching function for"

We were happy to help them by sending them three different samples of wine, grapes and soil from the south area of France. Now we are waiting for a discount for their enzyme when it will be available on the market.
Bordeaux
One of the current problems of today’s society is sleep disorder. This year, Bordeaux iGEM team worked on a sleep-inducing peptide. After a Skype meeting with the iGEMers from Bordeaux, our team advised and supported them with a mathematical model for bacterial growth. On the other hand, they kindly hosted two of our members during their visit for a conference related to our project in their city.
METU HS Ankara
METU HS Ankara iGEM team created a database consisting of basic and routinely used protocols in different languages. We have responded to their collaboration request and we have translated their protocols to French. So, if you are looking for protocols in Yupik or Pawnee, check out here:
Edinburgh UG
The Edinburgh UG iGEM worked on finding a solution to the problem of data storage. Their idea was to develop a modular system for encoding text or any other unit of information into DNA. We have helped them with the translation of the Letter of Mary Queen of Scots to French.
UCL
UCL ’s project about maintaining the quality of life and extending lifespan is interesting and challenging at the same time. The part of their project on the Catheter Lubricant centered on the same problem as our project, about Sexually Transmitted Infections. During our Skype meeting, we shared our projects and also our knowledge about the use of aptamers for STI detection.

Warwick,2018," A member of our team, June Ong, alongside Robert Garcia, the research assistant help translate their videos into the Malay and Catalan language respectively. In return, they helped us in publicising our “public perception of synthetic biology” survey in India which gave us really good insights for our East meets West study.
iGEM Stockholm
Recognising that many of our outreach objectives were aimed at engaging more young people and children in synthetic biology, we chose to work with iGEM Stockholm to test and reflect on our communication methods. We first did this by trialling iGEM Stockholm’s childrens book at a regional ‘Family Fun Day’ event where we collected qualitative feedback from families and children on their book. We then decided to deepen our collaboration by producing a guide on communicating synthetic biology to children, designed for educators and the iGEM, as well as the wider synthetic biology community, to understand some of the insights our teams jointly gained over our summers of public engagement.
Turkey HS Ankara
We mentored a Turkish High School team during the summer by skyping them regularly over the summer to answer any of their questions and taught them how to use tools such as Benchling. We were on hand to answer any of their questions about synthetic biology techniques and BioBricks and also provided general support via messaging.
Imperial College London
After holding skype calls with Imperial iGEM, we advised them on how to improve their science communication guide. We tested it out for our own purposes and used our own experiences of science communication this summer to provide them with feedback. We also trialled out Imperial’s team communication app within our team to test how the app works in an iGEM team dynamic, this feedback was again circulated back to Imperial so they could improve their app.

The collaboration allowed them to assess the reproducibility of the data in various labs around the world and develop a network of labs with a common interest. Our team gained experience with working with archaea and a partner in research. We received their samples and measured the fluorescence of this mCherry archaea specimen.
University of Eindhoven
We participated in TU Eindhoven’s collaboration where they wanted to make a cloning guide for new iGEM teams to use and make a clear choice on what cloning method is best to use when working on their project. We chose to write up procedures for the Classical Cloning guide and added onto their project. We gave general information about the cloning method, points of interest, disadvantages and advantages in non-specific terms so that the iGEM teams can indicate how much used for each step.

Hangzhou-H14Z,2015," quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:
        dn/dt=k*(N-n)*fex(t)
        Solve that differential equation.
        1/(N-n) dn=k*fex (t) dt         ∫1/(N-n) dn=k∫fex (t) dt         -ln(N-n)=k∫f ex(t) dt + C
    Since we already know that ∫f ex(t) dt= x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438) in this condition.
        -ln(N-n)=k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)         (N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))
    So the lipid-time function, Slp(t), were found:
        Slp(t)=(N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))

ColumbiaNYC team
The ColombiaNYC team is housed in Dr. Harris Wang's lab at Columbia Medical Research Center. We needed access to an electroporator to transform our Pichia pastoris. Team members allowed our team to use their electroporation device, and they also showed us how to correctly use it. This was critical our project.
New York City High School team
We allowed students and mentors from team access to our lab in the fall, since they lost lab access near the end of their project. This allowed them to complete their project.
iGem Team Meet Up
We invited ColumbiaNYC and CUNY-Kingsborough team to a meetup at our lab where we introduced ourselves and discussed our projects. We Had a great time, and brainstormed and coordinated collaboration efforts.
Makerere University team
We video chatted with this team from Uganda to gauge how our project would work in other countries with different infrastructure. They did a survey for us of the needs of health professionals in their country for alternative ways to test injectables for endotoxins. In turn, we helped them brainstorm an experiment to test an existing part for the bronze medal criteria. We are also providing them with lodging during iGEM."

Overview
Collaboration is always important in the science community, let alone the iGEM competition. It is important for different teams to exchange ideas with each other, as well as help each other to deal with difficulties and solve problems. The iGEMers from all over the world are in a big family and there is no doubt to give each other a hand. Besides, it is also important to propagate iGEM to new people and help them establish a new team.
 
This year, our team Nanjing-China formed close collaborations with three iGEM teams and helped to establish two new undergraduate iGEM teams.

1. Team Tianjin
 
At the beginning of the summer vocation, team Tianjin contacted us for help and support. They wanted a kind of bacteria called Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. We eagerly contacted Prof. Aijun Liao in our university asking for this species, cultivating it and then mailed Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 timely. After that, when they encountered some difficulties cultivating this species, we assisted them to get technical support about the conditions for culturing this kind of bacteria.
 
Later, in CCiC conference, we are pleased to know that team Tianjin managed to use Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 successfully and achieved crucial experiment results based on this species. Therefore, we took a picture with each other’s posters together to witness this collaborations. Besides, some of the team members in team Tianjin or team Nanjing-China made great friends and team Tianjin gave special gifts to us during CCiC to express their thanks.
 
 
2. Team NEFU-China
 
We got in touch with NEFU-CHINA during the CCiC conference by asking questions after their presentations. Most of our team members were really interested in their project so we meet them after the Q&A time of the presentation. In this meeting, our team members came up with some great ideas to improve their project. What’s more, when advisors in team NEFU-China put forward their difficulties of proceeding experiments, we offered to share some equipment with them and invited them to our lab. All of the teachers and students in team NEFU-China are excited about this invitation and expressed intense interests in collaboration. Therefore, about one month later, they invited us to their lab for a"

1 High Schools
----Mentoring new high school teams
This year, we publicize an assistant Handbook in Chinese version striving to help general schools get familiar with the iGEM competition and encourage them to take part in. Particularly, our handbook focuses on the basic information like long-standing history and medal requirements, as well as the outstanding works done by others. Beside, this book is practical for anyone who wants to know more about iGEM with easy-to-approach pictures and summaries which then gives readers a clear image about this competition. Our Handbook has helped five high schools including SKLBC-GDSYZX, SKLBC-China, Shiyan_SY_China, H4Z-Hangzhou and WLSA_Shanghai as well as several universities. Notably, SKLBC-GDSYZX started their first journey in iGEM this year within our collaboration. They benefit a lot especially from team setup guidance since it is their first time to organize an iGEM team. Questions like how to gather the talents and how to figure out their topic seem important for them. Although other teams are not the first time to participate in, they also learn a lot from our experience. They highly valued our work exhibition sector and paid more attention studying deeply. We believe that our Handbook can prompt their success and we are intended to help even more schools not just in China but all over the world.

COLLABORATIONS
NYMU_TAIPEI
We have continued and strengthened our long-standing partnership with National Yang Ming University (NYMU_Taipei). They troubleshooted our cloning procedure and design of primers, gave us protocols for assaying biofilm production, and trained our future iGEMers (Leona and Catherine).
In return, we helped add to the characterization of their lactose-induced suicide mechanism: the Holin-Endolysin-NrtA system ( BBa_K2350021 ). We measured the population of their kill-switch bacteria in different lactose concentrations, and find that our results are consistent with their findings.
We independently tested the function of NYMU_Taipei’s lactose-induced kill-switch system. Different concentrations (0-250 mM) of lactose were tested for their effects on bacteria population. Experiment: Yvonne Wei
Additionally, this year two members from TAS (Catherine and Leona) are members on both NYMU and TAS teams. They learned the cloning cycle from TAS and helped run experiments and human practices for NYMU throughout the year. In Boston, they will also help NYMU present their project at the Giant Jamboree.
CGU_Taiwan
We first met the CGU_Taiwan team at the end of our presentation for the Asia Pacific iGEM Conference hosted at National Chiao Tung University (NCTU).
They were excited that our biofilms were able to trap nanoparticles, and wondered if they could trap ink particles as well. CGU_Taiwan is working on improving the procedure to manufacture reprocessed paper. They found that a process called “flotation,” typically used to de-ink paper, could cause significant paper fiber loss. They wondered if biofilm could potentially replace the current flotation process to preserve paper fibers. We offered to test this for CGU_Taiwan. We used a similar experimental procedure as our preliminary biofilm trapping experiment. The results suggest that our biofilm can trap ink particles. As shown below, the relative absorbance of ink decreased by approximately 50% when mixed with biofilm.

Duesseldorf,2018," defined as technology or equipment designed or suitable for both civilian and military purposes. It refers to research or knowledge that is done for the benefit of the society but can pose a threat to the security of public safety and health, the environment or living organisms if falling into wrong hands.
Several experts attended the event who deal with biosecurity, laws and ethic on a daily basis and were able to inform us about current regulations and committees. These experts were Prof. Dr. Alfons Bora (Faculty of Sociology, University of Bielefeld), Prof. Dr. Kathryn Nixdorff (Leopoldina, University of Darmstadt), Irina Rais (student at the University of Bielefeld and member of its iGEM Team) and Dr. Tom Hobson (University Bath and iGEM Safety Committee). The focus has always been on the questions: Where are the limits of science and should it be limited? And how great is the risk of misuse of science?  Irina presented us the results of a Germany-wide survey conducted by the iGEM Team Bielefeld. They showed the reason for this panel discussion: Students as well as a lot of researchers often didn’t know about dual use, regulations and appropriate authority.
After this, a discussion between the audience and experts started where it became clear, that the definition of biosecurity and biosafety was still an issue. Also the information regarding the laws are not yet clear.
Everybody agreed upon one point though: Dual use needs to be implemented in educational programs.
After the panel discussion we were invited to a nice restaurant by the iGEM Team of Bielefeld. We had to walk through pouring rain in order to get there, but it was well worth it.  In a comfortable atmosphere (next to a fire place, where our clothes were able to dry) we ordered delicious food and drinks and watched the highly anticipated soccer game England versus Croatia. In addition to that we discussed the results of the panel discussion, our current status and problems with not only the Bielfeld team but also the team of Hamm-Lippstadt.
After arriving home it became evident that we also had to check our project for dual use issues because we had never heard of it before. This is why the iGEM Team Bielefeld gave us informational powerpoint slides that can be implemented in Safety instruction briefings.

UrbanTundra_Edmonton
This year the UrbanTunda_Edmonton team also worked on a space-related project. They developed an automated prototype for ClO4 extraction, its conversion to rocket fuel, and its genetically engineered biodegradation to oxygen. We helped the high school team by connecting them with our contacts within the Canadian Space Agency to answer some of their questions. Not only did this benefit UrbanTundra_Edmonton, but the questions they asked raised a new perspective on the economics of synthetic biology and space which we did not consider ourselves.
aGEM Workshop
We helped organized the Alberta iGEM (aGEM) competition in collaboration with MindFuel and GeekStarter. This competition helped to prepare the Alberta high school and collegiate teams for the international iGEM competition by mimicking the presentation layout expected at Jamboree and providing the opportunity to meet with well-known iGEM judges such as Megan Palmer and Todd Kuiken. It included the three collegiate teams in Alberta: Ingenuity_Lab, University of Lethbridge and us, UofC_Calgary. It also included the high school teams of The Breakers, Lethbridge High School and UrbanTundra. Through this collaboration, we were able to help mentor the other high school teams by preparing them for what to expect during their presentations at the Jamboree, as many students were new to the competition. We were also able to share protocols with other teams on wet lab work we had done to help improve their projects.
Through this collaboration, we gained a better understanding of the needs of other iGEM teams and how we could contribute to their projects. These presentations really emphasized the strengths of all teams, but it also illuminated our weaknesses and allowed us to explore how we could better improve upon different aspects of our projects before the Jamboree. We also got a chance to meet and network with the other teams and judges and discuss our interests in synthetic biology.
iGEM
iGEM is an international competition promoting synthetic biology as a means to solve social, economic and humanitarian problems around the globe. The iGEM Jamboree is held in Boston annually. In 2016, over 300 teams are competing against each other.

While making the video, we invited other teams to collaborate on the campaign by filming their ways of reducing laboratory plastic waste. We want to thank all the teams that sent out their video material: University teams Marburg and Washington and High school teams Lahore and Ruia-Mumbai.
UK meetup
On 12th and 13th of July, the Worcester College iGEM team organised the UK meetup along with SynBio UK. The conference was extremely well organised, allowing the participant teams to meet with each other, present their ideas and the work that was done so far, while offering them to discuss about potential collaborations in between, troubleshoot and understand the role of entrepreneurship in such competitions. Many teams attended including the London teams (UCL, King’s, Imperial), Warwick, New Castle, Cambridge, Oxford and Exeter.

Text: used italics and bold text to identify which text is important
London iGEM team troubleshooting sessions
Together with Imperial College, UCL and KCL, we organised a troubleshooting session that took place a month before the Jamboree at the KCL campus. During the session, the teams managed to get in contact with students from UAL to give us a presentation on designing a good wiki page.
It was a good opportunity to also go over each other’s projects and help troubleshoot issues that were occurring with other aspects of our projects.

The common progress has fully reflected the spirit of iGEMer's synergy.  When we were introducing our project, students from other team asked several questions about our interview with companies. By knowing about the situation of market and social requirements, we can make our project more suitable for the status at present.
3. Manchester United iGEM Idea Exchangement
Our team members visited the iGEM team at the University of Manchester on August 7th and had a friendly communication, which promoted the cooperation and friendship between two universities. When communicating with the iGEM team at the University of Manchester, we found that both teams were modifying special bacterial strains, not E. coli., which raised a better understanding between the two teams. During the communication, we also discussed several issues about the competition, and had a clearer understanding of their project. This communication activity built a bridge of friendship between our two universities, which made us recognize the importance of the spirit of cooperation and learn from each other's strengths to enhance ourselves and climb the peak of science. In addition, the projects of the two teams have some steps in common, so we focused on discussing about how to make these steps better.
4. A Communication with MIT iGEM
In this MIT tour, our team members got a chance to meet with iGEMers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and conducted communication and discussions on the 2018 competition project to provide optimization possibilities for each other. The MIT iGEM team's project this year is to solve the health problems of human tooth decay through the transformation of engineering bacteria. The team members of two schools raised many meaningful questions and suggestions on the content of each other's project, which enabled us to further improve their respective project frameworks. In addition, we have the honor to visit the biological laboratory of their team. Through this visit, we saw the difference in scientific research between ourselves and internationally renowned college students, inspiring us to constantly improve ourselves and improve our comprehensive strength and scientific research quality.

We had a meet-up in Trondheim with the iGEM team from the University of Oslo (UiOslo). During the                 meet-up we had a ""Mini Jamboree"" and held presentations for each other. Professor and previous iGEM                 judge Eivind Almaas was present to give feedback, and the teams gave feedback and comments to the                 presentation and project for each other. After the Mini Jamboree we had a lovely lunch together                 (see pictures) and sightseeing in our laboratory, at the university campus, and in Trondheim city.

Improved characterization
Afterwards, we decided together that the UiOslo team could help our team by improving the                 characterization of our biobrick MP6 mutator. They used Escherichia coli TOP10, which is a different                 strain from the E. coli DH5α that we have been using. By using a different strain, we were able to obtain                 more data on the mutagenesis activity of the plasmid and check if the plasmid worked in another strain.
We sent our biobrick to Oslo, together with the guidelines on how to perform the experiment. First,                 the MP6 mutator plasmid was transformed into E. coli TOP10 together with the pLA230 control plasmid.                 After 16 hours incubation at 37 C, the transformed bacteria culture was split into two, and glucose                 (20 mM) was added in one culture flask while arabinose (20 mM) was added in the other one. The cultures                 were incubated at 37 C for 24 hours. The next day, 100 μL of the different cultures were plated on plates                 with LA, glucose and ampicillin (culture dilutions 10-0-10-3) and plates with only LA and glucose                 (culture concentrations 10-5-10-8). The plates were grown overnight. The resulting plates are shown                 in the picture below, and all results are also shown at Team UiOslo Norway"
UESTC-Software,2018,". We also invited them to use our database. After experiencing it, they gave us their opinions on the improvement of the project and they indicated that BioMaster would be of great use. https://2018.igem.org/Team:NKU_CHINA/Collaborations
USTC-Software
(University of Science and Technology of China)
Since we are all software team track, unlike experimental team, what we need is more and more feedbacks and technical support to further improve our software. USTC-Software and us decided to test the projects of each other. After testing, we gave them the results of test of Biohub for USTC-Software and shared our experiences and some technical methods on the construction of our database with them so that they might improve their project. Also, they presented their discreet suggestions and feedback which helped us optimize our database BioMaster and it became one of our basis on the improvement of our project.
USTC to UESTC: Your information is comprehensive and the UI surface is user-friendly. However, the ranking of search results is to be optimized when searching with iGEM_ID, such as searching for BBa_K104000, the first display of BBa_K1040001, and BBa_K104000 in the back position. You’d better give out a guidance to each information, for example, new user may not know what EPD& RegulonDB contains of.
UESTC to USTC: The response of your Biohub is more than goodness. The design is good to see and is clear enough for users. However, there’s no specific introduction on the main page and it may mislead the users. If an example is provided on the editor page will be more user-friendly and clear.

The results show that, when we didn’t add IPTG, the bacteria expressed more GFP. After we added IPTG, the bacteria expressed more RFP, so the fimS switch can work. Here is the link to their wiki
NKU_China also did some experiments for us. As for our project, two significant changes will happen when geneguard takes effect. One is the delaying in bacterial growth, the other one is transformation in bacterial morphology. The two experiments we designed above certified geneguard’s function through delaying in bacterial growth. We also wanted to demonstrate it through transformation in bacterial morphology. However, we lacked appropriate equipment for observation. Thus, we seek help from our partner NKU_China.
We designed the morphology experiment according to our pervious work.
The results are as followed:
Figure 3. Cellular morphology. Groups with none inducer, 0.2% arabinose, or 0.2% arabinose and IPTG co-induction were set respectively. Bacterial morphology was observed at 1.5, 3 and 6 hrs.
As Figure 2 shows, bacterial shape in control group didn’t have evident change in 1.5h, 3h, 6h, all in rhabditiform. Arabinose induction group appeared bacilliform in 1.5h. In 3h observation, part of bacterial turned into roundness. In 6h observation, most of bacteria became rounded. The arabinose and IPTG co-induction group appeared bacilliform, in 3h observation, part of bacterial turned into roundness. In 6h observation, most of bacteria were bacilliform.
E. coli in control group didn’t express induced heterologous protein. Thus, they appeared bacilliform. While in arabinose induction group, part of bacteria became rounded in 3h and most of them turned into roundness in 6h. we can consider that toxin cbtA led to the transformation in bacterial morphology.
Part of bacteria in Arabinose and IPTG co-induction group turned rounded in 3h observation. That’s because the toxin addicted time was too short that only part"
UCL,2016,"
Not only were we able to meet up with most of the UK iGEM teams but we also got a chance to present our project for the first time. This meant that we could start to prepare ourselves for the finals at Boston by receiving feedback on our presentation/ project from other iGEM teams at the meet up.
We also got to see what the other teams were doing such that we could organise a possible relevant collaboration. This meet up was very exciting and fun! Once our presentation was over, we asked the University of Westminster iGEM team to give us some feedback on our project. They mentioned that we should include some facts in our presentation to make the audience realise that each of our projects are important in society and the problem that they solve is an important one. Their feedback allowed us to improve the way we communicate our project to different audiences, especially those that do not have a strong synthetic biology background.
The feedback we received has really helped us rethink how we can present our project to the world in a better and clearer way. We now have a clear understanding that not everyone has the knowledge that we do about our project and the science behind it. Therefore, it is essential that we receive feedback from people who were listening to our presentation and act upon it by making our presentation clearer and easier to follow and understand. Through our iGEM journey we have found out that its essential that we focus on clear communication of our project.

International survey
To kick-start our iGEM journey, the team decided that we wanted to distribute an online survey about synthetic biology and ageing. We wanted to find out what people think about synthetic biology not just in the UK but globally. It would not have been possible without the help of the iGEM teams that helped distribute the survey on twitter and took part in the survey! The teams that collaborated with us were:
Imperial team
XMU-China
Edinburgh team
NRP-UEA iGEM team (Biowire)

USMA
The United States Air Force Academy iGEM team collaborated with the United States Military Academy.  The USMA tested our part to verify it was inserted into our plasmids.  We offered to test and validate their part, but they did not have a testable product ready in time for us to test it.
USMA cadets performed two digests to confirm the insertion of the part into PSB1C3:  1) KpnI digest;  KpnI can only produce fragments if the insert is present. The expected fragment sizes for this digest are ~3200 and  280bpwill  2) MscI and PstI double digest; MscI cuts once in the insert and the plasmid, and Pst cuts in the suffix. This digest will confirm orientation of the insert relative to the suffix and prefix sequences. The expected fragment sizes for this digest are ~1430, 1320, and 740bp.
Carroll HS
Carroll High School in Dayton, Ohio mentored the USAFA iGEM team.  Carroll and USAFA shared lab space at AFRL and were able to practice presentations, work inter-lab issues, and develop ideas together.  Carroll answered many of the questions that the USAFA iGEM team had regarding the wiki, iGEM administration, and the Giant Jamboree."

Summary
IGEM is an international competition that promotes the search for solutions of problems in the world using synthetic biology. While every team is working on their own projects in their local laboratories utilizing the biobricks provided by iGEM over the summer, they design new parts to add to the collection of biobricks at the end of the competiton. This makes every team part of a big community, that works togehter to promote the transparent and innovative developement of new tools for engineering biology. This community is not only about the collection of biobricks, but also about helping each other. Collaborations of individual teams are one of the most important aspects of iGEM, where teams help each other achieve their goals. This can be just by giving helpful advice or even doing experiments together. We collaborated intensively with the team of Marburg to determine the binding affinity of the EPSP synthases AroE and AroA to glyphosate.
Collaboration - Biochemical characterization of EPSP synthases in cooperation with iGEM Marburg
This year, our team came toghether with the iGEM team of Marburg , to investigate the interaction of the EPSP synthases AroE and AroA from B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively, with glyphosate. Glyphosate targets AroE and AroA in B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively. Since the members of the Bange lab , which is hosting"

Chalmers InterLab
After deciding to participate in the InterLab study as a criterion for the bronze medal, we realized that we did not have any Escherichia coli DH5-ɑ in our lab. Luckily, iGEM Chalmers in Gothenburg, Sweden, generously sent us a plate.
DTU Biobrick Tutorial
iGEM DTU organized an inspiring and practical 3 day introduction to iGEM. We got to learn how to create BioBricks and attend different workshops which covered the iGEM registry, Interlab study, the importance of human practices and life after iGEM.  Abigail Sison from iGEM headquarters also held an informative session about iGEM, answering many of our questions regarding the requirements of the competition.
Biohackathon
iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania organized a biohackathon on the theme “lab issues”, which we were happy to attend. The event took place on August 3-5 and was open not only to iGEM teams but to anyone interested in programming and lab work. We had a lot of fun and won third place with our software, a search engine for the iGEM distribution kit and for previous iGEM teams’ wikis.
Symposium
Together with iGEM Stockholm and iGEM Uppsala, we organized a symposium called Limits of Life, a one day event where two important topics were covered, burnout in academia and the ethics of biohacking and human augmentation. Read more about it here .
Along with the symposium event, we also collaborated with Uppsala regarding their handbook on stress management. We have been in contact throughout the entire process, discussing various topics related to the subject of burning out and stress. They did a great job outlining sources of stress and what one can do to avoid these issues. As such, we have included their handbook as an additional resource for further reading in our own handbook regarding project management in iGEM.
iGEM Linköping (LiU)

Technische Universität Dresden: iGEM Goes Green
We edited and added to their ecology tips and have given them a lot of feedback of additions to their iGEM Goes Green pamphlet. We have employed many of the tips they had in their pamphlet in our own laboratory and at school. You can learn more about more about our contributions to the iGEM Goes Green cause in the designated subpage, iGEM Goes Green , showing how we have made a direct effort to help reduce our impact on the environment in the iGEM laboratory and beyond.
University of Bristol
University of Bristol iGEM provided mentorship and advice regarding our wiki. They helped us build our own website with their expertise. We tested a tool they created, IDE, or iGEM Development Environment, which hosts a local server. Regarding our website, Bristol iGEM provided help to us when we were stuck at a point where we did not know how to move forward in the HTML and CSS programming process. Thank you, Bristol iGEM!
Nazarbayev University Astana, Kazakhstan
Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan provided mentorship and guidance about our project. They provided a varied perspective to help us broaden our scope. We also talked about their project and provided some of our own insight.
University of Nebraska-Lincoln
We made adjustments to their “Safety Cases and Their Use in iGem Competitions Feedback” that serves as a means to help other iGEM teams. These changes we made ultimately helped in the greater development of the document itself, and thereby clarified important purposes central to their cause.

This year, FAFU-CHINA team had many collaborations with many Chinese teams and exchanges parts with them. We helped different teams to design protocol, construct the parts and verify their results independently. Meanwhile, other teams helped us to build model, test the accurate data and purify the expressed protein. Parts exchange also played an important role in collaborations.
Collaborations with SZU-China team
On 17thJune, Junhao visited the Shenzhen University and their team (SZU-China) after Synthesis Biology Meeting. SZU-China focused how to utilize Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii to produce more hydrogen. We also tried to express toxin proteins in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii. Based on the various background, they transform plasmids into Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii by glass-bead method while we used electroporation. The genetic transformation in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii is still big problem, with their help, the transformation of Cry10Aa-2A-Cyt1 was successful by glass-bead method.
Meanwhile, due to various and unknown reasons, SZU-China encountered a common problem that they failed to get any clone or amplified the PSB1C3 plasmid could not get any clone in the lab. We reproduced their experiment in our lab. Luckily, we got the positive result and figured out that their Chloramphenicol was inactivated.

This year, we not only learned from our instructors the biotech skills of molecular biology such as gene cloning, protein analysis, spectrophotometry, also we were sponsored and helped from a local biotech company, BIONIME Corp (and its new spin-off company, Zensor R&D Corp.) who is an expert and innovator of blood glucose meters and electrochemical analyzers.
In addition, we sought NCTU-FORMOSA as our mentor and advisors. They gave the BioBrick [ BBa_K1694002 : Lpp-OmpA-NcoI/pSB1C3] to us for designing and displaying our enzymes on the E. coli cell surface by Lpp-OmpA outer membrane proteins (They used it and the design for their iGEM project in 2015). We confirmed the plasmid by DNA sequencing and improved the existing BioBrick part by replacing NcoI site (There’s an extra NcoI site present on Cm resistance gene) with BamHI site to facilitate creating a fusion protein linked with Lpp-OmpA [ BBa_K1991004 : Lpp-OmpA-BamHI/pSB1C3].
On the other hand, we used the skills learned in the lab in Mingdao High School and have helped NCTU-FORMOSA 2016 to confirm a function of their Biobrick in protein analysis experiment.
By the way, NCTU-FORMOSA 2016 also helped us to examine our AOX enzyme activity. They proved the function of our Biobrick. Based on the results from us, NCTU-FORMOSA and BIONIME Corp., we firmly believe that our product will be applied in the real world in the near future.
On august 23rd, some of our members (Jiun-Jie Huang, Hsuan-Yi Lin, Shih-Chen Chen, Ming-Jui Tseng) went to the lab of NCTU-FORMOSA in National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu and helped them to confirm a protein expression of one of their BioBrick.
We learned some experiment skills in molecular biology at Mingdao’s lab from"
