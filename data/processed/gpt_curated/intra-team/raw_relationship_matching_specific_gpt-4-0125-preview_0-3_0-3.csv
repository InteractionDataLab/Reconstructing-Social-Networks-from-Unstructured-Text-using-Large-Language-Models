"Based on the provided phrases and the categories, here's how they match up:

1. ""resolve dermal ailments"" - This phrase does not directly match any of the provided categories as it describes an application or goal rather than a specific activity or role. It could imply Design if it's part of conceptualizing a project aimed at treating skin conditions, but without more context, it's hard to categorize. 
    - [[""resolve dermal ailments"", ""Other""]]

2. ""make susung's software into hardware"" - This implies working on converting software tools or algorithms into physical devices or systems, which fits both the Software and Hardware categories.
    - [[""make susung's software into hardware"", ""Software""], [""make susung's software into hardware"", ""Hardware""]]

3. ""hunting down pcr machines"" - This activity is related to Material Supply, as it involves sourcing necessary equipment for experiments.
    - [[""hunting down pcr machines"", ""Material Supply""]]

4. ""carry the team"" - This phrase is metaphorical and could imply taking on a leadership or significantly contributory role, but it doesn't fit neatly into any of the specified categories without more context.
    - [[""carry the team"", ""Other""]]

5. ""work on the wetwork"" - This clearly refers to Experiments, as ""wet work"" or ""wet lab"" activities involve hands-on laboratory work.

- ""mars-soil substitute"" could match with ""Design"" as it involves conceptualizing and designing a part of the project that simulates Mars soil. It could also match with ""Experiments"" if the substitute was actually created and tested.

- ""access to jens-martin mars-chamber"" might be best categorized under ""Material Supply"" as it involves providing access to specialized equipment or facilities for the project.

- ""advice"" is a general term but in the context of iGEM, it would likely fall under ""Supervision"" as it implies providing guidance to the team.

- ""support"" is similar to ""advice"" and would also fit best under ""Supervision"", indicating a role in providing assistance and support to the team.

- ""guidance on jens-martin mars-chamber"" is another phrase that fits ""Supervision"", specifically providing expert advice on how to use a particular piece of equipment or facility.

- ""brainstorming for red lab"" suggests activities related to ""Design"", as brainstorming is a process of generating ideas and conceptualizing the project.

- ""logo design"" clearly matches with ""Creative Contributions"", as it involves creating visual elements for the team's branding.

- ""moss transformation"" would fit under ""Experiments"" as it describes a specific synthetic biology experiment being conducted.

7. ""attend medical school"" - This is a future aspiration and doesn't fit into any of the categories related to iGEM activities. It would be classified under ""Other"".

8. ""majoring biomedical engineering"" - This indicates a field of study rather than a specific activity within iGEM. It could imply involvement in ""Design"" or ""Modelling"" due to the nature of the major, but as stated, it's best classified under ""Other"".

9. ""passionate about statistics"" - This could imply involvement in ""Analysis"" due to the relevance of statistics in data analysis.

10. ""learning new things about biology"" - This is a general statement about personal or academic interest in biology. It could potentially relate to ""Design"" as learning could inform project conceptualization, but it's generally more fitting under ""Other"".

"Given the context of the iGEM competition and the categories provided, the phrases you've listed mostly fall outside the typical activities associated with the competition. However, I'll attempt to categorize them based on a broad interpretation that could potentially link some of these activities to aspects of the competition, while recognizing that many of these will likely fall under ""Other"" due to their lack of direct connection to the standard categories of iGEM activities.

1. ""soccer"" - [""soccer"", ""Other""]
2. ""volleyball"" - [""volleyball"", ""Other""]
3. ""fifa"" - [""fifa"", ""Other""]
4. ""collecting used batteries"" - [""collecting used batteries"", ""Other""]
5. ""enjoying the outdoors"" - [""enjoying the outdoors"", ""Other""]
6. ""exploring new places"" - [""exploring new places"", ""Other""]
7. ""gardening"" - [""gardening"", ""Other""]
8. ""cooking"" - [""cooking"", ""Other""]
9. ""birding"" - [""birding"", ""Other""]
10. ""taking hikes and bike rides"" - [""taking hikes and bike rides"", ""Other""]

Explanation:
Most of these activities are recreational or hobbies that don't directly align with the specific categories related to the iGEM competition, such as Design, Experiments, Documentation, etc. Therefore, they are categorized under ""Other."" However, it's worth noting that in a more creative or abstract interpretation, some of these activities could potentially be linked to broader themes within iGEM, such as sustainability (collecting used batteries), or human practices (exploring new places, enjoying the outdoors), but without specific context tying them to the iGEM project activities, they are best categorized as ""Other.""",2018

"Based on the provided phrases and the categories, here is how each phrase matches with the categories:

1. ""publisher for yale scientific magazine"" - No direct match to the provided categories. This activity does not directly relate to any specific iGEM competition category but could be tangentially related to Documentation due to the involvement in publishing, yet it's more appropriate to classify it as ""Other"" due to the lack of direct relevance.
2. ""playing the bells of harkness tower"" - This activity does not fit any of the provided categories for iGEM competition activities. It is best classified as ""Other"".
3. ""playing with stuffed animals"" - This activity does not fit any of the provided categories for iGEM competition activities. It is best classified as ""Other"".
4. ""chasing chipmunks"" - This activity does not fit any of the provided categories for iGEM competition activities. It is best classified as ""Other"".
5. ""taking long naps"" - This activity does not fit any of the provided categories for iGEM competition activities. It is best classified as ""Other"".
6. ""working on an mvp for an electronic health records system"" - This activity could fit under ""Software"" due to the development of a minimum viable product (MVP) for software, and ""Entrepreneurship"" due to the business aspect of developing an electronic health records system.
7. ""participating in research with the igem team"" - This activity could fit under several categories depending on the nature of the research. It could be ""Experiments"" if it involves wet lab work, ""Design"" if it involves conceptualizing the project, ""Analysis"" if it involves data analysis, among others. Without specific details, it's challenging to assign specific categories, so it will be broadly matched to ""Experiments"", ""Design"", and ""Analysis"".
8. ""singing with his a cappella group"" - This activity does not fit any of the provided categories for iGEM competition activities. It is best classified as ""Other"".
9. ""working closely with a local alderman"" - This activity could be related to ""Human Practices"" if the work involves understanding and addressing the ethical, legal, economic, and social considerations of the project, especially if it involves policy or community engagement. However, without specific details tying it to the iGEM project, it's safer to classify it as ""Other"".
10. ""working on a project for the igem team"" - This phrase is very broad and could potentially fit into many categories depending on the specifics of the work. Without further details, it could be matched to ""Design"", ""Experiments"", ""Documentation"", ""Analysis"", ""Parts"", ""Safety"", ""Modelling"", ""Hardware"", ""Software"", but for a more accurate classification, specifics are needed. Given the broad nature, it will be tentatively matched to ""Design"" and ""Experiments"" as the most general categories applicable to iGEM projects.
