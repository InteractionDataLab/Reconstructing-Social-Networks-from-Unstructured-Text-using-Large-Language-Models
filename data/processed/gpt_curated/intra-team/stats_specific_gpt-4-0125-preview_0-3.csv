We would like to take the chance to thank these people here for all of their help. It really means a lot to us.\n2017 Team and Project\nTeam recruitment was started in February and bi-weekly meetings were held in March to flesh out the 2017 project idea. By the end of March, we had decided to continue working on the project from the previous year: Cloning the cellulose degradation pathway into E. coli for efficient conversion of wood waste to glucose, then production of ethanol by yeast. iGEM elections for team leads were held in April. We elected the president and 5 team leads: Wet Lab, Dry Lab, Web Design, Fundraising and Human Practices. Our team was 24 undergraduate students at the beginning of April. Over the course of April and May we developed our project, and the goals we wanted to complete before the Jamboree. Starting in June we began mining the synthetic metagenomic library for enzymes to send for synthesis. In June we also started building the metagenomic cosmid library which continued, with much troubleshooting, until the end of October. Cloning began immediately after our first IDT shipment arrived, and assay development started early September. This continued into late October. In June we also started contacting people for our science communication project. We wanted to ensure that our science project would be understood by the most people possible. Human practices finished all interviews by early October. Our project was developed by undergraduate students at Dalhousie University with the help of the following people.\nFaculty Support of the Project\nDrs. Craig McCormick, John Rohde, and Lois Murray helped form and direct the project from the beginning. Drs. McCormick and Rohde provided their lab and many reagents to get us started.

Dr. Murray arranged our own iGEM laboratory space during the summer.\nWet Lab Support\nMetagenomic Library Shubenacadie Wildlife Park provided the porcupine fecal samples and diet data sheets. Drs. Trevor Charles, Juigun Cheng, and John Hiel (University of Waterloo) welcomed us into their lab and taught us how to create a cosmid library for functional metagenomics. Dr. Charles also provided us with E.coli strain HB101, and cosmid pJC8. Dr. Melanie Dobson provided metagenomic library mentorship and support. Dr. Jason Leblanc gave us access to his pulse-field gel electrophoresis equipment and offered instruction and supervision during our first attempt. Members of the team that worked on this were Mackenzie Thornbury with the help of Bess Pearson, Matt Curry, Landon Getz, and Nicholas Boudreau. Cloning and Assay Development Patrick Slaine provided mentorship on primer design, general cloning and assay development. Jamie Cook provided mentorship in assay development. Emma Finlayson-Trick provided general cloning tips and laboratory supervision. Landon Getz provided general cloning tips and laboratory supervision.

Drs. Langille and Comeau were on- hand whenever we needed analysis support or help. Landon Getz for writing the pipeline we used to pull out novel cellulose-degrading enzymes from the metagenomic sequencing. Nicholas Boudreau, Jacob Sicheri, and Matt Curry worked on carrying out the pipeline.\nHuman Practices and Outreach Support\nGeneral: Emma Finlayson-Trick provided dedicated mentorship to the human practices team. Emma helped steer our ideas and kept us in-check for deadlines, as well as provided creative solutions to the ideas we wanted to investigate. Emma also created our blog: “Think of the PLOSibilities” in collaboration with PLoS journals to provide lay summaries of scientific articles. Team members that worked on Human Practices were Angela Tsai, Nicholas Boudreau, Francis Routeledge, and Mackenzie Thornbury. Outreach: Jennifer Baechler from Shad Valley facilitated our DNA extraction workshop. Abbey Martin from Dalhousie SuperNova Camps included us in their programming. Paul Briggs and Heidi MacKinnon gave us access to the Biochemistry teaching labs at Dalhousie University for Shad Valley and SuperNova workshops. Ryan Jameson and Steve Thurbide from the Discovery Centre provided us the opportunity to lead a workshop in their Innovation Lab. The Dalhousie Microbiology and Immunology Department provided us a space at Dalhousie Open House to spread the word of iGEM to prospective Dalhousie Students. Integrated:\nDavid Lloyd of FREDsense agreed to an interview and gave us priceless advice for improving our iGEM team. Dr. Eddy Rubin agreed to an interview and provided insight into the future of metagenomics and DNA sequencing technology. Port Hawkesbury Paper agreed to an interview and provided insight into the pulp and paper industry. Scott Doncaster and Grant MacKenzie of BioVectra invited us to their factory and provided a tour.
