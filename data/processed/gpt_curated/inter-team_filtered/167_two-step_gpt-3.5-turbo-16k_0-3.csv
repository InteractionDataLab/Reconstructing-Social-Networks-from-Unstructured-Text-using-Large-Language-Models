Our team, SDU-Denmark, participated in the iGEM competition. 

We conducted research on synthetic biology and developed a project aimed at solving environmental issues. 

Throughout the competition, we collaborated with other iGEM teams from different universities and labs. 

We exchanged ideas, shared resources, and provided support to each other. 

We also attended meetups and conferences where we had the opportunity to network with other teams and learn from their experiences. 

Additionally, we received mentorship from experienced teams who guided us in our project development. 

Our project was funded by our university, SDU, and we received material support from various sponsors. 

We are grateful for the support and collaboration we received from other iGEM teams, universities, and labs throughout our journey in the competition.",SDU-Denmark,2015,11
