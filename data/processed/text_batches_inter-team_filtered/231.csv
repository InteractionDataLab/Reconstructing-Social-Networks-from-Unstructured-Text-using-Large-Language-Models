Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Selection#KnockOutKnochIn_-_-_TEXT.html," pMB1 origin of replication within pSB1C3 and pSB1K3 could cause problems, because E. coli is not able to control the amount of plasmid in the cell if both plasmids have the same ori. The next step was the exchang of the backbone of the part with SH2-cI and the reporter from pSB1K3 to pSB4C5 . The pSB4C5 vector uses the pSC101 origin of replication.   For different antibiotic resistances the coding sequence of the other fusion protein HA4-RpoZ was cloned in the pSB1K3 vector. To test the efficiency of the new constructs, both were transformed in the E. coli strain KRX together. A comparison of a culture with cells carrying both plasmids and a culture with only the pSB4C5 plasmid containing the reporter and the SH2-cI fusion protein reveals visible differences in the RFP fluorescence intensity. The culture with both plasmids has a higher    visual red color. To validate the results, the two cultures were measured in the Tecan plate reader (figure 1).
Figure 1: Tecan-results in vivo reporter activity. Two culturs of E. coli were measured on their ability to produce RFP through the reporter construct. A culture with one fusion protein SH2-cI expressing is compared with a culture carrying both fusion proteins SH2-cI and HA4-RpoZ. The RFP intensity of the culture with both fusion proteins is significantly higher than in the culture with only one fusion protein.
Like expected, the two measured samples differ from each other. A comparison of the RFP intensity demonstrates an about 48% higher RFP signal if the bacteria carrying both fusion proteins SH2-cI and HA4-RpoZ except only the SH2-cI. To calculate if the difference can be    pointed out as significant, an unpaired two sample t-test was applied. With a  calculated t-value of 4.62 and the corresponding p-value of 0.0099 the possibility, that the difference between these two fluorescence signals are caused by chance is lower than 1%.     Due to the fact that the results are very significant the evidence is given, that in vivo selection with our designed bacterial two-hybrid system is possible.
Although it is shown that the bacterial two-hybrid system is working, the output signal is lower than expected. Two possibilities could increase the transcription activity of the bacterial two-hybrid selection system. The first opportunity is the reduction of the background activity of the promoter. The used promoter BB"

Note that 10-15 are for Test #2.  11 and 13 test competitive binding while the remaining transformations test to ensure that there is no nonspecific binding between the repressors that do not share the same binding domain as the activator and the target site for this binding domain.  This is important seeing as we will have multiple repressors in our system and we would like to characterize the effects of their presence on the functionality of the system.  Thus, we expect the transformations 10, 12, 14, and 15 to emit the same YFP response as a control which contains pRS304* + activator + activable reporter.  This control will be constructed later.
Half of each plate for these transformations had 20 uL while the other half had 100 uL.
Put plates into the incubator at 30 degrees C at 11:30 pm.

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#HeatherNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," I presented our project to the other Wellesley CS/Math/Physics Summer Research groups. It was good to practice doing a formal presentation in front of our peers. I think it helped us to organize our thoughts about what we want to communicate and prepare us for future presentations.
Week 8: July 15 - July 19
Monday: After much pain and heartache, I finally managed to implement a better version of drag and drop on canvas, using event listeners and mouse coordinates. Now the functionality will allow for more dynamic movement and interaction, but will need to be revised. Hopefully this is on the right track, even though it feels a little bit like a step backwards.
Tuesday: In the afternoon the lab performed demos of our projects to a group of high school students. Presenting to a younger audience was an interesting mental shift. We had to make more of an effort to be engaging while also concisely communicating our ideas in understandable terms. The demo session was pretty quick, so we didn’t have a chance to observe much interaction and receive feedback, but it was good practice and the students seemed interested in our projects.
Joanna and I presenting our project
Wednesday: Natalie Kuldell from BioBuilder and Rebekah, a high school teacher came to visit the lab and see our project demos. Having input and feedback from them was really helpful and inspirational. Joanna and I continue to make progress improving the functionality. I managed to get HTML5 canvas to dynamically resize, so it is nice to have the possibility of a flexible layout again. The only drawback is that now some of the functionality needs to be revisited. At least Joanna had some success laying out the Codon Dictionary.
Thursday: Internet is down today, so it has been a little difficult to continue developing. Nonetheless, we now have a lot of other work to complete over the next week. We have to put together two new design mock-ups, and finish putting together a poster for the Science Center Summer Research poster session. Additionally, we need to begin thinking about writing research abstracts. So, we are going to take advantage of the technical challenge and begin working on our other quickly mounting tasks.
Week 9: July 22 - July 26
Monday:  Moving forward with the design of the application, Joanna and I have begun to work on mock-ups of the final look and feel. We decided upon two different themes to elaborate upon, a minimalist-streamlined design and an industrial, steam-punk inspired design. For the functionality, we added a panel for the twitter feed of messages, using JQuery to fill the queue and to create a sliding"

Conclusion:
Transformation of pDR111+message into E. coli MC1061 appeared to be successful. Transformation efficiency was low, only 12 colonies were obtained, but 4 colonies seemed to be correct clones. And those were colonies 1, 8, 10 and 11 (see Figure 5). Correct sizes of the bands were obtained: 572 bp. Those colonies were grown overnight (see cell culture protocol ) from pre-glycerol stocks made for colony PCR (see colony PCR protocol ).

Imperial_College_London,2010,Team:Imperial College London#Schistosoma_-_-_TEXT.html," Much progress has been made in the control of the disease through community-based chemotherapy however these rely on political commitment and strong health systems. To understand the disease itself, as well as the possible approaches to improving its control we have to gain a deeper understanding of the complex life cycle of this parasite. Like many other eukaryotic parasites, the Schistosoma life cycle involving several stages in and outside two different hosts.
The Life Cycle
Infected people can pass out several thousands of parasite eggs in their stool (most species) or urine (Schistosoma haematobium). These eggs were first discovered in Egypt by Theodor Maximilian Bilharz, a German pathologist. Under the microscope one can see that they are around 110-170 µm long by 40 to 70 µm wide giving them an elongated shape with a distinctive terminal spine that is used for identification.
Egg of S. haematobium. Stanford University (2004)
Schistosomal cercaria. Loker Laboratory (2006)
These characteristically shaped eggs are viable for around week and once in contact with water they quickly hatch and release the first larval form called miracidia. These free-swimming, ciliated larvae cannot feed and will usually die within 24 hours if they fail to detect a suitable intermediary host, using light and chemical stimuli, and subsequently enter it. Different Schistosoma species show preference for different host species but at this stage all rely on fresh water snails. Once inside the host the miracidia reproduce asexually and form multicellular sporocysts which later develop into cercarial larvae with embryonic suckers and a characteristic bifurcated tail.
This process takes between 4 and 6 weeks from which time on thousands of cercaria, a second larval form, can be shed from the snails daily for several month. This shedding is induced by light (Gryseels et al. 2006) and aims to maximise the likelihood of cercaria finding their second host. The larvae can survive in the water for up to 72 hours, although more commonly around 30 hours, during which time they use chemical stimuli as well as light and temperature to detect the skin of a suitable host. By far the most powerful stimulus to triggering invasive behaviour are skin lipids, in particular medium-chain free fatty acids (McKerrow and Salter 2002) : Of the C18 fatty acids examined, stearic (18:0) is inactive, oleic (18:1) slightly active, linoleic (18:2"

USMA-West Point and USAFA Collaboration
The iGEM teams at USMA West Point and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) collaborated to validate the USAFA DNA submission part in the iGEM pSB1C3 plasmid. The USAFA created a bio-brick that contained an open reading frame that was intended for expression in either bacteria or yeast.
To confirm the presence of the bio-brick in the pSB1C3 plasmid, we performed PCR reactions using the intended submission part plasmid as the template, and primers (provided by the USAFA) that specifically annealed to the bio-brick insert. Prior to running the PCR reaction, the USAFA pSB1C3 plasmid was used to transform DH5alpha bacteria in order to create a bacterial stock and to generate a sufficient reserve of plasmid for all subsequent analyses.
PCR reactions were analyzed by running 10uL of 20uL PCR reactions on an 0.8% agarose gel in 1XTAE for approximately 40min at 100V. The intended iGEM submission plasmid generated a band at ~1300 bp (Figure 1, lane 2). By contrast, a control plasmid generated a band at ~1800 bp (Figure 1, lane 4). The ~1800bp product is consistent with the nucleotide sequence information provided by the USAFA team. The control plasmid used was a yeast expression plasmid into which the USAFA team previously and successfully integrated their bio-brick (pYTK-AFA18; also provided by the USAFA team). The control PCR reaction also used the primers provided by the USAFA team. The reason for the discrepancy between the PCR products for the two plasmid templates was not readily clear.

students in China, introducing biology related researches and activities to them. SYSU-Software also grasped this op-
portunity and attended to this camp, presenting an one-hour introduction about synthetic biology and iGEM competi-
tion to them.
   Considering what they have learnt in senior high school, we organized our presentation as a small lecture, from
DNA, RNA sequence and genetic engineering to the principles and target strata in synthetic biology. Our presentation
explained three main factors that led to success in synthetic biology: standardization, decoupling and abstraction. We
emphasized the importance of standardization, which enabled the biologists to create circuits having specific functions
with “Bio-bricks” like building constructions with bricks. This principle was also most familiar with these students be-
cause they had learnt something about genetic biology, and noticed the deficiencies in digested operation if restriction.
sites unspecific between gene parts. Although the other two principles, decoupling and abstraction, was hard to image
their roles in synthetic biology for these students, we believed their main idea would help students when they had to
face some complex problems in the future.
   We also introduced the target strata in synthetic biology, including sequence, part, device and system. From se-
quence to higher stratum, we thoroughly explained how a intact synthetic system form, and mentioned standardization
again. At last, we presented a brief introduction on iGEM competition, including its history, tracks and awards. We also
introduced the software track and what we have done in this track.
   After the presentation, many students showed their interests in synthetic biology and iGEM. One of them even said
that he was excited because he had played LEGO for years but had never imaged functions in creatures can be built
like the toy bricks, and he wanted to know more about synthetic biology and iGEM.
Genexplorer
   Even in Biology Festival we used toy electronic components symbolizing the genetic circuits, some participants also
felt confused about synthetic systems and their function in reality because electric circuits also had slight differences
from genetic circuit. Thus we decided to develop a video game in which genetic circuits coming from real projects and
their parts are shown as those in SBOLv.
   Then Genexplorer came into being, in which the player can built a circuit following the order of parts shown in the
game, and all circuits were retrieved from eminent projects in previous competition. Target players of this game is
people who have not ever learned synthetic biology but have interested in it.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

Eliminating Varoa Destructor
Overview
The top 100 food crops produced provide 90% of the world’s nutrition. 70% of these crops are pollinated by bees. A phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) has decimated honeybee colonies across the world, halving the number of productive colonies worldwide. One of the main factors hypothesized to contribute to CCD is the mite and viral vector Varroa destructor. While feeding on the bee’s hemolymph, Varroa destructor expels RNA viruses into the bee crippling colony’s strength. Current commercial methods to eradicate Varroa have seen a gradual development of resistance in treated populations. Using synthetic biology, we plan to target Varroa more effectively by directly delivering the miticide, oxalic acid into Varroa and utilizing RNA interference to eliminate Varroa populations within commercial hives.
Our Solution
A few methods to deal with V. destructor are ineffective as they do not target the mite at a crucial phase when the bee is most susceptible. Others rely on chemicals that increase bee mortality rate. For example, formic acid has a harmful effect on capped and uncapped honey bee brood. We are working on killing the mites more effectively by directing delivery of the miticide, oxalic acid. Oxalic acid is an optimal weapon against the mites because the concentration needed to kill a mite is 70 times less lethal to the bee. The acid is already being used in syrup and spray solutions. Our method differs from other oxalic acid methods as it directly transfers the oxalic acid to the mite through the blood-like substance of the bee. Specifically, we are aiming to put E. coli in the midgut of the bee via ingestion, the E. coli would then produce oxalic acid which would be absorbed into the bloodstream. From there, when the mite attacks the bee and drinks its hemolymph, the oxalic acid will be there as a defense mechanism.
Human Practices
Although the science is an integral part of our project, we put some emphasis on human practices as well. Every team member contributed so that we could have a diverse and engaging set of human practices. We reached out many individuals, including one of our MLAs, who is also the Minister of Environment to get her support of our project; rural beekeepers in Southern"

7. Centrifuge sonicated samples to remove unbroken cells.
8. Ultracentrifuge the supernatant to pellet the cell membranes.
9. Remove the supernatant (corresponds to the soluble fraction of the cell).
10. Resuspend membrane pellet in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5.
11. Separate 10 μl of the samples by SDS PAGE (12 % acrylamide), transfer to PVDF and probe with specific antibody (detailed western blot protocol below).
Western blot
Western blotting was used to detect the expression of proteins in the E. coli chassis. 1 ml of an overnight culture of cells were pelleted by centrifugation.
The pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and boiled for 2 mins to lyse the cells. Samples were then loaded on freshly prepared 4-12 % polyacrylamide gels. Gels were run in SDS buffer at 180 V for 45-60 mins to separate proteins by size.
Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer at 175 mA for 20 min for western blot analysis, following the transfer membranes were blocked in 5 % milk/TBS overnight. The target proteins contained a hemagglutinin tag for detection by monoclonal Anti-HA−Peroxidase antibodies supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 % Tween 20 and incubated with the antibody at 1:10000 concentration in TBST for 1 hour at room temperature.
Photo-detection of the cross-reacting bands used ECL reagent (luminol + HRP) and exposure on photographic film.

The talk was given at the University of Guanajuato and an invitation was sent to professors from  the most important Educational Institutions in the state of Guanajuato. There was a very good response from faculty  members of the University of Guanajuato, IPN and UNAM León, where they showed very enthusiastic about the iGEM competition and about making a team.
After 2 weeks the faculty members that showed interest decided to join together in order to create an iGEM team made of the 3 institutions. We were happy to see that our talk was very productive because we not only helped spread the word about iGEM and synthetic biology, but we also contributed to the development of a new team in Mexico and in a state were iGEM was not very known. As of today we continue  as advisors to the new forming team and we would love to see them in the next iGEM Competition!

As the famous Chinese proverb goes,""Union is strength"". It adequately shows the importance of collaboration. During the past years, team Nankai has been cooperating intimately with team Tianjin, our beloved neighbor and friend. We discussed from time to time about different details in our projects and helped each other out when it was needed. Besides, this year team Nankai set up a new resource sharing platform named ""iShare"" . It's a platform for all the iGEM teams to get what they need. To gather more the information, we have also reach for many other teams for help. Thanks to all the iGEM teams who offered us help, ishare is now fully functional.

The Lotus Festival held at TJU
In early April, when the lotus is the most exuberant in school, team Tianjin held a lotus festival to popularize the knowledge of  biotechnology. As their neighbor and partner, team Nankai were invited to the festival. We thanked their hospitality and offered them several samples of actinomycetes for exhibition. During the festival we had some nice chats with members of team Tianjin and had a good time enjoying the beautiful view inside the campus of Tianjin University.

This year, iGEM team Tianjin worked on a special small protein called hydrophobin. They tried to optimize the expression of hydrophobin in prokaryotic expression system. However, a special member in hydrophobin group called injanus, also known as HGF1, could not be expressed in E.coli. They still needed the dates about the expression of injanus and thus reached us for help. Fortunately we managed to characterize the expression of injanus in Pichia pastoris,with the help of Qiao's laboratory in Nankai university.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the discussion proved us that a multidisciplinary team nowadays is a key to success. This is why we decided to organize an event for people who face difficulties and lack a multidisciplinary team when trying to implement their scientific ideas.
We dedicated the first weekend of August to the international coding competition - “BioHackathon: Lab Issues”. It was the first event of this type ever to be held in Lithuania. We considered that BioHackathon would be a great opportunity for representing life sciences to people from various fields and age groups as well as an opportunity to work together in order to expand and boost our project.
Because symbiosis between Life Sciences and IT fields in Lithuania still is in its initial stage, prior to the BioHackathon we prepared a short cycle of lectures. Prospective BioHackathon competitors have attended Prof. V. Ašeris’, P. Gibas’ (PhD) and K. Leonavičius’ (PhD) lectures during which they introduced main concepts of biology to the IT specialists and fundamentals of coding and IT projects for people from the Life Sciences field.
The general idea of hackathons is for a team to create any minimum viable product during the 48 hours of coding. During our BioHackathon, each team including ours, had a specific goal: to create wet-lab-applicable projects in order to reduce the burden of commonly complicated or simply time-wasting daily laboratory tasks.
Seven teams from Lithuania and three iGEM teams from Sweden (iGEM team Lund), Finland (iGEM team Aalto-Helsinki), and Netherlands (iGEM team Groningen) have participated in our BioHackathon. We invited the Minister of Economy of the Republic of Lithuania Mr Virginijus Sinkevičius to welcome the participants and open our coding games. During the opening speech he has emphasised that future is not separately in IT or Life Sciences fields, but rather in their fusion. Neuroscientist Dr. Urtė Neniškytė held a lecture about brain efficiency improvement, Co-Founder and CEO at “Integrated Optics” Evaldas Pabrėža gave a lecture named “Long Haul Start-ups. Motivation Not to Fail” which were productive and short distractions from coding. Throughout the BioHackathon thirteen IT and Life Sciences mentors have kindly consulted and guided all teams.
BioHackathon was also a breakthrough for our software part of the project. As we mentioned in the DNA Day page, event’s final discussion proved to us that we needed to develop a software which would ease the implementation of our project goals and would also be"

Calgary,2011,Team:Calgary#Team#Biographies_-_-_TEXT.html," my third summer as a member of the University of Calgary’s iGEM team and as always I am super excited for the year.  I will predominantly be helping out in the wetlab and marketing aspects of the project this season. I’m most excited about showcasing our project as well as teaching others on the team.  I am also very excited about working with a new group of people this year on a subject brand new to me.  I know that I will gain a ton of new knowledge this summer and have a chance to hopefully step out of my comfort zone and learn a bit more about modeling and website design.  In the fall I will be going into my fourth year of biomedical sciences, and I bring my previous lab experience as well as my theatre experience in public speaking to the team.  In my spare time I am involved in theatre in Calgary as well as competitive highland dancing.

I'm a third year student in Chemical Engineering with a specialization in Biomedical Engineering. I take an avid interest in both engineering and biology, and I hope to be involved in both wet lab and dry lab aspects of this project. As this is my first year being involved with iGEM, I hope to make an impact by bridging the gap between the computational and wet lab requirements of synthetic biology research. Specific research interests before my involvement in iGEM include stem cell growth, tissue engineering, and chemical process optimization. In my free time, I enjoy playing the violin, tinkering with computers, and riding my bike. I look forward to getting to know everyone in Indianapolis and beyond!

As seen from the results, the difference in mean methylation score between 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines and 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines + 25 µM regular cytidines reads is around 40%. This change in methylation score (reference nucleotide count) proves the fundamental step of catalytic activity information recovery from the DNA. By identifying the mean methylation profile it’s possible to assign the ratio of reference (in this case 5mC) and product nucleotide incorporated into the DNA. This ratio corresponds to the starting concentrations of nucleotides present in the DNA amplification step. The starting nucleotide concentration ratio (5mC to catalytically converted nucleotide) depends on the catalytic activity of the analyzed enzyme. More active enzymes catalyse the conversion of larger amount of nucleotides. Thus, by determining the methylation score of the sequenced DNA is possible to extract the catalytic activity data of the enzyme which created the corresponding ratio of the 5mC to product nucleotides. These findings conclude, that Nanopore sequencing and present base calling algorithms are delicate enough to differentiate and assign mean methylation scores to sequencing reads which correspond to different starting nucleotide concentration ratios.
7. CAT-Seq determined activities
The final step in the journey of Catalytic activity sequencing workflow is to sequence the control libraries (esterase mutants, toehold orthogonality and RBS parts) and compare the data to results measured in bulk experiments. The correlation of the results would prove that catalytic activity of a biomolecule indeed CAN be incorporated into DNA as a ratio of nucleotides and that it CAN be extracted from it using Nanopore next generation sequencing.
Recording the sequence-activity information
The constructed in silico designed mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information was prepared and sequenced with Nanopore. By applying the same data preparation and analysis pipeline discussed above, the mean methylation scores arising from reference nucleotides for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized to Wild Type CAT seq Esterase and K227R mutant (lowest activity).

Apparently the ASKA collection and KEIO collection do not share the same selection marker. Made two batches of competent cells the old-fashioned way, like an idiot. They were super competent though, as all my plates were overgrown.
Week 20 (11th of September - 17th of September)
Performing BiFC in M9 doesn’t change anything, sadly. Cotransformed TEV and ZIP constructs to BL21 and transformed RnRc cultures to K12 and K12dCpxR. Overflow in BiFC expertiment at the start (how is that even possible)...

Tried BiFC in KCl-less PBS, which didn't work out great (makes sense as it contains a shitload of NaCl). Played around with TEV and ZIP constructs, but José’s lysis protocol didn’t do any miracles unfortunately. He saw similar issues and cloned both YFP-ZIP halves into one cell (which worked for him). Started to suspect that resuspending in PBS might set off BiFC under any condition: measured in uncentrifuged LB cultures. And would you believe it, it worked! Started my 2nd Labjournal (I'm such a hard worker), BiFC CpxR proved to be reproducible!
Week 22 (25th of September - 31st of September)
Let’s give CpxA-CpxR interaction a shot in K12, so transformed accordingly. Had some troubles amplifying necessary products for YFP-ZIP tests. Designed primers to show BiFC modularity by using Venus, which showed the fastest maturation according to José’s experiment. Tested different L-Ara inductions for Sabines models as well. To combine my work with Stijns project, placed RnRc in the 1T3 backbone.

Week 23 (1st of October - 7th of October)
Realized placing RnRc in 1T3 is useless, but succesfully cotransformed K12 CpxAeYFPn CpxReYFPc! Dropping a plate with your samples to the ground before measuring significantly makes your results worse, proven by empirical research today. GoldenGate assembly of CpxR-Venus is troublesome, unfortunately.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," cells, we assumed the permeability constant of the skin to be negligible. In conclusion, the diffusivity through both exudate and blood were assumed to be equal to water due to the high water contents (approximately 92% for blood plasma (2)) and our target, S. aureus, thrives in exudate with high water content. (3) Furthermore, for the reason that blood flows to the wound and away from the wound we set a boundary where the blood is. This boundary works as a sink in the sense that nutrient and lysostaphin concentration are zero here, because there is flux away from the wound additional to diffusion.
Figure 1: Structure of the 3D model in COMSOL Multiphysics. The hydrogel parts are shown in grey, from top to bottom: nutrient layer, cell layer, buffer layer. The layers fulfilling the goals of exudate and blood are the top and bottom blue layers respectively.
Cell layer
As can be seen in the second model on lysostaphin production, we assumed a completely saturated hydrogel for cells to get a lysostaphin production rate per cell. For this model we do not assume growth of cells, actually, we assume that the cells’ growth and death rate are in equilibrium, establishing a steady state where there is a constant number of cells. Since we obtained a lysostaphin production rate per cell and nutrient uptake rate, along with diffusion constants, we can vary the amount of cells in the gel and the thickness of the gel to get results on possibly fitting values.
As can be seen further in this model, due to the fact that we vary the thickness of the buffer layer and not the cell layer, we argue that for convenience in handling a minimum thickness of 1 mm of the patch is needed (excluding the nutrient layer). This means that the minimum thickness is equal to the thickness of the cell layer, because the buffer layer’s thickness can be zero. Since using 1 mL as the cell layer’s volume eases calculations a lot, we fixed the thickness of the cell layer to 1.111 mm causing the cell layer to have an exact volume of 1 mL with both other dimensions being 30 mm.
Nutrient layer
The parameters in Table 1 will be used in the COMSOL Multiphysics model. We will be using the concentration of nutrients of standard LB Broth (Miller) which we also use in our laboratory. This nutrient-rich layer has to be able to be easily replaced by a new nutrient layer. Just like we argued for the cell layer in the patch,"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP"

Abstract
Background
Goal&Design
Result
Future Work
Goal
What we desire to achieve is to characterize and modify the naturally existing sensors in prokaryotes in order to alarm the occurrence of red tide precisely and accurately. At the same time, try to find a way to restraint it. See more .
Design
Fig. The flowchart of our design is on the right side. To characterize the original promoter is the essential part for understanding the original promoter. After finishing this process, we continue to select engineering methods as well as seek for suggestion from our modeler. Experimental test goes along with the design.
promoter testing platform
1.1 Nitrate-sensitive promoterWe firstly selected well-characterized promoter BBa_K216005 (Edinburgh 2009) as our nitrate-sensitive promoter. To verify its responding characterization, we chose green fluorescent protein (GFP) as our reporter and put its generator E0240 downstream of BBa_K216005.
1.2 Phosphate-sensitive promoter
phoBR promoter
Ugp promoter
Since BBa_K116401 (NYMU-Taipei 2008) has not been submitted physically, we obtained two pho-box-contained promoters by PCR from strains E.coli-K12 MG1655. One of them is the phoBR promoter which contains one single pho-box. The other is the ugp promoter which contains several pho-boxes as well as CRP binding site associated with carbon metabolism. The latter one facilitates more variable phenotypes when introduced to multiple mutants by error-prone PCR. Besides, C:P is another important factors associated with red tide and we speculate that it may show great potential for further modifications. Similarly we have constructed test platforms for both of them by connecting E0240 downstream of each promoter.
Characterization
Phosphate-sensitive promoter characterization is somewhat difficult. Only when phosphate concentration is below 4"

To sum it up, the subject of GMPs is nothing science alone can clearly answer. Many social factors need to be considered before deciding what might be right, wrong or best and where it can be used, in Switzerland or elsewhere.
The matter is not white or black but comes in many shades. The only thing I know for myself is that one should try everything to keep the research in this field up, since it can have many positive outcomes for society, even if it is, for many reasons, at the moment not yet ready to be fully established in society.
Outlook
The morning after the first wiki-freeze before the European iGEM Jamboree, the Swiss parliament prolonged the Moratorium on the commercial use of GMPs until 2017. This negative outlook on commercial use together with the high costs of field experiments will now most likely lead to what Professor Potrykus already mentioned: Research on the GMPs will commercially play no more role in Switzerland and important existing research facilities will be closed down. Even worse, there will a drain out of the country of well educated people in the field on GMP research that, because of governmental decisions, see no more future in their field in their country.
These events leave only looser, not only in Switzerland: Here, an important future industry with high applicable potential will not be further developed, even though Switzerland has a leading position in research in GMPs at the moment. This also affects any future projects, that like golden rice could have had their start in Switzerland and be the foundations of a success story.

Perspectives from the scientific field :  considering the social world.
As we find out in our previous reflexions, the look of the outsiders of the scientific field on scientific practices and productions is now perceived as a richness and is progressively admitted and legitimate.
Citizens, jurists, sociologists, economists, politicians, people from consumers or patients' associations, NGO's are now entitled to claim a visibility on scientific practices and motivations. That claim came with discourses, recommendations and alerts.
My own presence in the Paris team in the IGEM competition is representative of that phenomenon : being a science studies sociologist on the team, having a “anthropological approach”, trying to enlighten ethical stakes. Scientists accept the presence of observers. What will be the feedback of that acceptance? Of that opening to the other, the outsider of the scientific community, the uninitiated?
We first have to come back to an a priori that will be only mentioned here because of its importance even if it is not at the heart of our reflexions : the historical influence of the uninitiated, the non scientists on the constitution of scientific knowledge, has always been important, even if invisible. In the pubs of London in the modern period (see Larry Stewart here [3] ) or in the salon of the “Blue stockings” movement of the British aristocracy (see Eric Sartori here [4] ), many invisible places and people are left out of the History of science but were active contributors in the production of knowledge. That contribution in invisibility is a way for us to perceive the broadness, the irregularity and the divergence of the multiple front line of science, creating a multiplicity of places, people, kind of expertise and practices to look at (see Dominique Pestre here [5] ).
According to Marie-Angèle Hermitte (see [6] ), in the 1970‘s, a ""society of science and technology"" (refering to any society where science and technology are the primary production resource) developed between the economy of knowledge under construction (weighing up knowledge, technology and sustainability as a new motor of the contemporary capitalism) and the risk society, considering that “we can't have one without the other”. That culture of science also has a new component, separating it from the idea of priceless progress, making its rise “spectacular” for the analyst : that society rests on “consent”. It is"

Introduction
As we planned to build a very sensitive measurement system, we looked for a set of plasmids that allow a continuous and stable expression of our proteins, and offer a choice of several yeast selectable markers. In the iGEM registry we found the pTUM100-104 vector series, which was established by Team TU Munich in 2012, and the pRS315 vector with different promoters and terminators from Team UCSF in 2008.
We decided to use the pTUM vector series to characterize our simple parts since these plasmids are RFC25 compatible, replicate to high-copy numbers in E.coli and yeast and contain built-in terminators and different promoters. Unfortunately, the pTUM plasmid series only has the URA3 selection marker. We therefore cannot use the pTUM vectors to characterize our composite parts (Caged-Cre and Stop-Cassette), which need to be cotransfected. For our complex parts we decided to use the pRS plasmid system.
The pRS vector series
These vectors encode an ampicillin resistance gene and replicate to high-copy numbers in E.Coli. Furthermore, the CEN6/ARS4 (Chromosome VI centromere/Autonomously Replicating Sequence 4) cassette ensures that the plasmid stays at a low copy number in yeast, because they are treated as pseudo chromosomes (1-2 plasmids/cell). pRS315 is part of a vector series containing four different plasmids (pRS313-316). Each contains a different auxotrophy marker HIS3, TRP1, LEU2 and URA3 respectively,  (compare figure 1). Since the pRS315 and the other pRS plasmids are not compatible with the BioBrick standard, we decided to alter the pRS313, 315 and 316 to make them RFC10 compatible. [Sikorski 1989]

As participants in the iGEM Competition, we have come to accept the ability to modify genes as an obvious fact, one that does not require much reflection on our end. At the same time, whilst we understand such possibility is granted to us by law, not many realise the extent to which law may incentivise, guide, shape and, at times, limit our efforts. It originates from politics, creates institutional procedures, gives life to new businesses, dictates the pace of scientific progress, and affects consumer choices. In this, law reflects the perceptions of its creators while its creators reflect diversity of the country’s citizens. In this, law is diverse.
In this collaboration, we aimed at creating a document that would illustrate that very depth and diversity of law. For this reason, the first issue we discussed is law-related politics, the second, its bureaucracy, thirdly, law’s impact on business, fourth, on science and finally on consumer behaviour. Willing to gain an even deeper understanding of GMM legislations, we have invited teams 15 from different countries to participate in these collaborative efforts. In the end, the final document has been created by 137 iGEMers from 10 teams, 10 countries, 7 different iGEM tracks and 5 continents.
We thank iGEM Manchester team to initiate this collaboration and are pleased to participate. Visit wiki:

Today we did a titer on the ""M2"" phage (The second round of mutagenesis)
6/26/13
Results for the M2 titer. Plaques go down to 10^-5 (about 6 plaques) So our concentration is somewhere between 10^-5 and 10^-6.
Today we were going to start mutagenesis again, but it looks like out E.coli needs to be streaked out again, we're planning to start the whole procedure again tomorrow with an overnight culture of e.coli B plus adenine. Once the bacteria is grown we will centrifuge it and resuspend it to a concentration of 10.5x10^8 cells/mL in M9+ medium with the addition of 20 ug of both uracil and adenine as well as the mutagen 5' deoxybromouridine. We will then resuspend the mixture in separate tubes and add 2x 10^9 of our T4 Do stock. Then we'll aerate at 37C until clearing with 1 mL of chloroform.
6/27/13
Today we did another round of mutagenesis using the same protocol. We also did spot tests on a few of the pin prick plaques found from the experiment on 6/24.
6/28/13
Here are the results from yesterday's experiments. We are slightly concerned because in general the plaques are smaller so it's tough to see true mutants.

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,", we sacrificed mice after 5-day treatment with hEGF or saline, and measured the weight changes over time, as well as the colon length. We found hEGF, but not saline enema rescued the weight loss phenotype (Fig. 3). In addition, the colon length of hEGF treated group was longer than that of saline (Fig. 4). In aggregate, with the joint efforts from both two iGEM teams, we consolidated that recombinant hEGF protein produced from engineered bacteria can effectively relieve several IBD symptoms in an in vivo model, suggesting engineered bacteria capable of releasing therapeutic agents (such as hEGF) could be an attractive approach to fight against IBD.

FAFU-CHINA
We have been keeping a good relationship with FAFU-CHINA iGEM team (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University). At the beginning, we had some troubles in gene cloning. We therefore sought help from FAFU iGEM team. FAFU team was very helpful and finished a very important part cloning pNorV (Reference can be seen in NO Sensor ) in two weeks.
We have also helped the advancement of their project. In their project, they aimed to use Chlamydomonas reinhardti to co-express toxin genes cry and cyt by a 2A-peptide system and purify proteins for bio-activity validation. (Cry and Cyt toxins are Bti toxins that are effective in killing various species of mosquitoes, fungus gnats, and blackflies, while having almost no effect on other organisms. ) They therefore asked our team to help purifying from bacteria by His tag. We were able to finish the protein purification on time and got the bio-activity validated by FAFU-CHINA team. We thought it is helpful to their team and we enjoyed helping each other to improve each other's projects.

Yeast
FERMENTATIVE RESPONSE
This construction has three parts: (1) a transcription factor binding site inside the promoter (UAS1), (2) a transcription factor binding site (UAS2/CSRE), and (3) the coding sequence which contains the yeast AP-1 protein (YAP1). We used the ADH2 promoter, which is regulated by two trans-acting elements, both necessary for maximal promoter activity in the absence of a fermentable carbon source [1].
When is the protein synthesized? Our construction is repressed several hundred-fold in the presence of glucose, so the transcription of YAP1 protein is initiated once the glucose in the medium is depleted.
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: there are two transcription factors which regulate the promoter, ADR1 a carbon source-sensor zinc-finger [2] and CAT8 [3]. In the absence of glucose both cis-acting sites in the promoter are bound cooperatively by the transcriptional activators. ADR1 binds to the UAS1 site while CAT8 binds to the UAS2/CSRE site and regulates positively the transcription of YAP1 protein by the activation of the ADH2 promoter [4]. The presence of glucose downregulates the levels of the transcription factors (ADR1 and CAT8) which results in the depletion of the production of YAP1 protein by the repression of the ADH2 promoter.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HumanPractice#Synenergene#TechnomoralScenario_-_-_TEXT.html," the river where many hydroelectric power stations were built. With a surprised looked they realized the truth. There was no water left in the river. It took several minutes until they found the reason for the depletion of the river. There was a landslide which blocked the river bed. The river bypassed in another direction where no hydroelectric power stations were positioned. Everyone took his shovel and they worked together for many hours to dig the landslide from the river bed. As the river flowed again, the electricity also returned.
The murmur began to become louder after this incident. Many citizens said that it could not go on like that. They began to understand their dependence on natural sources like the power of the sun as well as the strength of the river. Both were needed to fit the energy demand of Amberville. A solution had to be found because so many people were dependent on electricity in this modern society. Many people began to talk about their feelings with their neighbors and friends. The discussions often tackled the recent events with fear and doubt. Others talked about the past and how good it was back then. Nevertheless a few began to talk about solutions. But there was none. And that was what they really start to fear. The society they were living in was based on regenerative energy and they were not allowed to change their lifestyle back to conventional energy sources. Some proud and brave men began to speak with the mayor of Amberville but he did not have the right to change the society. The fear increased day by day. The citizen piqued each other until another three or four families left Amberville.
The man came back again and turned out to be an agent of the government after the incidents had got public. He did a presentation about these experimental villages like Amberville. There was a problem in the electrical power supply. The government thought that it would be possible to base only on regenerative energy sources but the experiment did not succeed. The people realized their addiction to high energy demand, established through the regenerative energy sources. The citizen began to fear that they would have to leave Amberville but there was another idea. The agent presented a new system which used electricity and carbon dioxide to produce a storable substance which was called isobutanol. Isobutanol could be used as an additive for fuels for example.
The citizen did not understand why they had to change their lifestyle but the agent explained it. There was a problem with stability and dependency. The energy which was produced by regenerative sources could be used during the production and few hours later. But there was no feasible possibility to store the energy. The resulting problem was the dependency while"

iGEM is not only about experiments and labwork, but also about bringing the topic of “synthetic biology” closer to the public, and iGEM Düsseldorf perfectly understood that.  Each year, a bunch of iGEM teams is joining this project by promoting synthetic biology using self-designed postcards. We designed a postcard which shows our project’s logo on the front (Cf. Figure 1), and a small information text on the back.
Hi mysterious team, Have you ever thought about bionic prostheses and nerve control? This year, we want to improve the living conditions of amputees by giving them the opportunity to connect their limb to a functional machine! To do so, we are developing an interface between nerves and prosthesis thanks to synthetic biology. Hope your project is going well! See you at the Giant Jamboree in October! iGEM Pasteur 2018 team

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," modifications must be made because in other software tools, reaction-searching is name-based. However, in our program, it is structure-based. Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which is featured as the most important part of our program. In addition, process of products generating is not as easy as just creating a new species with specific name, too. Their structures are required to be constructed under rules defined in MoDeL at the same time. The species matching and products generating modules are essential to implement our automatic modeling idea.
To complete the final systemn network from initial conditions, we break up the task to several parts:
Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file;
Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species;
For each template species found matching, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both at the same time;
For each template reaction found possible to occur, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction;
For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied for given constraints, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
Go to step 2 until the end of the species list;
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
Figure 1: Algorithm Flow Chart
Special reactions and volume strategy
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions. The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. It means number of mRNAs per DNA per second for transcriptions and number of proteins per mRNA per second for translations. A transcription will not end at a terminator"

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," the PgolB and RFP will not be present and between PgolT/S and golS the “replaceable” (SacII and SanDI restriction enzymes) lacZα will be present.
Two linear fragments were ordered as gBlocks containing PgolT/S-lacZα and golS with XbaI and SpeI restriction sites on the sides. However, later on we had to change the restriction sites by PCR, because the plasmids were only re-ligating during the cloning process and we were unable to transfer the genes and fuse these two parts together. Finally, a PgolT/S-lacZα-golS construct was made into pSB1C3. The activity was tested on LB plates containing X-gal as well as a β-galactosidase assay to best understand the response time and required gold ion concentration for induction.

Gold scavenging peptides
Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) differ from solid particles by their chemical and physical properties and have characteristics making them useful in: medicine as drug delivery agents (1), chemical industry as a catalyst (2) and various other areas (3). However, synthesis of AuNP with defined size range requires various toxic chemicals and usually traces of them are left and synthesized materials cannot be used for biological or other sensitive applications (4).
Recently it was discovered that some bacteria like Delftia acidovorans is secreting small non-ribosomal peptides, which are able to reduce gold ions to solid gold. This forms a substrate to attach to and prevents the bacteria from gold ion induced toxicity (5). Interestingly, it was suggested that this species could be responsible for formation of small gold nuggets. However, commercial synthesis of delftibactin is too expensive due to modified side chains of the compound (Fig 1) as well as the formed gold particles are unstructured and can only be used for jewellery or electrochemical industry.
The alternatives like small peptide synthesis required prior knowledge, thus the phage display system was used and few AuNP binding dodacemer peptides like MIDAS-2, MIDAS-11 and A3 were generated (6, 7). Further experiments provided some evidences for nanoparticle formation. At first it was thought that not only MIDAS-2 and MIDAS-11 can reduce gold ions without external reducing agent, but also A3 and its fusion with Flg. AuNP almost showed no signs"

By establishing dialogues with labs, we found the limitations of our thoughts. Thankfully, enlightened by Professor Liang in Ocean university of China and Professor Du in Institiue of microbiology, we changed our initial thoughts and extended the expression gradients of target gene by model prediction and mutation of hairpins and Csy4. What's more, we applied our minToe to polycistron with the help of modelling for further application.
See more details in our Gold & Integrated human practice
Fig.3 We communicated with Professor Du about our project.
2. Integration with biotech companies
The best way to further verify the practical application of our project is to investigate in the biological companies who are good at transforming basic researches into practical results . We visited some relevant local biotech companies such as BGI, Qingdao Bright Moon Seaweed Group Co.LTD and Qingdao youdu biotechnology Co.LTD. We introduced our project to the stakeholders and also gathered many good suggestions. Importantly, they applauded our ideas and proposed some application of our project on production. Enlightened by the investigation, we ensured our ideas of applying our system to polycistron expression system and put it into practice.
See more details in our Gold & Integrated human practice
Fig.4 We went to biotech companies and it really inspired us.
3. Integration with other iGEM teams
In CCiC(Conference of China iGEMers Community), we communicated with other teams about our project.  XJTU-China came to exchange their ideas with us, and the similarity between the two project made us collaborated. After finishing the experiments of polycistron system, we integrated the system with their project and built a model for them. In the process of human practice, we established a platform with stakeholders for a long term cooperation and feedback. Our project is a great example of fundamental research being transformed into application. So we shared our experience with Tianjin, ZJU-China, NUDT-China team and documented for future iGEMers.

Moving forward, we will most likely move to an alternative CRISPR-Cas9 expression system that would allow for optimized modifications, such as removing the requirement for a selection marker, which in turn would allow us to construct more robust donor sequences. Nonetheless, herein we provide a concept and initial tools for ribosome engineering. This demonstrates great potential in synthetic biology, especially in cell-free biomolecular systems like SynDrop.

Design Process
Overview
In our project, we applied a user-centered design (UCD) approach for developing software tools for synthetic biology. In UCD, users are involved throughout all stages of the design process. Thus, extensive attention is given to gather information about users, identify their needs, and to test and refine designs based on users’ feedback. The main goal of UCD is to develop software tools that users find desirable, usable, and useful. Tools that rather than forcing users to adopt their behavior, improve and enhance current practices.
Design Process
Our design process consisted of an iterative cycle that included 4 stages:
Following, we describe the key activities we employed in each stage:
Analysis
Observed users in the lab: our own wet-lab team, and the MIT iGEM team.
Met with a wide variety of users to understand their needs, requirements, and constraints. We conducted focus groups and interviews with: PIs from the Harvard Medical School, researchers from the Weiss Institute, Boston University, and MIT, Biology faculty from MIT and Wellesley College, the MIT iGEM team.
Looked at competitive products
Created user profiles
Developed a task analysis
Documented user scenarios
Design
Brainstormed design concepts and metaphors
Developed walkthroughs of design concepts
Created design sketches
Created low-fidelity prototypes (see example below)
Conducted usability testing on low-fidelity prototypes
Created high-fidelity detailed design
Did usability testing again
Implementation
Conducted ongoing heuristic evaluations
Iterated on visual design, performance, and
Conducted on going usability testing with users (our wet-lab team, biology students and faculty)
Evaluation
Evaluated the usability and usefulness of our software tools by deploying them for use by our wet lab team
Considered various quantitative measures (e.g. time on task, subjective satisfaction) and qualitative indicators (e.g. collaboration and problem solving styles demonstrated by users)

In 2006 Pédelacq et al. engineered and characterized new form of GFP – superfolder GFP (sfGFP), which is more stable and has stronger fluorescence than wild form GFP. We aimed to create other superfolder fluorescent proteins and we succeeded. Changing color of fluorescent proteins is possible using direct mutagenesis technique. We did it using PCR, with sfGFP from Parts Registry (BBa_I746908) as a template.
sfBFP (K1093000) - blue fluorescence, contains Y66H point mutation compared to the original sfGFP
sfYFP (K1093001) - yellow fluorescence, contains T203Y point mutation compared to the original sfGFP
sfCFP (K1093002) - cyan fluorescence, contains Y66W point mutation compared to the original sfGFP
By doing this we improved sfGFP (by expanding the range of possible excitation/emission optima). One could say that we improved standard forms of CFP, BFP and YFP by creating their superfolder forms. We sent sfBFP, sfYFP and sfCFP to Parts Registry.
When we confirmed the correctness of our constructs by sequencing, we cloned them on pSB1A3 plasmid, added J23100 promoter and B0034 RBS and subsequently measured them in RF. We chose RF, because our standard medium, LB, displays high internal fluorescence, which makes it impossible to visualize sfBFP in liquid without significant experimental error.
Excitation/emission maxima for each protein:
sfGFP – 485/510 nm
sfBFP – 380/445 nm
sfCFP – 425/475 nm
sfYFP – 503/540 nm

Subjects that Ought to be Implemented in the Device
ATP Production from Solar Energy
Harvest of solar energy comes to mind as one of the most essential systems needed for the PowerLeaf to actually work. We had to select parts of the PowerLeaf to work on, and at the end of the day, we decided to cut this subpart. Instead, we had a great Skype call early on in the process with the Australian Macquarie iGEM team , who has been working for several years with the implementation of the photosynthetic systems in E. coli.
Cellulose and the Cellulases forming an On/Off Switch
This is also a very crucial part of the PowerLeaf, since it would otherwise be generating an electrical current non-stop, even when not needed. Thereby overthrowing the potential for long term-storage of solar energy. We believe this can be solved either through precise gene circuit regulation or by physical compartmentalisation, but there might be even more elegant ways in which to handle this challenge.
Physical Engineering of the Hardware
It should be possible for the energy storing unit to convert CO2 into cellulose, thereby producing O2 making its chamber aerobic. For the energy converting unit to effectively transfer retrieved electrons to an anode, it requires anaerobic conditions. Thus the removal of O2 from the device is an obstacle to overcome. It will require some out-of-the-box thinking to come up with a novel idea without having to require more energy than produced.
To make a workable prototype of the PowerLeaf, proper engineering of the hardware is necessary. This includes elements such as anodes, chambers, circulation of important nutrients, removal of wastes, and the use of appropriate materials. We worked out the optimal type of plastic for the system with the help of a local expert. You can read about our work regarding the plastic here .

Purdue University iGEM
Welcome! This is the official wiki of the Purdue Biomakers, Purdue’s official iGEM  team since 2006.
Just to give you a little background what iGEM is all about:  The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the  premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. iGEM began in January of  2003 with a month-long course at MIT during their Independent Activities Period  (IAP). The students designed biological systems to make cells blink. This design  course grew to a summer competition, which has then evolved over the past ten  years to include over 250 teams from all over the world. Student teams are given a  kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard  Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these  parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate  them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally  motivating and effective teaching method.
2006 marks the year that Purdue began its long-awaited journey towards making a  difference in the world of synthetic biology, entering the competition with seven  undergraduate members and three advisors. Purdue continued to compete for the  next four years, earning bronze medals almost every year but never anything more.  Facing some trials and tribulations along this journey, namely lack of interest and  insufficient funds, Purdue did not field a team in the 2011 iGEM competition.  Fortunately, the team was revived with enough interest and support to not only  field a team in 2012, but to receive a gold medal and advance to the international  competition at MIT for the"

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the growth rate of original strain differs greatly from deletion strains, especially with the presence of FAP. However, some of the deletion effects are negative, and others are positive, indicating various physiological functions regulated by different transcriptional factors. Seeing that TORC1-relevant regulators play crucial roles in inhibitors treatment, it should be useful to relieve or even switch the allergic symptoms of yeast through reconstructions of TOR pathway, especially modifications on the signaling transduction node “TORC1”, and regulations on corresponding downstream pathways.
With the summed up assumptions above, The core of our project is the directional modification of TOR protein(The target of rapamycin), a highly conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase which is the central component of a major signaling transduction network that controls cell growth in diverse eukaryotic organisms, ranging from yeast to human beings. Massive physiological processes, such as amino acid biosynthesis, transcription and translation machinery, carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis, stress response, protein turnover and cell cycle are directly or indirectly linked with TOR pathway.
In contrast to most eukaryotes, yeast contains two TOR homologues, Tor1 and Tor2. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TOR1 and TOR2 genes encode two large (*280 kDa) and homologous (67% identical) proteins that belong to a family of phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). Despite their resemblance to lipid kinases, they are thought to function solely as Ser/Thr protein kinases. Based on the homologous proteins Tor1 and Tor2, two functionally and structurally distinct TOR multiprotein complexes exist: TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2). Both Tor1 as well as Tor2 can be found in the multiprotein TORC1 together with Lst8, Kog1 and Tco89. A separate pool of Tor2 also associates with Lst8, Avo1, Avo2, Avo3, Bit61 and Bit2 to form TORC2. However, only TORC1 is specifically inhibited by rapamycin.
The addition of rapamycin induces dramatic phenotypic changes such as cell cycle arrest and entry into G0, general downregulation of protein synthesis, accumulation of the reserve carbohydrate glycogen and the stress protectant trehalose, upregulation of stress response genes, autophagy and alterations in nitrogen and carbon metabolism, which became the research foundation of TOR pathway. It appears that TORC1 signalling controls the temporal aspects of cell growth in response to the quality of"

and, using our assumption of a fixed number of active sarA genes, considered the relative change in number of molecules to be representative of the per-promoter rate.  We were interested, however, in the changes of concentration rather than the changes in the raw number of molecules. As the name suggests, Staphylococcus aureus are spherical in shape. Assuming that all S. aureus are spheres, the volume of the cell can be determined. The diameter of a USA300 S. aureus cell was previously measured as 1.1 μ•m
resulting in the overall cell volume to be calculated as 5.575•10-15 L. The number of molecules were thus converted to units of molar concentration in the cell, specifically nanomoles per litre (nM). The exponential fit used to find the rate constant is shown below:  This resulted in a exponential model a•ebt with a b rate constant of 0.0011 nM/min.

Week 6: June 5 - June 9
This week, our team decided to pursue PHB production on Mars from human waste as the main application for our project. Our subgroup revisited the scope of work and different stages of the required process and prioritised tasks. We first researched potential extraction and purification techniques and chose the top 3 methods for further testing in the lab. At the same time, we also looked at VFA production from feces. For safety reasons, we decided to use synthetic feces in preference to real samples. We found synthetic feces recipes (Wignarajah, Litwiller, Fisher & Hogan, 2006),  (Colon, Forbis-Stokes & Deshusses, 2015) and purchased required materials. After preparing synthetic feces, we researched desired conditions for VFA production, separation of VFA from feces and VFA quantification methods.
Week 7: June 12 - June 16
This week, we met with professors in the Chemical and Petroleum Engineering department at the Schulich School of Engineering to discuss PHB extraction and purification techniques. One professor suggested growing bacteria in a biofilm while continuously collecting PHB. With this setup, dead bacteria can be filtered out by a 0.2 µm filter and harvest containing PHB can be separated from biomass without centrifugation. However, biofilms require a large surface area, which is not ideal for the space application where compact systems are desired. Another professor suggested that our process involve the continuous production of PHB in a membrane reactor that retains the bacteria, but lets the PHB through. This continuous PHB production system will also be compact compared to biofilms. We also discussed coagulation including electrocoagulation as a potential method for extraction and purification of PHB with Dr. Nashaat Nassar.
For lab-scale experiments, we plan to test centrifugation and coagulation methods for PHB extraction. Centrifugation method would involve two centrifugation steps: the first step to separate supernatant containing PHB from biomass and other large particles and the second step to settle the PHB granules. Since bacteria and PHB have different settling velocities, the first centrifugation step can remove biomass while leaving PHB in suspension. The"

Collarboration with NTHU_Taiwan
2018.08.03
Team Collaboration
As a team composed of members from biology background, we gladly offer help and troubleshoot the problem on making construct for team NTHU_Taiwan, being insufficient with members from biology department. Since August 3rd, we had several meetings with 2018 iGEM team NTHU_Taiwan.
Earlier before the meeting, NTHU_Taiwan designed the gene of insert for their experiment. After getting the synthesized gene part from IDT and digesting both the inserts and the vectors, they proceeded to ligation, which failed after times they tried.
We went through details from their design of the gene, cutting site and protocols. Later we concluded that the major reason for failing to make the constructs is due to low concentration of the inserts left following digestion and purification.
We re-designed primers for NTHU_Taiwan and suggested NEBuilder Assembly kit, so that they can avoid the loss of their inserts while digesting and purifying the DNA. The kit requires lower DNA input and can save time by avoiding PCR amplification steps.
A few weeks later, we were informed that NTHU_Taiwan still failed to make the constructs. Therefore, we provided our lab for their experiments and kept an eye on them through out their experiments to make sure that there’s no man-made technical false.
Gladly, after several meetup with us and our assistance in lab, team NTHU_Taiwan successfully made all three constructs they needed-- pSB1C3 - AHL snesor - Anti – STAR, pSB1C3 - pLac – STAR, pSB1C3 - pLux – GFP. It was very pleasant experience to work with NTHU_Taiwan.
Since we urge to seek help in building wiki page, in return, NTHU_Taiwan also give us host a meeting with us teaching coding and giving us tips that help making wiki page easier for us. We took the wiki pages designed by previous teams as examples to learn and practiced basic coding skills.
Validating construct used in our Biowatcher experiment is also involved in our collaboration.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," isolate the DNA. ( DNA isolation boiling ). After DNA isolation, the samples were amplified, transcribed into RNA, purified and then loaded on a gel ( RPA+in vitro transcription protocol, of the RNA  isolation protocol and the RNA electrophoresis protocol). The samples prepared in LB-medium all gave a positive output. However, all the dilutions prepared in milk did not show a band. We wanted to test if the samples were too diluted already, so we prepared the 10-1 and 10-2 dilutions both in milk and in LB. The results can be found in Figure 17.
Figure 17: Target RNA of blaZ-gene made by RPA and in vitro transcription. (A) To test if the primers we designed on the conserved regions of blaZ work, we extracted DNA from S.aureus (1.0), Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus 1 (2.0) and Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus 2 (3.0) prepared in Tryptic Soy Broth in 3 different ways, namely: the boiling method (0.1), the commercial promega miniprep plasmid isolation kit (0.2) and the norgen milk isolation kit (0.3). (B) To assess the sensitivity of the boiling method, different dilutions of S.aureus were prepared in milk. These dilutions are on indicated per lane. We prepared the 10-1 and 10-2 dilutions of S.aureus both in milk and in LB and performed RPA and in vitro transcription. We used DH5-α transformed with pSB1T3;(Tet) as negative control.
The samples in milk again did not show a band, in contrast to the samples prepared in LB. For the samples prepared in LB, the boiling was long enough to break open the cells. This indicates that the boiling method can be used for gram-positive bacteria in LB. For milk on the other hand, 10 minutes in boiling water was not sufficient. We dove into literature again and found out that milk interferes with DNA isolation methods. We did not experience this when we boiled gram-negative bacteria in milk. However, gram-positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall, making it harder to lyse the cells. Therefore, for future experiments, we would recommend to boil for at least 15 minutes and immediately put samples on ice for 15 minutes before centrifuging as described by Ribeiro Junior et al. 201"

Aims of the Week
Our main aim this week is to create a line of competent cells, by reinvigorating our previous cell line. This protocol began last week, and will be finished by Tuesday. At this point we can test the competency of the new line, and hopefully recommence our transformations. Also, with regards the wiki, we are hoping to make significant progress on its content. in particular we would like the get more of our information onto the Research page, and also set up a safety page, a protocols page, and a Lab Book. Also, Carina is working on some inforgraphics for our homepage, which will make the principles and aims of our projects much simpler. For the Rathenau debate, Erin hopes to make it half way through the first draft of the more detailed proposal Rathenau have asked for. Finally, for modelling, the aim is to develop the Matlab model for degradation, and we are waiting to hear back from Professor Rowley who will assist us with the"
