SHSBNU_China,2018,Team:SHSBNU China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," of synthetic dyes from wastewaters: a review. Environment International, 30(7), 955, 959, 961.
II. Description
Synthetic dyes, which are widely used in many industries and researches, cause various environmental and health problems. Xintang, a village in China, where textile industries are located, have been heavily polluted with indigo blue dye. After enduring such bad environment, many villagers, unfortunately but inevitably, get heart disease as well as leukemia. (Guang etal., 2013)
Biological degradation of dyes is economic and environmentally friendly methods comparing to chemical degradation, so this year, our team aims to use CotA, a laccase coding gene, to deal with synthetic dyes containing effluents. CotA is a polyphenol oxidase which has capability to decolorize a wide range of dyes. Comparing to chemical process which has high expense and take tedious steps, CotA laccase is eco-friendly. It is proven that laccase decompose dye efficiently even in harsh condition with 3.5% salinity and pH 11.6 (Piscitelli etal., 2010, p. 252), which shows potential for dye decomposition.
However, bacteria are not capable to grow in harsh environment. We learn that previous researchers have reported that biofilm is able to be engineered to display proteins with different functions, which ameliorates the drawback. CotA laccase is fussed with Spycatcher to attach covalently to biofilm containing Spytag. Biofilm is a layer adhered by large amounts of microorganisms to the surface, and organic substances such as enzyme are trapped in it. It maximumly protect bacteria and enzyme in wide range pH environment, lowering the impact of acidic sewage water to laccase activity, enhancing reaction efficiency of laccase. We successfully attach CotA laccase to biofilm and prove the effectiveness of laccase to decompose dyes eventually.
To further improve the efficiency of discoloration, we come up with the idea to construct a filter which holds a large amount of laccase while letting water to get pass. We design to attach CotA laccase to biofilm which cover polyhydroxyalkanoates plastic beads to fill the filter. When processing sewages, the velocity of flow will be controlled to be appropriate, at which the treating efficiency as well as the stability of biofilm are both optimized.

Overview
The story of our E.coil
Here is the story:
Long time ago, Clark Kent grew in the farm. While this summer, our E.coil grows in the LB. What is the difference between our E.coil and normal E.coli? Well, E.coil is super-E.coli! He has the power to produce much more fatty acids than his normal peers. How can that happen? After he “swallows” a plasmid containing all the special genes, he obtains the super power. On this magical plasmid, there are thioesterase, desaturases, fluorescence system and so on.
Thioesterase and fatty acid desaturase are key enzymes for free fatty acid (FFA) synthesis and unsaturated fatty acid production, respectively. They are both extensively spread in animals, plants and microorganisms. This time, we “borrow” the thioesterases from Umbellularia californica and Arabidopsis thaliana, use them to build this magical plasmid and equip our super-E.coli. Also, E.coli contributes to offering its own desaturase to the plasmid.
Besides that, our E.coil can produce the exact fatty acids we want. And this amazing power comes from different operon structures which regulate the expressions of corresponding thioesterases and desaturases. Thanks for them, we manage to produce various fatty acids in a controlled manner.
Considering the strong power our super-E.coli processes, we do want to monitor its fatty acid producing progress. In this case, we design a fluorescence system composed of Transcriptional Regulatory Protein FadR to detect the concentration of fatty acids in the whole system.
In a word, by the ways listed above, we accomplish the switch between production of different kinds of fatty acids by applying different signals to operons, and we can obtain the real time production status of E.coli by fluorescence report.
E.coil: Our responsibility to save the world!
With great power comes great responsibility. E.coil has"

Figure 15: Schematic description of site-specific recombination between a bacteriophage attP attachment site in the plasmid and an attB attachment site in the bacterial genome. In this way the sequence of interest (called ""Part"" in the figure) can be stably integrated into the attB genomic locus. This process is mediated by a specific integrase.
Thanks to its R6K conditional replication origin, the integrative vector cannot be replicated in common E. coli strains, so the Chloramphenicol resistant bacteria are actual integrants.
In the Materials and Methods section ( https://2010.igem.org/Team:UNIPV-Pavia/Project/results ), a detailed protocol to target the desired BioBrick part into the Phi80 locus is reported.
How to perform multiple integrations in the same genome
When this vector is integrated in the genome, the desired passenger should be maintained into the host, as well as the Chloramphenicol resistance marker and the R6K conditional replication origin. The CmR and the R6K can be excised from the genome by exploiting the two FRT recombination sites that flank them. The Flp recombinase protein mediates this recombination event (for a schematic description of this process, see Fig.16 and http://partsregistry.org/Recombination ), so it has to be expressed by a helper plasmid, such as pCP20 (CGSC#7629). This enables the sequential integration of several parts using the same antibiotic resistance marker, which can be each time eliminated.
Detailed protocols about homologous recombination can be found here:

Ms Larocque did subcultures of all 8 overnight cultures - 5uL AMP, 5mL LB, 50uL cells to grow from 10am - 1pm.
Ran mini-prep, restritction digest, and gel on overnight culture plate 1A and 2A.
- Gel may have cooled too much before pouring
- We poked through gel wells on first two rows
We are testing our bacteria with the nitrophenyl solutions.
Robert's Emails about steps:
1. Take a sample of the overnight culture (100-500 uL) and pellet it in the centrifuge (max speed, 5 mins).
2. Add detergent to the phosphate buffer to get a 1% detergent phosphate solution.
3. Add nitrophenol at a 1:50 dilution so that we end up with a 1 mM nitrohpenol, 1% detergent phosphate solution (this is the reaction mixture).
4. Resuspend the cell pellet in the reaction mixture and incubate at either room temp or 37 degrees at 200 rpm.
5. Take a sample (250 uL) at the desired time points and centrifuge it to remove the bacteria. (NOTE: incubate on ice for 10 mins before centrifugation if you can as this will help stop the reaction from progressing while you centrifuge). Once pelleted, take the solution and store it in a clear vial in the fridge.
6. When all samples are ready, take a picture with a white background to see the progression of the reaction at each timepoint. If the tubes get in the way of taking a good picture, use a piece of parafilm with the paper backing removed and put a 10 uL drop on it. Emily can show you how to do this (we used to do this in iGEM to mix loading dyes into samples).
Emily Hicks made the solutions needed and these were our steps to fit in between (steps 3-6 above)
1. Make reaction micture 2.5mL of nitrophenyl mixture (2 of them - 50uL of nitro, 2450uL of detergent)
2. Pick 4 cultures (2 overnight 3A and 2B, 2 subcultures 2A and 2B) and spin down:

Growth and expression profiles obtained elsewhere (e.g. Groningen) were also comparable to the ones obtained in Nottingham, pointing towards the potential universality of the >i>Key. coli system.
5. Modelling and software programs underpinning Key. coli
To support the work done by the wet team, diverse and complementary models were developed.
First, constitutive gene expression was modeled to set the basis of protein synthesis in a bacterial cell. Then, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) was superposed to this basic model by introducing different parameters such as dCas9 production rate and dCas9:gRNA association rate, simulating transcription interference on the expression of one, two or i fluorescent proteins (FPs). A third layer of modelisation linked the maximum expected fluorescence to the protein concentration available, allowing access to the latter directly via spectrophotometric measurements.
As fluorescence was at the heart of our project, an absorption and emission model summarised all useful values that could be used to excite and detect emission from each of the three selected FPs.
In addition to the above, a software was developed to assess fluorescence levels between Key. coli capsules and the mother strain. The software is able to translate spectrophotometric readings into image-like data using an image similarity algorithm, with predefined threshold values. Readings outside of the threshold range would result in “Denied Access” to the lock of interest.
Finally, we have generated a Random Number Generation tool and a user-friendly Excel sheet with editable Protein Concentration fields that can be used to create a customised strain and get the associated tweaked combination allowing for randomness and flexibility.
Conclusion
In this study we have shown the first steps taken towards the development of a randomly assorting, fluorescent bacterial key: the Key. coli. The results of the proof-of-concept experiments undertaken provide us with confidence that Key. coli, albeit futuristic, is a feasible technology employing available know-how, such as large part pools, random plasmid assemblies and CRISPR interference. In addition to proving the scientific feasibility of Key. coli, we have also designed a safe and portable device for its storage and revival at a desired time point. Finally, we have paired Key. coli to a streamlined authentication procedure, tailored to be immune to current hacking frameworks.
We hope that this next generation biological security system will one day be commercialised so we can all protect"

Toxicity
Short Summary
On the one hand, gold, silver, copper and iron ions are of interest due to their chemical properties. On the other hand, some of the ions possess toxic properties for the cell (Ochoa-Herrera et al., 2011; Shareena et al., 2015; Zhao & Stevens, 2009). Therefore, the toxicity of the different ions of the metals needs to be included into consideration when planning the uptake and processing of these ions as a substrate for metal nanoparticle (NP) production by bacteria. Not only is the toxicity of the dissolved ions of interest but also the potential toxic effect of nanoparticles on the cell.
Gold
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are popular in many scientific applications, e.g. the transfection of human cells (Chang et al., 2008). However, there are several contradicting reports regarding their toxicity (Brust et al., 1995; Caruntu et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2015). AuNPs in the form of rod-shaped nanoparticles (""nanorods"") were identified as non-toxic, solely the coating agent was found to be toxic (Alkilany et al., 2009). AuNPs in general do not possess toxic properties. Reported toxic effects of AuNPs resulted from poor purification of the AuNPs from Au(III) (Shareena Dasari, 2015). However, gold ions, such as Au(I) and Au(III), have toxic properties. Shareena Dasari et al. demonstrated in 2015 that exposure to Au(I) and Au(III) inhibits the growth of nonpathogenic Escherichia coli as seen in figure 1. Furthermore, they determined"

Gold Medal and Integrated Human Practices
The expansion of mGEM’s Human Practices team this year allowed us the resources to integrate discussions of safety and responsibility throughout our entire project timeline. We began a handful of new initiatives, with the goal of blurring the lines between subteams and their associated fields of knowledge. Our pursuit of Integrated Human Practices extended to providing communication pathways and collaboration techniques for all subteams, including Wet Lab, Dry Lab, and Outreach. Below, we will detail some of these initiatives, their successes, and improvements for the coming years.
Brainstorming
Our Human Practices integration began at the brainstorming level with inter-subteam, group-based investigations into possible project directions. Small groups of paired Wet Lab and Human Practices members chose to tackle a wide range of engaging topics. The groups researched their potential lab projects, associated ethical and safety considerations, and the capacity for local community engagement. Some topics of note were:
Employing natural mechanisms found in tardigrades to preserve blood platelets
Synthesizing a cost-effective and multi-use antidote to snake venom
Creating a publicly-accessible diagnostic tool for Lyme disease after contact with ticks
The aim of this brainstorming approach was to familiarize different subteams with their colleagues’ responsibilities and research considerations, with the goal of selecting a project which would spark enthusiastic learning from all fields. The initial, brief research period ended with presentations where each group summarized their findings, and pitched the project as a feasible direction for mGEM 2017. The experience was highly rewarding as an inter-subteam icebreaker – we established a positive dynamic between research teams that provoked continuous collaboration throughout the season. mGEM had never used this type of inter-subteam brainstorming before, and we will no doubt continue with this method in the coming years.
The Standard
After deciding our general project direction, the Human Practices team sought to supplement the Wet Lab with the current statistics and diagnostic methods for antimicrobial-resistant strains of C. difficile. We compiled a document detailing the current standard for C. difficile diagnosis and treatment, including the timeline for clinical testing, costs associated with brand-name assays, and experts’ concerns about the treatment process. This “standard” document helped"

(v)   Any other relevant information.
None
(c) Assignment of a Provisional Containment Level that is Adequate to Protect Against Hazards to Human Health This step will involve considering the containment level necessary to control the risk of the recipient organism (e.g. the ACDP Hazard Group of the recipient microorganism) and making a judgment about whether the modification will result in the genetically modified organism being more hazardous, less hazardous, or about the same.
Provisionally categorized as a Category 1 project
(d) Identification of Any Hazards to the Environment
(i) Hazards associated with the recipient organism (e.g. bacterial host, viral vector animal, plant) Factors to consider include whether the recipient microorganism is capable of infecting any plants, animals or insects in the environment and whether there is any possibility of any disabling mutations being complemented or reverting. In particular it should be ascertained whether the recipient microorganism is a pathogen that is controlled by DEFRA. If it is an animal or plant, are these organisms inherently hazardous to any population in the environment. List all such groups even though they may not exist in the UK
Escherichia coli DH5 (a K12 derivative) is recognized as being unable to colonize humans and is disabled with respect to growth outside the laboratory.  The cells have limited survivability in the environment and often have auxtrophic reqirements which are unlikely to be satisfied outside the laboratory, and thus are unlikely to present a hazard to the environment.
(ii) Hazards arising directly from the inserted gene product Consideration should be given to whether the inserted DNA encodes a toxin, an oncogenic protein, an allergen, a modulator of growth or differentiation (hormone or cytokine) or any other protein, which may result in potentially harmful biological activity. Where the function of the inserted gene is unknown, it may help to describe the function of any known homologues. Please note that even a normal gene may be harmful if overexpressed, especially if the overexpression is in tissues that do not normally express the protein. You should also indicate if the protein produced by the gene may affect other organisms in the environment (e.g. expression of antibiotics etc)

The fundamental aim of the UNAM is to serve both the country and humanity, train professionals, organize and carry out research, mainly on national problems and conditions, and offer cultural benefits in the broadest sense possible.
UNAM, main campus
Ciudad Universitaria (University City), Mexico, is UNAM's main campus, located in Coyoacán borough in the southern part of Mexico City. Designed by architects Mario Pani and Enrique del Moral, it encloses the Olympic Stadium, about 40 faculties and institutes, the Cultural Center, an ecological reserve, the Central Library, and a few museums. It was built during the 1950s on an ancient solidified lava bed in Coyacán called ""El Pedregal"" to replace the scattered buildings in downtown Mexico City where classes were given. It was completed in 1954. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007.
Although the University has other buildings in Mexico City (mostly for undergraduate studies and cultural purposes), in other Mexican states and in other countries (such as Canada and the United States), Ciudad Universitaria, known simply as ""C.U."", is the prime symbol of the University.
UNAM, campus Morelos
Campus Morelos is one of several UNAM campuses outside Mexico City. It is located in the city of Cuernavaca in the State of Morelos, grossly 40 km south of Mexico City. The UNAM, has three main institutions here: the Institute of BioTechnology , the Center for Genomic Sciences , and the Institute of Physical Sciences .
The Center for Genomic Sciences
The CCG (Centro de Ciencias Genómicas in Spanish) was originally a Center dedicated to the study of Nitrogen fixation. It was not until 2004 that the name was changed to"

Our
Vision
What we wanted to see with our project
In New Zealand, 91% of kiwifruit growers cite winter temperatures as the greatest threat to crop yield. Source: Cradock-Henry, N. (2017).
Cold temperatures can stunt growth, cause severe plant damage, and even kill growing plants, making them a severe risk to the industry that needs to be addressed.
While there are potential treatments, as shown in the image, we think there is another way to reduce the impact of frost.
Our vision is to have crop plants that do not require these costly interventions in order to be protected from winter temperatures.
We hope that in time farmers will not fear the oncoming of winter, or have their livelihood threatened by a sudden frost. Genetic engineering provides an avenue for this.
Frost resistance genes, in the form of Ice Recrystallisation Inhibition Proteins and Antifreeze Proteins, are well documented in many species, both plants and animals and can be used to protect crop plants from the kind of damage caused by cold without the need for other interventions.
We hope to improve crop yields, therefore reducing waste and making better use of the farmland that is in current use. We want to make it possible to grow crops in colder, or more unstable environments than it is currently possible to do, through improving the cold tolerance of these plants. We hope this would lift some of the limitations imposed on farmers by cold winter temperatures.
Fig1. shows a Négociant in Bordeaux, France lighting candles to protect his grapes from frost. This shows the lengths growers will go protect their livelihoods. Source
Current methods of frost protection are expensive, labour intensive, and are often ineffective. These methods include selectively breeding for frost resistance traits, adding frost covers, setting up gas heaters or candles (as shown), using fans or helicopters to churn up the air, and using sprinklers to naturally insulate the crops as the water freezes. Unfortunately, each method comes with its own limitations. We hope that genetics could be the answer to this.

All T-domains from the respective genomes were amplified using CPEC primers with a uniform 5’-end and a 3’-end specific for the respective gene. For the assembly of the hybrid-indigoidine synthetases by CPEC, the indC-ccdB construct was used.
Creation of Synthetic T-domains
All R scripts used in the following sections are based on R version R-3.0.1.   Different assumptions about the evolutionary conservation of T-domains were examined: i) conservation of a specific module across different species, ii) conservation of T-domains across different modules for the same species, iii) conservation of T-domains across different species,  iv) conservation of similar modules across different species. According to these three assumptions, different libraries of homologous protein sequences were generated using ncbi protein BLAST (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with standard parameters:
query sequence: indC; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences without organism restriction
query sequence: indC T-domain; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences within P. luminescens
query sequence: indC T-domain; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences without organism restriction
query sequences: indC, bpsA, entF, delH5 and tycC6; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences without organism restriction;
The 50 closest related protein sequences contained in each the library were subjected to a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using clustalO ("

We compared the    pigment expression by our device with the wildtype strain in the presence of rotten meat and without the presence of meat.    When our device sensed volatiles produced by the rotten meat, the promoter was induced, resulting in the activation of the    amilGFP coding gene and the production of the yellow color. At the end of the experiment, the cells were harvested and spun     down to obtain a better view on the cell pellet. The cell pellet from our device that was exposed to the rotten meat volatiles    exhibited strong yellow color while the wildtype strain and the device that was not exposed to the volatiles were white (right).

After this, we kept the tubes on ice and brought them to the Proteomics lab of the University of Valencia. The proteomic analysis was carried out in the SCSIE_university of Valencia Proteomics Unit , a member of ISCIII ProteoRed Proteomics Platform. Once there, proteins were isolated and quantified with the supervision of the technicians. Finally, proteins were digested and labeled by using the iTRAQ technology, which allowed us to work with all the samples in the mass spectrometer at a time and then assign each identification to a particular sample.
Proteomics Results
A general view on the protein profile of each sample was firstly observed on an SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 6). Strong differences were detected, as expected, in the bands corresponding to the GFP and the β-lactamase encoded by the ampicillin-resistance gene of the pUC57 plasmid used for cloning.
Figure 6. SDS-PAGE gel showing the protein profile of the samples used for proteomics analysis. WT: wild-type E. coli strain DH5α (2 replicates); Bb1: Biobrick part 1-expressing strain (3 replicates); ᴓ: strain carrying the empty cloning plasmid. Red and green arrows indicate β-lactamase and GFP, respectively.
An average of 1500 proteins per sample were identified with the mass spectrometer. Among them, 472 proteins could be properly quantified. Figure 7 shows the variation of a subset of proteins among samples. Notice that chaperone proteins are specially over-represented in the strain expressing Bb1, whereas proteins involved in response to oxidative stress are particularly abundant in the strains carrying the empty plasmid.
Figure 7. Representation of a subset of differentially expressed proteins among samples. Red and green colors indicate strong over-representation and under-representation, respectively. Blue arrows indicating β-lactamase and GFP; orange arrows indicating chaperone proteins; purple arrows indicating oxidative stress-related proteins.
But this apparent variation in the proteome changes when applying some statistics. A relative comparison of the average expression level of each one of the quantified proteins in the three groups of samples (WT strain, Bb1-expressing strain, and empty plasmid-carrying strain) is shown in Figure 8. Those proteins displaying the highest alterations in their expression levels are marked with numbers and identified in the table on the right.

Figure 9. Linearization of microcystin-LR occurs when MlrA hydrolyzes the bond between two of the toxin’s amino acids, Adda and arginine.
Based on a homologous structure model (figure 10) we obtained from the Phyre2 tool (Kelley et al., 2015), it seems that the enzyme is a transmembrane protein consisting of eight hydrophobic α-helices that form a channel, with the presumed active site (Bourne et al., 2012) residing in the middle. It is worth pointing out, however, that the model does not cover the whole length of the MlrA sequence, as only very few homologs were found for the sequence - the homology model is mostly based on two homologs that didn’t cover the very ends of either terminus. Other than this evidence, there are previous studies pointing to the direction of MlrA being a membrane protein (Pei et al., 2011). However, when the enzyme was heterologously produced in E. coli , it was noticed that it had localised mostly in the soluble fraction of the cytosol, in an active state (Dziga et al., 2012).
Figure 10. A homology-based structure model of MlrA made with Phyre2 and visualised with UCSF Chimera. Based on the model, it seems that MlrA has a typical membrane protein structure consisting of set of hydrophobic transmembrane helices.. The presumed active site (Bourne et al., 2001) resides in the middle of a channel formed by the helices.
The mechanism of MlrA’s function is not yet fully understood. The homologous structure model gives some suggestions as to how the enzyme might work: it seems that one end of the channel is wider than the other, and that the active site resides in the middle of it. Consequently, if the enzyme is located on the outer membrane of the cells, it might actually be a transporter which the cells use to import the toxin and simultaneously linearize it.
It has been reported that the linearization of MC-LR renders the toxin 160 times less toxic (Bourne et al., 1996). When the blue-green algae problem is at its worst, the levels of microcystin can go up to 24 mg/L (Chorus and Bartram, 1999). However, such levels are only observed in scums, which"

To transform Physcomitrella patens, the moss material has to be taken from the liquid culture and its cell walls have to be digested with driselase dissolved in mannitol to obtain protoplasts. The protoplasts are isolated by passing the digested material through sieves and the enzyme is washed off with mannitol and then resuspended in mannitol.
The number of protoplasts is determined with a hemocytometer and the material is suspended in the right amount of 3M medium to adjust the concentration. The linearized and purified DNA is mixed with PEG4000 and the protoplast solution and incubated while regularly mixing. After incubation, the mixture is diluted with 3M medium, centrifuged and resuspended in regeneration medium.
The protoplasts are put into 6-well plates, left in the dark over night and then left for 10 days for the regeneration of the cell walls at standard conditions. After moving the protoplasts onto solid medium covered with a layer of cellophane for three days, they are transferred to solid selection medium plates for two weeks. To ensure stabile integration, repeat the two weeks of selection after a two week release phase.
Trips to Freiburg
We had the great chance to perform our Physcomitrella patens transformations at Prof. Dr.Reski´s lab in Freiburg, with Dr. Wiedemann as our expert instructor. Our first trip started in a great hurry, because we worked on our DNA preparations until the very last minute. Ingmar even pulled an all-nighter to get the DNA ready. We would have missed our intercity bus if it wasn’t for Rosario who drove us to the bus station, all squished together in the “pizza mobile” with the trunk  full with our medium bottles and lab equipment. After five hours on the bus, we fell into bed to get some rest, because we had a very long day ahead of us.
We arrived at the Reski lab early in the morning to meet with Dr. Gertrud Wiedemann, who instructed us throughout the day and gave us many tips how to proceed with the moss. Because of the"

Cells were plated on LB+Kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours.
Five colonies of each plate were screened using iTaq polymerase and two primer combinations for each colony. This is VF2/PPTase_rv primer and PPTase_fw/VR primer.
pRB16 is obviously wrong. We checked the PCR product we used for the assembly and recognized that it's wrong, so we have to amplify it again from S. verticillus. DelC screenings show another small band, we have too check whether the primers bind elsewhere on the plasmid and run a negative control with those primers.
Assembly of pKH4
pKH4 is a pRB3 derived version of an indigoidine synthetase expression plasmid w/o sfp as activating PPtases. So the two plasmid strategy can be conducted (at first) with this plasmid instead to rely on pRB21 . Basically the idea is to use restriction sites before and after sfp to discard it and to religate with another sequence to yield a functional backbone.
pRB3 has a BamHI before and a NheI cutting site after sfp. pMM64 and pMM65 both can be cut with a combination of BglII and XbaI to yield for example a 164 bp long fragment with compatible ends to the linearized pRB3 . This fragment unfortunately contains a T7lac hybrid promoter which could interfere with our used primers, but still is worth a shot.
digest mix volume: 30 µl (3 µl NEBuffer 3.1, 6.5 µl pMM65 (~481 ng), 0.3 µl (BglII, XbaI) each, 19.9 µl H2O)

While it was possible for every member to take part in everything, there were some focus areas for every person in the team.
Leading the Team: Oskari made sure that everything that needed to be done would get done. While he didn't always have to do this alone, the importance of proper leadership isn't questionable! Oskari also founded the team and recruited the members.
Business: Pietu, Niklas, Otto and Oskari took part in Summer of Startups and brought the entrepreunial views to the team. Pietu is our main pitcher and Niklas and Otto focused on creating the business plan.
Research: The background research, designing our genetically engineered machine and the bioinformatics was mostly done by Oskari, Lassi and Laura.
Lab: Minttu and Martina spent the summer in the lab playing with bacteria and BioBricks.
Modeling: Niklas and Otto are our modeling agency . They took care of both the mathematical modeling and the business model. Oskari participated in their work by giving comments and suggestions.
Simulation: Otto and Niklas took care of the computing whereas Oskari created the user interface for the python script and web based simulation. Lassi ported the computational parts into JavaScript for the web simulation.
Software: Lassi was in charge of the software development, created the Seekers and taught everyone to use GitHub. Most of the team members programmed something, but Lassi was usually the first person who you'd go to when your code didn't work. Pietu programmed and built the LED rig and Laura worked with the web pages.
Wiki: Laura designed the looks and the structure of the wiki, Lassi implemented the core of the wiki, Pietu made the wiki upload tool and Oskari scripted a neat way to refer to figures in the research section. All of us contributed to the content.
Media: Mikko did a wide range of things to hype us in the media, created and constantly updated our social media sites and wrote a big story for Kemia magazine.
Visual Appearance: Laura took care of the visual appearance, often asking opinions from the other team members. This included e.g. our logo, web/wiki page layouts, poster, team banner and illustrations of lambda repressor. Minttu made the gene circuit and lamp pictures and took many photos of the lab.
As already mentioned, we didn't always follow this categorization. Lassi and Otto, ""the competent boys"" (Finnish version: ""komppipojat"" ) e.g. made competent cells in the lab a couple of times, Niklas made"

Wild type and ∆crcB were grown directly next to each other at varying levels of fluoride. As described in literature, ∆crcB should not grow when exposed to fluoride levels over 500µM. Unexpectedly, ∆crcB did grow on high levels of fluoride when placed on the same plates as wild type E. coli. Without wild type E. coli, no growth of ∆crcB was seen on 1mM and 2mM fluoride.
In order to figure out the cause of the unexpected growth, we reached out to Dr. Randy Stockbridge at University of Michigan for possible explanations. Dr. Stockbridge informed us of Fluoride’s dependability of pH. A low pH environment is necessary for Fluoride to enter cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the wild type altered the pH of the agar to a more basic level, facilitating the growth of ∆crcB.
To confirm our hypothesis, we prepared similar set of plates, but with phenol red, a pH indicator, for visual confirmation.
Phenol red appears red at basic pH and turns yellow at acidic pH. In the absence of a buffer, wild type has a visibly basic pH. Therefore, once the entire plate became basic, ∆crcB showed fair amount of growth. On previous days, ∆crcB grew only at red areas (low pH).
To further confirm our results, we prepared the same plates with a MES buffer, which kept the agar at a 6.5 pH, which is slightly acidic.
Upon the addition of the buffer, the alteration of pH was significantly delayed, so F was able to enter the membrane of ∆crcB, allowing the strain to grow.
CHOP (Chloramphenicol Operon) and ∆crcB (E. coli without Fluoride Channel) were added to 50µ chloramphenicol plates and observed over the course of 4 days.
The plates had increasing concentrations of F with CHOP and ∆crcB to determine the level of fluoride that leads to the greatest growth of CHOP.
∆crcB was part of the control and did not grow because it does not have the fluoride channel to pump out the F.
As observed, there is most growth of CHOP on 100μM of F, suggesting maximum growth of CHOP at 100μM of F.

Our proposal is to create a system which allows us to measure a biological signal precisely and without delay. But we are not the first who make this kind of attempt. In 2008 Harvard iGem team developed a similar idea: they introduce a plasmid into Shewanella oneidensis which contain a Lac promoter   coupled with gene that codifies to mtrB cytochrome.  The last protein belongs to an oxidation complex that reduces minerals by electron transference. Hence, Shewanella produced an electrical signal when stimulated with lactose.
On the other hand, Chile 2012 coupled a bioluminescent molecule to the circadian clock of cyanobacteria. Their aim was to produce a bioluminescent cyanobacteria which lights up during dusk hours and regenerates the substrates during the day. And Cornell 2012 create a biosensor that generates and electrical output of to measure water quality in areas affected by oil and gas extraction. They also used the Shewanella cytochromes complex to produce the electrical signal."

Choice of Antibiotic Resistance
As a selective marker gene we chose the ampicillin resistance gene (amp) coding for TEM-1 beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamases are well-studied resistance enzymes of gram-negative bacteria against beta-lactam antibiotics. Beta-lactam antibiotics inhibit the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer in the periplasm and therefore the proliferation of bacteria. If the beta-lactamase is present in the periplasm it can hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring, rendering the antibiotic useless (Wilke et al. 2005). A benefit of beta-lactamase as a resistance for our selection is, that it can grant resistance even at a low expression rate (Matagne et al. 1998). Therefore, even Evobodies with a low affinity to the target protein might be able to grow on low concentrations of ampicillin. In a process of continuously increasing the selective pressure, the chances of acquiring a functional Evobody is a lot better if low affinity Evobody bacteria are not eliminated instantly but instead are granted the possibility to adapt the Evobody to the target protein. Apart from our projects primary selection, the bacterial two-hybrid system , we proposed two additional methods to screen for binding Evobodies.
Split-Protein System
Figure 2: Illustration of the split-protein system. Only in case of the Evobody showing affinity towards the target protein the functionality of the split beta-lactamase(10) is restored, granting a ampicillin resistance to the bacterium that generates the Evobody.
The split-protein system works, like the name indicates, with two parts of a former functional protein, which are fused to the two proteins that should be screened for an interaction. A lot of different proteins are able to be split into half and to reassemble when fused to two interacting proteins (Ladant, Karimova 2000). By using a visual reporter like the green fluorescent protein or an selection marker like a beta-lactamase, the split-protein selection system can work as an indicator to screen cultures for protein-protein interaction (Shekhawat, Ghosh 2011). In our case however, we utilized it as an in vivo selection system (Porter, JR et al. 2007) to give a growth advantage to those bacteria producing the best Evobody.
The split-protein approach relies on the Evobody and the target protein each forming a translational fusion with one half of the split-protein, respectively. It is important to design the split"

The procedures were done according to the respective protocol.
Analytic Tests
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
For agarose gel electrophoresis, 1.0% agarose gels were prepared. For analytical purpose, the gels were run with the parameters U=90 V, I=400 mA, t=60 min. For preparative purpose, the gels were run with the parameters U=120 V, I=400 mA, t=35 min.Afterwards, the gels were stained in ethidium bromide solution, and then analyzed by UV light.
Gel extractions of DNA were performed using the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up kit distributed by Macherey-Nagel (REF740609).
Expression Test
In preperation for expression studies, the constructs in pBAD202 were transformed into E. coli TOP10, R. planticola or S. blattae cells. The respective cultivation conditions (medium, temperature) are listed in “Cultivation and Transformation”. The expression assay was done as described in the D-TOPO® protocol.
For each transformant, inoculate 2 mL of medium containing 50 µg/mL kanamycin with a single recombinant colony.
Grow overnight with shaking (225-250 rpm) to OD600 = 1-2.
The next day, label five tubes for each transformant and add 10 mL medium (50 µg/mL kanamycin) to each tube.
Inocculate each tube with 0.1 mL of the overnight culture.
Grow the cultures with vigorous shaking to an OD600= ~0.5.
Prepare four 10-fold serial dilutions of 20% arabinose with sterile water (e.g 2%, 0.2%, 0.02%, and 0.002%).
Remove a 1 mL aliquot of cells from each tube, centrifuge at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 30 s and aspirate the supernatant. Freeze the pellet at -20°C as a zero time point sample.
Add arabinose to the five 9 mL cultures according to the following table.

As seen in Figure 30, the number of colonies found after drying and rehydrating the bacteria (BL21(DE3)) with the TDPs is considerably larger than that for the empty vector of the same bacterial strain (1 vs. 103-104). This proves that the survival of bacteria is greatly enhanced by the presence of the three TDPs in the cells and complies with the results from Boothby et al. 2017 .
However, a closer look at the differences in trend between the samples washed with water and PBS reveals a modest increase in the survival of bacteria with plasmids for the production of cytosolic abundant proteins (CAHS) and a decrease for the secretory abundant protein SAHS 33020, which proves that either the proteins or the mechanism by which the protection is conferred are affected by the media used to resuspend.
Preserving Cas13a activity with TDPs
After evaluating the influence of TDPs on the desiccation tolerance of LDH, an established procedure, we wanted to assess their protective performance with Cas13a. Our lattice model indicated that it was best to use CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 to preserve Cas13a activity at a concentration of 1 g/L or higher. Furthermore, it was observed previously that these two TDPs preserved LDH activity after drying and subsequent rehydration, even after several weeks.
Both CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 were dried with Cas13a in a concentration of 1 g/L, as the protein purification yielded low concentrations for SAHS 33020. Subsequently, Cas13a was rehydrated and its activity measured via an RNase alert fluorescence assay . All measurements were performed in duplicate.
Figure 31: Cas13a activity with CAHS (94205) (a) and SAHS (33020) (b) in RNase Alert assay after drying and rehydration. SAHS 33020 and CAHS 94205 were dried with Cas13a and then combined with the target. Additionally, the fluorescence activity of the same sample without target, as well as a Cas13a sample with target, but dried without TDPs was measured. Cas13a with the respective TDP and the target without previous drying were used"

Killing test
I Background
    From our orthogonality test, we find that no matter how we construct, warrior I can’t fulfill our desire that it is only killed by warrior II but not itself. However, our orthogonality test uses RFP to represent the level of LacI, thus representing the killing effect. We want to find out if it is really the case in our warriors, so we construct our warriors and carry out the killing test.
II Experimental design
    To test how our warriors kill the enemies and if they kill themselves, we let equal amounts of the two kinds of warriors to grow together, with the warriors growing separately as negative controls. We attach different fluorescent proteins to different warriors in order to differentiate them. We compare the killing effect of the warriors by monitoring the ratio of the two kinds of the warriors.
    To test how efficient our warriors can kill the enemies, we do a gradient experiment. We let warriors and beggars from different sides to grow together with different starting ratios,with beggars growing alone as negative controls. The warriors and beggars from different sides are attached to different fluorescent proteins. We monitor the change of the amount of beggars with time to see how the killing effect is.
III Methods
    1. Construct our warriors and beggars by co-transformation. (the gene circuits are as follows)

Our plan was to have a final product composed of the microcystinase and lysozyme. If we had obtained results of the quantification of produced MlrA, we would have tested the degradation of microcystins from an actual microcystin contaminated lake water sample by supplementing the sample with known MlrA and cyanobacteria-lysing lysozyme.
MC Yeast - the conclusions
After experimentally  testing our stress promoters, the CCP1 promoter in particular showed promise for development as an oxidative stress sensor.  It produced a large relative increase in YFP when induced, and had a low base level of expression.
Our simulations support the hypothesis that transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7 play a crucial role in the immediate response of the cell against oxidative stress. This means that promoters relying on these transcription factors, such as our CCP1 promoter, would be rapidly activated by oxidative stress. Therefore, our promoters proved to be good candidates for future development of sensor applications.
Based on our results, MlrA has great potential for production and purification in an active form in both E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Additional experiments should be done to find the optimal chassis and conditions to acquire maximal yields of highly active enzyme.
“Our model confirms that Yap1p and Skn7p seem to play a crucial role in the immediate response of the cell against oxidative stress”

Second meeting - Epistemology
In our second meeting we tried to work out what the special epistemological characteristics of an applied science are [5]. We expounded the general epistemological problems and possibilities of an engineering discipline. We noticed that causal knowledge and natural laws are not the main aim of an engineering discipline. Rather, the main aim is for efficient maxims and sufficient rules: In order to judge a technological system we only refer to it's efficiency -  we just see if something works or not. In the epistemology of technological sciences the concept of efficiency plays a similar role to that which the concept of truth plays in the epistemology pure sciences, since scientific theories are judged by their truth value. Therefore, if the synthetic biology aspires to define itself as an engineering discipline, then the aim of knowledge-making is necessarily non-substantial [6].

Third meeting - Procedure
After asserting that synthetic biology follows an ‘intentional epistemology’, we analysed the conceptual procedure of synthetic biology. In view of the fact that the synthetic biology aims to create life, a consistent definition of the phenomena of life is needed, in order to have a reasonable goal ([7],[8]). Interestingly, the conception of life in synthetic biology matches with the settled purposes [9]. The understanding of life is adjusted to the notion of things that humans can make, modify and comprehend. Thus, the field of synthetic biology approaches biological systems as technological systems ([10],[11]). In this context, the analogical transfer from technological properties into the realm of the living can be understood as the epistemological program of synthetic biology. This transfer"

During his talk, Dr. McBain explained the role of biofilms in infections and how they confer ABR. He talked to us about persister cells and their importance in the recalcitrance of biofilms to antibiotic treatment. Hence, in the project design, we looked at agents that specifically target these sessile, metabolically inactive persister cells and decided on Art-175 as one of our antibacterial agents.
Professor Timothy K. Lu, from the Synthetic Biology Group at MIT recommended that we use endogenous anti-biofilm agents rather than designing them bottom up. He said that our idea to use synthetic biology as a means of fighting UTIs and ABR was “interesting” but raised to us the the problem of our bacteria being subject to resistance mechanisms depending on the agents used, but that we could overcome this by exploring combinatorial therapies.
During the summer, we also gave two talks, one at the termly Corpus Christi College Biochemistry talks and another to a group of alumni from the Oxford Biochemistry department. Again, the feedback we received in terms of our project idea was positive and our idea was described as “ambitious but achievable”. Max Crispin, Oxford Glycoprotein Therapeutics Laboratory raised the issue of whether the protein s we planned on secreting would be immunogenic. We explored this, and similar issues, in a report we wrote about the urinary biome . Another question we were faced with concerned the issue of whether our solution would make fungal infections more likely. This issue is addressed in the Futher Considerations section.
Return to the public
Having investigated the feasibility of our idea, we approached the public again to seek their opinion. The idea working on paper is one thing, but having the support of the public and the patients who would be using our solution is another aspect entirely.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
We asked the public, “If you had the option of using two treatments for an infection, where one was antibiotics and one was bacteria that were designed to cure the infection, which would you choose?”
The majority (70%) of the people we surveyed said that they would take the advice of their doctor on this. This reinforced to us the importance of nurses and doctors backing our project idea. However, encouragingly, of those who wouldn't take the advice of their doctor, our treatment was favourite with just under half saying they would prefer the designed"

Research
We have begun preliminary research and development of our product. Thus far, we have expressed, purified and stored one of the proteins (protein A) with which we will develop BEAR. Currently, we are in the process of expressing our second protein (Protein B) of interest. We cannot release the names of the proteins at this time in order to protect our intellectual property.
Figure 1. Overexpression 15% SDS-PAGE of Protein A.        It is approximately 32 kDa in size though it appears to be appoximately 35 kDa in size.
Figure 2. Overexpression 15% SDS-PAGE of Protein B. The overexpression was not successful under the conditions we used. We will conduct several test expressions at lower temperature, lower IPTG concentration, and induce expression at different cell concentrations.

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.

Sorting cells - A method is needed to sort cells by their ability to bind the venom proteins
- One such method would be to have the cells secrete their anti-venom proteins and then flood the cells with venom. The best cells would survive and the weak ones would be killed. However, this may cause the production of proteins that bind the venom components that are less dangerous such as phospholipases and oxidases. It would be more important for the anti-venom to inhibit the neuro-muscular disruptive proteins
- One effective method would be to use Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting, which is able to sort cells by their fluorescence. See: http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/method/FACS.html
- This would require a system that expresses a fluorescent reporter in response to the binding of venom proteins to the cell-surface proteins, but I cannot be too specific until I know how the anti-venom proteins are going to be expressed
- Yet another method would cause the death of any cells that do not bind to the venom with high enough affinity - it would be similar to the methods employed in T-cell selection in eukaryotic immune systems, but would be more tricky as it has to occur in a bacterium
- The ideal then, would be to have all the cells that have little or no binding affinity killed, and then those that do bind express GFP so that the fluorescence can be quantified and the binding can be rated
- Again, I'd need to understand the anti-venom proteins before I could suggest any particular systems
- Perhaps a second species of bacteria could be used to express the venom proteins on their surface, and come into contact with the anti-venom producing cells, causing contact-dependant stimulation, so that those that interact by the venom-antivenom complexes will be stimulated to divide whilst the remaining cells will potentially be killed See: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085179 (Text by Frank)
In vivo mutagenesis
- we need a method for random mutagenesis of peptides to create high affinity binding proteins to the multiple components of venom
- PCR based mutagenesis is namely used for site directed mutagenesis and has several biases that make it not ideal for random mutation
- in vivo homologous recombination inherent to yeast can be exploited for protein mutagenesis

We contacted Jacqueline Brooks, the Events Manager from GSCC, to see whether the organization would be interested in such event and what they would like to get out of it. Jacqueline was enthusiastic about our offer and told us they wanted to get more girls involved in STEM, particularly in engineering. Over the course of the next few months, we worked together to organize the event and publicize it. We planned to have the event run from 9:00 to 12:00 in the Integrated Science Center at William & Mary. Jacqueline handled contacting participants and getting people enrolled in the event, while we organized the activities, program, and event volunteers. There was a total enrollment of about 75 Girl Scouts and about 20 parents. We organized the event so we could split the girls into 5 groups based on age, and each group was led by a member of the iGEM team and two other student volunteers. We made our program of activities by starting with concepts from engineering and then showing how we can apply them to biology. Below was our schedule for the day:
8:45-9:00: Check in, distribute name tags, and have parents sign photo release forms for their girls.
9:00-9:15: Presentation in the auditorium. Introduce synthetic biology and the program for the day, and then split the girls into five groups based on their grade level.
9:20-9:50: Circuit Design: Students practiced designing simple electrical circuits, and how adjusting different parts of the circuit can have an effect on the output (a green LED). We later discussed how parts of the circuit are (or are not) analogous to parts of a gene.
9:50-10:10: Twizzler DNA: Students learned about the structure and role of DNA by building it out of candy.
10:10-10:30: Lego Genes: We presented the scenario of having a high concentration of lead present in our drinking water. Students had to think about how to build a biological circuit (combining the idea of the electrical circuit and DNA) that could be used to address the problem. Students worked with Legos as a way to visualize the different components of a gene, such as the promoter, RBS, protein-coding region, and double terminator.
10:30-11:00: Gel Electrophoresis: Students learned about the lab techniques that enable scientists to create something like a biological circuit. We helped students run gels using dyes and discussed the role of gel electrophoresis in a synthetic biology lab.

Clearly, there was not much improvement for either.  Also note that now there is only 18 uL left, since 2 uL was used to do the ligation.
Also decided to transform some of Caroline's parts tonight, seeing as P0501 had been so successful.  It turns out that some of the plasmid solution had stuck to the caps inside the tubes containing them, so that by pounding the tube against the table it was possible to accumulate at least 2 uL of liquid in most cases.  At first, began transformation of all 38 parts, but realized that this was impossible given the amount of plates available in the fridge (50 plates).  Since it was necessary to use two plates per transformation as a safeguard, this would allowfor 23 parts, including two for a positive control and two for a negative control.  Thus, decided to transform the first 20 parts on the list sent by Caroline, which correspond to parts that we hope to use for our tests.  These parts are:

From Sinusoids to Square Waves
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Sinusoidal waves have been generated and characterized in several circuits employing various topologies so far, including single cell oscillators, small colony synchronized quorum sensing based oscillators, wide range synchronized oscillators (that synchronize over different channels inside a microfluidic chamber), and even mammalian oscillators. Thus, we used these as a starting point in our project, and thought of ways to transform this sinusoid, so as to generate a square wave.
After brainstorming, basic modeling and simulations, and discussing several possible topologies (which have been linked below), we finally found the 5 node ring topology with our design modifications to be the best solution to the problem.
The basic topology for the system was inspired by the 3 node repressilator, which basically had repressors arranged in a cyclic fashion, where one represses the second, the second represses the third, and the third represses the first. The same schematic, with an even number addition to the number of nodes can generate oscillations, as has been shown by several groups in the literature. Thus, we employed a novel 5 node system in the same fashion, with our design modifications, in order to get the square waves to work.
For this transformation from “y = sin (t)” to “y = square(t)” (as MATLAB calls it), the major strategies for conversion, and how our 5 node oscillator employs these to generate square waves have been outlined below.
Graded to Digital Response – High Cooperativity
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The first issue that we identified was that sine waves go up and come down in a slow fashion; slower than what we would want in our square waves. Thus, the first thing to do was to increase the rate of the response, by employing a mechanism wherein the repressors act quickly, and only after a certain point. This would make rise and fall times faster.
As mentioned in the earlier section as well, cooperativity is the property of a repressor that"

We searched for a way to change the lense and have the more control possible on it and we found that the easiest way was to remove the initial lense, put a CS mount on it and attach a much bigger lense.
We found some cheap lense online (~45$) and we did the mounting.
 
The first thing is to unplug the camera module from the PCB, once it's done you need to remove the lense carefully by unscrewing it.
You will then see the camera detector.
 
You can then screw the CS mount on the board and plug the lense in.

roGFP2-Orp1 MICHAELIS EQUATION MODEL
Purpose
In the previous model, we successfully obtained the relationship between intracellular H2O2 concentration and extracellular H2O2 concentration. Therefore, we were going                     to establish the                     relationship between intracellular H2O2 concentration and roGFP2-Orp1 in                     order to evaluate the                     antioxidant function signal output of our entire system.
Model Hypothesis
1. The roGFP2-Orp1 is a fusion protein, and Orp1 is a catalase. Therefore, the reaction process of                     the protein with H2O2 can be considered as a classical enzymatic reaction                     meaning that this                     reaction is a  roGFP2-Orp1 Michaelis equation Model, and the oxidation state of roGFP2 is one of the reaction products.
2. The total intracellular concentration of roGFP2 is constant. And roGFP2 has two states,                     oxidative state and reductive state. And the intracellular protein concentration is depended on the                     transcription rate of promoter.
3. The two absorption peak values of roGFP2 at 405 nm and 488 nm are linear with the protein                     concentration in two states.
Model analysis and construction
According to Hypothesis 1, we consider the reaction process of intracellular hydrogen peroxide with                     roGFP2 as an enzymatic reaction process, which is consistent with the roGFP2-Orp1 Michaelis equation Model.
$$V=\frac{v_{max}[H_{2}O_{2}]}{K_{m}+[H_{2}O_{2}]}$$
Here we define a new parameter OxDroGFP2 to reflect the degree of oxidation of                     roGFP2.                     Meanwhile,"

Social
Demographics are changing towards a more environmentally concerned generation.
Society has different attitudes towards the environment. In particular, Swedish society is one of the most sustainable countries in the world.
Communities connected to the municipal WWTPs are concerned about the cost. There are available techniques to clean the water to the point of converting it into drinkable water; however, these communities are reluctant and assume they would have to economically assume the implementation of these techniques (Study visit T Mörn 30 Jul 2018).
Municipal WWTPs’ management shows a socially responsible behavior and wishes to offer better services as long as they do not feel they are wasting money (Study visit J Olsson 15 Aug 2018).
Experts in the field would like to see cheaper, more straightforward (Study visit P Gruvstedt 18 Sept 2018) and universal techniques in the market (Personal communication M Ryen 7 Sept 2018).
Around a quarter of a million households are not connected to the municipal water or sewage systems, 90% of these are houses for leisure purposes which are not used regularly [10].
There has been a suggestion of having an environmental marking or label on the pharmaceuticals packaging, or to influence their manufacturing to adapt it to some environmental protection actions (Personal communication S Rosenborg 10 Sept 2018).
Clinical Pharmacologist from Huddinge Hospital foresees a future regulation implementation during the upcoming 10-20 years (Personal communication S Rosenborg 10 Sept 2018).
Technological
Increasing R&D development.
Healthcare field is evolving with new treatment techniques that might decrease the use of pharmaceuticals.
There are emerging advanced techniques as well as technologies under development to treat pharmaceuticals [16].
There is a need for a cost-efficient technology that decreases the energy consumption levels and the use of chemicals in comparison with existing solutions (Study visit M Ryen 25 Sept 2018) [16].
The numbers of liquid/solid separation toilets are increasing as a measure to fight this problem [10].
Legal
Since Sweden entered European Union (EU) in 1995, EU directives have gradually been incorporated into national legislation, by the Swedish EPA and the Environmental Assessment Ordinance, within the framework of the Environmental Code and its ordinances and regulations [10].
The EU is currently reviewing the water regulations to unify them. In "

iGEMer- we met, exchanged, shared, and learned from each other. As an iGEM team we’ve collaborated with other teams on several occasions.
Workshop
During brainstorming，we invited Dr. Zhang Haoqian to give a speech and other iGEM teams to exchange the ideas. Dr. Zhang Haoqian shared his experience and give us some advice. We discussed how we brainstormed our topic, how we recruit members, and what difficulties have we experienced so far.
We get to catch a glimpse of the progress and concoct of other teams through experience workshops.
Taiwan- 5th Asia-Pacific
iGEM Conference
The iGEM team NCTU_Formosa hosted us together with the other iGEMs' teams at a wonderful event, the ""Mini Jamboree"", simulating the iGEM competition itself, with judges, presentations, speeches and more.
Through various breakout sessions and discussion, we learn different projects from individual teams across Asia, ranging from detection and degradation of EDCs(Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals) in farmland to water cleanliness for aquaculture. We cluster around posters asking questions that pop in our minds.

NCTU_Formosa aims to use database to find effective and also harmless anti-fungal peptides，with IoT forecast system to save fungus-infected plants. They was creating an E.coli expression system for their project and we were doing our own research for a yeast factory.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," more powerful and accurate sensor.
The next step was to design and order DNA for all the parts of the other two biosensor systems that were not present in the registry. The strategy was to order the DNA for each part such that it could either be submitted to the iGEM registry in biobrick format in pSB1C3 or PCR primers could be used to put it into RDP assembly format. With this in mind, we created the following separate parts and submitted them to the registry:
AI-2 system- parts involved in the detection of AI-2:
K1799000        pLsrA-2  
K1799001        LsrK ORF
K1799002        LsrR ORF
Nitrogen detection system:
K1799015        pYeaR (twin to BBa_K216005  which was not available)
K1799016        NsrR, repressor of pYeaR
Modularization of parts involved in the transport of AI-2 into the cell. We theorized that if we could somehow control expression of components of the  transport system  that perhaps the sensitivity of the AI-2 biosensor could be increased or decreased. Furthermore, we submitted parts representing both the transport system components as the occur naturally, with embedded RBS and overlapping reading frames, and also the whole system engineered as modularized components with all internal signals eliminated. The intent was to test both iterations of the system to see which performed better and was easier to titrate.

Clonings of basic parts: FucO only and GSH only.
In order to be able to grow colonies of DH5α with our first and second basic parts, we’ve ligated them to pSB1C3 backbone with a ratio of 1:3. Then, we’ve transformed the                  ligations to DH5α competent cells and grew colonies on LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol at a final concentration of 40 µg/ml. After obtaining DH5α colonies, we’ve              done colony PCR and considered the results which led us to the conclusion that colony no: 4 from FucO (figure 1 and figure 3) and no: 8 from GSH (figure 2) have given the best results.
Thus, we’ve done plasmid isolation for basic 1 from the 4th colony and for basic 2 from the 8th colony, followed by PCR to confirm our results.

In the gel image below, the band on the 5th well (starting with ladder) demonstrates our correctly inserted gene in pSB1C3 backbone. In this PCR, we’ve used FucO left and VR primers to check the orientation of our part in backbone. Expected band length to see was 625 bp and the results were obtained.

Parameter Space Analysis
Recall that the equations of our system are as follows (see Equations page for parameter definitions):
We wrote a program which takes the equations for our system, calculates the nullclines and records whether or not bistability is achieved. Whether or not bistability is achieved depends strongly on the parameters  λi, Ki, μi and ni.
The values for the parameters λi, Ki and μi were taken from literature [1]-[13] but have a large uncertainty attached to them. To take this uncertainty into account we selected each parameter value randomly from a range of two orders of magnitude around the literature value for each parameter. We knew that n2 was between 1 and 3 and n4=1. This is due to the number of stem loops on the two DNA strands (see Fig 1 in Equations ). The strand associated with GFP has two stem loops. A protein can bind to one stem loop and this can then hinder the binding of a protein to the second stem loop (thus making n2 less than 2 but more than 1) or encourage the binding of a protein to the second stem loop (thus making n2 more than 2 but less than 3). The strand associated with the CFP has only one stem loop and thus n4=1. Please see Determination of the Hill coefficient n2 for an explanation on how we narrowed down the value for n2.
We ran the program for various combinations of Hill coefficients (ni) between 1 and 5. Each time the program was run, the Hill coefficients remained constant but the other parameters varied.
Choosing the parameters in this way meant that each time the program was run we would sometimes achieve a combination of parameters that allowed bist"

Results from 15 July 2013 -  We got our results from the titer test last time on the M9 and LB lysis inhibition test. For the LB plates, we got 9 plaques on the 10^-10 plate, for a total of 9x10^12 pfus/mL.  We were extremely excited about these results.  The M9 was significantly less (we sort of expected this because we could not induce lysis as well with chloroform) with no plaques on the 10^-9.  The spot tests confirmed these results (plaques on 10^-10 for the LB and plaques only down to 10^-6 for M9).
Today I did another round of mutagenesis using the lysis inhibition technique.  I did two flasks.  The first flask had 20 ug/mL of adenine which was added with the bacteria and 25 mL of LB broth; the second flask had 40 ug/mL of adenine added with the bacteria and 25 mL of LB broth.  Both flasks incubated at 37C on the shaker for 3.5 hrs until slightly turbid.  I then added 200 ug/mL of bromodeoxyuridine, 20 ug/mL of uracil, and .5 mL of phage to flask one; I added 400 ug/mL of bromodeoxyuridine, 40 ug/mL of uracil, and .5 mL of phage to flask two.  They incubated in the same location for 3 hours.

Project: Magneto-bacter vinelandii Magnetosome-forming Azotobacter vinelandii with Downstream Applications  
In our collaboration work with the Chinese University of Hong Kong iGEM team, we were given the task to assist them with their project by doing a simulation that look into the interaction between GFP-nanobody to different concentrations of GFP. It is our honor to be able to collaborate and participate in their project. A wonderful experience we have gained through.
Background
The project of the CUHK iGEM team is to explore the use of magnetosome together with GFP-specific nanobody for immunoprecipitation. Magnetosome is an organelle with a magnetic iron crystal surrounded by a lipid bilayer. It is derived from magnetotactic bacteria which is used for navigation through sensing the Earth magnetic field. Biomolecules such as antibodies can be immobilized on magnetosomes for various scientific applications. One such applications is using magnetosomes together with nanobodies for immunoprecipitation reactions. To make the experiment measurable, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-specific nanobody was used (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Schematic diagram of a magnetosome (adsorbed with GFP-specific nanobodies) interacting with GFPs
Task
Simulate the binding dynamics of a fixed concentration of magnetosome with GFP specific nanobody expressed on its surface in different initial concentrations of antigens (GFP). 
Calculation
Software - SimBiology
SimBiology is a toolbox in Matlab that enable us to model and simulate the dynamics of the association and dissociation between molecules. Most of the function can be utilized through its GUI (Graphical User Interface).
Once the model is constructed (i.e. the mathematic relationships between molecules are set up, parameters such as association constant, molarity of reagent, etc. are provided), we can simulate the reaction or even scan through one or more variables. The “scan” function enables us to simulate the dynamics of the system when some parameters, such as the initial concentration of the reagent, are at different values.

Uptake of Cellobiose
While cellulose is too large to be pass the cell membrane, transportation of cellobiose is a common feature found in many organisms. An example is E. coli, which utilises the membrane protein lactose permease (LacY) Sekar R, Shin HD, Chen R.

Degradation of Cellobiose to Glucose
Through evolutionary events, many organisms have developed the ability to express enzymes, capable of breaking the β-linkage in cellobiose. E. coli expresses the periplasmic β-glucosidase encoded by the bglX gene, which is known to have said feature, hydrolysing the cellobiose β-linkage UniProt entry for bglX . Saccharophagus degradans expresses a different enzyme, which efficiently cleaves the β-linkage in cellobiose, namely cellobiose phosphorylase encoded by the cep94A gene. This enzyme phosphorylates the cellobiose at its β-linkage, resulting in the degradation of cellobiose to

2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
did you document these issues in the Registry?
how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
How could other teams learn from your experience?
Currently, none of the BioBricks we have made (or are planning to make) raise any specific safety issues. For example, we do not plan to create BioBricks that encode for toxic proteins, and neither do we intend to extend the environmental range of a cell chassis; in fact, by developing a protocol for markerless insertion, we're trying to do the exact opposite (i.e. make engineered bacteria not resistant to antibiotics)!
All BioBricks should be fully documented in the Registry, and any pertinent safety issues are noted should they be seen to exist. On the other hand, the iGEM project timescale is insufficient for current techniques to conduct thorough analysis of BioBrick characteristics such as genetic reliability and performance reliability, and it is often the case that even parts that are fully documented do not perform as they should. Hence, it is important that work outside iGEM continue to make use of and add to the documentation in the Registry for safety concerns.
It is also important to create a centralised forum for discussion on safety issues, such that teams can learn from the experiences of others. This would also allow for the development of software that would integrate safety and security aspects into the design process such that the designer is automatically informed of possible safety problems.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
Yes, there is a biosafety committee at the University of Edinburgh. At the beginning of the project, we were required to fill out a risk assessment form for Health and Safety at the University of Edinburgh. We had to provide details about the recipient micro-organism (E. coli), any genetic material we would be adding into the recipient micro-organism, and the vectors we might use, with regards to the bacterial systems, the risks to health and safety for humans, the nature of the work, the associated risk for the environment, their respective classification and containment measures"

Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," Oxygen levels were constrained to an uptake rate of 10 mmolgDW -1h-1 [7].
Results and Discussion
Figure 15 Maximum E.coli BL21 growth rates on different Energy Sources.
Figure 15 shows the growth rates of E.coli BL21 on different energy/carbon sources. From the Figure it can be seen that using Glucose or Ascorbate as substrate, the bacteria have high flux values that represent the growth rate (hr-1). These varying growth rates are obtained because each substrate is metabolized specifically, giving varying reactant starting values for the survival reaction to use. These results indicate that the bacteria could robustly grow on various dietary energy/carbon sources in the human gut and thus the diet could be designed accordingly for adequate growth of bacteria to constantly produce the compound of interest (L-DOPA and Dopamine).
Figure 16 L-DOPA (Blue) and Dopamine (Red) production at maximum growth rate of E.coli BL21 at different Energy Sources. The values shown are the synthesis rate of compounds in mmol gram of dry cell weight per hour (mmolgDW -1h-1).
Figure 16 shows the results of L-DOPA synthesized by the bacteria on different carbon sources. These results are dependent on Figure 15, as the survival reaction was then constrained to the maximum growth rate that yields out of particular carbon source. From this Figure, it could be seen that, apart from when glucose is used as substrate, there was no positive flux value obtained and hence no L-DOPA was produced on other substrates. These results indicate that apart from glucose no other energy sources are suitable for production of significant levels of L-DOPA and dopamine. This is because the necessary metabolites (L-Tyrosine which is also important substrate to produce L-DOPA and dopamine) were used up for the survival reaction. As this reaction was constrained to the flux that resembles the maximum growth rate, more weight is given to the survival reaction and thus, no L-DOPA or Dopamine was produced in the BL21 model. Since glucose as energy source produced the highest growth rate, there were enough metabolites in the model required to L-produce L-DOPA and Dopamine. This was not the case for other sources and hence, there was no DOPA or dopamine produced.
From the same Figure, it could be seen that same levels (same flux values of L-DOPA and Dopamine) are predicted to be produced even though the enzymes that catalyses both the reaction are different and thus the outcome could be expected to differ"

SECRETION OF RNAIII INHIBITING PEPTIDE
We wanted our interface to produce a protein that would inhibit the development of Staphylococcus aureus in the environment of the implant, and we wanted this peptide (RNA III inhibiting peptide) to be secreted from cytoplasm to the extracellular medium.
We decided to modify the Biobrick BBa_K237002 from iGEM SDU-Denmark 2009 Team. This Biobrick enables expression of RNAIII inhibiting peptide, we improved it by adding a secretion signal peptide to adress RIP to Escherichia coli Type II Secretion System and optimizing it for our chassis E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain.
Following the advice of Dr. Jean-Michel Betton, Research Director in the Structural Biology Department at the Institut Pasteur, we chose to try two different signal sequences to export our peptides, which he knew about and which are known to be efficient: MalE and DsbA. Once in the periplasm, due to the small size of RIP (7 amino acids), a leaky release through the outer membrane of the bacteria should allow us to obtain RIP in the medium [6].

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#human practice#start-up kit#report_-_-_TEXT.html," the third biggest contributors, scoring 145 and 143 times respectively, taking 10% each of the entire projects. Books and Business were the least popular types, only 26 and 22 of them done in the past six years.
Though the results were somewhat expected, the question why talks, surveys and workshops are much more popularly done still needed to be answered. The most likely reason would be that these are the types of projects that involve direct interaction with the public. The sole purpose of human practice is to expose the idea of synthetic biology out to the society, and the three types mentioned above fulfil the mission in a most obvious way.
Teams introduce their projects by holding conferences, observe and analyse people’s knowledge and perspective on synthetic biology by conducting surveys, and provide the opportunity for people to witness their working environment and attain hands on experience by giving lab tours and various workshops. Moreover, in order to discuss the current development and future applications of synthetic biology, teams write articles and post it on websites to allow interested groups to gain access and obtain knowledge.
In contrast, types like books and business seems not yet fully developed comparatively. Similar reason can be implied. It seems harder to get in touch with the public by writing and publishing a handbook or children’s book, since the number of copies made by each team limits the access. Though constructing a business plan may provide a base ground for future introduction of their product, it makes little contribution to the society in a short term. Nevertheless, all these types should not be discouraged, for they may have dramatic impact in the future.
Projects Done for Each Type in Each Region
   Fig 3.Percentage of projects done for each type in each region
It can also be concluded from the graph that Latin America, compared to other regions, have higher interest in holding workshops. Europe on the other hand, shows a higher percentage in using social media platforms as a form of Human Practice project. The teams in Asia are more comfortable with conducting survey than the other regions. The European and North American teams shows to have higher consideration in writing an article comparatively than Asia and Latin America.
When it comes to other types of projects such as business, books, visit investigation, game, video and art, there cannot be a definite conclusion which can affect the whole point of this section. This is mainly due to the low percentage or amount of these type of projects being made. So to wrap it up, the teams in each regions have their own preference in how to deliver their human practice projects.

IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," circuits. A square wave generator could be used as a genetic clock, since square waves lie at the heart of clocks. Further, these clocks could be used in any cellular system to time particular events.
Characterising gene regulatory network nodes through impulses
This could be used to study correlation between two genes, by coupling one of the genes to the oscillator, then observe the dynamics of the second gene. In this manner, the effect of one gene on the others could be studied.
Periodic Drug delivery
Like diabetic patients, insulin needs to be provided externally through injections or other means. Our oscillator system could be used as a patch containing bacteria that are oscillating to produce square levels of insulin to the patient once. This then would deliver insulin automatically at intervals, guided by our system .Further when the requirement for insulin would be high, the amount of insulin being delivered to them could be changed through some source which could dive a change in frequency of the oscillations (future applications could be focused on engineering frequency modulation).
Metabolic Switching
A bacterial species could be engineered to produce levels of the permease for a particular sugar in the form of a square wave. Thus, at varying intervals of time, the permease (say lac permease) would be expressed, which would cause the bacteria to start metabolizing lactose. When it goes off, the bacteria would not express the lac permease and consume glucose. In this manner, we could tune the frequency of the oscillations to ensure metabolic switching and activation of pathway shunts in the manner that we want.
Temporal Barcodes
If we can control the frequency of the oscillations and modulate the time spent by the wave in the ON and OFF state (which is basically a function of the frequency itself), we could generate a combination of 0’s and 1’s, in order to generate a bar code. This bar code would be read in time, and therefore would be a temporal bar code. A typical example of this would be to encode the word “iGEM” by 11001001, where 1 represents an ON state for say, 20 minutes. Thus, an 11 response, which represents the letter i, would then be read if the fluorescence stays on for 40 minutes. In this fashion, our device could be used for encryption of data.
For memory storage
The system could be used as the bacterial analogue of memory storage. The base of the oscillations could be called the 0 bit, and the high point could be called the 1 bit, and these combinations of 0 and 1 bits could be used to store short term"
