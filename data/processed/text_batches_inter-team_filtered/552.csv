Relative criteria
We only want azurin to be produced in the situation of a high lactate level (5 mM) and high bacterial cell density (5% density). This means that we want to maximize the ratio of azurin production in (high lactate, high density) state compared to the production in (low lactate, low density) state, or (low lactate, high density) and (high lactate, low density) states. To assess whether our system is good enough, we will set these quantified criteria:
Criteria for a functional circuit: percentage of maximum Azurin expression allowed in each condition
We have to keep in mind that these criteria are very arbitrary, and that their primary goal is to guide us in the engineering of our bacterial strain. They are not based on measured toxicity level of azurin, as azurin is already quite specific for tumor cells, therefore relying on such toxicity data could lead us to be allowed to express more azurin in healthy tissues, because it would not be less toxic there either way.
Absolute azurin expression
As the colonizing bacterial population is concentrated in a small shell inside of the tumor (which represent only a fraction of the tumor volume) and is at most occupying 5% of the space there, we can already anticipate that it will have to synthetize the highest amount of azurin possible to be able to kill the most tumor cells possible. However, as we have no idea about the effective expression of azurin in E. coli cells, we can only relate it to the expression of another protein in our circuit. As the azurin will be expressed on the same operon than luxI, an enzyme taking part into the bacterial cell density sensing, we can try to get a sense of how stronger must be the expression of azurin in regards to luxI to reach a given arbitrary azurin concentration.
This way, we'll know whether our circuit leads intrinsically to high expressions of the luxI-azurin operon (the expression level of azurin compared to luxI will not be that high in this case), or on the contrary weak expressions of this operon (in this case the expression of azurin will have to be much higher than the one of luxI to reach the target concentration).
We take as a reference value for azurin concentration 1 mM (absolute maximum of concentration of a given protein that can be achieved in E.coli [5] )."

miRNA2911 ( BBa_K1860700 )
Aim
Our goal was to use synthetic biology to produce miRNA2911, which is endogenously expressed in Lonicera japonica.
Results
We were able to construct a Biobrick (BBa_K1860700) that contains the anti-viral miRNA2911. The Biobrick was validated by sequencing.
Design of Oligos
We started our project by designing oligos of the miRNA2911. It was really important to consider that the desired sequence had to be in line with the iGEM standard, meaning that the resulting Biobrick can be used for 3A-Assemblies later on. Hence the miRNA2911 is flanked by the appropriate restriction sites (EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI). Depicted in Figure 1 are the designed sequences.
Annealing of Oligos
In the next step the oligos needed to be annealed. We used the standard ‘Annealing Protocol’ and the figure depicts the results of this annealing. The appropriate bands of the resulted miRNA2911 insert are at 61 bp.
Ligation
After confirmation of successful annealing we proceeded with the ligation of the insert (miRNA2911) into the standard backbone pSB1C3. For this purpose the linearized backbone (pSB1C3) was cut with EcoRI and PstI and the insert was ligated into the vector. The insert does not need to be cut, as it was designed to form overhangs after annealing.
Shown in the following figure is the verification of ligation. The ligation was verified positively, as the ligated vector runs at 2050 bp and the control sample, only containing pSB1C3, runs at around 2000 bp, as seen in the agarose gel.
Following, the ligated product was transformed into the E.coli strain DH5α. Single colonies were picked, liquid cultures were grown overnight and plasmids were prepped.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"Lab on Wheels
How do you show the public what research is like, when you can not invite tons of people into the lab? You go out and find a place where people gather and take the lab there! The 10th of August the human practices team took a table, some agar plates, a microscope and ingredients for extracting DNA from a fruit and went to one of the most crowded streets in Stockholm. We started experimenting, and lots of people stopped by and showed interest in what we did. The main focus was to show how easily accessible research is, but we also talked about our project and what we are doing in the lab. Some of the comments and questions we got were: “This is really interesting!”, “I will try this [the fruit DNA extraction] at home with the kids.” “Forensics extracts DNA from hair, do they use the same procedure?” “What can you do with the DNA when it is extracted?”
We got a chance to talk to a diverse group of people; different ages, cultures and occupations. Somehow we also stumbled across Mojdeh R. Tabari, who works in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
ISO collaboration - standardization of clean water
“You did an important job. Your work will be used as an example for the other students. At the end the students who attended the meeting were very interested in establishment of another SSS. [...] You started an important work that can serve as an example for the other students in the world.” - Mojdeh R. Tabari
After meeting with Britta Hedlund at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we understood that there is no standardized way of measuring and detect sulfamethoxazole and other pharmaceuticals in the water from wastewater treatment plants, rivers and seas. We then happened to meet Mojdeh R. Tabari, microbiologist and secretary for several boards in the International Standardization Organisation (ISO). Mojdeh gave us the opportunity to be the first group of students creating a Standard Student Society (SSS) and establishing a technical committee for ISO, for the purpose to provide a foundation for future work on international standards as students. We wanted to be able to work at the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals in wastewater, and ISO gave us this opportunity.
After creating the SSS we started working on the different stages beginning with a New Working Item Proposal (NWIP), “Limit of Sulfamethoxazole in wastewater”, including how to measure and detect sulfamethoxazole in wastewater in a standardized way. Our work in SSS and the technical committee (TC) was really"
Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," correct bands and a PCR purification was performed with those three PCRs. Two of the purifications had suitable concentrations and were sent to GATC for sequencing. The Plaque Assay was repeated twice with the picked plaques that were sent in for sequencing using different dilution steps.
The results of these Plaque Assays were promising but did not show single plaques. So in order to determine the phage titer the Plaque Assay was repeated one more time. On the next day plaque PCRs have been conducted with the new Primers again with 5 chosen plaques.
3. Test constructs for Riboswitch and CYP1A2: Test constructs were designed in order to seperately test the Riboswitch of the AP and the CYP1A2 on the SP.
1)    Riboswitch test construct:
Taking the backbone of the pSB4K5 Plasmid which contains RFP and cloning the Riboswitch right infront of the RFP replacing the previous RBS. This construct enables an easy readout when adding theophylline to see whether theophylline induces the Riboswitch.
2)    CYP1A2 test construct:
Taking pSB1C3 and replacing the RFP by the CYP1A2 gene. When this construct is transformed into competent cells already containing the Theophylline PACE AP (contains the chaperone) and the substrate (caffein) is added, the activity of the enzyme can be checked.
So far the test construct have only been implemented in silico. Also all needed primers were designed and ordered.
Modeling
Calculations of medium consumption for iGEM goes green were performed and made interactive. A heatmap visualizes medium consumption, calculation of ideal turbidostat and lagoon sizes are possible. The user can annotate own experiments and compare them to others.
Heatmap with default values
Experimentation with elements of a Predcel model based on distributions instead of scalars were started. The idea is that a population of phages does not have one fitness between 0 and 1 but rather has individuals that have different fitness values. In this more complex model the concentrations have to be calculated for each phage fitness value, depending on the amount of phages that have that fitness value. The fitness distribution is changed by mutation and by selection. The first naive approach for mutation was programmed. It simply substracts a given percentage of the difference between the amount of a fitness value and the mean amount from the amount of a fitness value. Obviously this is oversimplified and will therefore be replaced"

Matt did gene-specific PCR -- touchdown-style -- on the lysis cassette. The gel results look fantastic. Pictures coming soon. Next up, adding the T7 promoters (all twelve of them) upstream of lysis.
Monday, October 10 2011
Over the weekend, Matt and Vincent figured out how the PCRs ought to work out to get the different T7 promoters upstream of the lysis cassette, which had been successfully amplified earlier last week. A helpful website indicated what the right melting temperatures should be. From there, Matt kindly took the initiative of making all 12 T7-lysis combinations via PCR. He then ran a gel and took a bunch of sweet pictures, and the results look great: no additional PCR products and some very clean bands of the right size.

Motivation
Our project is about developing a kind of novel bio-pesticides dedicated to benefiting peasants. Therefore, indispensable for us to know the current pesticides usage and the real needs among them.
Through survey, we have knew that glysphosate is one of the most common-used herbicide in China. Although it has been banned in many countries for the resistance problem and the potential toxicity to human and nature. we still hoped to get the real user experience of these kinds of chemical herbicide for further thinking what we can do to improve farmers’ farming condition. so that we could design project better to meet their demands and seek for the opportunity to bring it to the market.
Respondents
Respondents: All of respondents are local farmers.
General conditions: Most farmers have been living in northwestern region of China for many generations and most of them are senior citizens. They make their livings through farming.
Method
Because of the condition that most farmers’ literacy was not so good, we collected the information and data through the questions we asked them. The respondents were randomly selected, and this survey is based on those questions included in the questionnaire.
Survey time
From late July to early August
Contents of survey
There are 12 questions included in this questionnaire, and they are mainly consisted of questions relating to the current situation of farmers’ pesticide usage, the advantage and disadvantage of their usage.

1. Your sex is __?
2. How long have you taken up a career as a farmer?
Most answers to this question were more than 20 years, and some were between 10 to 20 years. Thus, from this question, we could acknowledge that most of farmers were really experienced farmers, and they have taken up planting for long. As those farmers lacked professional training, most farmers do farming based on the experience from their parents or relatives.

Overview
The increasing environmental pollution with plastic waste, like bottles, textiles, and injection-molded components, has created a serious risk for nature and humans. Currently over 150 million tons of plastics are produced per year, the major share being polymer polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ). With annual global production exceeding 100"

After the lysate passed, 20 mL of wash buffers of gradients 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mM imidazole were used to wash away unspecified proteins all the while using the syringe and collecting the fractions in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Finally, 20 mL of 500 mM imidazole were used to wash the his-tagged protein and the entire volume was collected in centrifuge tubes. Then 5 uL of 1x SDS loading dye were added to 5 uL of each fraction and let to incubate in 60oC water for 20 min.
-Meanwhile, the cast gel was pre-run for 20 min. on 240V before samples were added. Once the gel was prepped, the samples were added and ran for 40 min. at 240V. The gel was then stained with coomassie stain for 1 hr. and destained with H20 for 1 hr. After the gel was finished, it was imaged on GelDoc XR along with the SDS-PAGE gel of lysates from 9/19. While the gel was running, 1 mL of used Ni-NTA were added to 6-2/7-2 PUF-PIN and left to shake in the 4oC room. The same procedure for purification was followed and another SDS-PAGE gel was ran to test for purity of the protein collected.
9/23/12
-Inoculated 1 L of LB media with 5 mL of WT PUF-aGFP with 1 mL of Ampicillin and incubated at 37oC at 2:30PM to prep for protein purification.
-Checked the OD levels at 6:20PM and received a reading of 0.5530nm. Decided to incubate for longer and checked the OD at 6:50PM where it was at 0.6814nm and induction with 2 mM IPTG was done at 6:55PM. The culture was left to incubate in the 37oC room overnight.

What isour model going to achieve?
“Our model should focus on the following points:
Binding/dissociation of Cas12a protein with DNA.
Activity of gRNA in complex with Cas12a bound to DNA.
Anything to do with molecular signal? Does it affect gRNA activity/ Cas12a activity?”
How would iGEM CMUQ team collaborate and benefit the TecCEM team ?
We would characterize their plasmid. The plasmids sent would already be cloned in the backbone of pSB1C3. We would have to transform the pSB1C3 plasmids in E. coli strains and characterize the protein expressed. The TecCEM team would provide us with the size of the proteins. The type of column that would be used in the characterization would be Ni column (if available). The team would send their linearized plasmids to CMU-P then CMU-P would send the linearized plasmids to  CMU-Q. This would hopefully shorten the time taken for the plasmids to arrive.
How can TecCEM team benefit iGEM CMUQ team ?
Saliva samples from the local people would be sent and analyzed using the fluorescent device. In the project description,  “In middle eastern populations many carriers are unaware of the mutations that they can pass on to their children and the risk that their offspring are born with the disease.” . TecCEM team can help us test different ethics and populations of the world by sending saliva samples from Mexican people that are carriers of the disease.
TecCEM team would characterize the Cas12 protein. We would send the sequence cloned in pSB31C plasmid to them and they would characterize the Cas12 protein.

8.03.15
Started overnight cultures of the Sensor 6 cells from the restreaked plate
Did not add estrogen
Each overnight tube from a different colony
For the next overnight: will add 100 µL of the overnights into 2mL of fresh media & add different dilutions of estrogen then
Goal: want to see if different colonies gave consistent results
Want to see if lower dilutions of estrogen give lower readings
Made another set of starter cultures for estrogen sensor (with and without estrogen) and controls by adding a colony of each sample into 2 ml of fresh LB media. Cultures shook overnight in 37C shaker.
8.04.15
Added 20 ul of starter culture to 2 ml of fresh LB containing 2 ul of chlorophenical and 1.2 ul of kanamyacin. This was done three times for each sample. For the J23100 RFP and PelB Gaussia, however, no kanamyacin was added
7.29.15
2ml cultures consisting of 2 ul of chloramphenicol were made for J23100 RFP and J23115 RFP and left overnight in the 37C shaker.
7.30.15
Goal: To compare the fluorescence of J23100 RFP with J23115 RFP.
J23100 RFP did not show consistent results from previous data, mostly likely due to reason mentioned above. New cultures of J23100 RFP and J23115 RFP from newly streaked plates will be used to set up new cultures for measuring.
Re-tested the fluorescence of the J23115 RFP and J23100 since the first set of data from the previous day did not consist of biological replicates. However, the J23100 culture did not seem to grow well since the culture was not red. One reason could be that the plates from which the colonies were taken from were from 6.29.15 and not from the newer plate. This would explain why the fluorescence for J23100 RFP is much lower than expected, when it should be much higher than that for J23115 RFP.
8.3.15
Started three 2 ml overnight cultures, each consisting of 2 ul of chlorophenical, for  J23100 RFP and J23115 RFP
One 2ml overnight culture without chlorophenical was also made for empty MACH cells as a control.

Introduction
When the uAlberta team first started their buoyancy assays, the foremost question in their mind was: how long will it take the bacteria  containing the gas vesicles to get to the top? Seconds? Minutes? Hours? Days? To better understand this question and to find an answer, we dug out our physics textbooks and started with a very simple equation: Velocity equals the change in distance over the change in time. We knew that if we can find the velocity of the gas vesicle-producing Escherichia coli bacteria, we can use that to calculate the time it will take for the bacteria to travel a certain distance of the culture tube. At the time, there were a few options: we could take a high-resolution photo every certain interval and trace the distance travelled by a single layer of bacteria; we could measure the absorbance at different depths of the culture over time; or we could streak different levels of the tube on an agar plate and count the resulting number of individual colonies. However, none of these options were advising the initial parameters of our assay so that the E. coli containing the gas vesicles reach the top at a desired time. To understand how these parameters affected the buoyancy of our bacteria, we started by looking at the individual forces that act on these bacteria.
Model Approach by Individual Forces
Force 1) Buoyancy Force
Buoyancy is the force exerted on an object that is wholly or partly immersed in a fluid. In this case, buoyancy force is exerted on the E. coli bacteria containing the desired GVP’s.
\[  Fb = displaced\ liquid\ by\ the\ vesicle\\Fb=mg,\ \ p = \frac{m}{v}\\Fb = pV(g)\\Fb=p*\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3*g\\Fb=-\frac{4}{3}*\pi r^3*(p-p_v)*g   \]
Force 2) Drag Force
Drag Force, sometimes also called air resistance or fluid resistance, is the force acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with respect to a surrounding fluid.
\[  Fd = Cd*0.5pv^2"

At last, we used Firefly Luciferase Assay Kit to test the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signal                                         pathway.
This is the luminescence result of OR1A1.
OR1A1 biosensor evaluation with its cognate odor molecule
Here comes the most essential experiment. We infected the stable cell lines with all                                         virus to construct a super cell line, which has a high expression of the three genes.                                         Then we transfected OR1A1 and OR1D2 respectively in the super cell, and stimulated                                         with β-citronellol and bourgeonal, which can recognized by OR1A1 and OR1D2 respectively.

This week I began working on an algorithm that would search for the path with the fewest changes to the host organism. I got the algorithm to function properly but the database did not have all the organisms paired up with the reactions yet. The next steps will be to populate the database with the additional information such as reversibility of reactions and stoichiometry.

E' NOTE
Abstract
E' NOTE is an experiment recording tool specifically designed for iGEMers. It allows users to take notes, draw tables, upload images, and provides a series of templates for them. The templates are capable of some basic calculations such as enzyme digestion system and ligation systems setting, which significantly ease the burden of experiment recording. Besides, E' NOTE also provides a plasmid library which can be further constructed by users, in addition to basic information, the library can offer the data of the time of purification and breed conservation to avoid the death of strains caused by freezing for too long. The library is linked to the templates, hence, after recording the data in the library, the templates will present the data which the users recorded in the library.
E' NOTE also offers a calculation board for some basic calculations during solution configuration and a built-in E-mail sender to facilitate communication among team members. Of course, the tools provided by E' NOTE is far from complete, so E' NOTE contains a software integration board. It can integrate the software tools useful for synthetic biology experiment process on the internet. Users can easily find their desired software in this part.
The broad majority of iGEMers may often get entangled with uploading the experiment notes to the wiki by either PDF file or constructing a webpage. But it’s a pity that simple experiment notes cannot show the experimental method and thus barricade communication. If you use E' NOTE to record your experiments, simply input your"

After 120 min the Miller Units of the culture induced with 1.0 mM IPTG go down again, which might be evidence for increasing of proteolysis caused by death of bacteria due to a too high concentration of IPTG. It can also be observed that the uninduced control yields higher Miller Units than the β-galactosidase negative, induced control. This can be explained by leaky biosynthesis of the genome-coded T7 polymerase. If the production of T7 polymerase is more tightly controlled, the level of expressed β-galactosidase should go down to the minimum of the negative, induced control.

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Nanoscience_-_-_TEXT.html," living organs to reconstitute integrated human organ-level pathophysiology in vitro. These microdevices can be used to test efficacy and toxicity of drugs and chemicals, and to create in vitro models of human disease.  Thus, they potentially represent low-cost alternatives to conventional animal models for pharmaceutical, chemical and environmental applications.
If we do not keep optimizing and honing such methods, resistant to the multi-resistant bacteria will pose a monumental danger to us. As such, this project offers a way to circumvent the use of antibiotics in future treatment of diseases, halting the development of omni-resistant germs.
For our design, we follow mostly the protocol from the Harvard Wyss Institute for the fabrication, microengineering and operation of these microfluidic organ-on-chip systems.
Organs in the human body are complex living systems composed of different types of tissues that form complex tissue-tissue interfaces, such as between endothelium-lined blood vessels and parenchymal epithelial cells that exhibit organ-specific functions. Most organs are multimodular structures in that they consist of repeating smaller functional units that individually perform the major characteristic functions of the whole organ (e.g., gas exchange in the alveoli of the lung, absorption in the villi of the gut, metabolism in the hepatic triad of the liver, etc.). Typically, these functional units comprise different types of specialized tissues (e.g., epithelium, vascular endothelium, connective tissue, immune cells, nerves, etc.) that interface in organ-specific patterns and are subjected to dynamic changes in chemical and mechanical signals that vary depending on their particular spatial microenvironment.
To develop a useful organ surrogate device for in vitro analysis of complex human physiology, we mimic this complex physical microenvironment in which cells are normally situated. We recreated the critical alveolar-capillary interface of the lung air sac in our human lung-on-a-chip by developing a 3D microfluidic device that contains two parallel microchannels with the same dimensions separated by a thin flexible membrane made of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) ECM-coated. We tried to approximate the width of our microchannels to the the average diameter of an alveolus in human lungs. Normally the membrane would be porous to allow for nutrient exchange between the cell tissues, but we did not have the time to make the silicon master for this. Also, we had to omit the adjacent vacuum channels and thus the breathing function, as it is stated, that the simulation of the human lung on a chip is pretty accurate, even without “breathing”.

Procedure
A couple of colonies are chosen from the LB-plate.
Each colony are transferred to 5 ml LB + resistance marker with a pipet tip.
Incubate over night at 37°C in the shaking incubator.
Purification of plasmids for fungi
Materials
The GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit from Sigma-Aldrich is used to isolate our plasmids to use in fungi. QIAGENs EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit is used to purify plasmids for use in mammalian cells.
Preparation
The agents are thoroughly mixed. If any reagent forms a precipitate, warm at 55–65 °C until the precipitate dissolves. Cool to room temperature before use.
The solution is resuspended. Spin the tube of the RNase A Solution briefly to collect the solution in the bottom of the tube. Add 13 μl (for 10 prep package), 78 μl (for 70 prep package) or 500 μl (for 350 prep package) of the RNase A Solution to the Resuspension Solution prior to initial use. Store at 4 °C.
Wash solution; Dilute with 95-100% ethanol prior to initial use.
Procedure - according to the manufactures protocol.
Harvest cells by centrifugation of 5 ml of an overnight recombinant E. coli culture. The optimal volume of culture to use depends upon the plasmid and culture density. For best yields, follow the instructions in the note below. Transfer the appropriate volume of the recombinant E. coli culture to a microcentrifuge tube and pellet cells at ≥12,000 3 g for 1 minute. Discard the supernatant.
Completely resuspend the bacterial pellet with 200 μl of the Resuspension Solution. Vortex or pipette up and down to thoroughly resuspend the cells until homogeneous. Incomplete resuspension will result in poor recovery.
Lyse the resuspended cells by adding 200 μl of the Lysis Solution. Immediately mix the contents by gentle inversion (6–8 times) until the mixture becomes clear and viscous. The lyse reaction must not exceed 5 min.
Precipitate the cell debris by adding 350 μl of the Neutralization/Binding Solution. Gently invert the tube 4–6 times. Pellet the cell debris by centrifuging at ≥12,000*3 g or maximum speed for 10 minutes. Cell debris, proteins"

MARCH - JULY
Planning! We spent a long time umming and ahhing about potential projects. We only decided to put all our efforts into one just a week before we were due to start in the lab at the beginning of July!
WEEK 1
Discussing options for CRISPRi and transposons to give assortment of levels for products. We spent a lot of time in meetings and planning to make sure that we were sure about our project. We went bowling as a team this week and discovered that Natalia is an incredibly precise bowler... hopefully her precision transfers to her pipetting skills - all will be revealed later.
WEEK 2
This week we really got our heads down and the biochemists planned our constructs and designed primers. In the meantime the rest of the team worked on outreach (i.e. sending hundreds of e-mails!). Vikram, the computer scientist, worked on lots of complex computer stuff and worked endlessly on our game, a Portal mod. Jake made us a new logo and designed a front page for our wiki which looks super professional now.
WEEK 3
This week we started lab work! 5 of us (biotechnologists and biochemists) were in the lab learning the techniques needed for iGEM.
Primers and enzymes were ordered for one of our two constructs today so we started on the InterLab study until they arrive! We transformed the controls and devices into DH5a competent cells that were provided for us. We set up overnight cultures of TOP10 cells for making electrocompetent cells, and we also made O/N cultures of E.coli carrying the backbone we need for our pReporter which was donated by a lab member. This is called pSTLS.  Vikram released a teaser trailer for the game we have made. Vik's computer then died.
Vik's computer is alive again. Unfortunately our transformations only gave very small colonies on some plates, and none on others. We re-streaked those colonies that we did have. We extracted plasmid DNA from the O/N cultures of pSTLS and others for the lab to get some practice. We learnt to use the NanoDrop to quantify DNA. Outside of the"

I am the mastermind behind iGEM at Cooper Union. I do everything at once. I prefer to spend at much time in the lab as humanly possible, and encourage my students to join me. There are times when I will set up an experiment that will be done at 2 AM, and that is completely acceptable to me. The students have lovingly re-named my cat Misha to Oligo.

Laccase Lbh1 from Bacillus halodurans C-125
Summary
First some trials of shaking flask cultivations were made with various parameters to identify the best conditions for production of the His tagged laccase Lbh1 from Bacillus halodurans C-125 named BHAL. Due to inactivity of the enzyme in the cell lysate a purification method was established (using Ni-NTA-Histag resin). BHAL could not be detected by SDS-PAGE (theoretical molecular weight of 56 kDa) or activity test by using the BioBrick <partinfo>BBa_K863020</partinfo> and E. coli KRX as expression system. Due to this results the new BioBrick <partinfo>BBa_K863022</partinfo> was constructed and expressed E. coli Rossetta-Gami 2. With this expression system the laccase could be produced and analysed via SDS-PAGE. A small scale Ni-NTA-column was used to purify the laccase. The fractionated samples were tested regarding their activity with ABTS and showed ability in oxidizing ABTS. A scale up to 12 L with a optimized medium (HSG) and a labscale Ni-NTA-Purification were implemented to enable additional experiments to characterize BHAL. A total specific enzyme activity of 8 U mg-1 was determined for BHAL at pH 4 at 25°C with ABTS as a substrate.

When single colony appeared on the LB plate, we picked out 10 colonies, respectively, as our template for bacteria solution PCR. In order to avoid the appearance of false positive clones, we used mCherry F(a primer on the beginning of mCherry)/ VR as the universal primers for the plu0840 is too long to amplify all the parts sequence with VF2/VR .Primers are shown below. The positive clone and its corresponding raw bacteria solution were stored and samples were sent to do DNA sequencing.

RESULTS
PLASMID CONSTRUCTION
5-μl samples of the single (L1) and double enzyme (L2) digestion products for plu0840-device were loaded onto a 1% BioRad Ready Agarose Mini Gel, then subjected to AGE. See Protocol for AGE parameters. We use PstI for single digestion, XbaI and PstI for double digestion, then products were determined by AGE analysis. The DNA size standards were the DL5,000 DNA Marker (M2; TaKaRa, Cat#3428A). Bands were visualized with a Shanghai Peiqing JS-380A Fluorescence Imager.
It can be clearly seen the Plu0840 is constructed into the pSB1C3 backbone (Figure 3).

BACTERIA CULTURE
It can be clearly seen that the recombinant turned red, indicating the expression of  reporter mCherry(figure 4, 5). As mCherry is located behind target gene and shares a promoter with target gene, the target gene may be expressed to a great extent.

This article is written in 1947 by Vannevar Bush. It’s absolutely astonishing, because in this article, she is predicting future inventions, ideas, and pathway. And our human society did invent some of these things/ ideas that he decided. Truly profounding. Man, I can’t believe someone can see this far into the future.
June 11: Thinking...
Today, we listened to research presentations from our research group and we started to brainstorm for ideas for our project this summer. I love this brainstorming phase because anything is possible. All that we need to do is to dream. And dream big. We can say anything that we want, anything you can come up with. As for the coding/ realistic part, that’ll come later, but now. Just dream. So we came up with several cool ideas, such as a display of history like a black hole.
June 12: BU + iGEM
Today, we visited BU and learned and bonded with the BU team that we’re going to work with over the summer. We learned about biology and about the projects that the BU team will be trying to do this summer. After today, I realized that iGem is such an amazing opportunity. The fact that we get to not only work on CS (something that I am passionate about) but also learn about synthetic bio and that iGem combines these 2 is just so cool! I can’t wait to brainstorm and come up with ideas/ projects to work on for the rest of the summer.
June 13: Brainstorm
Today was a busy day. In the morning, a man from Agilent came to check out our work, and I helped on presenting an app with Consuelo, Kara, and Veronica. In the afternoon, BU came over and we started a major brainstorming session. First, we started by just gong around the room, individually, and just writing down ideas that came to our mind. Then, we regrouped and discussed the major topics together. This was actually a lot of fun because we were writing down all the ideas we could think of. All of the whiteboard around the room was filled with words or pictures. Everyone has a chance to speak up and say something that caught their interest. All ideas were welcomed. So it was really cool to see how everyone’s minds work and the different ideas we could all come up with. In a matter of minutes, the whiteboard of the topic that we’re discussing would be filled with ideas with all colors of the marker.
This definitely was very cool. However, brainstorm"

Results
We are excited to present a lot of interesting results, including the characterization of parts of the natural E. coli LldPRD operon on which there is only a very limited amount of information present in the literature up to date, as well as a library of promoters , in which we present a better alternative to the wild-type promoter. We also increased the sensitivity of the system by the addition of LldP . In addition, we developed a hybrid promoter responsive to LacI and LldR which shows an AND gate behaviour.
We also characterized the behaviour of our system with aiiA ; and explored the possibility of Annexin V expression on the outer membrane. Last but not least, we validated our lactate sensor in a nanoliter plate .
For a better understanding of the results of our project, we divided this part into three parts:
Bacterial sensor
Experiments involving mammalian cells
Mammalian cells and bacteria combined
Goals
Our main aims during this project were:
A highly sensitive lactate sensor
the characterization of the natural lldR-promoter ( K822000 )
the characterization of our 8 newly designed syntehtic promoters controlled by the regulator LldR
the characterization of 2 newly designed hybrid promoters"

D. Transform the existing antibiotics.
E. Screen the new and effective antibiotics.
What really got everybody aflutter is that the design of our project gets the majority of responders' approval.
What do you think about exploiting a new antibiotic using Synthetic Biology?
A. That sounds great!
B. Have no sense in it.
C. It is not necessary to consume resources to do that.
In a word, we can draw conclusions from the information mentioned above.
1.As the time went by, people get a deeper education so that they know more about antibacterial resistance and begin to use antibiotics more careful.
2.Even though the public awareness has improved, ABR is still a serious problem around the world and we need to try our best to inhibit its wide spread. The most effective way to achieve this goal is to exploit the new and effective antibiotics.
This survey is a general analysis of the public's attitude on Antibiotics Misuse and how the public know about Antibacterial Resistance.  There is much more problems and we are welcome for your guides.

Hang Out and Eat
  
  There are many girls in our team, and we share a hobbit, which is eating dessert. We often hang out together, and find a dessert house, then rush in and have a dessert banquet! We all believe that, eating together is the best thing way we can find to communicate emotions.
  Our director of support services, Yidan, always provided us with lots of delicious snacks, which were enjoyed by everyone. Sometimes she even made dessert for us herself! And it was really yummy!
Travelling
  
  We had a holiday, which lasted for a week when we finished the first program. Many members went home, but some of us went to Guilin, the city that is famous in China for its beautiful landscape. It was a short trip, but we really enjoyed it. We love the green mountains, the clear water, the amazing karst caves, and of course, the delicious local food. There are many minorities in Guilin, and we were impressed by the gorgeous minority culture. All the things are wild, as pristine as the ore; but they are at the same time so strong and lively, which make people to appreciate them wholeheartedly.
Do the Puzzle
  
  We also do the puzzle in our free time. It is Mona Lisa, and is made of one thousand pieces. It was such a difficulty in the beginning, because it was very hard to distinguish two little pieces. But then it became much easier as we all tried to figure it out together. It was a fantastic break after we were tired of programming. Now it is almost completed. Every time when we see Mona Lisa smiling at us, the feeling of proud arises spontaneously.
  Through doing the puzzle, we know that no difficulty can defeat us, as we are a team, we are together. We believe that we are one, now and forever!

Performance of PSO
In contrast with simulated annealing, another method we used to optimize parameters, PSO performs much better both on the efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, PSO is good at dealing with very large parameters because it is a global optimization algorithm.

Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)
A general objective in our modeling process is an exploration of the high-dimensional input variable space as thoroughly as possible for its impact on observable system behavior, often with either optimization in mind or simply for achieving a better understanding of the phenomena involved. Since the system input->output behavior is typically a nonlinear relationship, simple logic suggests that the number of runs could grow exponentially with the number of input variables. However, an emerging family of high dimensional model representation concepts and techniques capable of dealing with such input->output problems in a practical fashion. RS-HDMR is a global sensitivity analysis technique that can decompose the high-dimensional, nonlinear contributions of each parameter to the network properties(represented by their total sensitivity) into a hierarchy of low-dimensional terms. Calculations by RS-HDMR require only the ODE model, an estimate of the initial conditions and an estimate of the dynamic range to explore for each parameter.
Introduction to GSA
What's Sensitivity Analysis? The sensitivity of a system to its parameters may be determined using either global or local methods. We implement both of them into our code. Specifically, the global sensitivity analysis employed Random Sampling-High Dimensional Model Representation(RS-HDMR) algorithm to estimate the sensitivities of the circuit properties with respect to the circuit model parameters, such as rate constants, without knowing the precise parameter values.

Project Description
What?
Our project removes ammonia (NH3) from waste water, and via two E. coli mutants, turns it into nitrous oxide (N2O).
Why?
Global demand for fixed nitrogen has increased to the point that half the human population now relies on chemical fertilizer to grow their food. While fertilizer is a requirement for modern life, runoff from overfertilized farmland can cause eutrophication.  In the presence of abundant ammonia, algae overgrow and consume the much of the available oxygen in the water [1].  This results in decreased biodiversity throughout the watershed.  Within Europe, 53% of lakes are eutrophic.
In Europe the annual surplus of fixed nitrogen from crop production and livestock farming is 10 Tg (10 Teragrams = a million tonnes), 6 Tg of which leaches into ground and surface water [2]. If that was to be converted into N2O, it could be decomposed for 4.87 Billion kW h -- equivalent to the annual power consumption of 36,000 Avarage households.
If released into the atmosphere, nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas, and capable of degrading ozone, which is why it makes sense to convert it to N2.
How?
Using two E. coli mutants built with genes from Nitrosomonas europaea and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we provide a system to reverse nitrogen fixation.  Our mutants consume ammonia and produce nitrous oxide, releases a sustainable source of energy when decomposed into nitrogen and oxygen [3].  We also provide a model of a bioreactor that could be scaled up and deployed in the field to simultaneously clean the water and produce energy.
Details
Mutant 1: Aerobic
The first mutant incorporates AMO , HAO and two cytochromes c554 and cm552 from Nitrosomonas europaea (shown in blue).  AMO is a 3 subunit protein which converts ammonia (NH4) to an intermediate called hydroxylamine (NH2OH).  HAO then converts the hydrox"

Team Accomplishments
Project:
The prototype of our project was raised by Shiyang WANG in our brainstorm session in Feb. 2017. This idea was then modified and improved by Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG. Our investigators Prof. Xien-en ZHANG, Prof. Chunbo LOU and Prof. Jiangyun WANG helped in our project design. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI also offered help in project design.
Experiments:
Our experiments started in July 2017. As our team's leaders, Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG, separately responsible for the sensor part and degradation part, designed and monitored our experiments. They also did the primary work of data analysis. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI gave their suggestion on project design. Our experiments were accomplished with the joint effort of the following 9 teammates: Ruiling CAI, Jianyi HUANG, Shubo YUAN, Jiang WU, Jingnan YE, Yi WU, Yunfan LI, Yuze WU, Yuqing LEI.

Then, equation (14)-(16) are reduced into the following form:
Using linear algebra, we solved the approximated analytical solutions:
We then apply the analytical solutions into a Jacobian Matrix of the system of ODEs to assess the stability:
After computation, we obtained the following results:
Eigen-value \ Analytical solution
$\begin{pmatrix}x_s\\y_s\\z_s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a\\a\\0\end{pmatrix}$
$\begin{pmatrix}x_s\\y_s\\z_s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a\\0\\a\end{pmatrix}$

The result shows that all eigenvalues of the 3 solutions are smaller than 0, according to the criterion of Poincare-Perron Theorem, these three solutions are all stable equilibrium points only if $n\geq2$ and $a\geq1+\frac2n$.
(II) Phase Portrait
Another method can be adopted to analyse the system's stability is phase portrait. (P, 2009) In order to give a clear picture, we begin with the illustration of the phase portrait of a simpler yet similar system, bistable switch.

The arrows on the plot represent the vector fields of the system, which indicate the direction that the system tends to evolve to. Specifically speaking, a direction to which vector fields point tells where the system tends to approach; conversely, when vector field points away from certain region, that region is where the system does not tend to stay.

Being chemical based, these messengers are constrained to a chemical system regardless of the scope of said system, eg: even far reaching messengers such as hormones are bound within the chemical system that is the human body.
In this project, our goal is to render the chemical barrier deprecated by enabling chemical-free communication. This has been translated to the implementation of a non-chemical messenger, in this case, photons. Our channel is thus light based; packages of photons, or energy quanta, will transport information from senders to receivers, effectively bypassing most chemical barriers in-between. Consequently, our communicating system is no longer contained within a chemical system, but within a physical one, ie: there must remain a physical channel where photons can be transported. This physical channel may range from something as sophisticated as a microcontroler-based electronic relay system, to something as simple as vacuum (or void). However, this physical layer proves very well to be impervious to most chemical signaling. Ergo, the chemical system's signaling would remain unaffected by the physical channel, and vice versa. In consequence, the exchange of information through physical means is sufficiently independent from the information encoded in the system's endogenous chemical pathways. In other words, it is extraordinarily uninvasive. As an added bonus, our receiver entities are easily transformed into emitter entities. Thus, by using our cells as information processing chassis, we can expand the communications layer. We can effectively render our system one where information is:
Encoded and sent by an emitter
Recieved and decoded by a receiver
Plus processed, transformed, and relayed forth
Our ambicious implementation is based on well known systems, mainly bioluminescent proteins from Photinus pyralis and Vibrio fischeri, as well as photoactive receptors like Cyanobacteria cyanobacteriochromes and Light-Oxygen-Voltage domain quimeric proteins. We thus exploit the fact that cells already display primitive photo-communication, both within multicellular organisms as well as within populations of unicellular ones. Moreover, in our system the photonic information is transformed to and from chemical information within the chemical system that is an individual cell. Thus, the chemical barrier that is the membrane has ceased being a barrier to communication and is now a noise isolator. By decoupling the messenger from the chemical layer, we enable a brand new host of applications that were previously unavailable, ranging in domains from neurobiology, to cybernetic coupling, and even to biological telecommunications.

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Brainstorming Health_-_-_TEXT.html,"Despite the advance in emergency therapy, anti-venom is often only the effective treatment. In treatment anti-venom is injected into patient intravenously which could neutralize the toxin. Collecting of anti-venom is done by milking the venom and injected into the cattle. The subject will undergo immune response where its antibody produced can be collected. This common method of obtaining anti-venom can tackle many toxins in the venom but however is considered unproductive since only small amount of anti-venom is produced from the animal blood which is due to complicated serum purification process from the animal's serum. Waiting of animal recovery from venom also make its production quite slow and in several cases the animals die after injection.
Therefore bacteria should be introduced as a substituted platform utilizing synthetic biology to deal with the problems mentioned above. Apart from existing characterised anti-venom, other anti-venoms could be more easily discovered using the various mutagenesis of variable region of antivenom antibody. To develop this platform, well known venom could be produced to test this platform. Indian cobra snake is therefore chosen as the first target due to its generality, high toxicity and it is also one of the highest profile anti-venom discovered which could potentially save many victims from this fatal snakebite.
The way to engineer the bacteria is to mutagenise the shark antibody gene to allow different variable regions of the antibody to be expressed on the surface of the bacteria in different libraries. The venom is screened onto each plate of different bacteria libraries. The venom will bind to the right antibody and trigger the signal cascade which results in the expression of the fluorescence proteins which can be detected by FACs. machine. The bacteria that produces the antibody for the venom will be subjected to DNA sequencing which could be the platform for producing bacteria expressing antibody specific to the venom in the future. (Text by Ming)
So the method for the anti-venom generation begins as follows: 1: Take the venom proteins and bind biotin to either the C or N terminus so that it is able to be fixed to a large ferro-magnetic beads that are coated in streptavidin. Streptavidin has an extremely high affinity for biotin and the beads can be picked up with a neodynium magnet - so the bacteria with the 'antibody' on their surface that is able to bind to the venom proteins will be attached to the bead. 2: The bacteria will have a plasmid that encodes a gene for a single-chain variable fragment, a fusion protein of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains"

The biofilm formation rate appears to be   following a similar pattern for both the nhaR BioBrick and for the control. However, the nhaR BioBrick has the highest biofilm formation rate between 24   and 48 hours.

An increase in the IPTG concentration does not   seem to have an effect on the growth rate of the nhaR   BioBrick. A leaky IPTG inducible promoter can be a reason   for this behavior. There is also a possibility of the   promoter malfunctioning. nhaR BioBrick with a constitutive   promoter has been used because of this possibility.
Breaking Down Nylon 6,6 Microplastics with Manganese Peroxidase
Maganese Peroxidase
Manganese peroxidase is an enzyme from the fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium.   In this fungus, commonly known as white rot fungus, this enzyme aids in lignin degradation.  Its enzymatic activity has been found to be optimal near a pH of 4.5 and at a temperature of 32C.
Syringaldazine Oxidation Assay
Syringaldazine (4-Hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde azine) can be used as an indicator of oxidative activity for laccases and peroxidases.  The general conditions outlined by the protocol given on the Sigma Aldrich website were used in order to preliminarily assess if the mnP coding sequence encoded by the BBa_K1357001 on the compound BioBrick BBa_ K1357006 was producing MnP protein.  The operating pH for this assay is 6.5 and hence fell far outside the pH optimum for the MnP protein.  Even so, BioBrick BBa_ K1357006 showed an observable difference in oxidative activity (see Figure 1 below).

We transferred these plasmids again and got 7strains of DH5α. Just using painting brushes to dip in the culture medium containing these strains and draw on the solid medium, after culturing in 37℃ over night, we could finally get these beautiful works.We held a little painting competition in our school and attracted over 40 students to participate. Then, we decided to hold this activity in the science museum again to provide the opportunity for kids to learn some basic knowledge of synthetic biology when they were totally involved in this unusual painting competition.Of course,we requested every participant to wear gloves when they were painting. The following pictures showed these kids who did really love this activity.
What’s more, we met some professionals on site occasionally, who also showed interest in our work, so we seized the opportunity to discuss with them.

If this activity is a key to the syn-bio door, then we stepped on to guide who interested in it to go a little further. You may already noticed that all the stamps and souvenirs were related to iGEM. The motifs on the stamps consist of the logo of iGEM, ZJU team logos from 2013 to 2017, and high school’s team logo this year. What’s more, when a children happily went home with a notebook designed by our own, he would find a brief summary of our project on the first page. For more syn-bio information, people can scan the QR code on the back of notebooks to book our wechat subscription. In this way, we can let more people know about iGEM and keep the communication with public.

Today we compared the fluctuations in ice nucleation speed of 4 types of water; deionised water, Milli-Q, filtered Milli-Q and tap water and found that deionised water showed the least fluctuations. This is important for the rest of the experiments.
Thursday 6th of October
We tested the speed of ice nucleation of deionised water with no cells, cells expessing a GFP construct or the INP constuct.
Monday 10th of October
We repeated the previously done experiments and also started experiments with AFP.
Wednesday 12th and Thursday 13th and Tuesday 18th of October
All previous experiments were repeated. We also started testing the re-usablity of INP and AFP.
Friday 14th of October
Professor Koeckelberghs explained us how we have to work with a differential scanning calorimeter. We tried to do the experiments, but due to a defect, we will do them next week.
Monday 17th of October
We started with growing cells for the DSC measurements.
Wednesday 19th of October
We washed the cells. The department of Chemistry provided us a DSC. We did quantitative test on deionized, ice rink and NaCl water combined with AFP and INP.

Protocols
Competent Cells
Day 1
1. Streak out frozen glycerol stock of bacterial cells onto an LB plate (no antibiotics). Work sterile. Grow cells overnight at 37 oC.
Day 2
2. Select a single colony of E. coli from fresh LB plate and inoculate a 5 ml starter culture of LB (with no antibiotics). Grow at 37 oC in shaker overnight.
Day 3
3. Inoculate 50 ml fresh growth medium with 500 μl starter culture and grow at 37 oC for 2 hours.
4. When OD600 reaches 0.35-0.4, immediately put the cells on ice, chill the culture for 20-30 minutes, swirling occasionally to ensure even cooling. Chill centrifuge bottles on ice.
5. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 3000g (around 4000rpm in the Beckman Ja-10 rotor) for 15 minutes at 4 oC.
6. Decant the supernatant and gently resuspend each pellet in about 5 ml of ice-cold transformation buffer1.
7. Aliquot in 200 μl batches into sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and snap freeze with liquid nitrogen.
Store frozen cells at -80 oC.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#15 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," this morning of the J13002-LuxOD47E-B0015 colonies that I transformed yesterday and grew overnight.  I ran this Colony PCR on a gel this afternoon.  See picture below.
Analysis:
Lanes 1-4 are J13002-LuxOD47E-B0015 trial 1 (treating B0015 as the insert),
Lanes 5-8 are J13002-LuxOD47E-B0015 trial 2 (treating J13002-LuxOD47E as the insert),
Lane 9 is a positive size control J13002-LuxOD47E,
Lane 10 is another positive size control with just BBK LuxOD47E and
Lane 11 is a negative control- ddH2O
From this gel, it looks like trial 1; colonies 1 and 2 might have worked as well as possibly trial one, colonies 3 and 4.  The gel looks a little bit slanted however, as the ladder does not perfectly line up on both sides.  Regardless, the first two colonies at least look like they may have worked.  I will prepare overnight cultures of these colonies as well as colonies 3 and 4.  Tomorrow I will isolate plasmids and start with a NottI digest, run this on a gel with my two size controls (J13002-LuxOD47E and BBK LuxOD47E).  If this gel looks good, we will send the appropriate colonies for sequencing.  I also did restreaks of these colonies.
Today I also helped Carol do a little but of lab cleanup, filling pipet tip boxes, re-filling tube containers, ethanol bottles, etc.  We also went to Invitrogen to get more Polymerase for Carol's stuff.  I also helped Carol make restreaks of her glycerol stocks and I saved and edited some pictures for Mandy from the weekend.  These pictures will be going up on the Wiki.

Unfortunately, we did not have time to ligate the individual components of the constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone so we were unable to test the switches with luciferase. If we had managed to test our switches with luciferase, we anticipate that our sensitivity would be significantly higher.

Modeling
Us visiting him at Imperial
Dr Thomas Ouldridge
Early on in our project we met Dr Thomas Ouldridge, a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. He strengthened our modeling foundations and told us what assumptions were sensible for our system. He explained energy landscapes of nucleic strand displacements, which helped us increase the specificity of our first series of switches despite us not modeling the toehold switch binding base-by-base.
We went back to him a couple of months later with our mass action kinetics model. He located where we could remove unneeded complexity from our model. After changing the model accordingly, we were able to to narrow our model to have just 4 main parameters. This allowed us to vary them to test the effects of changing the parts of our toehold switch, for example the RBS and promoter strength to optimize the dynamic range. This made our model orders of magnitude more useful to both our design and wetlab teams. See our modeling page to learn more about why fewer parameters is better and how our model influenced our design and implementation of our project.

Dr Daniel Pregibon
We spoke to Dr Daniel Pregibon, who works for Abcam, and developed a new method of quantifying miRNAs. He advised that our method could prove especially  effective in low resource settings and in situations where results are needed urgently. He also advised us on the clinical use of miRNAs as biomarkers.
We have looked further into all of this on our silver human practices page .

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," were very curious: our investigations led us to conclude that microfluidics were not widely known about by the public, and in industry and research these devices seemed specialized and costly, also sparsely used. We knew already that synthetic biology research labs at Boston University only use microfluidics to a very limited extent. Overall, we concluded that microfluidics are not widely used. But why?
To explore this question, we visited Lab Central, a hub for young and emerging biotechnology companies that need a lab space. Here, there were dozens of small synthetic biology startups. At Lab Central we presented our work on Neptune, highlighting the workflow as accessible for researchers new to microfluidics.
While at Lab Central, we met with representatives from Sembler, a Draper affiliated microfluidic fabrication company. We learned about what Sembler offers: for several hundred dollars, you could order custom designed batches of microfluidic chips. These are single use, single purpose chips. Sembler provides once monthly fabrication and delivery.
Intellectual Property Blog
In our outreach events, we found that the public, and even high school students interested in synthetic biology and engineering, have never heard of microfluidics. Further, we noticed in out industry visits that most microfluidics used are prohibitively costly and very specialized to a single task. Accessibility is a huge issues with microfluidics.
We then decided to center our human practices contributions around accessibility by creating a blog called ""Who Owns What"". In this blog we discuss intellectual property rights in synthetic biology, and how these important ideas shape the environment of synthetic biology we know today. This blog is an educational reference to anyone in the community who wants to learn more about IP in synthetic biology.
Definitions | Post One
Our post, “A General Overview of Intellectual Property in Synthetic Biology: Part 1” began our blog series by going over the basics of intellectual property. In essence, the post provided needed background and definitions such as patent, copyright and trademark, as well as a roadmap to future posts.

Our post, “A General Overview of Intellectual Property in Synthetic Biology: Part 2” continued the flurry of necessary definitions from Part 1, but went farther and began drawing comparisons between intellectual property in synthetic biology and the closest cousin in regards to policy and property laws: software.

Greenpeace GMO Debate
This event, the Greenpeace debate, was one of the most intense, emotional, and moving moments within our team’s journey. Greenpeace, for many of us, was an organization we once supported and looked towards as a beacon of hope. A passionate group fighting for sustainability and environmental awareness in a time when little attention was given to either, it functioned as an inspiring role model for all of us. However, as the GMO debate began to pick up steam, it appeared to many of us that Greenpeace chose a path we could not follow. Greenpeace derides and disapproves the use of genetic modification, claiming that GMOs are ‘unnatural’ manipulations and environmental failures.
That is why it came is a surprise when Sandra Dreisbach, professor of Bioethics, invited us to present our understanding of GMOs to her Bioethics summer course, followed by a presentation from a Greenpeace representative, along with Q&A after the presentations. We were essentially entering a debate with one of the most influential voices in the GMO discussion. Understanding our responsibility to communicate the scientific consensus on GMOs effectively, we put both our nervousness and excitement aside to prepare our presentation. Both presentations are included below.
Since we wanted our audience to have a comprehensive understanding of what GMOs truly were, we decided to take a historical approach to presenting the information: starting from the domestication of dogs, to the artificial selection of crops, through to the modern techniques and GMOs we know today. We concluded with a brief introduction on what our iGEM team has been doing over the summer in order to both explain who we were as well as give another example of how genetic engineering can be a boon to sustainability. The Greenpeace representative brought up the negative effects of pesticides/herbicides, discussed Greenpeace’s belief that we do not yet have enough scientific evidence or data to support GMOs, and illustrated the negative effects of animal agriculture and the GMOs that sustain it. Most notably, the representative silenced the classroom by referencing a research paper from MIT which stated that if we continue to use glyphosate at current rates, half of children born in the U.S. will be born with some form of autism by 2025. The Q&A portion was not captured via recording (and unfortunately so), yet it was the one of the"

Prediction 2150: Natural human immune system is bred out of general population due to general efficiency of artificial immunity.

IVIS, the medical breakthrough of the 21st century. Hailed as one of mankind's greatest triumph. It was supposed to provide complete protection from any disease, virus, bacteria, even cancer and neurodegenerative disease. It would bring us a new era of prosperity. It became a common practice to receive the IVIS vaccination at birth. A completely synthetic immune system far superior than the one found naturally in our own bodies. Soon everyone, even babies in third world countries would receive this vaccine. And why not? It was cheap, comparable to a bottle of aspirin.

Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," for instrumental analytics, laboratory technology, laboratory chemicals, and biotechnology attracted more than 900 visitors (among them our iGEM team).
We got the chance to hear presentations about the newest innovations in the field of lab technology as well as lectures from a few equipment manufacturers.
Furthermore, the visit was an opportunity to directly get in touch with the companies to promote the iGEM competition and our team. For instance, we gained the support of companies like eppendorf, OMNILAB and LABOR PRAXIS. To sum up, the convention gave the visitors the chance to gain information from the trade exhibition by around 100 producers coming from lab- and analytic technique, to listen to lectures about the newest trends concerning the application technique in the laboratory, and also to gather tips for the daily work in the laboratory.
The Potsdam day of science was an excellent way for promoting our project, exchanging ideas with other scientists and having lots of fun!
At our booth, we showed which products include or will be produced by gene modified organisms. Many people do not know what gene modification is or that every organism and every cell contains DNA. We tried to bring the synthetic biology closer to women, men and children.
We also isolated the DNA from bananas together with children. They were so excited to see the whole genetic information, since every cell includes it. DNA is everywhere but you cant ""touch"" it, thereby it was even more interesting for the small explorers.
Presenting our project at schools is a very straightforward example of human practices. The pupils were excited to get a deeper insight into the actual process of scientific research and we might even convinced some to look for a degree in science themselves.
An important assignment of iGEM is to get in touch with non-scientific people, to inform them about our ideas of the competition and synthetic biology in general. Therefor, we asked around and then had the chance to visit two grammar schools, in Brandenburg and in Saxony. We gave presentations about synthetic biology and biotechnology in general and also explained our projects and experiences in the lab. Incidentally, we talked about our studies in Potsdam and scientific work. We ended with a discussion about the pros and cons of genetic engineering, in which the whole group took part. Students as well as the teachers were interested in the topic and asked a lot of questions. We also used the chance to give away the postcards that were sent to us by iGEM Düsseldorf-Cologne .

The transformation from yesterday was successful; hence the same people could proceed with restreaking the transformants. Hamid and Tomas re-did PCR on pcpcG2 using primers with BioBrick overhangs because of the weak band we got last time. This time we got a stronger band.
λ Red
After internal discussions concerning progresses this far, we decided to start preparing the λ Red assembly parallel with the other assemblies. We need to knock out the gene envZ in our E coli strain to avoid cross-talk with our red sensor cph8. To do this, we will use Lambda Red recombineering [ Datsenko and Wanner, 2000 ].
First step was to perform colony PCR of a strain carrying the plasmid pKD4 (Datsenko) to generate a PCR fragment with a kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by FRT sites and homologies to envZ: “EnvZ- Knock out FRT-Kan” (PCR protocol of envZ knockout FRT-Kan_FRT). We could observe the bands around 1477 bp as we expected. However, we also got a stronger band for the negative control (NC). Even though it seems like we got the right product, the appearance of a band in the NC force us to redo the experiment. Just as a precautious measure.

- Cells need to survive every step of the entire process
- Sterile environment needs to be maintained at all time
From these points, we came up with a six step process to make a 3D biofilm!
How we print bacteria in 3D
Step 1: The first step already determines the outcome printing quality. The bioink needs to be deposited at the exact right spot to print a structure with high precision. Firstly, this depends on the precision of the motors moving the printhead across the stage. Secondly, it depends on the bioink itself. Its viscosity, flow rate and surface tension. Finally, the adhesive properties of the surface (in the following referred to as biopaper) upon which the material is deposited determine the outcome.
Step 2: By pretreating the biopaper with calcium chloride, the bioink is immediately exposed to free calcium ions upon deposition. This triggers the crosslinking of the alginate polymer to afford a stable gel. You can imagine this like spaghetti before and after boiling them. This step needs to take place as fast as possible to avoid liquid movements leading to unwanted losses in precision. Here it is important to ensure that both the liquid and gel form of alginate do not pose any harm to bacterial cells and that they are sustained with water and nutrients.
Step 3: Our cells are now trapped in a tangle of spaghetti. It’s time to start what they were made for: connect! Rhamnose induces the production of protein units CsgA which are exported out of the cell and self-assemble to form nanowires which connect the bacteria.
Step 4: Protein production and diffusion at the right place takes time. To create a strong interaction between cells, this step takes up to 24 hours. However, placing the biofilm into a 37 degrees incubator leads to the alginate gel drying out and eventually cell death. To prevent this, storage at room temperature was found as compromise.
Step 5: Now that a stable connection between cells has been established it is time to liberate the final product. To do so, the spaghetti tangle around the biofilm needs to go. Sodium citrate is used to complex the bridging calcium ions which then are replaced with sodium ions. Like this, the alginate is stepwise dissolved and can finally be washed away.
Step 6: But did it work? Let’s find it out by looking at the biofilm under the microscope. Certain dyes specifically interact with the bacterial nanowires created by our bacteria. These are known as"

1)Creation of KO yeast strains
At a first step, we worked on creation of KO yeast strains which uptake more sodium and therefore show salt-sensitivity. It is because we need to use salt sensitive yeast strains in order to assess functions of proteins which contribute salt torelance, and also Na+を外に漏らさずため込ませたかったからだ。 作り方は Special protocol を見てください。 Based on Aachen 2017's result, we created ΔNHA1, ΔENA1ΔNHA1,ΔENA1 at first, and 実験を進めるにあたって東北大学の魚住先生にいただいたG19株(ΔENA1,2,3,4)がよく塩を吸収し、高い塩感受性を示すことがわかり、ENA1だけでなく同じタンデムにあるENA2,3,4もノックアウトする方がいいことがわかった。またNHA1をノックアウトすることも塩吸収に貢献していたため、最後にΔENA1,2,5ΔNHA1も作成しました。以下が私たちが作成した変異株です。実験においては、上記のG19株と、渡部先生にいただいた醤油酵母も用いた。

(-) kontrol < Wild type HNS < PotB59/PomA < HNS-T108I .
The results of 0.30 and 0.35 agar concentrations doesn’t give significant information. Besides, in 48. hour of incubation the diameter of colonies reached to plate’s diameter, so measurement results didn’t show any difference than 24. hour’s.
PSB1C3T7-HNS/HNS-T108I / PotB59/PomA CLONING
As we didn’t very satisfying results from our functional assays, we checked everything about our experiments. Then we noticed that even one amino acid change in a protein can cause a difference in protein activity. We noticed that His-tag was added into the proteins when we cloned the genes into pET45-b. Hence we cloned these genes into our own design PSB1C3-T7 plasmid, in order to produce required proteins without any addition. For this cloning, we removed the gene sequences from PSB1C3-HNS, PSB1C3-HNS-T108I, PSB1C3-PotB59/PomA plasmids with BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Then we ligated the cut gene with pET45-b which was cut with BamHI and SalI enzymes.(XhoI and SalI enzymes occurs a scar when their cuts ligate)We transformed ligated products into BL21 bacteria strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was performed with Verify Forward and verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly the band should be at 503 bp line, but if colony PCR worked, then bands are expected to be at 906 bp line for HNS and HNS-T108I, 2204 bp line for PotB59/PomA.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check in order to learn if the cloning was correct. For cut-check"

Week 20: September 15th  - September 19th
Initial draft of the schematic was prepared and sent to Cesar and the rest of the team for review. It was concluded that the schematic is currently not effective at showing the repression/expression of the reporter protein and does not show the interaction between the repressor gene and the reporter.  Through exploration of different designs, arrangements and symbols we hope to be able to show our complicated system in a manner that can be understood by many different perspectives.  Additionally we have begun cost analysis of our device.  It is important to recognize that development costs will be much larger than the final cost of a device we are planning on producing.  We are hoping to receive a cost breakdown of the specific costs of each material within our device, however for the time being we have calculated the dimensions of the various parts.  Bulk prices of materials such as Teflon were searched with the goal of being able to estimate the cost of mass production.
Week 21: September 22nd  - September 26th
This week we brainstormed a way to show the interaction between the repressor gene and the reporter gene. A new version of the schematic was prepared and discussed with Cesar and the rest of the team. Overall, the schematic is improving and is very effective on communicating information, but there still are details that need to be changed to make the schematic as clear as possible.  Additionally we have been working to render new images of our device with three chambers (aligned at 120 degrees) radially and symmetrically.  This consists of both a positive and negative control and a disease test for proof of concept.  This design can be altered or changed for as many detection wells needed depending on the task of the device and the resources available to build it.  The amount of chambers can be adjusted as along as they are symmetrical with the PCR chamber as demonstrated by fluid flow analysis on Solid Works.
Week 22: September 29th  - October 3rd
This week we continued uploading our work to the wiki. We also set up a vote to choose a team member to do a voice over for our animation so that this visual process can be narrated with the necessary background information and description of the process occurring. This week we also continued working on the design of a schematic to show the basic process of our system and how it operates.

The European Experience 2016 in Paris
The iGEM Teams Ionis and Evry from Paris organized an awesome event to bring together teams from Europe. We are happy that we could participate in this event and meet different teams from Europe and hear of their projects. All the great ideas and thoughts gave us even more motivation for our project, so we can be a well-deserved member of the iGEM community. We found new ideas, possible collaborations and some new friends.

Facebook Campaign
Although it is still very important to go out on the street to reach people, we think that using social media in a highly targeted way is the most efficient way to spread information, and ideas, and impulses of thinking. Therefore, we decided to run a well planned social media campaign, in which we wanted to show the importance of Vitamin B12. Telling a story with different chapters about the red vitamin, we wanted to get peoples' attention on facebook. Moreover, we made our campaign going viral.
In Germany, Facebook is by far the most important social media platform (far ahead of for instance Twitter), so we focused on that. After analyzing our previous Facebook posts, we found out that including pictures of human faces in our posts causes significantly higher attention than those who did not include human faces. In result, including faces increases the number of likes and shares, which then again increases the number of re-likes and re-shares. The total number of likes and shares determine how many people will see our post in the end.
For this reason, we decided to combine the introduction of our team members with interesting facts about Vitamin B12. The trend of posting facts as a catchy picture currently generates many followers on facebook, combined with nice pictures of us, our campaign was supposed to inform many users. Moreover, it was also intended to generate new site followers to generally increase the outreach of our Facebook site, to reach even more people for future posts.
The result was amazing. Reaching up to over 1,200 people per post, the outreach was by far higher than any street campaign would have been. Many of our friends told us that they found our campaign very interesting, and asked what this iGEM competition might be. Of course, no question remained unanswered.
We can only encourage future iGEM Teams to use social media for reaching the public, and to put a very high focus on it.

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#KillAbility_-_-_TEXT.html,"6. If the ratios are alike, then the killing ability of the warriors are similar.    Figure 2 shows the result.We can see that in the medium containing A+K, the amount of the warriors from two sides are roughly equal. At the same time, in the medium containing C, the amount of warrior 2 is much larger.This is easy to explain as not only does warrior 2 kills warrior 1, but warrior 1 kills itself as well.                                     *A+K stands for ampicilin+kanamycin,C stands for chloramphenicol.
IV.Results:
B.Test if the killing ability is adequate
   We calculate the ratio of beggar/warrior in each group and the results can be seen from the figures.
   We can see that when we mix warrior1 with beggar 2, the amount of beggar 2 after 15h is much more than the amount of warrior 1.This may partly because warrior1 kills itself and partly because its killing ability towards beggar 2 is weak.
   In contrast with the result above, we find that when we mix beggar1 and warrior 2 together, the amount of warrior2 surely surpasses that of beggar1. Besides, the killing ability of warrior2 is adequate. The killing ability is neither too strong                                                                      when the ratio is 1:1, nor is it too weak when the ratio is 1:10.
   Furthermore, we compared the amount of beggars when they are cultured alone with the amount of beggars when they are cultured with warriors. We calculated the amount of beggars in group 7/group 8 to see the change in beggar1 and in group11/group12 to see the change in beggar2.From  figure 4, we can see that the amount of beggar1 drops drastically when it is cultured with warrior2,                                                                which means that warrior2 really work. As the amount of beggar2 does not have an apparent change, we may say that warrior1’s killing ability is surely too weak.
       
V.Analysis:
    Firstly, we ensure that our warriors can really kill. The amount of beggars do decrease when the warriors from the other side is added and the more warriors, the less beggars.(figure 3) Secondly,we get to the conclusion that the killing ability of the two warriors are apparently not equal. The killing ability of warrior2 is actually quite ideal as it does not kill itself and that its killing ability towards beggar1 is obvious but not excessively strong. The killing ability of warrior1 is rather"

Controversy around biodegradation
While reading about PLA, we noticed there was diversity of opinions on its biodegradability. We decided to take an skeptical point of view and we performed a little experiment to empirically observe what happens in daily conditions.
Project insights
We carried out our PLA system development and its experiments before and during the human practices procedure, which made it difficult to apply on the wet-lab investigated issues. However, we stopped to think about how could we help on bioplastic society impact.
High prices of PLA products compared with petroleum-based equivalents hinders the consumption of this bioplastic. As those prices are related with low yields of PLA production, we decided to work on efficient ways of production through conceiving a DIY efficient bioreactor.

We want to figure out the relationship of the ratio between Di (R) and Di (D) and final density D(T). . We have the following description with the setting: 1.As the total number of the nutrition in the square region is limited, and competition occurs among conjugative transfer and reproduction nutrient. too high or too low initial density both cause conjugative transfer fewer. Therefore the initial density and must be limited within a certain value range. 2.Due to reproduction and conjugative transfer both breeding competition on nutrition, and we need to study the the ratio of D and R conjugative transfer efficiency, we should control the  reproduction competitiveness, so then initial density is set to a fixed value. 3.the ratio of the optimum D and R may vary within a certain range with n. Here only consider one value of n. The simulation results are shown as below:
Wherein C2 = 4, C1 = 1, γ1 = 0, γ2 = 6, Ψ2 (R) = 1.0, Ψ2 (D) = Ψ2 (T) = 0.9, τ = 0.005, p = 1.0, n = 0.08. Simulation step length is 1min. The maximum time limit of simulation is 30 hours. The simulation should be terminated when the total number of plane nutrition is less than the initial value multiplies 0.001. As is shown in the picture, the best ratio of D and R is 3:2. The simulation is terminated as nutrients running out. The final state of the two layers of bacteria are shown below:

Since the experiment conditions are different, the parameters may be impertinent. We can calculate every parameter more carefully and improve the accuracy of model if we have more time and resources. 2. The model and simulation of the repression of conjugation has always been the difficulty of conjugation models, thus rarely can we find the related reference model and experiment. Set out with the conception of balance each other, we come up with a model of two plasmid transfer types which one can inhibit another one. But the correctness of this model still need more experiment to be testified. 3. Due to the limitation of condition, large-scale computers are not available.

Healthcare
As there are still a lot of Indonesia regions which are not really clean, we would like to hear the public point of view about this, the diseases correlating to the environment. Therefore, for our third and fourth survey, we had a dialogue with the public about synthetic biology application for healthcare. The human practice team and several members from the other division were divided into two groups. We approached the public one by one and had a discussion with them.
What is the most frequent disease that related to environment?
From all of the 37 respondents, most of them answered diarrhea, followed by flu and skin diseases. In addition, the public thought that the main cause of the diseases are bacteria. The following wordcloud (generated from: http://www.abcya.com/word_clouds.html) shows the distribution of the answer.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Our Project#Reporter Systems#lacI_-_-_TEXT.html,"I. To validate our construct, we repressed the two transcription factors sequentially with ATC and IPTG, respectively. Details of these experiments are given in the following sections.
ATC induction
Adding ATC in the medium of the co-transformed cells will inactivate TetR. As a consequence, LacI will be expressed and RFP will be repressed, as shown in the cartoons below. We should then see a decrease of RFUs correlating with increasing concentrations of ATC.
Gene expression in the cells without ATC:
Gene expression in the cells with ATC:
With the wild-type TetR, the induction curves at different ATC concentrations added to the growth medium are shown here:
With zero or low concentrations of ATC in the cells' medium, RFP expression is quite weak. Normally, we should see RFP expression since TetR binding to Ptet is not hindered by ATC. However, Ptet has been mutated when added to our plasmids and thus TetR can't repress LacI efficiently. LacI being still produced in the cell, RFP is repressed even when TetR binds to Ptet. Nevertheless, our results show a decrease in RFP expression when we add sufficient amounts of ATC. Even in our mutated system, TetR interaction with Ptet still has an effect on the output. There is a 2-fold difference between high ATC concentrations and zero ATC; we believe that by restoring the Ptet sequence, this difference would be higher, then allowing a detection window wide enough for characterizing mutants.
ATC dose-response curve
This graph shows more clearly the difference of normalized RFUs for low or high concentrations of ATC - even if the intensities are low. As in our first readout system, the highest ATC efficiency seems to be reached with 200 ng/microL already.
IPTG induction
IPTG will inactivate LacI, so that RFP will be more highly expressed as depicted in the cartoons below. From this we expect an increase in RFP expression with increasing IPTG concentration in the medium.
Gene expression in the cell without IPTG:
Gene expression in the cell with IPTG:
Below you can see the induction curves with different IPTG concentrations added in the cell's medium:
Indeed, RFUs increase 8-fold between zero IPTG and the highest concentrations. Note that the RFU intensity for the curve with no IPTG matches the intensity of the curve with no ATC in the ATC induction experiment, showing that these two experiments are consistent. The curves with the highest IPTG concentrations are not"

Week 10: July 1 - July 5
After talking to Taylor it has been determined that we will do a factorial design to investigate the effects of concentration and PH on the magneto-ferritin we will prepare in our lab. The goal is to quickly find better operating conditions to move on to next stages of the experiment. My next step needs the raw materials to be here and processed, so I am continuing to learn more about factorial design.
It has been decided that for the modelling in Autodesk Maya, we shall use the plug-in ePMV, which is only available for 2013 as the latest version. So installing both Maya 2013 and ePMV. Our vision is to simulate the bonding between parts, so I was studying dynamics and other related techniques in Maya as well.
Week 11: July 8 - July 12
This week's focus has been on Maya. Mostly figuring out how to import protein data base files (.pdb) and how to install and use various extensions in ePMV. I found out that the ePMV website isn't always clear, but fortunately YouTube has wonderful video tutorials on ePMV.
I loaded the ferritin sphere into the database file and changed the color scheme. The resulting Maya file can be as large as 50 MB, sometimes 100 MB more.
Week 12: July 15 - July 19
I kept working on Maya. Now all parts of the assembly have been loaded to Maya and ribbon, coarse surface, surface and atom models have been constructed. We were trying to print the modelled scenes from Maya, by rendering the scenes to images. But so far we have no success; all rendering methods in Maya resulted in poor images that we can't visualize the 3D structure. Sometimes the colors were lost resulted in a region of red surface. This problem occurred on all computers with Maya installed, under many different settings, even in Autodesk Max, but not on our in-house expert Merry's computer. For now we just use print screen to get the image and will worry about rendering later.
At the same time Ceser asked us to study the following techniques in Maya: Dynamics, nParticle, and APBS extension of ePMV for calculating the electrostatic force of a protein. Like everything else in Maya, the APBS extension did not work as we expected; for some reason it complains error occurred when executing a line in the script but without the details necessary for debugging. As a result nothing came out of APBS extension. Even worse we were going for the"

Bilirubin
Bilirubin is a yellow pigment (Benioff Children’s Hospital, San Francisco) created by the enzymatic reaction of haemoglobin degradation.  Since the haemoglobin is located inside the red blood cells, the protein is hidden from the catabolism. It is only when the exchange into new red blood cells takes its place that the haemoglobin becomes exposed and decomposed by either fagocytosis or haemolysis. The result of the degradation are two toxic compounds; carbon monoxide (CO) and the bilirubin, were as it is only the carbon monoxide that is possible for the body to excrete easily (Mugnoli et al. 1983). The bilirubin is difficult to excrete since it is a non-polar compound and therefor not soluble in water (Fevery, J et al. 1977). The bilirubin molecules have a tendency to create different complexes with other proteins as well, such as serum albumin. The pigment also has the ability to conjugate with three types of proteins that are involved in the transport and the metabolism of bilirubin in vivo (Bonnett et al. 1978).
Bilirubin is an unstable compound (Le Bas, Allegret et al. 1980) and can occur both as bound and free pigment among the humans. The molecule has a tendency to form several derivate of bilirubin such as biliproteins, several conjugates and glucuronides etc (Harris, Kellermeyer, 1970). The schematic form"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Description merge_-_-_TEXT.html," from specific detection systems. Using this approach, production of biosensor variants will not require subsequent engineering steps: cells containing desired components will simply be mixed together.
The splitting of biosensor components into separate cells may have additional advantages besides ease of variant production. Goni-Moreno et al. (2011) have previously suggested that the use of synthetic quorum sensing circuits enables each cell to be considered an independent logic gate, which may rectify the “fuzzy logic” seen in some biosensors, where stochastic cellular processes may produce false positive results. Quorum sensing has also been previously used to synchronise gene expressions, leading to reduced variability within a population (Danino et al., 2010).

Due to the easier design and higher expected profit, we decided to use the cI protein of the phage 434, as the DNA binding domain for our system.
The activation domain
The second fusion protein of the hybrid transcriptional activation system is our Evobody fused to an activation domain. This domain is the impeller of the system. If the activation domain is recruited to the promoter through the interaction of the binding protein (the Evobody) and the DNA anchored target protein the gene expression of the reporter gene is strongly increased( Dove & Hochschild 2004 ). The most commonly used activation domain is the alpha subunit of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase A or in short RpoA. Several early publications about bacterial one- or two-hybrid systems are based on this subunit as activator ( Joung et al. 2000 ; Dove & Hochschild 2004 , Durai et al. 2006 ). RpoA is a subunit of the core complex of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The interaction with the promoter as well as the connection to the regulatory proteins is established via RpoA. Therefore, it is essential for the initiation of the subunit assembly of the RNA polymerase ( Ishihama 1992 ).
Figure 6: RpoA and RpoZ highlighted in the RNA polymerase I crystal structure. Image designed by PyMol.
RpoZ, the much smaller omega subunit of the RNA polymerase, which could also be used as transcriptional activator. It is mainly important for the facilitation and stabilization of the assembly of the RNA polymerase ( Mathew & Chatterji 2006 ). RpoZ outperformed RpoA and a special phage polymerase subunit in a gene activation comparison ( Badran et al. 2016 ). Therefore, we decided to use the RpoZ as activator domain.
Choice of the positive controls
Every system should be validate by analyzing a positive control. The two hybrid transcriptional activation system converts the binding affinity of two proteins in corresponding expression intensity. A well-documented protein-protein interaction is the binding of the regulator protein Gal4 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a modified version of the Gal11 regulatory protein Gal11P ( Jeong et al. 2001 ). The transformation from Gal11 to Gal11P results in a mutation in only one amino acid ( Himmelfarb et al. 1990 ),"

Safety Concerns During Election of Project
In electing a project there were numerous ideas to be considered. They were divided into the following categories: the environment, foods, health & disease, physics/chemistry/biochemistry and finally other which included some more artistic ideas along with a few humorous ones (like the jeopardy bacteria – knows all the right questions).  Especially while thinking about medical ideas for implementing in the body we knew there were serious risk issues that had to be considered because of the many ways bacteria may interact with the human body.
During our closer investigations of project ideas, we also considered which bacteria it was possible to use. Our focus was to try and find a project that was possible to carry out by using E. coli. The reasons are that (cultivated strains of) E. coli are very well adapted to the laboratory environment since they are easy to keep alive, they can be fairly easy modified and unlike some wild strains of E. coli they no longer have the ability to thrive inside the intestines. Despite of these considerations we started out working on a project we called mE.chanic (because we wanted to make bacteria do mechanical work), and the idea was to have a culture of bacteria contract and relax, thereby making a pump-like movement creating mechanical work.
Our first project idea involved pili, but we decided it was unsafe, because of it's potential pathogenicity.
Now, we found out that we could use pili as some sort of ‘grappling hooks’ to make a connection between the bacteria. Pili from E.coli had been measured to have a pulling force of about 100 pN (enough to work a nano-machine), and so it seemed that we would have a good chance of making usable mechanical work if we continued this idea. We just needed to find out how to control the formation and retraction of the pili.
The project turned out to be most likely to succeed if we used the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, because it is very good at making the type"

Results: Reculture of one of the July 17, 2015 biofilms –Day 4
The 5 mL tube of LB media labeled “before” when bleach was not added had RFP cultures growing at the bottom of the tube. This showed that we were able to reculture the biofilm. The 5 mL LB media tube labeled “After” which had been washed with bleach contained no biofilm growth indicating that the bleach had degraded the 4 day old biofilms.

Vector Construction
We got the gene of INP from BBa_K523013 sent by iGEM, and the gene of intimin, autotransporter and VHb from Chen Guoqiang Lab in Tsinghua Uniuersity.  We used gibson assembly, goldengate and biobrick assembly to make our constructs with the pSB1C3 backbone. For each method we have built a standard procedure so that everyone can design the primers for construction alone by following the procedure. Thus we successfully built the vectors in need and used them to conduct the following experiments.
Test for surface display system
As mentioned in the design part, we used three kinds of surface display system named as INP, intimin and autotransporter respectively, and we linked them to the fluorescent protein to test their surface display ability.  The constructed vectors were transformed to E.coli (BL21) to express the interest protein. Two methods were used to test the surface display ability, one of which is watching the distribution of fluorescence after cell lysis and the other one is super-resolution microscope examination. The results of INP, intimin and autotransporter are shown in figure 1, figure 2, figure 3 respectively.

The forward primer was different for each of the 5 different 5mers on Davidson's campus and 6 different 5mer's on Missouri's campus. We only needed one reverse primer for each reporter gene we used. We carried our PCR using wild type RFP and Tet plasmids as our respective reporter templates.
We only used an aliquot amount to run a gel and verify that the sizes of the PCR fragments included the beginning of the reporter (with ATG and our 5mer) to the restriction site we chose.
Week 4 (June 15- June 19)
tRNA Project
We found that the variable to negative ratio of tRNA colonies was about 2 to 1. We saved liquid cultures of these and we re-ligated and re-transformed the tRNAs again.
Later that week, each lab member ""adopted"" a specific 5mer and tRNA for the rest of the summer. After verifying and plating tRNAs of correct insert size, we prepared samples of some tRNAs for sequencing.
5mer Reporter Project
We ligated cleaned and digested PCR inserts into vectors and transformed them. The vectors had been digested with EcoRI and either BamHI (Tet) or NcoI (RFP). Unfortunately, no colonies appeared on plates the next day. We repeated PCR to construct the first half of the reporter. We ended the week by verifying the insert sizes and cleaning the insert.
Week 5 (June 22-June 26)
tRNA Project
Sequencing for the tRNAs initially gave us 2 100% matches. The rest of the tRNAs had at least 1 ambigious nucleotide. We  decided to resequence these tRNAs. We also decided that we would use pBad as the promoter for these tRNAs. We decided that to use the pBad promoter for the tRNAs because it maintains low expression of the tRNA in cells, which is best for the them. We also entered our tRNAs into the parts registry.

5mer Reporter Project
We re-verified our PCR inserts and after cleaning/digesting them, re-ligated and re-transformed them. We obtained colonies this second time. After PCR screening the colonies, we chose samples that looked the right size for sequencing.  At the end of the week, we entered our 5mer reporters into the parts registry. 5mer Reporter Parts
