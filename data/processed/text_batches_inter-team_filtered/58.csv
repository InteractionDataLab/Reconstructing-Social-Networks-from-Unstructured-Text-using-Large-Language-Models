DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#results#Copenhagen_-_-_TEXT.html," the human CYP's, which unfortunately delayed their cool project. Furthermore, the elimination of the illegal restriction sites by site-directed mutagenesis caused a lot of trouble because of the number and positions of the restriction sites. When we met mid-July, Copenhagen had spent a lot of time trying mutate the illegal restriction sites, and they still had to eliminate a lot more.
Fortunately, the assembly standard that we have designed is easily adapted to any molecular biology research project, and in this system there is no need to eliminate restriction sites. By using our system they would be able to save some time, which would allow them to proceed with other parts of their project. This was a great opportunity for us to test, if our system really could be customized and applied to a random research project. It was also a fine opportunity to test our assembly system and the expression of the Plug 'n' Play plasmids in bacteria.
In the beginning of the project we planned to construct a plasmid from scratch with both the Plug 'n' Play with DNA and the Standard Assembly of BioBricks, so we could compare the two systems. Due to our late entry into the iGEM competition we did not have time to compare the two system ourselves. However, the Copenhagen team tried out both systems and compared them for us. Another part of our collaboration has been practicing our presentations and giving each other constructive criticism as well as testing each others wiki pages.
The figure below illustrates the process that the Copenhagen team had to go trough with the Standard Assembly of BioBricks compared to assembly with our Plug 'n' Play with DNA standard.
When more than one illegal restriction site is present at a certain distance of each other, more than one round of site-directed mutagenesis by PCR has to be performed. A circular arrow in the figure below illustrates this.
Work conducted for the Copenhagen Team
We in total created seven BioBricks for the Copenhagen team; these parts and our standard backbone plasmid were intended for assembly four different plasmids. Two with human the human CYP's A2 and C9 as well as two with the plant CYP's 79-A1 and 79-B1. All pre-produced parts for the assembly were delivered to the Copenhagen team for them to assemble according to the Plug 'n' Play standard. The two plant CYP's were assembled without problems. The human CYP project was however put on halt. The two constructed plasmids with CYP79-A2 BBa_K527001 and CYP79-B1 BBa_K527002 are illustrated below.

The newest methods of water condition maintenance is to exchange the pond waters to make both automatic depuration with a method of biological capture; for instance, the water for mullet farming swaps with the one for conch cultivation, using the conch to clean the excreta or food residue and then drain to the gutters so that the water would not cause eutrophication.
The customer of fish farm
The main customer group depends on the types of the fish variety. For the ordinary fish variety, it will be sold directly to market or market makers, but for the rare type, like eels, it will mostly send to market makers. For more special type—indoor fish farming, it’s mainly for the fish with supper commercial value, especially for fry, such as eel larvae. This fish variety requires higher technique and expenditure; the relatively larger-scale farmers would own the pond and there are specific sale accesses.

Seminars
(1) Co-organized Taiwan iGEM Conference
During the Taiwan iGEM Conference that we co-organized with Chang Gung iGEM team , we are in charge of the creativity and brainstorming activity in order to let all participants get to know each project well. This activity we designed can be split into two parts: First, the “teamwork section”. Each team should introduce their own project and let other teams’ members think of other possibilities or better solving methods to tackle the problem. At the end of this section, each team will collect the feedbacks and give a quick presentation. This activity is really successful since each team did get a lot of inspirations and find out some blind spots from other iGEM teams. For example, NCTU Formosa has a problem of controlling the drug-resistant presented in organisms, which is still a huge environmental issue nowadays.
[ Figure. 4.1-1 ] We hosted the creativity and brainstorming activity in the iGEM Taiwan Conference.
As for the second section, in order to consistent with our own project, we've designed a forum about the environment: Life X Technology X Environment. We’ve designed three problems for each group to solve. First, give a solution that combines with microorganism and daily products"

Currently, shells range cost $40-$50, but Bill Morgan said he would spend $100-$200 for what we were offering, which would still be less than some other products on the market. This willingness comes from the fact that each case of mastitis could cost up to $300, and would permanently scar infected cows so that they would produce 10% less milk for the remaining duration of their milking days. Any way to decrease mastitis is therefore looked upon favorably. In addition, since he is able to identify the strain of bacteria for each case causing mastitis on his farm using a special plate, choosing a specific bacteriocin for treatment is better than traditional antibiotics. He also said that the microscope and app we were designing would be either more convenient or less costly than current management techniques for mastitis."
KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Law&Patents_-_-_TEXT.html,"Bricks. This idea of having genetic parts available to everybody is completely new. The biotechnological community finds open-source a big hurdle, as our market model is based on which IPR portfolio there can be protected to control a certain monopoly on products. The new developments in synthetic biology lead to a totally different market model in which everybody could produce new applications and copy already existing ones.
The K.U.Leuven iGEM team wondered if something entirely new is created out of open source Bio-bricks, is it then possible to patent this new application? It was interesting to learn that in order to get a patent there has to be a, what is called, ‘intuitive step’ in the application. A patent application using open-source BioBricks would be turned down because all underlying steps are publically available. Even an unskilled person could make the same thing, so it’s necessary to include an inventive step, which can only be performed by experts.
Our discussion got even more intriguing as GMOs are created from little pieces of DNA that exist in nature and that are put together. The big difference with BioBricks is that one can look-up in a database which bio-bricks already exist. The patents of GMOs are based on sequences that have not been declared to be publicly in advance of the patent application, so this is different to the BioBrick concept and can be patented. BioBricks have been declared to be publicly available, nobody can patent those sequences anymore and it would go against the open-source philosophy.
We wondered why people would invest money into BioBricks, if they cannot get profit out of it? As entrepreneurs are asking themselves, “How can I make the money out of it?” All this boils down in being inventive and creating a new kind of market model. For instance it often happens in pharmaceutical companies that as soon as a patent expires they find often a new way to administer the medicine and so even though the substance itself is no longer covered by patent law the device is patented. In this way they still can make money from their invention and create certain market monopoly.
At the moment there are people that strive to cover various types of medicine with special laws because of their high public value. In the interest of these important public applications non-profit models are interesting, but again that is for the Craig Venter's of this world who have a very particular viewpoint on these things. However, there is going to be a big debate or whether you got for a public model of research for bio-bricks or whether it goes for the private patent type approach. At the moment BioBricks are a relatively"

The PCR product consisted of the two target sequences, with about 200bp of junk DNA in between, and biobrick cut sites on either side. The results of the PCR are shown in Figure 6. We then inserted the linear PCR product into a pSB1C3 backbone. This construct was successfully transformed, mini prepped and sequence verified. Because TALE B was discovered to have a mutation, we have two versions of this construct. One has the original TALE B target sequence we created before we realized there was a mutation. The other contains the new target sequence we created for the mutated TALE B.
Figure 7. Kapa HiFi PCR using custom primers to extract construct of combined TALE target sequences [A] and [B]. The construct of the two target sequences contained about 200bp of junk DNA between the two target sites and was flanked by the biobrick cut sites on both side. Every lane shows bands at 500 bp and was expected at about 507bp. Some unexpected amplification is seen for this PCR. No contamination is observed in the negative control without template DNA. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
Protein Purification
After getting our DNA constructs ready, we moved on to express and purify them. We first did a mini expression of TALE A ( BBa_K1189000 ) and TALE B ( BBa_K1189001 ) to optimize expression of these TALEs. Figure 7 shows the Western blot we performed on the crude lysate of TALE A and TALE B. Following optimization we purified our TALEs using affinity chromatography through Ni-NTA columns.
Figure 8. Western blot of crude lysate of TALE A under and LacI promoter with TALE B . The blots were probed with anti-His antibody and at a concentration of 1:1000 raised in mice and probed with an anti-mouse secondary antibody at a concentration of 1:20 000. We see a band at 86 kDa indicating TALE expression.
Following the same conditions for large scale protein expression and purification we were able to purify TALE A linked to Kcoil ( BBa_K1189029 ) and TALE-A linked to β lactamase under a LacI promoter ( BBa_K1189031 ).

Clement Gallay continued with a general introduction about bio bricking. I thought that a lot of what she told was already known, since nearly everyone had a biology background. Yet it was a nice abstract about what we would be doing in the lab this summer.
Time flew by and at the beginning of the afternoon we got lunch in the canteen. It was a great moment to talk to the other team members and ask about their projects and experiences so far. After the lunch every team gave a short presentation about their project and their progression so far. That was a moment we could give comments and ask questions. Because we didn't have our final idea yet, it was a nice opportunity to hear different opinions about subjects we had in mind. Although the other teams were already a lot further than us, we are sure we can still catch up with them.
The day continued with a presentation by Anna Lauxen from the Groningen team 2014. She also gave us a lot of tips that were very practical. Maarten van den Nieuwenhof followed with an informative lecture about Human Practices in iGEM. Lastly Bayu Jayawardhana informed us about modeling in iGEM. He described the importance of modeling in Biology in general and the importance for iGEM.  After the last presentation of the first day, we stayed a while to have dinner with the team of Groningen. They ordered large pizza’s with beer and we had a nice time with the other teams about the long, but educating day. We went home satisfied. On the way back we had a little bit of troubles, but thanks to the beautiful singing voice of Hector we were able to come home without extra costs.
On the second day, the iGEM courses were hosted at the TU Delft campus. Unfortunately due to disruptions with the trains, the Groningen team were unable to join the gathering. Luckily, the team of TU Eindhoven was able to come to with the other half of their group, so there were a lot of new faces for us, and many introductions. At 10.30 we started with a lecture by Anne Meyer about tuning and troubleshooting engineered genetic circuits. It also included many tips and tricks to avoid problems. Aljoscha Wahls followed up with a presentation about Network Motives, a kinetic perspective. Timon Idema started his presentation about physics and modeling behind the iGEM project, and how you had to ask the right questions to use modelling as a tool. He also"
Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,", our conversation highlighted the regional specificity of transmission, directing us towards Bolivia as our focus country since it has the highest rates of congenital Chagas. We were also able to question Jalia about potential concerns highlighted through our meetings with HeLEX, such as the stigmatisation of Chagas disease in Latin America. An insight into the public opinion on Chagas disease was invaluable in designing our Chagas public policy that can be found by following the link below:
Applied Design
Dr Carol Lole Harris
Dr Carol Lole Harris advised us on the practical and social considerations involved in the application of our diagnostic in Latin America, based on her experience working in Paraguay. We discussed the current tests available for Chagas and Carol emphasised that a spot test would be by far the best option for a multitude of reasons. We then took this forward as a key criteria for our device. Carol spoke to us about the necessity for a clear output system that would cater to all education levels and not require specialist training to interpret, as this could limit its use in some places. This reaffirmed our idea of using blood clotting as an output in our device which will have a clear unsubjective positive/negative result. Following these discussions, we spoke about the practicalities of obtaining a blood sample for our diagnostic. Carol mentioned that finding professionals who can take blood could be difficult to find at all times, so a finger prick test would be better. This corroborated our previous research and information from other experts in this area. Our modelling later confirmed a finger prick test would be feasible even with the lowest concentration of cruzipain.
Tim Ring
Tim Ring, is the vice president of safe-tec sales and marketing and generously sent us MICROSAFE® pipette samples so we could test the compatibility of these with our kit design. These pipettes are advantageous for blood collection, as they eliminate the requirement for lining the collection tube with anticoagulant since they use a medical grade thermoplastic shown to delay FACTOR XII of the coagulation cascade. Using the samples provided by Tim allowed us to test our applied design more rigorously, and obtain information such as the the time taken from blood collection to delivery to the assay chamber being only 30 seconds.
Sarah Dragonetti and Dr Ben Riley
Sarah is a registered nurse who we contacted to evaluate our 3D printed kit prototype. She liked the good fit of the flat pipette hole, intuitive size and shape, and timestrip which would be a useful tool during busy periods. However she recommended the use of a window so the emptying of the pipette could be seen to prevent"

There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening programme and a set of quality.
Adequate staffing and facilities for testing, diagnosis, treatment and programme management should be available prior to the commencement of the screening programme
Clinical management of NSCLC is optimized by NICE. NICE would be in charge of creating management and monitoring plan for our test, were it to be used clinically. Our test would actually free up healthcare staff and facilities. Early detection would reduce the number of cancers diagnosed at later stages where the only option is palliative care, which is more expensive than earlier stage treatment.
This in turn would free up healthcare staff and facilities. [12]
Information about the test and its outcomes must be understood by the individual being screened.
Potential participants should be provided with evidence-based information on the purposes and potential consequences of the programme so they can make an informed choice.
Decisions about the screening interval and sensitivity of the process should be scientifically justifiable to the public
When the individual is being screened, information, similar to that on our wiki, could be presented to them. Evidence for the efficacy of screening could only be given once clinical trials have been carried out. The screening interval could also be optimized from these trials.
All other options for managing the condition with cost effective intervention should have been considered
This is not applicable to NSCLC - early detection is required to reduce mortality rates - when detected late, it can only be treated palliatively.
If people carrying a mutation are identified through screening, their natural history should be understood, which includes psychological implications.
If the test is for a mutation or a genetic variants, the method and means for findings to be kept under review, should be clearly set out

Education
After running a couple of workshops relating to synthetic biology, it was clear to us that genetic modification was seen as dangerous, or unsafe by most younger students. Bacteria were generally seen as risky to work with as many people did not realize there were non-pathogenic strains. Often synthetic biology jargon would cause people to turn off. This was not only the case with younger students, but with adults as well.
We therefore changed our approach to engagement - focusing on making our project more accessible and therefore more exciting. We came up with real world scenarios to pique interest in synthetic biology - from diagnosing disease to reducing the impacts of climate change. We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rect"

Human Practices for Gold Medal
Judging Criteria
Expand on your gold medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Our Human Practices
For qualifying the criteria of the gold medal in Human Practices, we expanded the human practice activities from acquiring the general opinions that reflect on related issues to integrated human practices that help us calibrate the project design and execution in a more creative and direct way.
Here are the human practices well-tailored for the extended human practices. The context elaborating on the details of each activity, please see the link.
1. Study—Expert Study
In the expert study, we have consulted two agricultural experts in National Chung Hsing University and Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute about the methods of feeding assays. The two experts have aided us in providing protocols, pest data, larvae sample that greatly facilitates the research our project.

3. Education—Board Game
This year, we have created an exciting board game that not only promotes the logic of synthetic biology but also propagates the idea of our project. It is called “Gene Armageddon—The Pest Crisis.” The rule of the game is built upon biobrick construction, and the process of the game is based on the evolution. We have played the board game with iGEMers in the conferences. The feedbacks are all satisfying.

Miniprep of 17H, 17J, 17L
Experimentor : Liz Geum
Aim : To acquire 17H, 17J, 17L from 5-mL overnight cultures inoculated yesterday
Results : Cultures of 17H/J/L, which were grown in 5 mL of LB and Chlor overnight, were miniprepped. (The colonies picked were from transformations done on July 7.)  With the products, we did the three following things.
did a restriction digest with EcoRI and PstI to confirm the presence of an insert
prepared each plasmid for sequencing to confirm the sequence of the insert (and the presence of the yeast consensus sequence, which we hoped to remove)

Figure 8. Samples of our parts that were converted to Prussian Blue ferritin were mole balanced in order to ensure that the same number of effective ferritin cores are present in every sample. Additionally the ferritin-coil fusion was incubated with the TALE-coil fusion part in order to allow their binding for a separate trial. Negative controls include unconverted recombinant ferritin, bovine serum albumin and a substrate only control. Samples were incubated with a TMB substrate solution for 10 minutes at a pH of 5.6. Absorbance readings were taken at the 10 minute time-point at a wavelength of 650 nm. An ANOVA (analysis of variants) was performed upon the values to determine that there was statistical difference in the data gathered (based off of three replicates). A t-test was then performed which determined that the * columns are significantly different from the ** column (p=0.0012). Neither * column is significantly different from each other (p=0.67).

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#MAGE_-_-_TEXT.html," is a insufficient method to quantifying MAGE frequency.
Showed that the knockout of mutS has a significant effect on the transformation frequency
developing a procedure for repeating MAGE in Bacillus
Materials
The protocol specially made for this procedure was followed. This protocol takes approximately 6 hours for every cycle. Four cycles was run.
 
Results
We had problems with finding the optimal dilutions. This cause a lack of data for some of the samples, new cells were re-plated from the glycerol stock of the differed MAGE cycles, but the same problem was encounted again.  There was a high variation in the amounts of transformants on the plates. We recommend to use the OD calculator for making an approximation of the correct dilution factor.
 
Figure 9. The frequency for the insertion of the streptomycin phenotype can be seen for the samples.
It seems that mutS::beta is better than the wild type, mutS::GP35 and amyE::GP35. The experiment indicates that many MAGE cycles gives a higher yield than a single cycle, but the data is inconsistent when looking at Figure 4. The experiment will need to be run with a better method of testing if the insertion has been incorporated into the genome.
Surfactin
Overview
To test if the MAGE method could be used to change the affinity of the A domain in a NRPS. The A domain in the 5th module of the synthase producing surfactin was changed and results were verified using using MALDI-TOF. Results indicate that the desired change was incorporated. The production efficiency of the bacteria was strongly reduced.
 
Achievements
showed that the MAGE method can be used to change the specificity of a A domain in the surfactine synthase
 
Experimental design
Surfactin is a surfactant cyclic lipopeptide produced by Bacillus subtilis important for sporulation in B. subtilis[8] and is used as an antibiotic[9]. The cyclic peptide of surfactin is produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS). AntiSMASH prediction of adenylation domain specificity corresponds to surfactant. The NRPS modules are divided out on three contigs (ctg1_354-5) with 3, 3, and 1 module, respectively as shown in figure 1

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Late presentation of symptoms was identified as the biggest challenge in its diagnosis. This played a role in our decision to choose NSCLC as our tool could be used to screen patients, and achieve the early diagnosis that would reduce mortality rates.
Tests are usually only done once symptoms appear - as this is when the patient goes to their doctor. Unfortunately, for cancers like NSCLC, symptoms usually only appear once the cancer has metastasized and can only be treated palliatively. Early detection is vital as survival rates are much higher in earlier stages - stage one NSCLC tumors can easily be excised surgically.
Attribution: Philippe Verdy, in public domain
Screening
As the primary application of our sensor would be in screening, we carried out research into previous attempts to screen for NSCLC. This allowed us to gain an understanding of the problems with existing technologies and how our tool could be an improvement.
Screening for NSCLC is attractive due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease in its early stages, and relatively good prognosis when detected early. Numerous trials have been carried out to investigate the efficacy of low dose computerized tomography (LDCT) in improving mortality rates for NSCLC. Previous trials have shown other screening methods such as sputum cytology or chest radiography to produce no reduction in mortality rates. The national screening trial in America showed with LDCT, a 20% reduction in mortality rates from lung cancer in high risk groups compared to X-ray. [1] However, the benefits of screening remains highly controversial due to high rates of false positives leading to unnecessary further testing, thoracotomies for benign lesions and associated cost.

The meta-analysis performed by Gopal et al. showed that using LDCT to screen high risk individuals 70% of lung cancers were diagnosed at stage one compared to the 16% detected at stage one during routine care. However, the benefits in early detection may be outweighed by the limitations of the screening method. The screening arm produced a massive number of false positives - for every 9 stage one tumors detected, there were 235 false positive nodules and 4 thoracotomies for benign lesions performed. Compared to the control, the false positive rate was a 3.1 times larger and patients"

Project Description
Bacteriophages are the most abundant organism on the planet (estimated at 10 31), yet they are still the most uncharacterized.  Historically, bacteriophages have been used to study basic processes of molecular biology.  Recent developments have shown that phages are an untapped resource for future technology.  For example, phages are used in medicine (drug delivery and phage therapy) and nanoparticle technology (flexible batteries). The goal of the 2013 BYU iGEM Team is to expand the usage of phages by providing a library of well-characterized phage and show how phages can be used to address cholera, a world problem.
Although a natural library of phages already exists, only a few have been approved by the FDA for human use, such as T4 and T7. This approval process costs upwards of $100 million and limits the application of phages.  Our goal is to create a library of modified T4 and T7 phages with varying capsid sizes through mutagenesis, purification, and selection.  Researchers can choose phages with the appropriate capsid size from this library based on their needs. Such a library expands the useful capacity of these phages, avoiding the full expense of FDA approval for untested phages.
To demonstrate the utility of phage, we built a phage-based enzyme delivery system to address the worldwide problem of cholera. Cholera affects 3-5 million people around the globe each year, is transmitted through contaminated water sources, and is infectious when surrounded by its biofilm. Most prevention methods require a large infrastructure and current treatments target symptoms rather than the cholera itself. Our goal is to transfer quorum sensing genes from cholera into E. coli, allowing it to detect the presence of cholera. When cholera is detected, E. coli will"
Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"1. Quorum sensing
We investigated two quorum sensing systems for this sensor: the N-Acyl Homoserine Lactone (AHL) sensitive Lux pathway, and the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) sensitive Lsr pathway.
Lux
The AHL-sensitive Lux pathway was characterized in A. fischeri, but is also present in various bacterial species, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, commonly found in large numbers in human waste and sewage .  Large populations ofA. fischeri express bioluminescence.  However, the bioluminescence from a single bacterium would be too low to detect, so in low populations their luminescence is downregulated to conserve energy.  The Lux system relies on two parts: the Lux promoter, a very weak constitutive promoter; and the LuxR protein, which, in the presence of AHL, binds the Lux promoter and enhances its affinity for RNA polymerase.  Both the Lux promoter and LuxR protein were available in the registry, which made them suitable for immediate use.
Lsr
The AI-2-sensitive Lsr pathway relies on a transmembrane protein (LsrACDB) to import AI-2, which is then phosphorylated by LsrK, allowing it to bind the repressor protein LsrR, which detaches from the p LsrA and pLsrR promoters, enabling transcription.  This pathway is used in E. coli to regulate biofilm formation[ source ] and is present in many other bacterial species as well.  However, few components of this pathway were available through the Registry, and the ones that were available did not appear to function as intended.  As a result, we had to have many of the relevant parts synthesized, making use of IDT’s generous offer .  Following the delivery of these parts, we used Synbiota’s RDP system to quickly assemble several large constructs ( BBa_K1799020 , BBa_K1799021 , and BBa_K1799022 ) in a matter of hours, which were then used to begin to characterize the Lsr quorum sensing pathway.
2. Nitrate sensing
 After researching common chemicals in feces, we saw it has been reported that  there is a 100% increase of nitrate in water from 20-40 mg/l. A quick search showed that there are two parts listed within the IGEM registry that are able to detect nitrate"
UofC_Calgary,2016,Team:UofC Calgary#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," to be more time-efficient and less resource-intensive.
Our last construct does not fall into either of the two previous categories. The construct is an integration cassette, which is a mix of both the mBBI and Comk constructs. Our cassette contains thrC integration sequences which flank the sec and TD1 tag. However, the mBBI sequence is replaced with the restriction sites for BamHI and XmaI restriction enzymes. Addition of the restriction sites allows for directional cloning of any desired insert, allowing B. subtilis to be used as a platform for future biotherapeutics, creating a portable mini-pharmacy.

State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start.
Be clear about what you are doing and how you plan to do this.
You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.
Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.
Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.
Start documenting your project as early as possible; don’t leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines visit the iGEM 2018 calendar

3.3 Improved model
3.3.1  Competitive effects of two substrates on the same enzyme
Although we used the relationship between the Michaelis-Menten equation and the chain reaction to obtain the expression of butanol, the model only considered the case of single enzyme reaction. However, bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase was used twice in the reaction, and different substrates competed for the enzyme. In this process, we assume that the substrate has no inhibition during the reaction.
As shown in the figure above, the two substrates combined to share the same enzyme can be approximated as a competitive inhibition kinetic equation:
\[\left[ {{E_f}} \right] = \left[ E \right] - \left[ {ES} \right] - \left[ {EI} \right]\]
(10)
\[{k_m} = \frac{{{k_r} + {k_{cat}}}}{{{k_f}}}\]
(11)
\[{k_1} \cdot \left[ {{E_f}} \right] \cdot \left[ S \right] = \left( {{k_r} + {k_{cat}}} \right) \cdot \left[ {ES} \right]\]
(12)
Equation (12) is based on the law of mass action, combined with equation (11), can obtain a model considering substrate competition:
\[{{\rm{v}}_{{x_6}}} = \frac{{d{x_6}}}{{dt}} = {v_{{x_5}}} - \frac{{k_{cat2}^{AdhE2} \cdot {x_6} \cdot \left[ {AdhE2} \right]}}{{k_{m1}^{AdhE2}\left( {1 + \frac{{{x_6}}}{{k_{m1}^{AdhE2}}}} \right) + {x_6}}}\]
(13)
\[{{\rm{v}}_{{x_7}}} = \frac{{d{x_7}}}{{dt}} = {v_{{x_6}}} - \frac{{k_{cat2}^{AdhE2} \cdot {x_7} \cdot \left[ {AdhE2} \right]}}{{k_{m2}^{AdhE2}\left( {1 + \frac{{{x_7}}}{{k_{m2}^{AdhE2}}}} \right) + {"

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," we can print lines with a resolution (thickness) of down to 1 mm. We were able to successfully print and image of up to 4 layers of bioink with only little mixing between the layers. Our prototype passed its final test in a collaboration with the iGEM team from Groningen confirming that it can not only be easily used by any other iGEM team, but also is even compatible with the different strain they were using, B.subtilis.  Although redissolving jellified alginate becomes more challenging with size, our bacterial cells were able to survive under alginate dissolving conditions for 36 hours.

Introduction
Since the 1980s numerous applications and materials have been developed for 3D printing. Nowadays, starting from a computer generated three dimensional image file (stereolithography .STL) metals, plastics or even food can be printed in any shape imaginable. Recently, significant progress has been made in the three dimensional printing of mammalian stem cells towards creating  artificial organs within many renowned research groups all around the world working in the field. Since 3D bioprinting has high potential and is still largely unexplored, we set out to find a novel application. Inspired by machine-specific properties: precision and reproducibility, we came up with the idea to print cells in a structurally defined pattern. In this way we intend to meet the increasing demand of reliable product testing in medicine and health applications.
In the following pages, we describe the development and the printing conditions of our prototype.
Making 3D Biofilms
Biolinker: From 3D printer to a Biological System
Normal 3D printers generally follow the same principle: a raw material is transferred into liquid state by melting, or utilization of a fine powder, to obtain high precision upon deposition of the material. At this point the material needs to form a  stable, solid structure,by cooling  it, or using UV"

I’ve been working on considerations of project safety, including physical containment and kill switch options, as well as ensuring that lab practices follow the safety protocols outlined by our demonstrator. I’ve also been in the wet lab, focussing mainly on molecular cloning. I’ve helped in outreach as well, helping to create presentations for summer schools, and helping to promote our project on social media. Finally, I’ve helped to code up the wiki.

As chief chemist I have been in charge of making beads to encapsulate the bacteria (and vodka) as well as having far too much fun making up litres and litres of fluorescent solutions. I have been part of the interface between the wet-lab and the modeling by producing experimental data on the diffusion rates out of the beads. Along with my time in the wet-lab I have contributed to ensuring all of our content is coded up for the wiki; as well as taking artsy pictures for the headers.

Last summer I spent six weeks interning in a UTI clinic and laboratory, and so this summer I’ve spent 13 weeks attempting to destroy the very part of those those patients’ urine samples that brought me such happiness. In particular, I engaged in Human Practices outreach with Doctors and patients at the only UTI clinic in the country and when not doing that I threw a little of my fairy stardust onto the wet lab in the form of PCRs and Cell culturing as well as secret handshakes.

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," are crucial. We are planning to add new tools to improve graphs.Our     ultimate aim is finding best pathway based on automated construction     and input-output relation. BioGuide 2.0 will be more faster because     we are planning to use OODBMS and all all platform will support BioGuide     2.0.
Long term plan:
We want to improve our algoritm and add more parameter to make graphs     more effective. Our dream is embeding our software into partsregistry.org     so no mere iGEMers will choose parts in real time by using our software.
Suggestions based on PartsRegistry Survey Results
First suggesiton is offering fartnership with Google for easy search     and founding a committe to enforce a standardized nomenclature for terminology     and parts registry entries.
We strongly suggest starting a forum on how to quantify the performance     of promoters and genes to bring an easy to measure standard for the     efficiency of the parts. Additionally iGEM should assume the responsibility     and provide the measurements for the each promoter and gene included     in the distributions. The second choice would beeven better in terms     of standardization as all the measurement will be performed by one center     under similar conditions and with experienced researchers, which will     allow user to compare and contrast the efficiencies of the parts more     accurately. We suggest excluding the parts not-working, low rated or     with negative feedbacks from the annual distribution plates but still     archive them and make their data available through the parts registry.     So the while the individuals labs are receiving plates with higher rated,     fully working parts for their projects, anyone who wants to work on     a more exotic part can search through the achieves and re-vitalize the     parts stored there. The challenge of re-vitalization of parts can be     encouraged as an collaborative effort. We are sure, all of us would     like to see gene-protein and pathway information if these information     was integrated into the database and offered automatically for each     entry in the database. We are planning to provide this information about     the parts to all parts registry users as a build-in option in the next     version of BioGuide in iGEM 2011.
Database Standardization
Two main focuses of our project was the organization of the available     information about Biobricks on iGEM’s website and development of a software     application to help synthetic biologists at the experimental set-up     level by providing all available construct combinations for any given     input and output relations ,which they can utilize for their own project.
Normalization and re-organization of the part information at iGEM"
Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KaraNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", we write a method stub for the Permutations tab for Kathy and Consuelo's Eugene code, and start with backend.
11 - 12 Jul 2012
Started with backend. Couldn't find the old code I'd started, should've checked it in, so we started from a clean slate. We updated the Parts to hold registry data sheet information, to make all of that available for building later. We got text input search to work and filters look lke they're doing something, but they're a little questionable and returning very few results. So that bears looking into a bit. We also implemented one of the element menu controls, but are debating the viability of the remaining two and considering switching them to something else.
A minor UI update, but it changed the appearance a lot: wrote an algorithm to arrange ScatterViewItems in their containers, so they don't just show up randomly all over the place. It works alright, although we have some exceptions that are giving us trouble now. Also considering simply switching the svi to WrapPanels, which will expand to fit content and allow us to scroll when there are too many Parts to be shown at once. We need to make a dummy data sheet so the Eugene/Permutations team doesn't get a bunch of exceptions when they try to test.
13 - 14 Jul 2012
Here's something new but important: threading. Currently search is a slow and resource intensive process that causes the UI to hang while it operates. Apparently this is because the main UI thread is taking care of creating the search and trawling the parts registry. So the idea for that is to create a new, separate worker thread that does the search in the background while the main UI thread remains responsive to user input, and with a progress indicator so they know what's going on with the search. Easy enough in concept? Really tough in practice! I think I understand the code but when it comes to doing it, I can't! I'm not sure where the problem lies, since the separate thread won't throw exceptions on the main thread. But I do know it has something to do with how I'm getting it to make the search or with search itself - there's something incompatible there.

Learned how to use the incubator with shaker and how to operate the Moraes lab  Thermocycler and Spectrophotometer (details uploaded to Wiki).  Also investigated the ideal rbs sequence for our genes. According to From Genes to  Clones, the rbs should be 4-9bp upstream of ATG. It's stronger if you add adenines  upstream of the RBS and it comes before minor genes in an operon. If we're interested  in operon expression we must keep the stoichiometric balance of each minor gene by  preserving the native rbs sequences.

Proof of Concept
The core of our system is the combination of the library with a mutation system and a selection system, to optimize binding proteins to Evobodies. To get in this directed evolution process, some binding proteins must show at least a marginal affinity to the chosen target protein. Low affinity binders then get mutated and selected in vivo during plasmid replication and cell growth under a rising selective pressure. To make sure, that the designed binding proteins work and that the initial libraries contained some useful Monobodies and Nanobodies, respectively, we performed a phagemid display , using phagemid pAK100 and M13 derived helper phages.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," very good. An almost linear relationship was obtained when data were normalised with the sensor value taken in the dark room (the latter set at zero) without using the cuvette holder (1-(sensor value/sensor value in absolute dark)), presenting the sensitivity of the sensor to different intensities of light. This behaviour was expected due to the changing offset affecting the luciferase spectrum curve at different light intensities. The offset, using our data, was calculated to be about 0.2V for each dilution. A second graph is shown which takes into account this offset (and removes it), thus showing the presence of blue frequencies. The result was as expected, as the presence of blue frequencies throughout the dilution series is not only detected, but also found to be approximately constant. The raw data of this investigation can be found in the Lab book.
Normalised sensor data using a dilution series of bioluminescent E.coli- Concentrations on the x-axis are relative therefore an OD 600 value was also taken
Normalised percentage of blue frequencies using the same dilution series of E.coli
Dilution series of E.coli starting from the most concentrated on the left (number 1) to the least concentrated on the right (number 4). Cuvette number 5 is our control, as it contains only LB
Once the sensor was tested for sensitivity, we tested that our circuitry correctly identified different frequencies (colours) of light. As can be seen below, measurements taken from orange and blue light yield values respectively above and below those from white light (our reference point). The data was taken using constant intensity of light for each case (V.High and V.Low brightness, as specified in the application). This was done with the aid of an Android phone and a specialised software application, called Color Flashlight, downloaded from the official Market.
As expected from the potential-divider design of our circuitry, orange and red frequencies caused the resistance of the LDR with the orange filter to decrease, leading to a higher voltage across the LDR with the blue filter. The opposite effect was observed with blue light. The reason that the white reference point is a bit lower than 2.5V (the expected value for a non-biased circuitry with a 5V source), is because we use resistors of total net resistance 1.67 kΩ before the blue LDR. This was done to bias the circuitry towards blue (i.e. decreasing the starting value, thus the sensor identifies always a bit more blue - this can be shown in previous graphs"

Chloramphenicol resistance cassette
The coding chloramphenicol resistance sequence together with its promotor and ribosome binding site was amplified by PCR out of the pBluescript plasmid with the complete insert from the first phage cloning strategy (see figure 2.3.1). The terminator BBa_B0015 was amplified by PCR out of its standard plasmid pSB1AK3 as well (see figure 2.3.2). Because of the overhangs added by PCR the chloramphenicol resistance could be digested with KpnI/HindIII and the terminator with HindIII/SacI to generate sticky ends, necessary to ligate these two fragments in pBluescript digested with KpnI/SacI. A control digestion showed, that this ligation was successful (see figure 2.3.3). In the next step, the whole chloramphenicol resistance cassette was amplified by PCR out of pBluescript (see figure 2.3.4) in order to add the standard prefix and suffix to ligate it finally in the standard plasmid pSB1A2. A control digestion can be seen in figure 2.3.5. Finally, the EcoRI restriction site within the chloramphenicol resistance cassette, which isn’t allowed by the BioBrick standard, was removed by mutagenesis PCR. The finished part was confirmed by sequencing (using VF2 and VR) and a control digestion (see figure 2.3.6).

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Components_-_-_TEXT.html," Pumps
We have adopted the design of syringe pumps from the 2016 BostonU_HW Team, Neptune. Neptune originally utilized these pumps to input fluid to microfluidic devices, but we have integrated them to TERRA in order to actuate control valves on microfluidic devices.
Actuating valves of CIDAR Lab microfluidic devices typically requires manually applying a negative pressure to control ports and the PDMS layer using syringes. This then requires the scientist to stay by the microfluidic chip throughout the entire experiment and allows for human error. By utilizing syringe pumps,  TERRA allows scientists to automate experimental processes and reduces error.
The syringe pumps are comprised of 3D-printed supports and servo motors. The 3D-printed supports include mounts for servo motors and syringes, as well as an arm that attaches the servo motors to the syringes. The arm allows for the conversion of rotational motion of the motor to translational motion of the syringe plunger. This system enables scientists to automate actuation of valves, thereby controlling the selection of output fluids from a microfluidic device.
Click here to learn more about how we integrated and improved on Neptune's syringe pumps:
Improving on Neptune
TERRA includes both front-end and back-end software to collect data, process data, and control hardware accordingly. The front-end software, the UI, is where the user will directly interact with TERRA while the back-end software is responsible for controlling the XY Plane and Control Syringes.
User Interface
The UI is an intuitive web application that enables the user to interact with TERRA. The interface is designed so that it takes the necessary experiment information from the user and sends it to the device. The user will enter how many outputs their microfluidic chip has, the flow rate on the microfluidic chip, and properties about the fluid itself (density, continuous vs droplet, etc.). Given this information we are able to use our TERRA droplet predictive model to calculate a dispense time. The user can then select which wells each output should be dispensed into. This information is sent to the Arduino and enters the back-end software components. The video below demonstrates how an experimenter would use the UI.
The UI is able to facilitate communication between the user and TERRA through the use of Peripheral Manager, a daemon that runs on the workstation and facilitates communication between cloud-based applications and hardware connected to the workstation. This communication link uses WebSockets, a communication protocol that enables two way communication between the browser and server. Peripheral"

According to the literature, there are multiple parameters in regards to the sequence design which must be considered, including optimization of the dynamic range - tight regulation with a high level of expression. Furthermore, the post-transcriptional nature of this strategy may be more susceptible to leaky expression, which for our purpose, is highly undesirable.
Integration vector plasmids were also prepared, and ready for transformation of B. subtilis.
Week 7: June 23 - 27
We continued our efforts in building the repressor construct, consisting of Pveg + RBS [for E. coli] and one of five coding sequences for a repressor protein. A similar repressor genewill also be made consisting of two variants of an RBS - a RBS consensus sequence for B. subtilis and an RBS that works in both E. coli and B. subtilis.
The two RBS’s that will be used in B. subtilis were synthesized, because they were not immediately available from the iGEM kit plates. This week they were inserted into a plasmid, after several attempts.
We have also been dealing with logistical problems in ordering the synthesis of our reporter construct ‘skeleton’ - that is the Pveg + [operator] + [RBS] - that will be used to make reporter genes with different reporters.
Week 8: June 30 - July 4
Attempted once more to clone the three different synthesized RBSs into a plasmid. Since the parts are so small they are difficult to verify, however, it appears that they were successfully cloned into a plasmid vector and into E. coli. Subsequently the constitutive promoter, Pveg, was inserted in front of the RBS.

Week 9: July 7 - 11
While waiting for synthesis of our reporter genes, we are looking for a similar gene- promoter + operator + RBS - to amplify out to use for testing our system, preferably from B. subtilis. However, since we do not want to have our system overlap with the native regulatory systems in B. subtilis, we will again attempt to assemble the reporter geneusing the parts that we have.
Continuing efforts to make our own ‘generators’ (e.g. RFP_gen) that is relevant to our project - using"

Created a database_to_pigeon.py that pulls information from the database that is used in pigeon commands
Talked with yesterday Tiffany about the database_to_pigeon.py
Worked with Tiffany to check her code and how it works with database_to_pigeon.py
Established with Valeriy, Gary and KP information necessary to produce the final CyNetShare visualization. Two files will be created nodes.txt and edges.txt nodes.txt will have the following information Node_ID, Name, Type where type is either intermediate, transition or operon. Type may not be used during the creation of the json but this information may be necessary for CyNetShare. Later the Type can be mapped to the Node_ID dictionary style edges.txt will have the following information Source_ID, Target_ID, Math (Probably just for visualization purposes in CyNetShare simply as a text to see a label). Math is only important for transitions nodes. Later the Math can be mapped to the Transition_Node_ID.
Skyped with Fred so he can help me out with the Miriam ID using the Bioservices Module as well as helping to create the nodes.txt and edges.txt for the website team.
Talked with Jenhan and through a mention transitions tables decided to include the in the database. This may cause some denormalization but it makes it possible to look up specific transitions. This includes a transitions_input table and a transitions_output table. The good thing about these tables is that they can be made from data we have already captured and provide a Transition ID for them. Transition_input Operon_ID TO_ID Intermediate_ID Transition_output Intermediate_ID TI_ID Operon_ID Made some test data for Valeriy using the test database

These bacteria, in place of MotA and MotB proteins, use homologous membrane proteins PomA and PomB. These proteins function as Na+ channels and ensure that the necessary energy for flagellar rotation is generated as Na+ passes along the channel. Furthermore, in bacteria that use Na+ channels to power their flagella, there are MotX and MotY proteins which are localized in the outer membrane These two proteins stabilize the binding of PomA/B proteins to the motor Flagella that work by Na+ have greater speed and rotational power that those that depend on H+.
Figure 2. Schematic diagram of the proton-driven bacterial flagellar motor. The flagellar motor consists of a reversible rotor made of FliF, FliG, FliM and FliN and a dozen stators, each of which consists of MotA and MotB. FliF forms the MS ring within the cytoplasmic membrane. FliG, FliM and FliN form the C ring on the cytoplasmic face of the MS ring. OM, outer membrane; PG, peptidoglycan layer; CM, cytoplasmic membrane.
Both MotA and PomA proteins have 4 membrane-spanning region, a huge cytoplasmic fold and a C-terminal end. Yet MotB and PomB has only one membrane-spanning region.
Figure 3. Arrangement of transmembrane segments of the MotA/B complex, which consists of four copies of MotA and two copies of MotB. The view is from the periplasmic side of the membrane. The complex has two proton conducting pathway shown by orange ellipsoids. 
In work by M. Homma et al, a host of chimeric proteins were generated by combining different parts of the stator proteins (MotB and PomB) from the two systems mentioned above. .  Many experiments were done to show the activity of the chimeric stator proteins and to identify the most effective of these.  According to their data, the most effective protein was (PotB59)(PomB7E) which was generated by combining the N-terminal tail of PomB with the periplasmic C-terminal tail of MotB. . In order to understand how effective this protein worked, many experiments were conducted with this chimeric protein in combination with MotA and PomA.  According to results"

For housing applications, it is important that our mycelia has adequate structural integrity - we have begun to address this concern via materials testing. For filtration, one risk is that the mycelia will somehow contaminate the actual water being run through it - and one way we are addressing this concern is by killing the mycelia before using it to filter water. For off-earth applications, it is also important for our bacteria/mycelia to not contaminate the planet. Based on discussions we had with NASA's planetary protection officer, we have incorporated additional precautions against interplanetary contamination (including killing bacteria/mycelia via extreme heat, and only growing mycelia within plastic shells to limit exposure to the planetary environment). Thanks to our multiple post-doctoral advisers with many years of synthetic biology lab and safety experience, our primary investigator, and government-mandated inspectors from NASA for ensuring careful training and vigilant maintenance of safety standards."

From 2008.igem.org
The Minnesota iGEM '08 team consists  of groups working on two different projects. One team is located primarily in Minneapolis and is designing a comparator for their project. The other team is based in St. Paul and is working on a time bomb.
Team Comparator
Control systems are an integral component of almost all aspects of life. Whether it is in industrial, biological, or chemical applications, controllers provide a way to keep systems functioning properly. A vital part of any control system is the comparator. This component compares a set point value and a measured value, and determines which is larger. It then sends the appropriate signal to the controller, which reacts to bring the system back to the set point. In typical applications, the controller equipment is electronic. However, our team set out to create a comparator using only genetic components. This comparator could potentially be used as part of a new, solely biological control system that could be used to treat many diseases afflicting humans, for example diabetes. This comparator could compare the blood sugar of a patient to what it should be, and send this result to a control system that could compensate, for example by changing the levels of insulin.
In order to undertake this task, a system involving six genes was designed. For our system, the two inputs (one representing the set point and one representing the measured value) are IPTG and ATC. These inputs will activate the transcription of the LacI and TetR proteins, and set in motion the rest of the system to produce the outputs. Depending on the amounts of the two inducer molecules added to the system, either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or red fluorescent protein(RFP) will be produced. The actual design of the system can be seen below. In order to complete this project, a total of six genes will have to be cloned into plasmids, and two new BioBrick parts will be produced. One will be a TetR and p22-MNT dual-repressed promoter, and the other will be a LacI and lambdaphage cI dual-repressed promoter. We will also build mathematical models and conduct computer simulations that will help with the designs. This project will pave the way for other parts of a true genetic PID controller to be produced, which could be an exciting scientific development in the near future.

1.Learn from bladder caner professor Mr. Cai
We’ve been thinking about what we can help in face of the deadly disease. Cancer is a ominous word for most Chinese people especially for the old generation that used to be conservative. On the other hand people find it helpless when they were diagnosed as cancer. Since then we not only conducted a survey on synthetic biology and bladder cancer but also interviewed professor Mr. Cai Zhiming who has abundant experience in terms of the therapy of bladder cancer to search the way out. Professor and also the director of Shenzhen Second People hospital told us that the effect of different therapies varies depends on patients’ body condition and also the psychological states. Sometimes the physical condition is largely influenced by the mental states. However most sufferers inclines to isolate themselves and thus fear of death grow day by day. It is proved as we tried to reach the patients but only receive refusal.
The significance psychotherapy for cancer patients
Referring to the group psychotherapy which originally means a form of psychotherapy in which one or more therapists treat a small group of clients together as a group now include any helping process that takes place in a group, including support groups, skills training groups and psycho-education groups. We realized that some principles group psychotherapy shares may help those cancer patients. For example, the recognition of shared experiences and feelings among group members and that these may be widespread or universal human concerns, serves to remove a group member's sense of isolation, validate their experiences, and raise self-esteem. Studies also indicates clear evidence for the effectiveness of group psychotherapy for depression: a meta-analysis of 48 studies showed an overall effect size of 1.03, which is clinically highly significant. But the reality is hospital in China rarely apply this form of therapy to help those patients. Another reason is because cancer patients usually refuse to talk about cancer even themselves were deceived by their family concerning the fact would depress the suffers.
3.Mr Tumor，Go Away From Them!
Having learned the overview, we came up with the idea to set up the platform similar to group psychotherapy for cancer sufferers to communicate with each other. The trial to obtain approval from hospital was turned down as usual for several weeks. In this case,we tried to reach the Cancer Mutual Aid Association and gladly both sides agreed to help. On Sept 12th SZU-iGEM teams and cancer sufferers gathered in Bijiashan Park ready for the meetup. Team members joined the sufferers to do the exercise which believed to be beneficial for keeping a calm mind prior to the meetup. The communication started later with a 67-year-old"
DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," have made a small PCR to test the viability of the lysates as template. In this PCR we have the colony lysates 1,2,3, a positive control using RFP (0023) and a negative control. We have reduced the annealing temperature to 49*C and otherwise we have tried to keep the parameters the same. Should we get good results, we will retry the colony PCR using the lysates and the new conditions. Should the results fail us, we can consider to try to use Q5 PCR on the lysates or make a new batch.
6/9/2018
Gel results from the lysate PCR test: The PCR results from the experiment on the 5/9 were run on a gel. We can see that there are some results, which suggests the lysates are not the problem. This could mean that it was the annealing temperature which was too high, that was causing the problems.

Experiment: Colony PCR of transformants.
A colony PCR of the Gibson transformants was prepared, with 5 colonies picked from each plate. This was done early in the day, which may not have allowed the RFP-expressing tranformants to show yet, thus increasing risk of picking a wrong transformant. A one Taq-PCR was performed with verificiation primers at 53 degrees celcius.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Lab#Hydrogel_-_-_TEXT.html," Changing the environmental conditions turned out to be essential.                           By carrying out the initiation at 4 °C, we could delay the onset of the polymerisation reaction and allow ice                           crystals to grow more rapidly in the gel. These new environmental conditions with the standard chemical equivalents of APS and TEMED,                           resulted in firm and strong hydrogels.

Figure 3. NMR of Dex-MA with a Degree of Substitution of 60
Characterization of the degree of substitution
The degree of substitution (DS) of the methacrylated dextran chains was characterized using 1H-Nuclear                          Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy based on the method described in the paper by Plieva et al. (1) The                          spectrum was measured in D2O. The DS is calculated as (100x)/y, where x is the average integral of                          the protons at the double bond at δ 5.7 and δ 6.1 ppm and y is the integral of the anomeric proton                          at δ 4.8 ppm. The 1H-NMR spectrum can be seen in figure 3, which is the same spectrum as the one reported in                          the paper. (1) Our methacrylated dextran has a degree of substitution of 60.
Microstructure characterization with Scanning Electron Microscopy
To characterize the microstructure of our dextran hydrogels, we performed Scanning Electron                          Microscopy experiments. For the exact experimental details about these experiments                          and sample preparation, see the Protocol section. We could confirm that our hydrogel forms a                          super macroporous structure, with  pores on the micrometer scale. In figure 4, you can see the                          microstructure of our hydrogel at different length scales.
Figure 4. SEM images of the hydrogels with a DS of 60. Different length scales are shown at different positions, illustrating the supermacroporous character of the hydrogel.
Generating different hydrogel prototypes
We adapted the shape and size of our hydrogels depending on the experiment.                          Below the different prototype gels we created can be seen.
Patch prototype
This hydrogel (figure 5) was synthesized to investigate if the outcome of our modeling experiments can be realized with our hydrogel. The modeling results showed that a thin hydrogel with a thickness of approximately 1 mm would be the thinnest hydrogel still capable of killing S. aureus effectively. As we want our hydrogel to be as thin as possible while remaining effective, we synthesized this 0.75 mm thin hydro"

2) Receptors presenting an extracellular avidin variant.
These avidin derivates, by design, allow the functional fusion of the otherwise tetrameric avidin molecule with our receptor. Two different variants were used here: The so-called enhanced monomeric avidin, a single subunit avidin that is able to bind biotin as a monomer, and a ""single-chain avidin"", which resembles the naturally occuring avidin tetramer, but has the subunits being connected via polypeptide linkers. By linking the C-terminus with the N-terminus of the adjacent monomer the whole tetravalent avidin has only one N- and one C-terminus and can thus be fused to a type-I membrane protein for surface presentation.
Both receptor types generally serve the same purpose: By interacting with the complementary component in the printing reservoir, cells are being cross-linked due to the polyvalent binding of streptavidin molecules to polyvalent biotinylated proteins.
The general, modularized design of our membrane proteins (which we did for prokaryotic cells such as E. coli and eukaryotic cells such as HEK cells) is generally comparable (see Fig. 1). In both cases the expression of the membrane protein is controlled by a promoter and secretion into the endoplasmic reticulum or the periplasmic space is enabled by a appropriate signal peptide. Following the signal peptide the functional extracellular domain (biotinylated or with biotin-binding properties) is fused as a protein fusion in RFC [25] by an antibody binding site that can be used in experiments do quantify the surface presentation of the synthetic membrane protein. The membrane insertion is in eukaryotes enabled by using a simple single-span transmembrane domain and in prokaryotes by using a bacterial autotransporter that integrates into the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. By using this modular design, which is even cross-kingdom functional, we enabled future teams to present various protein domains on the surface of bacteria and mammalian cells and successfully generated cells to test our inventive bioprinting approach.
Prediction of signal peptide functionality
For determining a signal peptide suitable for our construct, we tested a total of three signal peptides - one taken from the parts registry, and two designed by ourselves.

Note. If the total volume exceeds 800 µL, the solution can be added to the column in stages. After the addition of 800 µL of solution, centrifuge the column for 30-60 s and discard flow-through. Repeat until the entire solution has been added to the column membrane. Close the bag with GeneJET Purification Columns tightly after each use!
3. Add 700 µL of Wash Buffer to the GeneJET purification column. Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow-through and place the purification column back into the collection tube.
4. Transfer the GeneJET purification column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, add 50 µL of Elution Buffer to the center of the GeneJET purification column membrane and centrifuge for 1 min.
Note. For low DNA amounts, the elution volume can be reduced to increase DNA concentration. An elution volume between 20-50 µL does not significantly reduce the DNA yield. However, elution volumes less than 10 µL are not recommended. If DNA fragment is >10 kb, prewarm Elution Buffer to 65°C before applying to column. If the elution volume is 10 µL and DNA amount is ≥5 µg, incubate column for 1 min at room temperature before centrifugation.

3/8: Transformation of pUT18-OBP2A into BTH101 E.coli strain.
Aim of Experiment: To perform a transformation of pUT18-OBP2A into BTH101, so that a subsequent transformation of pT25-OBP2A into the same chassis can occur as both plasmids are required to reside in the same chassis so that their interaction can be observed.
Protocols Used: Transformation
Results: N/A
Next Steps: If the transformation is successful, then the next stage of experimentation will be to re-transform this culture of cells using the pT25-OBP2A plasmid.

Aim of Experiment: To perform a day culture and then a subsequent transformation of the BTH101 chassis containing  pUT18-OBP2A from the transformation performed on 3/8.
Protocols Used: Transformation
Results: N/A
Next Steps: If the transformation is successful then the next stage of experimentation will be to observe the  protein interaction of the two subunits of OBP2A using MacConkey agar plates.
5/8:Day culture and plating of positive colonies from transformation onto MacConkey agar.
Aim of Experiment: To perform a day culture and then subsequent plating of positive colonies from the transformation performed on the 4/8. Positive colonies from this transformation contain both vectors of the bacterial two hybrid system along with the two subunits of OBP2A and so now the interaction can be observed. The day culture will be plated onto MacConkey agar which once the cells have been given enough time to grow will give a visual demonstration of the  protein interaction through a color change.
Protocols Used: Transformation
Results: N/A
Next Steps: It has been decided that whilst the E.coli strain BTH101 that is being used in this experiment is useful for visualizing protein interaction, it is very unstable. A better E.coli strain called MG1655(Δcya) will be used instead as it is much more stable. This means that tomorrow overnights will be prepared of MG1655(Δcya)for transformation with pUT18-OBP2A and then subsequently pT25-OBP2A.

William_and_Mary,2017,Team:William and Mary#Build Connections_-_-_TEXT.html," and they liked the presentation format but others told us that they found it very confusing. Based on this feedback, our team decided to create explanatory materials that were simple, concise, and understandable as a way of explaining our iGEM research to someone with a high school biology background.
We felt that the best format for making an accessible explanation would be a video. In order to accomplish this goal, we collaborated with a high school student to create and edit the video script. In order to make this most useful in the context of Virginia Public Schools, we adapted the materials to respond to Virginia’s state Standards of Learning for high school biology students. This ensured that we did not include information that a high schooler in our state would not yet know, as well as aligning the materials to the incentive structure of teachers within the public school system.
After finalizing the script and creating a storyboard for the video, we filmed the drawings, recorded a voiceover, and edited both. We published the video on the W&M iGEM social media accounts, as well as YouTube, and reached about 750 people from these platforms alone. The video also plays on a TV screen outside of our lab, so we have reached many students, professors, and visitors this way.
Our team received a lot of feedback on this video, both online and in person. Everyone who talked to us expressed that the video was an understandable explanation of our project, so we feel that we have accomplished the main goal of producing materials that would be understandable to a general audience with a high school biology education. Often, people stop outside of our lab to watch the video and become interested in talking to our team more about iGEM and our iGEM project, so the video has also had the added benefit of informing members of our college community about the research we do.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#MutationModel_-_-_TEXT.html," described a rational in-silico homology modelling procedure. Our goal was to determine the specific mutations of an Esterase enzyme, which would slightly adjust the wild type Esterase enzyme’s catalytic activity. First, we have determined the possible locations of the binding pocket and active center by performing sequence alignments. Secondly, we assessed the possible structure of the esterase by comparing it to the structures of closest neighbors. Then, we have added synonymous mutations in the binding pocket in order to slightly change the catalytic activity. Finally, we have experimentally tested the esterase mutants, and showed that they indeed had adjusted catalytic activities.

Further applications of bisphenol A degrading BioBricks and enzymes
Beside the use in a biosensor, BPA degrading BioBricks could mainly be used in bioremediation approaches in BPA contaminated water or soil. If it was possible to determine and isolate the genes which are responsible for the complete degradation of BPA to substrates that can be used by bacteria as a carbon source, it would enable the bacterium carrying these BioBricks to grow on BPA. This device under the control of a BPA inducible promoter, transformed into bacteria living in a BPA contaminated environment, would be a selective advance making other selection markers such as antibiotic resistance unnecessary. For bioremediation approaches this would be an interesting advance, because genes for antibiotic resistances which could potentially be passed to other bacteria via bacterial conjugation, are not released into the environment. The release of antibiotic resistance genes always bears the danger that these find a way into pathogenic bacteria strains creating multi-drug-resistant pathogens. A device which enables bacteria to grow on BPA as the only carbon source would not generate this risk in bacterial-based bioremediation approaches and therefore enhances the biosecurity of such an approaches.

BBa_K2149001 . This part contains the HPPD gene, which encodes the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase enzyme. Ok, you got us, this is not the last step... But it ain't the fourth either... So this would be the 3.5 optimization step. The produced enzyme, as its name suggests, remove oxygen from the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (p-HPP) substrate. The oxidation results in homogentisic acid (HGA). This acid is really important because not only it is used with PPP to form MPBQ, but also because HGA presence is the limiting step to our synthesis. This optimization incresa the formation of the composite, enabling a better and more efficient synthesis.
VTE1. Okay, now we have the true last step. 4/4. This one is the VTE1 gene, which encodes the tocopherol cyclase enzyme. What it does? Well, it takes the MPBQ and closes a cycle in the molecule, turning it into delta-tocopherol. The delta-tocopherol is than methylated, finally forming our precious product, the alpha-tocopherol.
Just like the genes from the alkanes complex, these were also synthesized into gBlocks and assembled together using Gibson Assembly. This would result in a composite part, which we unfortunately were not able to finish in time.
The three GGH, HPT and Crte genes were taken from the Synechocystis sp genome. The VTE1 gene has Arabidopsis thaliana as its origin and the HPPD gene is derived from Pseudomonas putida.

Seven substances were chosen as new attractants for our “tracking E. colis”: some were taken because of structural similarity to L-aspartate, the target of the tar receptor, others because of medical relevance and a third group was made up by just subjectively interesting chemicals. The first substance was D-aspartate, which is the enantiomer of L-aspartate. L-aspartate-4-benzyl-ester was chosen because of its structural similarity to L-aspartate. Another substance was 2-Ethyl-1-hexanol, which can be detected in the breath of lung cancer patients (Filipiak et al. 2009). The well known stimulant caffeine, the flavoring substance vanillin and  geraniol, the smell of roses, were tested additionally. Finally, sodium cyclamate was chosen, an artificially produced sweetener. The mutational library of the tar receptor, our receptor of choice, was produced by focus group #3 . Here, focus group 1 designed a selection system for the “tracking E. colis” (Fig. 2A).  In our system, the BL21 cells containing the mutagenesis library of the Tar receptor were dropped on 0.3 % tryptone agar plates with the attractant soaked into Whatman paper placed in the middle. The clones that moved the fastest towards the attractant and the reference strain were selected in three successive rounds and the plasmid DNA of single clones was sequenced (see results of group 3).

One 1 mL cryostock of the library was thawed and used to inoculate 50 mL LB-broth with chloramphenicol, the culture was incubated over night at 37 °C and approximately 180 rpm. 2. In order to reach a high cell density in a small volume1 mL of the culture was spun down for 10 min at 1.5k X g. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in the amount necessary to place 24 x 5 µl drops LB broth, which is approximately 200 µl. Alternatively, the supernatant was discarded by inverting the E-cup and the pellet was resuspended in the remaining liquid. 3. 7 x 12 cm plus one control Petri dish were filled with 0.3% tryptone swimming agar, a 2 x 2"

Liyana
Why did you take part in iGEM?
I like that it’s beyond just doing research. I like that it goes beyond the lab and tries to bring forth exciting applications to real-world issues and problems. We also get to work with people outside our fields, so broadening our perspectives is always good.
What was your responsability during this project?
I overlook the entire project (vice-head), was in-charge of one of the wet lab teams and head the creative team.
What did you learn from this experience?
Articulation of scientific ideas, or even, ideas in general. Other than that, I think I learned how to deal with different kinds of people too.
To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
I guess I am more interested in working in a dynamic environment after working in iGEM. I used to be more interested in just doing research.
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
These days, it’s a lot of CRISPR-Cas9 technology (since it’s pretty popular) ; I think about pharmaceuticals and GMOs in food, and bacteria. I think also because it is a field with massive potential that has not been tapped on to its fullest, I think, too, about the possibilities that biotechnology that offer to us.
Nanda
Why did you take part in iGEM?
To expose myself to synthetic biology and international competitions, to be involved in a meaningful project, as well as to gain more experiences.
What was your responsability during this project?
I was the team leader, and I was involved wetlab, collaborations, marketing and human practices
What did you learn from this experience?
A lot of biology knowledge, experimental skills, social skills, and about my weaknesses.
To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
The society can be intimidating sometimes.
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
Biotechnologies allow biology to be applied in real life.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of the disease. That is the problem we are facing now and I think therefore there are major efforts to design new vaccines strategies. We know that normal vaccines strategies, like done in the past for virus diseases are not working in malaria. In my opinion that is why there is so much new science in malaria research.
iGEM Hamburg: Is malaria linked to climate change? Do you think it is possible for malaria infected mosquitoes to come to countries where they were not before?
Dr. Jacobs: No, I actually think this is more for virus diseases, for example West-Nil-virus and dengue fever. There are certain mosquitoes which can come to Germany and I think their introduction will be faster if we have higher temperatures. But with malaria, we must keep in mind that we had malaria in northern Germany for quite a long time. The major question is how to control the vectors. Each country in Africa that has an economical situation of growth made major steps forward. Malaria can be controlled to a big extend if they have vector control programs, screening programs and the people have access to medication. I think [...] [Malaria is] a poverty related disease and not so much related to climate change.
iGEM Hamburg: Alright. Do you think that it is possible that in the future we see the Anopheles mosquitoes here in Europe?
Dr. Jacobs: I think that could be possible. But again, we have to keep in mind we have mosquitoes in Germany that are able to transmit malaria. So, we have had a certain case of airport malaria for example in very hot summers where infected people got bitten by a mosquito and then on a very small scale we can even have a small epidemic of malaria transmitted by German mosquitoes.
iGEM Hamburg: We have heard about gen-drive. Will this approach be pursued and why is it not used yet?
Dr. Jacobs: Well I think this is a very interesting technology and I think many labs are interested in this technology. There are even small-scale applications of the gene drive technology. But we have to keep in mind that we render mosquitoes, or we have genetically modified mosquitoes. I think there are major concerns about this technology and I think we should invest more into science and study this in depth before we actually start using this technology. We already have certain measures to control the vectors. For example, in the Region of the Rhein we tried and were able to control vectors to a very high extend. Without it we would have a lot more mosquitoes there. So I think we do not need the gene-drive technology, at least not at this stage.

All materials that contact with ethidium bromide were considered polluted and then they should be separately disposed of. (2) Molecular cloning of yeast To select the transgenic yeast we interested, the success one will grow up with drug resistance. As we have selected out the yeast wanted, the remaining medium is into the discard, but there is still great amount of yeast in it. If transgenic yeast which has drug resistance flows out, it might become booming and harmful in the nature. To deter from this happening, we added bleach into the medium or sent to sterilization for security. (3) Test of enzyme activity We detected the amount of total carbonhydrate with concentrated sulfuric acid and phenol sulfuric acid. They’re both strong reagent which may cause serious dehydration toward our skin. Besides the lab coat and protective gloves, we even wore goggles to prevent from any possible contact.
5.Any safety issues raised from the devices?
Environmental issue As the device will spray the transgenic yeast onto a paper, there might be a question whether it’s going to stay alive or not after the reprocess. The answer is negative because one of the process will heat to high temperature which kills the yeast for sure. Second, since our device isn’t sealed up completely, the yeast coming out from spray-head will be hard to be removed from the border of box and it might contaminate the gene pool in the environment if they’re not sterilized from the abandon boxes. Thus, we should treat the device a disinfectant to stay clean and safe after use."
