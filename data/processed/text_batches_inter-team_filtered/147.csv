Mutants comparison
In order to see better the differences between different mutants, we made two graphs: one showing the induction curves of all six mutants without ATC and one showing all six mutants with the maximal ATC concentration (2000 ng/mL).
No ATC:
Based on this graph, we can estimate the binding affinity of the mutants to consensus Ptet:
V36F, V36F W43S and E37A W43S T141A mutants plateau near 2500 normalized RFUs, which is the value observer for the wild-type without ATC. This means that these mutants can recognize and repress Ptet with the same strength as the wild-type.
Y42F K108E mutant reaches about 5000 normalized RFUs; this value is quite low compared to Ptet intrinsic strength but it is twice higher than RFP expression induced by the wild-type, indicating that this mutant recognizes and represses Ptet with less power that the wild-type
P39K and P39Q Y42M mutants induce very high RFP expression, 25000 RFUs being the maximal fluorescence obtained by the promoter alone. These data then hint at the fact that the two mutants are not able to bind and repress Ptet.
2000 ng/ml ATC:
These data tell us that some mutants are not as much affected by ATC as the others. P39K, P39Q Y42M and Y42F K108E mutants seem to be completely repressed, reaching the maximal RFUs of 25000 (based on Ptet characterization and wild-type TetR data). However, V36F, V36F W43S and E37A W43S T141A only plateau at 15000 RFUs. Still, their dose-response curves do indicate that we reached maximal TetR inhibition. A plausible explanation for this is that these 3 mutants cannot bind ATC properly anymore. There could be intrinsic differences in the cells used, such as endogenous TetR levels expression, but we used the same competent cell batch for all our mutant transformations.
Summary of the results
Our first reporter system allowed us to successfully characterize 6 of our mutants; these results are listed"

Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Results#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html,"). The parts required for the next steps of characterization were equipped with a the transcriptional  terminator Tadh by ligation into a pSB1C3 plasmid containing Tadh. The resulting assemblies were again BioBricks. These inserts were then ligated into the pRS shuttle vectors losing parts of their prefix and/or suffix. In total we have created 29 new plasmids!
Fig. 1: General assembly scheme: First, promoter and coding sequence were assembled in pTUM100 using the 3A-Assembly protocol. Constructs with the reporter mOrange were used for characterization directly. Subsequently, the promotor and the fused coding sequence are ligated into a pSB1C3 plasmid with the transcriptional terminator Tadh1. The resulting assemblies are again BioBricks. These inserts are then ligated into the pRS shuttle vectors losing parts of their prefix and/or suffix.
 
Readout
For the characterization of our repressible promoters Pfet3, Panb1 and Psuc2 we transformed pTUM100 constructs with mOrange under the control of the promoter of interest in the laboratory yeast strain w303 . We used the constitutive promoter Padh1 (sequence identical with BBa_J63005 ) as positive control. The promoter activity was analyzed qualitatively using fluorescence microscopy (fig. 2).
Fig. 2: Detection of mOrange expression in the fluorescence microscope. Non-transformed yeast was used as negative control. Fluorescence was detected using a RFP filter set (ET Bandpass 470/40, ET Bandpass 572/35).
 
Next, we established a protocol for quantitative read-out of mOrange fluorescence using the plate reader. We recorded an excitation spectrum of non-transformed yeast and yeast expressing mOrange measuring the emission at 581nm (+/- 25nm). Fig. 3 compares the excitation spectra with the ideal excitation spectrum of mOrange. While the fluorescence decreases with higher excitation wavelength for non-transformed yeast, the spectrum of yeast expressing mOrange has a similar shape than the ideal excitation spectrum.

The excitation spectrum of mOrange is indicated by a dashed line (source: http://www.tsienlab.ucsd.edu/Documents/REF%20-%20Fluorophore%20Spectra.xls"

Despite several attempts we have not been able to obtain BioBrick pyrG and pyrG-DR. Therefore we made a test with well-known primers without USER-tails (sometimes these USER-tails can be tricky). This was done to verify if something was wrong with the DNA template. The gel electrophoresis did not show any bands, and thereby it revealed that the DNA template was the source of error. Problem solved!
We also started cultivation of the mammalian cell line, U2OS, which is derived from a patient with osteosarcoma (bone cancer). They were defrosted and cultivated in DMEM medium containing serum, penicillin and streptomycin. The cell line was then transferred to a 25 cm2 culture flask, see protocol section.

Working Hard, Together
Aachen
In a bid to obtain more samples to view under our microscope, we contacted a series of European iGEM teams to try to get things that they were working on. Unfortunately, many teams were using the same organisms as we were or had restrictions on what they could send to us. Fortunately, the Aachen team was using an organism on which we were not working. They were kind enough to provide us with samples of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their transformed strains for us to use. We used the S. cerevisiae (which were of a distinctly different size than the other organisms we had observed) to help us understand the versatility of our technique with respect to finding the size and shape of organisms in a sample. An exemplary hologram showing these organisms can be seen on the Human Practices Silver page.
ULaVerne_Collab
The ULV iGEM team reached out to us as we were both working on transforming the same organism, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We video conferenced each other, and exchanged ideas and offered guidance on how they should proceed forward with their transformations. After the meeting, we provided them with a copy of our transformation protocol, along with tips and tricks that we found helpful when conducting our own transformations.
TU Darmstadt
When we met team Darmstadt at the Delft European iGEM meetup, they were greatly interested in our microscope. The discussions generated some interesting ideas that we used during the design and construction of our microscope. In exchange for information and guidance concerning the software and hardware that goes into digital inline holographic microscopy, they sent us a laser. We used this as a back-up during our hardware design and testing phases.
Lund
In April, we were contacted by the first ever Lund iGEM team. They were inquiring about mentorship. We provided guidance as to what to expect from an iGEM project, such as timelines, workload and mentorship on their local level.

Although protective agents can be added to reduce the harm of acid stress and frozen stress, the advantages of Lactobacillus lactis in anti-acid and anti-freezing are self-evident. And they raised the issue of safety, not only the safety of the bacteria, but also the emissions of the natural environment, and they encouraged us to add a suicide mechanism, which was consistent with our idea, so we considered the suicide mechanism in the design of subsequent experiments.
Education & Public engagement
A.  Education
    Based on our idea “Science for all”, we vigorously engaged ourselves into education and science advocating activities. All events have served for our final goal in long run: creating a science culture for all generations in our community in the future.
On June 22th The first station: Tian-E-Hu kindergarten
I. Science speech
    In this section, we introduced probiotics to children, and talked to them about the relationship between probiotics and our daily food, including yogurt, pickle and others. We also explained how probiotics work in our intestines. They showed great curiosity and asked us lots of questions about probiotics. We answered them patiently in an understanding way.
 
II. Drawing bacteria
     In this section, we asked the children to image how bacteria look like and draw them down. What they have drawn showed their rich imagination and understanding about our introduction.
     In summary, what we have done in Tian-E-Hu kindergarten enabled these children to understand the probiotics, and inspired their interest in science.
 
On July 8th The second station: the youth palace
     This section was meant for adults and teenagers. We made some display boards, which articulate and connect fundamental ideas in genetics, synthetic biology and iGEM without technical vocabulary and dense detail. Parents whose children was engaged with our other activities can come and listen. We got great feedback from them. They asked many questions and learned a lot in this section. This is also a mutual understanding between our project and its potential consumers.
 
B.  Communication with related Companies
    Eager to know market demands and trading policies, as well as solving problems encountered during the experiments, we went to visit several biopharmaceutical companies. In the process of communication with the company's R&D personnel, we first introduced our project and raised our questions, and then they provided us with some suggestions. In short, by communicating with corporates, we have gained a lot and what we learned played an important guiding role in the follow-up experiments.
（1）On June "
USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," cells of interest. Based on that, here we create a novel usage of GFP, splitting and reassembling.
GFP splitting
If we split GFP into two parts, it’s of high possibility that both parts won’t show bright green fluorescence, and if they can reunite into a “intact” GFP in some conditions, the fluorescence will appear. That is our primary idea. We are surprised to find that several research groups have been working on projects related to that, thanks to their experience and achievements, we can quickly get our idea started.
GFP splitting has two roles in modern bioresearch, one is detecting protein solubility, and the other is defining cell contacts and synapses in living nervous systems.
[Figure 2] GFP splitting & protein detection
GFP is first split into two frgments, and to have a better result, two fragments are not of the same size. A protein of interest (X) is fused to the smaller GFP fragment via a flexible linker. The complementary GFP fragment is expressed separately. Neither fragment alone is fluorescent. When mixed, the small and large GFP fragments spontaneously associate, resulting in GFP folding and formation of the fluorophore. Processes that make the small GFP tag inaccessible, such as misfolding or aggregation, which often happens when X is insoluble, can prevent complementation, thus there’s still no fluorescence[2].
[Figure 3] membrane contacts and synapses
Scientists have developed a system to label membrane contacts and synapses between two cells in living animals based on the proximity of the presynaptic and the postsynaptic plasma membranes, it is called GRASP (GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners). When the complementary fragments of GFP are fused to ubiquitous transmembrane proteins, GFP fluorescence appears uniformly along membrane contacts between the two cells. When one or both GFP fragments are fused to synaptic transmembrane proteins, GFP fluorescence is tightly localized to synapses. GRASP has the potential to greatly increase the ease of synaptic mapping, not only in simple and straightforward systems, but also in more complex systems, such as vertebrate brains, because GRASP should be immediately applicable in dissociated cells or slice cultures[3].
GFP reassembling
The two steps of using GFP in a novel way is splitting and reassembling, so if we can’t figure out whether the two fragments of GFP will self-reassemble or under what condition they will reassemble, we can’t start the experiment.

Please refer to our economic and cultural explorations as well as our interviews for more detailed research that helped us to consider these basic design requirements.
The encouragement of a lateral flow design is designed to help network with traditional health practitioners by making the technology look and act like malarial test strips already in use in the region.
The low cost associated with production due to thermostability of Grffithsin helps to make any rapid diagnostic test more economically compatible with the region.
The high degree of accuracy is designed to provide the highest available level of care in order to better inform people about their HIV status. This kind of knowledge, or at least access to it is one more step toward the de-stigmatization of HIV/AIDS in the region.

Introduction
Our attempts to fuse two segments originating from different organisms to design               a new receptor was met with great challenges.  These specific segments were the LBD               of the Human Estrogen Receptor α (hERα) and the cytoplasmic domain of Tar.
hERɑ is a human nuclear receptor that induces signal               transduction in response to estrogenic compounds. Despite the fact               that bacterial chemoreceptors are comprised of a two component system and               the hERα is not, we assumed that hERα will trigger the phosphorylation              cascade of the chemotaxis system, due to the conformational changes caused by the               estrogen binding to its domain. This led us to design and construct the new              hybrid: hERα-Tar (1).
Fig. 1: Predicted structure of human estrogen receptor (hERα) (3)
Design
The intein-gBlock was designed with the estrogen LBD site as the splicing inducer. The cDNA sequence was the source for the LBD in the intein gBlock.  This design provided the team an opportunity to easily extract the LBD and fuse it to HAMP domain, which is located at the C-terminal end of the last transmembrane segment of Tar, to get a final hybrid product hERα-Tar.  The new chimera was cloned to UU1250 to generate the new strain: UERT . To the best of our knowledge, this design and cloning has never been reported before.

In order to predict the feasibility of this new hybrid, a 3D model was made using the Phyre2 Fold Recognition server (3).  Later, in order to confirm the correct localization at both"

Hsinchu Girls Senior High School
Introducing Synthetic biology & BioWatcher at Hsinchu Girls Senior High School
Bringing the innovative projects in lab to the pubic is a step forward to adapting the ideas into reality. On one hand, practicality of the project is examined. On the other hand, it’s extremely exciting to spread the fun and the possibility of solving the unsolved using biology. Hsinchu Girls Senior High School collects top students in this city. With passion, we help the clever youngsters to get a glimpse of the amazement synthetic biology brings and hope to bring enthusiastic new bloods into the field.
On August 14th,we introduced synthetic biology, how it affects the world, how biobricks are built in lab, our project—BioWatcher and iGEM to these brilliant students. Upon the discussion about BioWatcher, the students were so excited and many questions were raised.
Since our project highly concerns health issue, we aim to raise public awareness about the importance of early diagnostics and early treatment. At the end of the session, we gave a quick survey about their blood test frequencies. It turned out that, as expected, only a few of them get blood tests regularly in hospitals and further confirm the necessity of BioWatcher.
TsingHua Bauhinia Day
Paying our maximum effort to promote synthetic biology, iGEM and the project of our team, we hope to introduce the fun and potential in biology to everyone and bring new enthusiastic blood into the biology field in Taiwan, where bio-industry is less popular than semiconductor industry.

Biotools
Our lab is conveniently homed at Inworks at the University of Colorado Denver, which has an array   of rapid prototyping equipment including laser cutters, 3D printers, CNC routers and mills, sewing machines,   and a full-stocked electronics shop. Our ability to utilize this space and the expertise and resourcefulness of   our members has allowed us to build many of the biotools we use day-to-day. A non-exhaustive list of biotools   we have built includes: a centrifuge, an incubator, an optical density and fluorimeter device, a refrigerated   centrifuge, and DNA concentration detector.
The fluorimeter and optical density sensor we built was based on a design by the 2014 Aachen iGEM team .   We improved upon their design by refactoring and commenting their code, redesigning the   cuvette holders, and improving upon the enclosure design. Diagrams   and our improved open source code can all be found on the Denver Biolabs Github.

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the interest of it. Now, a promising iGEM team is coming into formation and we will also support them theoretically and practically. The world is changing.   Except this, we were also invited to Shanghai Shixi High School, a famous high school to deliver a lecture named Synthesis + Biology = Synthetic Biology to expand their view. University: iGEM club During our summer vacation, we attended a sharing meeting with BIOS (Biology Intensive Orientation Summer) students who were learning basic biological technique to discuss our project and absorb positive opinion to polish our STEP system. Despite their relatively poor experience in research, but their fancy thoughts did inspire us and make our project more charming.
In Fudan University, iGEM exists as a club. In this semester’s giant meeting of all clubs, iGEM has attracted much attention from students of all majors and some showed great interest in iGEM. Through our introduction, they had a deeper understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology and got deeply fascinated by the idea. It’s predictable that next year, there will be more students fond of synthetic biology taking part in iGEM to share the fun.
3. STEP into Art
Are you attracted by our mascot on the poster? It’s a set of ""Tuanzi""（团子）！Really cute , aren’t they? Each represents one of our team member and instructor. Pipette, protein, E.coli, culture medium, camera, computer engineering… As part of our team culture, Tuanzi are our little bonus, for us and for other iGEMers. They were printed on sweaters and key rings, delivered to friends, instructors and others who gave us a hand during our preparation. Also we will bring them to Giant Jamboree. Thanks to them, more and more people come to know our team, realizing that iGEM involves more than wet-lab students. No matter what you are responsible for- human practice, modeling, art design and so on- we wish to express gratitude to every member’s effort in iGEM.
As a cutting-edge therapy, cellular immunology is really a hot spot. Mostly people only know it by the media, but hardly understand how it works. To make the public get acquaintance with the STEP system and how it comes to our mind, an animated video was created. Producing a video helps us reflect on the whole project design as well as plays an educational role.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

-KK Our transformations worked this time and we had several beautiful lawns of E.Coli. The E. Coli did NOT fluoresce either red or green to the naked eye. We haven’t yet looked at them under UV light. Clarisse streaked several singles, and also set up two overnight colonies. Kelton and I practiced streaking to singles for the first time, using old plates. We placed our E.Coli singles in the 37 degree room to grow, along with the overnights on the shaker. Most of today we spent presenting our progress thus far. It appears that bacteriophage K139 will not be very useful to us, as we will need to use E.Coli bacteriophage lambda for our system. Dr. Grose has ordered Lambda and it is on it’s way. Our goal is to incorporate the Lambda genome as a lysogenic prophage into the genome of E.Coli, and have that prophage remain dormant until the presence of cholera’s autoreceptor triggers the phage to be excised from E.Coli’s genome and become lytic. The lysogeny/lysis balance is determined by the relative concentrations of two proteins, CRO and CI. The two proteins are mutually exclusive; if one is being expressed, then the other cannot be expressed, because they share a promoter region. Expression of CRO triggers the events that lead to replication and lysis. Expression of CI induces and maintains lysogeny. Our plan is clone the CI protein into E.Coli following the Qrr4 protein and the CRO protein"

Archana Rachakonda
Archana is a junior majoring in Bioengineering. Though now a resident of Princeton, NJ, she comes from a humble background of grain farmers, doctors, and Kung Fu masters. Together, they instilled in her a great appreciation of raptors on hoverboards and lolcats. Archana traveled back in time and created DNA (dangerously nascent abacus), but unfortunately, an incompetent History intern misspelled both her discovery and name. Nowadays, she can be found in the Sacred Realm or, at night, in the shadows of Duffield Hall. She joined CUGEM last year as a spy for the Harvard team, but defected when she realized how much better Cornell is. She eagerly awaits the day when she’ll receive a CUGEM t-shirt.
Albert Li
My name is Albert Li. I have a passion for the extraordinary. Four words: corn maze laser tag. That is my dream. Glorious. Absolutely glorious. It's very relevant to biology too. Imagine this. Genetically altered corn that grows angularly or shrinks when approached by heat. An interactive corn maze. Just brilliant. Being an electrical engineer in a synthetic biology team is rather interesting. You tend to find many similarities. DNA nucleotides - bits and bytes. Ion channels or operon pathways - transistors or logic gates. My giant and inadequate brain - a lightbulb that never seems to turn on during team meetings and brainstorming sessions. Its been quite an experience. The realm of the biolab is both diabolically frustrating and teasingly rewarding. It will be cool to see whether what I've learned applies to my future or not. I can't make any accurate predictions, but for now it's just four words.

The Tale of Ghost and Elf: Chapter seven
Little Dot, Mr. Careless, Lily and Wind took little prince and Rose around the star of which they were so proud. Ecoli deserved their proudness because it was so beautiful a star where every site can be a place of interest from every point of view.
While the guests were enjoying their journey, Summer fabricated Firefly II, which would made it easier for Little Prince and his Rose to travel between Ecoli and their home star, B612.
“Bye, my dear friends, be sure to be back here often.” Little Dot held her tears and waved goodbye to Little Prince and Rose reluctantly. Who can resist to falling in love with so cute a person!
“Bye, Little Prince and Rose, I will miss you.” Mr. Careless was already crying.
“Bye, Little Prince, please feel free to turn to me if you have any problems in the future. Never forget I am the Flame Angel who protects the whole universe!” Summer pretended to be joyful to veil her sadness. She didn’t want to be parted with Little Prince at all. Fortunately, it would not be so difficult for Summer to visit B612 under the help of Firefly.
“Bye!” Wild Wind and Lily waved their arms, with numerous words blocked in their throat.

From 6 p.m. to 1 a.m., the public     can visit campuses, lecture halls and other premises of the universities and get to know about current     research topics and results. In the area of Franconia’s cities of Nuremberg, Fuerth and Erlangen there     is also one of these “Nights of the Sciences” – in which our iGEM-team was able to participate this year     regarding a presentation of iGEM itself, our project and our results. We were able to get the whole team     to look after our stand and tell the general public about our time with iGEM. It also served as some     kind of rehearsal for our presentation at the iGEM Giant Jamboree. Team members from Erlangen presented     the biological and chemical parts of our work as well as our engagement in collaborations and Human     Practise projects – our colleagues from Würzburg presented their app and enacted a survey about what     they could improve in the app for the presentation at the Giant Jamboree. Our project met with great     interest and many visitors wished us the best of luck for the Giant Jamboree.
Safety
As our system can be implemented in multiple devices outside the lab it is a crucial factor to guarantee     that it will not cause damage to the environment. A crucial factor is to prevent the genetically     modified microorganisms from entering the environment. As we were working with two stems Geobacter     sulfurreducens and Escherichia coli we had to rely on two different approaches for this goal. As     Geobacter sulfurreducens can only survive under strictly anaerobic conditions, that task is simple to     achieve as the culture dies immediately when exposed to the atmosphere.
For E. coli we chose a cell-free approach for our tissue to prevent contamination of the     environment. This consideration takes into account that cells in the tissue lower the performance of our     azo-dye based muscle as the cells in the tissue will not be contracted but remain as buffer likely     preventing a strong contraction. In the dielectric elastomer actuator tissue the E. coli cells will not     survive the mechanical stress in the tissue, which will rapidly lead to ruptures in the device. A     further aspect to work with a cell-free material is to prevent damage to the material by the bacteria     themselves as they may consume a significant amount of the proteins.
To obtain this cell-free protein material lyses of the E. coli cells is necessary followed by     purification via nickel NTA column chromatography."
British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#Patent_-_-_TEXT.html,"? Either way, it shows that iGEMers need to pay more attention to IP issues.  As for the other results, like expected, patents looks to be the most prevalent type of IP that iGEMers applying for IP protection is concerned about.  Now, if we look at the people who answered that they didn't want to consider getting protection, the majority of the people gave moral reasons and lack of effort as the explanation. We're hoping that our IP guide can help address both of these groups.  For the iGEMers who think tackling IP problems are too much work, a centralized collection of information (aka Team UBC's IP guide) may help them out.  As for the ones who don't want to seek IP protection, our guide can provide information for them to make informed decisions.  This aim really applies to everyone, because even people who don't want to get a patent/copyright/trademark themselves, they will still need to work in a world where these things exist.
Evidently, most respondents haven't been affected negatively by IP, or even been too bothered by it in general.  A lot of us also don't know if we have been affected! These two groups might not actually be mutually exclusive.
Opinions
Although 13% of respondents said they had been negatively affected by patents and 9% by other forms of IP, only 7% of respondents indicated they didn't want to protect their own IP. The majority replied that they wanted IP protection, which lets us know that an IP guide is something that would benefit a big part of the iGEM community.
There is a pretty even spread of answers as to whether BioBricks can be patented, but more than half think that we ''shouldn't'' patent them. Despite all of that, 75% of the survey-takers agree that iGEM teams are capable of producing projects that can be patented.  Seeing as how BioBricks play such a big role, to what extent should or can we patent iGEM projects, if half of us think BioBricks shouldn't be IP protected?
Conclusions
With a considerable sample size and responses from both students and advisors, our survey results are fairly representative of the iGEM community.  We've learned from the results that the majority of iGEMers want to learn more about intellectual property and think they will benefit from a custom-tailored guide, especially one on patents.  There were a lot of undecided responses, which indicate that many are probably lacking the background needed to take a stance.  Overall,"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Entrepreneurship#Main_-_-_TEXT.html," method would be easily adaptable to new developments in the doping world, keeping up with the rat race of doping user versus doping detector.
In contrast to these benefits, there are a few outcomes that doping authorities strive to prevent. False positive test outcomes must be prevented at all costs. A single false positive result could ruin an athletes career unjustly, so everything possible must be done to prevent such an outcome. Finally, they strive to lower the costs of detection methods as much as possible.
Value: Advanced Detection of Performance enhancement
The product we present is ADOPE, which stands for advanced detection of performance enhancement. The result is not a single kit, rather, it is a comprehensive step-by step method, including products (adapted kits and newly developed proteins), as well as services for more efficient testing and data analysis. The result includes a model for selecting the proper detection time , a sample preparation method for isolating trace elements of gene doping DNA from the blood, a pre-screening method to quickly screen and rule out many samples, an unique test based on targeted sequencing using a newly developed fusion protein , and finally a sophisticated, self-learning algorithm for data analysis to group the sequencing output in a reliable manner.
These products and services answer the needs from the anti-doping agencies in several ways. Our efficient pre-screen reduces costs and increases throughput.  The screen rules out most of the samples, leaving only a fraction to the relatively more expensive sequencing step.
Due to our highly specific fusion protein, our method sequences only a low amount of DNA. This reduces data-processing time greatly compared to methods based on whole genome sequencing . The sequencing step reduces false positive test outcomes, delivering a DNA sequence from the athletes blood as definitive proof of doping use. Thanks to the versatility of the target sequences we use to find doping DNA as well as our self-learning algorithm, our test is easily adaptable to new developments in the doping world. In addition, our test does not require expensive or rare laboratory equipment apart from the consumables supplied with the test, making it accessible to all WADA-accredited laboratories.
The products and services also relieve pain for our user by fitting within the current testing framework. Thanks to our detection window analysis, testing can be done at the frequency of regular inter-competition testing as executed by local doping authorities. Our test also facilitates compliance with data laws and athlethe privacy. Due to targeting specific DNA, only the data that is needed for a reliable test outcome is collected.
We have gathered expert knowledge on our process during our whole project. For a more in-depth analysis on which experts we spoke with and how they influenced our project, please see"

At first, all the readings came out as zero. After analysing our device we located the bug in Denver Biolabs' code and wrote a short solution. We later also removed some redundant sections.
You can download the fixed code from Github , however we recommend you use our far superior design using instructions below .
Our fluorometer and densitometer
We significantly improved Aachen and Denver Biolabs' design, having redone the most of the wiring and parts of the software. But we wanted to go further; we made our own combined fluorometer and densitometer, keeping only Aachen's cuvette holder design and their measuring principle.
Here we document the design decisions we made, how we built and tested it, and Judd-UK’s input to the design.
For the measurements, check out the measurement page .
Components
Our design uses only off-the-shelf components except for the cuvette holder, for which we couldn’t find an alternative. Aachen 2014’s design was good for this so we used theirs.
The key component is the Digispark, a USB-based development board similar to an Arduino except much cheaper, and with the ability to communicate with a host computer by mimicking keyboard events. It acts as a bridge between the light sensor and our interpreter app.
The device plugs in via USB so is compatible with almost anything, including desktop computers, laptops, phones and tablets. We created an interpreter application to be used on the device it is plugged into that can save the readings and convert them into common units transmittance percentage.
Our design is completely open-source by OSI standards [1]
Our code for both the device and the interpreter is licensed under the GPLv3 license
Our circuit design is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0

We’re using synthetic biology to change the way the world thinks and functions.
We’re a little disruptive, dangerous and maybe a tad too bold. But the world needs some shaking up every now and then, and we think we’re just the right people for that.
Together we’re going to engineer biology and create something awesome.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of the picture, the inversion is shown and at the bottom the process of translocation. All processes are depending on the orientation of the FRT sites, that are attached to the target gene region.
In general, Flp mediated recombination between these sites can lead to insertion, excision, inversion, and translocation of DNA, depending on the direction of the FRT sites (Figure 1). Using FRT sites that are oriented in the same direction, leads to Flp mediated deletion of the region in-between. (Sadowski 1995) .           This system works in Vibrio species like V. cholera or V. fischeri for rapid genetic modifications (Blokesch 2012) .
In order to establish a new and rapid method for genomic modifications in V. natriegens, we will use the FLP/FRT system to create our strains.
Integration
Abstract
The construction of stable bacterial strains for heterologous gene or pathway expression is usually done by chromosomal integration. Especially for the industrial application this has high priority, because continuous selection for plasmids is financial unsustainable. However, transcription levels vary between different chromosome regions. We therefore measured the growth of 15 different Vibrio natriegens mutants with integrated chloramphenicol resistance in different integration sites. Furthermore, we will characterize the gene expression in the integration sites by using the lac operon. By measuring its β-galactosidase activity the transcription level at this locus can be determined.
Introduction
Description Chromosomal Integration
Homologous recombination is a class of genetic recombination, in which a genetic exchange takes place between a pair of similar/ identical DNA sequences (Alberts et al., 2012) . Plasmids and linear DNA fragments, which carry sequences homologous to chromosome of the host strain, integrate into the host genome by homologous recombination following transformation (Cassey et al., 1991) (Cassey et al., 1991).
In order to achieve optimal flux throughput and omit unwanted intermediates, the expression of crucial genes in a metabolic pathway should lead to a protein stoichiometry that is as stable as possible (Dongmei Bai Flagfeldt et al., 2009) . This aspect is of special importance for industrial applications.
This can be achieved through chromosomal integration, as it rules out plasmid number fluctuations and the plasmid loss that sometimes occurs in bacterial strains.Another advantage of chromosomal integration is that it makes the use of antibiotics while cultivating obsolete, since there is no need to apply selective pressure to get mutants"

Abstract
This year, our team created a mathematical model to represent the series of reactions from Iron(II) ion concentrations in saliva to amilCP concentrations for our team’s system. We first had to decide whether we should model our final cell-free system (in vitro), or our in vivo lab work. An in vivo model would be advantageous, as it would allow us to compare the lab work we did to a model. However, we decided an in vitro model would be more appropriate. This is because the in vivo lab work was to test whether our construct worked, rather than finding a relationship between iron (II) ions and amilCP. We therefore felt a model to represent the relationship in an in vitro environment would better represent the final product our project aimed to create.
It should be noted that in a cell-free system, we would have to provide the FUR (Ferric Uptake Regulator) protein; in an in vivo system, the bacteria provides the FUR. Although it means we can easily increase the FUR concentration, FUR is very expensive (£130/5μg) [11]. We converted this value into something more useful. The molecular mass of FUR is 4047 [25] and the approximate volume of a paper-based system is 1µl, giving a value of 0.01372303¢ per nM.

Degradation Model
We used the degradation as another control in our Stochastic Switch construct in additon to IPTG and Xylose. While IPTG and Xylose control the expression of Hin, we designed an arabinose inducable degradation for Hin protein. Hence the width of the pulse for Hin expression can easily be adjusted by arabinose.
SspB protein regulated by arabinose binds to the modified ssrA tag and targets the Hin for degradation by ClpXP system.
We assumed that the species have the following inital concentrations. We took these values by running the model when there is no arabinose.
When the arabinose concentration is increased to 1000nM, Hin levels decrease sharply in 15 minutes.
The reason for this decrease is very obvious. Arabinose binds to AraR protein which normally repress SppB expression and SspB expression increases. As a result Hin proteins are targeted for degradation.
We haven't gone into much detail about the rate parameters of the ClpXP degradation system. We assumed that the system would degrade a 0.2 protein per second. However we changed this parameter between 0.1 and 0,8 at 100 intervals. Range of SspB and Hin concentrations are displayed below against 100 different values of the protein degradation speed of ClpXP system.
The diagran below shows the concentration of total Hin proteins (proteins that are free and bound to sspB) against SspB protein. X-axis represents SspB and Y-axis represents Hin. As it can be seen when Ssp"

The inducible temperature sensitive RNA structures will be tested by luciferase assays. Luciferase will be expressed under control of a standard promoter and temperature sensitive RNA. Luciferase is a 62 kDa protein obtained from the firefly. Luciferase catalyzes (in the presence of Mg2+) the bioluminescent reaction (1):
luceferin + ATP +  O2 --> oxyluceferin + AMP + PPi + CO2 + light (1)
The amount of light produced by this reaction can be measured and gives as a clue about the relative amount of luciferase present. The amount of luciferase present correlates with promoter strength and the effect of the temperature sensitive RNA present. As long as cells from the same bacterial colony (i.e. cells with the same amount of plasmids present and the same RNA temperature sensitive part and promoter) are handled, relative expression of luciferase induced at different temperatures can be compared. For creating variations in the riboswitch structures, we intend to introduce small (One or two mutations in the sequence) alterations in the DNA. We can achieve this, for example, by performing error-prone Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Screening of the resulting RNA sequence library could again be performed by LacZ screening at different induction temperatures. This way, we might be able to create RNA thermometers sensitive to different temperatures.
As has been stated before, FPP overproduction is needed to produce colored E.coli. In E. coli there is endogenous expression of FPP, it is produced by the DXP pathway. Simply overexpressing this pathway has led to only small increases in FPP production, as there are enzymes involved with very limited capacity. This is why we seek to overproduce FPP in another way. The color pathway we want to introduce consists of endogenous E. coli enzymes combined with enzymes ‘borrowed’ from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, some of the mevalonate pathway. It has been shown that this combination of enzymes is a more potent producer of FPP than the endogenous DXP pathway [7] . An overview of the compounds involved in the color pathway with names of the enzymes can be found in figure 1. To investigate the presence of the enzymes of the FPP pathway in transformed E. coli, we will screen for the products of the pathway in the transformed cells and compare them to wild type E. coli."

Human Practices Overview
iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .

Human Practice and what we did to help another iGEM team!
Macquarie University and Tsinghua University joined forces to build a better biobrick!
Tsinghua and Macquarie iGEM Teams have strengthened their bonds with Sydney Meetup and demonstrated a good example of Human Practice.
On 27 September, on behalf of Tsignhua iGEM Team, GU Xiang has paid a visit to Macquarie University. Yagiz Alp, leader of Macquarie iGEM Team, has welcomed GU Xiang and introduced him to other iGEMers at Macquarie. They caught Hilal on action in the lab. “I am so excited to finally see each other” said Hilal. They have visited the “iGEM Labs” at Biology and Chemistry&Biomolecular Sciences Departments. Bright scientist of Tsinghua was amazed by the technology used at Macquarie. Then it was time to get into action. Two teams have been helping each other for a long time and there were many questions to be asked many topics to be discussed.
They have started with biosafety and ethics topics related to the iGEM. Since Tsinghua Team is an experienced follower of iGEM, GU Xiang shared his team’s ideas about biosafety then Macquarie Team has explained what necessary precautions and action they took before starting their experiments. GU Xiang was surprised to see how strict the biosafety regulations are in Macquarie. After highlighting the essential points on biosafety and ethics, it was time for GU Xiang to demonstrate his expertise in Wiki-design. He shared his experiences with Macquarie Team how to build an effective and efficient wiki. Then presentation of projects took place followed by mind-blowing brainstorm and discussions. It was climax of the day when Yagiz Alp asked “why don’t we use our light switch system to screen and select your antibodies?”. Because the Macquarie’s"

Assessing the sustainability
Dr Adrian Higson discussed the necessity of plastics and the problems of their current life cycle. We expressed our major concerns; the feedstock materials and the sustainability of the process. As a result, the project gained great insight from the experience of Dr. Higson. He commented that in terms of feedstock, the use of agriculture materials is simple not feasible. The use of side products however is more sustainable and by using them we are making a good choice of raw material. We need to look at the energy efficiency, water efficiency, and conversion process. The GHG emissions and water footprint are not the only impacts to look at, we have to consider the social and economic sustainability of the production.
We also discussed the possible end-of-life scenarios, according to him the recycling of bioplastics and the final break of the polymer into monomers constitute a splendid way of tackling the waste problem. This also increases the chain value of the bioplastic as the monomers can be sold as chemicals for another industry.
Implementation
Dr Adrian Higson supported our idea of using by-products from other industry (whisky to be exact) due to its sustainability features. However, he pointed the necessity of looking in detail to some other impacts. This conversation was followed by a team discussion, where, with the advice of our supervisors we started to research the incorporation of the Life Cycle Assessment model to look into the life cycle of our bioplastic.
                     Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)                    
After of our talks with experts and stakeholders we incorporated the LCA tool to measure the impacts of each aspect of our product life.
Read more
Life Cycle Assessment is a systematic way of quantifying the environmental sustainability of a product and helps to identify aspects for improvement. It is a vital tool for sustainability studies and if implemented correctly can act as the basis to evaluate different scenarios and facilitate decisions.
Implementations
The LCA resulted in an iterative tool that began as the repercussion of the dialogues with experts and ended as a decision making instrument. The LCA supported the idea of using the in-situ secretion system and showed us that the recycling scenario modelled for our process contributed to decrease the environmental impacts up to 70%.

Executive Summary
The current market for phosphorus removal techniques is growing rapidly as more and more countries set increasingly stricter regulations on the effluent quality. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) from all over the world are looking for a dependable, sustainable and cheap solution. Our product allows companies to achieve phosphorus removal levels expected by the legislations in force. Additionally, our solution is the only one that allows the user to recycle the recovered phosphorus, thus preserving this agriculturally valuable resource. Our team have engineered phosphorus accumulating bacteria based on the newest research made by Martin Warren et al. as documented in the 2017 paper. Our team are planning to target WWTPs in Canada specifically, as we believe it is the best place to set up our business. As the threat of decreasing phosphorus reserves deepens and inland lake and rivers eutrophication continues, the demand for Phosphostore, which not only removes phosphorus out of water but also recycles it, is expected to increase significantly.
Customer Analysis
In most developed countries, wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are legally obliged to meet limits on phosphorus discharged to receiving water bodies (Tanyi, 2007). Often, these WWTPs have to choose between"

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," simplify the proposed circuits - a process called “pruning”. Taking cues from LacI, we attempt to prune the other architectures to the same small circuit, which is a subset of all the larger circuits.
Experiments are expensive and models are useful lies; acknowledging this statement, it is also useful to put the results of our model in a broader perspective provided by the literature and increase our chances of a successful experiment. miR-21 was included due to exceptionally high expression level in most cance cell lines but not in the majority of healty and immortalized tissues [ 2 ]. While examining miR-373, we notice it shares the same seed sequence with miR-372. The optimization algorithm takes this similarity into account at a preprocessing step, adding the expressions of miR-372 and miR-373 together and reporting only miR-372.
Putting all these elements together leads us to propose the following circuit for the wet lab experiments:
Architecture: 2 (LacI + miR targets at middle layer)
Circuit: hsa-mir-372 OR hsa-mir-373 AND hsa-mir-21 AND ~hsa-mir-143 AND ~hsa-mir-145
Re-evaluation of the proposed circuit
Although we’ve determined architecture 2 to be optimal, we reevaluate the proposed circuit across all the architectures. The resulting logarithm of the fold change is:
arch1
arch2
arch3
arch4
arch5
arch6
arch7
1.45
2.69
2.64
2.65
0.90
1.67
0.77
Architecture 2 retains the same high fold change with the proposed circuit.
Implementation problems and fallback
We designed experiments to implement this final classifier circuit in the lab. The promoter bearing LacO operator sites, CAGop, was ordered to be synthesized, but unfortunately synthesis proved very difficult due to the high GC content and the construct arrived at the 31st of October. Necessity forced us to fall back to an alternate architecture for which we already had the Parts: architecture 7 (FF4). Thanks to the way we had structured the circuit elements, we also had some leeway in choosing which miRNA targets to actually include: miR-21, miR-372 OR miR-372, or both. We reevaluate these 3 options for architecture 7 and also compute the efficiency of the circuits on datasets with HEK-293 and A549 as controls, apart from healthy tissue samples.
Expected fold change logarithm for healthy samples:

Our Savinase plate from the E. coli transformation has two colonies, however they didn’t look normal. The DspB didn’t have any colonies. We are re-running our ligations and E. coli transformations on these today. We also made new overnights and plated a new sample of cholera. The overnights and the new plate were all placed in the 30° incubator for ideal growth conditions.
7/30/13
We had colony growths for both Savinase and DspB. We did colony PCR using the Taq PCR reaction protocol listed on the protocol page.
7/31/13
We ran our PCR products on gel to check for the proper plasmids. We got products for Savinase clones colonies B & D as well as DspB. We set up LB-AMP overnights for Savinase clone colonies B & D and placed them in the shaker in the 37°C incubator.
We then set up restriction digests for DspB with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and XhoI. All procedures today followed protocols listed on the protocol page.

Hello!  My name is Mike, and I hail from Freehold, New Jersey. I am a sophomore Chemical and Biological Engineering major interested in pursuing certificates in Engineering Biology and Finance. Using genetic and bioengineering to improve human health and industrial output is something I hope to explore further through iGEM. Outside of iGEM, I am an avid swimmer, writer for the Daily Prince, and Outdoor Action leader. Fun fact: I really like country music.

My name is Rohan, and I'm a sophomore in the Chemical and Biological Engineering department. I grew up in the far away land of Taiwan (it's not Thailand), where they eat chicken claws and beef tongue. But it also houses the world's 10th tallest building and has high speed rails connecting all the major cities, so we've got a good mix of ancient and modern. I'm in iGEM because I hope to ultimately contribute to universal quality healthcare and clean energy for every human being on our planet, and iGEM is a great way to work on creative solutions to these problems. Besides iGEM and chemical engineering, I also love to play tennis, read novels, and compose on the piano. A fun fact is that I love to eat eggs with soy sauce, probably because it’s how my grandmother makes them.

1.Antibiotics resistance.
Early in 1945, Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin, warned that bacteria would finally be resistant to drugs. An increasing number of antibiotics including penicillin are found to lose their effectiveness because of drug resistance, the result of which is lack of effective ways to defeat bacteria in the future [1]. For example, Staphylococcus aureus become less sensitive to penicillin, one of beta-lactam antibiotics, for the acquiring of a penicillin binding-protein. Even worse, all the beta-lactam antibiotics are useless to Staphylococcus aureus infection for the same resistant mechanism. And the strains acquiring the resistance were termed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). According to the ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE Global Report on Surveillance of World Health Organization in 2014, community-acquired MRSA has increased greatly in several countries over the past decade. The report showed that MRSA proportions had exceeded 20% in all WHO regions, and even 80% in some areas [1]. Tuberculosis(TB) is a widespread, fatal, infectious disease. Its resistance appears soon after introduction of antibiotics, and has developed to multi-drug resistance(MDR). It’s estimated that, on global level, there are 3.6% new tuberculosis cases with multi-drug resistance [1]. (figure1)'Traditional Arabic'

There are some ways to fight against the antibiotic resistance, such as restricted politics [1]. As a researcher"

Like it is in the case with tumor cells, we assume that our printed tissue is dividing more frequently than its environment after implanting, especially if the printed tissue evolves malignant. Since a higher frequency of cytokinesis influences transfection positively, printed tissues would be targeted more directly by the bystander effect. Another positive effect is, that the bystander effect needs direct cell-cell contact because a soluble factor seems not to be involved [13] . Although it was demonstrated that phosphorylated GCV metabolites can leak out from cells, only neighboring cells are at risk to be killed by an unknown cellular uptake mechanism independent of gap junctions [14] .
Why we use Famciclovir
In order to fulfill the iGEM-competition’s philosophy, we intended to improve current BioBricks and the kill-switch, that was implemented for instance in Freiburg 2010 and Slovenia 2012. Therefore, we did not only erase point mutations in the mGMK-TK30-construct and added a Poly-A-tail, but went on using the current most modern prodrug: famciclovir. First, since for medication 4 common drugs are available on the market, we intended to analyze the differences between them in more detail.
With aciclovir the new era of antiviral therapy started in the 1980s. It is still a widely used drug against Herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 and Varicella-zoster-virus infections. Ganciclovir is known as the hydroxymethylated form of aciclovir and is known for its better activity against CMV [15] . Replacement of the ether oxygen by a carbon atom reflects the structure of penciclovir. Penciclovir has lower bioavailability than the other two guanosine analogues. Its prodrug famciclovir, with two acetyl groups instead of the hydroxyl groups and without the keto group at the purine (see Figure..). It is well absorbed when orally admitted and rapidly metabolized to penciclovir [16] . Nevertheless, all four guanosine analogues show adverse side effects, especially on the male reproductive system [17] .
Metabolism of Famciclovir
The major metabolism of orally admitted famciclovir includes normally a deacetylation followed by oxidation of the purine to form penciclovir. This is how the prodrug works in vivo. To get nearer to in vivo conditions in cell culture assays"

The natural occurrence of quorum­sensing inhibitors is an   important consideration for the assessment of their toxicological status and may facilitate their   use in food as preservatives and hence pave way for the application of novel food preservation   techniques. (Rai, 2011) Recent  modern  applications  of  microbiology  in  food  spoilage  have  caused  much  buzz  in   academic world. The discovery of novel biochemical pathways and subsequent development of   their  applications  is  increasingly  bringing  up  new  perspective  to  combat  the  intimidating   challenge  of  food  security.  Though  the  general  masses  at  large  is  still  oblivious  to  role  of   microbiota  in  their  dietary  habits.  Fermentation  helps  in  making  bread  and  pasteurization  is   enough to purify milk is the saturation of public’s knowledge about food spoilage. A systematic   campaign to spread awareness at grass root level would boost public’s interest in food spoilage   beyond their monthly budget into the spectrum of global challenge of food security. That would   hopefully  lead  to  more  developed  industrial  base  providing  cheap  protection  against  food   spoilage.. Bibliography Eley, A. (1992). Food Poisoning. Lone Gram, M. R. (2002).

The transformed constructs pUC57-aGal, pEX-A2-Intein, pRSH10.1-SNAP and pUC57-NAGA from last week were amplified in E.coli and purified, from where we subcloned them into pSB1C3, which we intended as our assembly vector aswell as out vector of choice for registry parts. We also tried to do three-part-assemblies in pSB1C3 with following inserts: SNAP+NAGA, Intein+NAGA, Intein+aGal and SNAP+aGal. Unfortunately we didn’t succeed in the transformation of E.coli BL21 DE3 with our ligated constructs. Possible reasons for that were thought to be improper concentrations of the parts for the ligations. Our last part, EABase-pEX-K4, arrived in the second week and was transformed into XL 10 Gold.
Week 3 --- 18.08.14 - 22.08.14
In the 3rd week we made a batch of competent BL21DE3. We received the BL21DE3 stock from a working group at our institute. Then we retried the ligation of several parts with pSB1C3, namely our three enzymes (NAGA,aGal and EABase) each with Intein (three-part-assemblies), aswell as our enzymes with of the three enzymes with pSB1C3-Spy(two-part-assembly) and all of our tags and enzymes with pSB1C3(two part assembly) except for Spy-Tag, which already was in pSB1C3. All the ligated constructs were transformed into E.coli BL21DE3. Although this time we used higher concentrations of our parts for the ligation, it didn’t work either.  In order for the SNAP-Tag to be used, we had to add the RFC25 prefix and suffix to it by overhang PCR.

After the  transformations into BL21DE3 failed multiple times we decided to swich to a different strain. We received a sample of competent NEB5α from a group at our institute from which we made a batch of our own competent cells.

Reture Overview
Purpose
We investigated the current situation of Chinese iGEM teams.
The reason we conducted this special work was primarily originated from the hardships our team has experienced this year. During the preparation of our project, we have lost the financial support from our university that was provided in previous years. Besides, we have been deprived of the permission to the laboratory for the first two months which interrupted our schedule, put off our experiments.
So, based on this situation, we want to know whether there are other iGEM teams in China met the same difficulties like us. Through Video interviews, we had discussions with more than 15 Chinese iGEM teams. Unfortunately, we found that quiet a few teams were also struggling for their project , suffering various obstacles such as shortage in funds, lack in labor or without effective academic instruction...
Although we experienced great obstacles this year, we have never given up. We sincerely wish our experiences could not only inspire the future iGEM teams to go through their bad time but give some directions to solve possible difficulties they would meet.
Respondents
Respondents’ positions in their teams vary. Some are leaders and some are in charge of Human Practice. Others are none of both.
Method
The contents of this special work are primarily based on the discussion and consultation through the video-chat.
Description
From September to October 2017, we have interviewed more than 15 Chinese iGEM teams.  We grasped the basic information of their teams like the team scale, the ways for team construction and the problems they have met during the preparation for iGEM this year etc. Also, We shared our experiences during the whole process of preparing our iGEM project with them.
Some examples, with Chongqing University, we shared the way of our team labor division and the training methods for cultivating new and qualified team members. Additionally, we introduced how to raise money from crowd-funding to them. With Xiamen University, we shared our three-round selections during the team construction.

    Without TetR, we can see that C4HSL can activate expression of LacI by binding to RhlR and LuxR from the results of Orthogonality test . However, we have TetR here! C4HSL forms a complex with the protein RhlR inside warrior I. This complex activates the expression of TetR. TetR can then inhibit the promoter Plux/tetR, thus counteracting the self-activating effect. In this way, the expression of LacI is not activated so warrior I does not kill itself. We modify the gene circuits of beggar I and farmer I in a similar way so that warrior I no longer kill them. Its feasibility can be seen in Improved gene cicuit .

Clemson,2012,Team:Clemson#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"Introduction
     Overall, our project goal is to create a three-component bacterial system: signaling, biosurfactant, and PCB degradation. First is an expansion of the UT-Tokyo 2011 Team’s bioremediation specific system, consisting of guider and worker bacteria. The system (currently activated by UV light) causes the guider bacteria to produce Aspartate A, which is converted to L-Asp, a natural chemoattractant for E. coli. Thus, both guiders and workers will respond when the bacteria come into contact with the substrate. However, the reaction producing L-Asp is reversible and would cause the bacteria to no longer stay with the substrate. In order to circumvent this, UT-Tokyo created a system with a chromosomal cheZ knockout E. coli stain and initiated substrate-dependent cheZ expression from a plasmid. Thus, in the presence of the substrate, the lambda phage repressor cI is produced, binding to the cI-repressed promoter, inhibiting cheZ expression, and halting bacterial movement. In order for this system to work for our purposes, we are to replace the UV light promoter with a PCB specific promoter. Ideally we would like to implement this system in magnetotactic bacteria since PCBs are insoluble particles that remain in the sediments of Lake Hartwell, we will need the guiders to dive to the bottom. The workers in this system will be comprised of two genetically different bacteria: one programmed to produce a biosurfactant and the other to degrade the PCBs to less harmful byproducts.

This year our team is made up of 7 biological scientists, 4 bioinformaticians and 1 chemist, all of whom are new to iGEM. We started our project design in January this year and finally decided our project —— Grenadier Guards on May 1st after four months of intense and independent brainstorming process. We have been putting ceaseless effort such as conducting wet experiments and mathematical modeling since the middle of June. During this long time battle, we are trying our best to understand our individual roles and responsibilities, as well as devoting all our time and energy to this project. Although our project is not mature enough and we are not that experienced, we really appreciated this special iGEM experience from which we have gained some precious qualities like perseverance and diligence, as well as establishing strong and sincere friendship with each other.
Self-supporting
Management:
Both Yijing Gong and Tianjun Wang were student team leaders. Yijing Gong put lots of efforts on dry experiments, human practices, collaborations and later wet experiment designs. Tianjin Wang focused more on designing and managing the wet experiment initially, as well as communicating with several biological reagent suppliers.
Overall idea:
Huiting Li and Ziying Jin first came up with the idea about using anti-microbial peptides to fight against Staphylococcus aureus. Huiting has done lots of jobs in searching information to support our idea at the early stages. Yijing Gong and Haohui Fang helped to design the initial biological circuit.  Later, Yijing Gong, Tianjun Wang, Zixin Rong and Yiyou Song communicated and modified the circuit further.
Wet experiments:
The majority of our members participated in wet experiments. The main members in each group are listed below:
Testing on the efficiency of DRGN-1: Tianjun Wang, Haohui Fang
Testing on the efficiency of LL-37, GF-17 and Grammistin on killing bacteria and destroying their biofilm: Zixin Rong, Yiyou Song, Xidan Zhang

Engineer Bianchi assists to the Beekeeper's society meetings, and he sees there are not young beekeepers to take the hard work of beekeeping, he sees that as another issue.

Valencian beekeeper interview
Received information on aspects like:
Status of foulbrood in Valencia.
Treatment used against foulbrood in Valencia.
Beekeeper's opinion about our solution proposal.
Detailed Description
Thanks to our colleagues from Valencia_UPV, we received written feedback from a Valencian beekeeper and information about the current status of foulbrood in his province. Our Valencian colleagues interviewed the beekeeper for us, thank you Valencia_UPV team! (LINK collaborations) Given that our interest diseases have a global presence, it is essential for us to make contact with beekeepers from all around the world; knowing how they face illnesses, the used treatment methods, their effectiveness and consequences, and the beekeeper's concerns and opinions about our solution proposal in order to also integrate them into the development of our project.
The interviewed beekeeper has spent approximately 70 years dedicating himself to the invaluable work of beekeeping and he shared with us some already experienced foulbrood implications that are lived in his province. In Valencia the treatment against foulbrood consist in the following:
First, the combs with the infected brood are replaced by healthy brood and then antibiotic with powdered sugar, is applied. The adult bees, when they realize the larvae are dead, clean the cell. The beekeeper ensures that with this treatment he has managed to heal all his hives, and has not suffered any loss from the disease, the drawback for this method is that it contaminates pollen, so it would no longer be suitable for human consumption, and when this treatment is not applied on time, beekeepers get to have very large losses of money and even the total loss of their hives (between 20 to 100 hives per beekeeper). Regarding this information, we could realize that antibiotics indeed are currently used and although they are effective in treating the disease, the innocuity of the honey is always"

We built a degradation model to help the UCL team with their beta-amyloid degradation assays. The model, a MATLAB based extension called Simbiology, provides information about how efficient MMP-9 enzyme can degrade beta-amyloid plaques, which is informative for wetlab work.

To amplify the KanR cassette* (~1kb), high fidelity PCR was done using pSB1K3 as template DNA and IV009 and IV010 as forward and reverse primers respectively. 8 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol.
NOTE: previously (10/8/2018), the KanR gene was used for amplification. This is not the same as the whole cassette, which includes the promoter and terminator.

OUR TEAM
We are a team uniquely composed by students from the      Polythecnic University of Valenciawith the support of the Spanish      National Research Council. In this iGEM edition we dare to work      with plants and hope our work will encourage other teams to do      so in the future.
OUR PROJECT
Avoiding damage in crops caused     by pests, using pheromoneproducing     plants that disrupt     insects mating and therefore avoid     laying and damage caused by     larvae.
Questions it raises : In what fields do you think that using     Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)     could improve our lifestyle?     (Ex: Safer drugs production, bioremediation)
Would you accept using GMOs for noneating     purposes? If not, why not?
What do you want to know about crop     protection against pests?     (Ex: How do insects behave in crops?)
This year, our team is developing an environmental friendly     approach to control insect pests: The Sexy Plant.
The gist of the project we are working on is focused on the production     of insect pheromones in the plant Nicotiana benthamiana. Our     main efforts are aimed at avoiding the insect laying and the     damage caused by insect larvae in crops. Since pests are one of     the main causes of damage and the use of pesticides is getting     more and more unpopular due to their environmental effects, our     goal is to release the sufficient amount of pheromones into the air     to cause mating disruption among insects, thus, male insects will     not be able to find and mate with female insects, in the same way a     soldier dressed in camouflage is difficult to be seen in a rainforest.
As for human practices, we are creating surveys about GMOs and     Synthetic Biology in collaboration with other iGEM teams from     different countries. This way, surveys from all the teams can reach     a higher number of people with different regional culture, so the     results are more global.
We know the importance of an early introduction in science.     For that reason, we have carried out activities"

Julian C. Shillcock
Associate Professor, Department of physics and chemistry, University of Southern Denmark. The aim of my research is to construct a computational model of a living cell that has predictive power for problems of biological interest on length and time scales of microns and milliseconds to seconds.  This includes biophysical processes such as:
•   Optimizing a drug delivery vehicle for delivering its payload to membrane-bound receptors
•   Signal transduction from the plasma membrane to the nucleus via motor-assisted transport vesicles
•   Pattern formation of receptors in the cell membrane
•   Sensitivity analysis of signalling networks in the presence of nanoparticles
•   Nanoparticles interacting with the plasma membrane
•   Engulfment of foreign objects into a cell
The techniques I use are particle-based simulation methods such as Dissipative Particle Dynamics, Brownian dynamics, Molecular Dynamics, and theoretical tools such as reaction-diffusion equations, non-linear differential equations.

I am doing my master thesis with Jakob Møller-Jensen in the microbiology group of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at SDU in Odense.
My research is focused on discovering sRNA’s from the pathogenic adherent-invasive E. coli involved in Crohn’s disease in order to identify the ones that are involved in bacterial virulence. I work with the nematode C. elegans as a modelorganism for the human gastrointestinal tract.
I was introduced to iGEM as the 2009 SDU team was my lab neighbour which I bitched and moaned about because they were jabbering, taking up all the lab space and “borrowing” my stuff without returning it. I guess I was asked to be part of the iGEM this year so that I could no longer bitch and moan but rather be responsible for the team's interplay with the other people in the lab. Jokes aside, I hope to bring knowledge and lab experience to the team and I am very excited about working with this very diverse group of people and look forward to all the science we are going to make and all the fun we are going to have, although there has been a serious lack of cake!

The meta table contains basic information of a brick. Initially it is folded, but you can expand it by clicking its header:
By clicking ""Documantation"", you can view the full description of a brick:
At the top right corner of the page, you will find a circular graph, which illustrates the structure of the brick. Each arc represents a special sequence part, arranged based on its position relative to the brick. You can learn more information by moving your mouse onto them:
For those sequences that are also bricks (called subparts), clicking on them will direct you their detail pages.
If a brick contains subparts, they will be displayed at the bottom of the page as well:
Forum
Forum is another essential constituent part of Biohub 2.0. It establishes a platform where users can share and discuss their experience. ""Experience"" is the core concept of Forum. An experience is an article belongs to a specific brick, stating experiment phenomenon and/or providing improvement advices. To post an experience, just click the button on the detail page:
Experiences use Markdown for typography, so you can use few easy-to-remember tags to format your article:
After submitting, your experience will then be displayed on the brick's detail page.
You may vote for an experience if you find it great enough:
Or if you disagree with the author, you may leave a comment:
The idea of sharing experiences are actually inspired by iGEM's offical website, which also has a similar submodule. Few articles have already existed on the website, which we think is a kind of valuable resources. Thus Forum will grab down and display those experiences while fetching data from iGEM, and make a refresh per 10 days to keep them up-to-date.
Apart from experience sharing, Forum also allows you to interact with the bricks:
There are three kinds of actions related to bricks:
Rate
You can grade a brick (0 ~ 5 points) according to your own using experience.
Watch
If you watch a brick, you will receive notifications when other users post experiences. Events related to the brick will also appear on your timeline.
Star
Star is in a sense a kind of mark. If you meet an interesting brick but have no time to skim through its document, you can just star it for later viewing.

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Results STEP_-_-_TEXT.html,"F (after co-transfection 24h).  (c) Relative fluorescence intensity at different co-transfection. A: GS linker + cECFP, B: GS linker + nECFP, C: 2GS linker + cECFP, D: 2GS linker + nECFP. Relative fluorescence intensity is evaluated by grey level measurement of ImageJ and flow cytometry. The group of AB seems to have a better expression level as well as response rate. Experiments were conducted in biological triplicate, and each experiment is representative of at least three independent biological experiments. (*: P<0.05, ***: P<0.001)
It is obvious that a complementary ECFP would not form if the two chains failed to locate to cell membrane or if they couldn’t bind under the effect of VEGF. Thus we can infer from the results that our VEGF-scFv together with the signal sequence and the transmembrane domain is ready for further tests.
Transcription Factor Test
Another important part of our system is the transcription factor on the intracellular domain. After viewing information of different transcription factors in previous parts, we finally decided to use the advanced tTA as our transcription factor, together with a pTight promotor.
We first co-transfected HEK293T cells with a plasmid encoding tTA with an EGFP protein and another plasmid with pTight promotor and a mCherry reporter, and observed both strong green and red fluorescence after 48 hours of expression (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Transcription Factor Test. (a) Fluorescent images of transfected cell with pTight-mCherry (-) and tTA-EGFP and pTight-mCherry (+). Photos were taken 48 h after transfection. (b) Relative fluorescence intensity in conditions above.
Then, for further tests of the whole system, we constructed stable cell lines of both HEK293T and HeLa, with downstream plasmid of pTight and mCherry.
Now that we had successfully tested both sections of STEP system and built stable cell lines, we were able to carry out further experiments concerning the whole system.
Overall Tests
TC/PC Ratio
To see if the whole STEP system works we need to co-transfect the two plasmids encoding TC and PC chains. We want to find a best TC/PC ratio and total quantity of transfection.
At the beginning we transfected HEK293T cells with different TC/PC ratio. We used VEGF-STEP as an example"

(4).         adjustment of  the concentration of ayl-CoA: Findings: decreasing the concentration of acyl-coA, the concentration of CI will decrease and GFP will increase. (comparison with standard)
(5).         Overexpression of FadL and FadR : Findings:  Thereotically, when we overexpression the FadL and FadR (under non-overexpression of acyl-coA), the concentration of CI must decrease due to the competition between acyl-coA and FadR.  However, the result remain the same. We assume that it might be our limitation of curve fitting due to the lack of experimental data. And thus we aren’t able to use the whole differential functions(see  the parameter setting and initial conditions above)
3. Verification and conclusion
According to the IGEM  Registry, POPS(polymerase per second) and RIPS (ribosome initions per second) are the actual standardized output  we want to know. Based on the  equilibrium function proposed by SYSU-Software 2013, we have:
Here, the DeRNA(degration rate of mRNA) is 10-4 and the TE of rbs30, rbs34 are 0.6 uM, 1uM respectively. Thus, we can acquire the RIPS for rbs30 and rbs34:
RIPSrbs30 = 0.006 RIPSrbs34 =0.01
The results correspond with the reference paper, which means the absolute TE values we use in our model are appropriate, and also verify the equilibrium function proposed by SYSU-Software 2013.

Composite Parts
This year, we CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan, brings you 3 composite parts.
Composite Parts
FOR ANTIDOTE
T7 promoter + Thioredoxin-FGD fusion protein ( BBa_K2382005 )
This part contains a T7 promoter and Thioredoxin-FGD fusion protein, and terminators are included. By ligating these two different parts as a fusion protein, it is supposed to raise the solubility of our protein, F420-dependent glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (FGD).
T7 promoter + Thioredoxin-MSMEG_5998 fusion protein ( BBa_K2382006 )
This part contains a T7 promoter and Thioredoxin-MSMEG_5998 fusion protein, and terminators are included. By ligating these two different parts as a fusion protein, it works better than MSMEG_5998 alone.
FOR TEST STRIP
Anti-aflatoxin scFv fusion protein construction DNA sequence ( BBa_K2382010 )
By ligating the constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101), strong ribosome binding site (BBa_B0034) and scFv-EAAAK- RFP-Histag, we were able to detect aflatoxin by the purified protein expressing in E. coli. Moreover, we designed a restriction site, BamHI, between scFv and EAAAK, so future iGEM teams could take advantage of this composite part to fuse their scFv with RFP as indicator, and make their own test strip!"
Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Lab#Plants_-_-_TEXT.html,"9-7366. Four gRNA near the beginning and five gRNA near the end of the region were found in the unmasked genome (none were found in that region in the masked genome, which is perhaps unsurprising as a non-coding region is less likely to be conserved). Two gRNA were chosen near the beginning and two near the end based on BLAST results.
Design IV: For this design, we wanted to stop expression of the two mRNA transcripts. However, we were using the CaMV 35S promoter elsewhere in our design, so we couldn't target it directly. Instead, we looked at the first 100 nucleotides of each transcript (i.e. as close to the promoter as possible) and chose a few candidates to BLAST, eventually choosing one gRNA target for each transcript.
Agrobacterium as the Genome-Integration ChassisPanel Toggle
To have every tissue of a plant express the anti-viral CRISPR-Cas9 system one must first integrate its sequence into the genome of the plant's germ line so that every cell of the next generation becomes a CRISPR-Cas9 carrier. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is widely considered nature's genetic engineer; its life cycle involves the insertion of a portion of its own DNA into the genome of its plant host cells, including germ line cells
. In nature, that inserted sequence codes for genes that encourage plant cell tumorigenesis, the expression of biosynthesis enzymes that produce bacterial nutrients, and genes that result in the creation of specialized amino                             acids called opines
. These are collectively known as the T-DNA and are found on the tumor inducing plasmid (Ti plasmid) within Agrobacterium flanked by 25 base pair repeat border sequences
. The Ti plasmid also contains a set of virulence genes which code for proteins responsible for the excision of single stranded DNA between border sequences and the transport and integration of that DNA into the plant cell                             genome
. It has been frequently demonstrated that the entire set of genes between the border sequences can be replaced with up to approximately 25,000 base pairs and still be acted on for plant genome integration
. Further, it's been found that the Ti plasmid's virulence genes can act in trans to integrate a sequence from another plasmid (often a shuttle vector) so long as it is flanked by border sequences
. Strains of Agrobacterium that have had their Ti plasmids modified to contain no border sequences (and thus no sequence to be integrated) are said to be"

We should make a brainstorming seminar, where we discuss functional examples from the literature about co-expression of heterologous genes in yeast. When looking for DNA-Sequences, it also helps to make a ""patent research"", for example using the homepage of the EPA (europ. Patentamt), because in patents, the DNA-Sequences have to be shown!
In DNA sequences, the following unusual letters are used:
n = any nucleotide
y = pyrimidine (C, T)
r = purin (G, A)
When showing DNA-Sequences & designed primers, it is best to show two sequences (preferably a WORD-Document): One that shows what the final construct should look like and another one that shows the template DNA (usually a plasmid) and the primers you designed for the PCR. Also, you should know exactly which restriction enzymes you want to use for the cloning of your parts and why. Also have the GeneBank or Uniprot or PDB identifiers (codes) ready, so"

The general principle how different inputs can be connect to various outputs. For details see text.
Inputs (such as proteins or small molecules) are indicated on the left side. blue lines represent transmitter molecules whereas organe lines present logic gates. The type of logic gate is indicated. Green lines indicate transmitter RNA that can function as mRNA and consequently generate any output gene (indicated on the very right).
In order to connect different BioBricks, our network requires four major types of components:
Input elements
Transmitter molecules
Logic gates
Output elements
Computer vs. molecular network - and our approach
Logic gates in a molecular network are often compared to transistors used in a computer, where billions of transistors are incorporated [7] . The main advantage on a computer chip is, all transistors share the same functional principle, and only the way connecting them in a special sequence allows specific addressing of only a subset of other transistors by an input. However, spatially fixed connections of molecular logic gates are not possible in a living cell. The ""wiring"" within a cell relies on the specific interaction between transmitter molecule and their corresponding logic gates, for example implemented by protein-protein/ligand-protein interactions or specific ligand-riboswitch interactions. [8] [9] As a result, in a cell, each occurring logic gate (""transistor"") has to be different, at least in a special recognition site [10] - for example like different transcription factors, recognizing different DNA-sites. Thanks to evolution, nature easily can invent a new transistor for each task - science achieves this only on a limited scale, and producing synthetic molecular logic gates artificially by either rational or evolutionary protein or riboswitch engineering, is limited to small circuits so far [11] . Our project aims to establish a molecular switch as close as possible to a electronic transistor, thus sharing the same functional principle for all logic gates.  At the same time, we want to design a easily exchangeable recognition site, which can individually be designed by everyone!
These elements can be combined to build up a molecular network (see illustration). Each input molecule (such as a BioBrick) produces a unique transmitter molecule. All transmitters belong to the same type of molecule and share a common design. However, each transmitter molecule can only interact and activate a certain subset of logic gates. In"
