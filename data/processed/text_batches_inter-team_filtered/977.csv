Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

However, conducting the experiment using the agar-design, we encountered a problem: after some hours the LB-agar/agarose started to shrink and dried out. Thus, the agar-design cannot be used without modifications for experiments of longer duration.
In an attempt we only left a small agar fragment in each channel and filled the rest with liquid medium, so as to decrease chance of it drying out, while avoiding at the same time that bacteria from one chamber reach the other chamber.
The bead-design consists of an alginate bead for each chamber and liquid medium in between. The beads either contained regulator/sensor-bacteria or AHL.

Week 14 : Diffusion experiments started, simulated with Comsol, and fitting of quorum sensing dynamics
Monday, August 25th
We carried diffusion experiment with different designs : punched PDMS, liquid, beads. For every design we added high concentrations of pure AHL in the sender well, so cells are glowing a lot. However because of this high concentration, diffusion is very high and at a given AHL concentration, receiving cells are glowing at the same time for all 4 channel lengths. Check the corresponding article for more details.
We have a Comsol simulation for these experiments that explains why at this concentration of AHL (1mM), all 4 wells glow at the same time irrespectively of channel length. Check this article for more details.
We could fit degradation rates of external, internal AHL and GFP thanks to quorum sensing dynamic curves.

Fitting quorum sensing dynamic curves
Monday, August 24th
We could use quorum sensing dynamic curves to fit degradation rates of external, internal AHL and GFP. We fitted the experimental results for lux with riboregulator and thus didn't consider leakiness (we showed leakiness was low enough in that case when fitting quorum sensing Hill function parameters ). By writing GFP production rate and replacing AHL in this equation by $$[AHL]=[AHL_i]-[AHL_{bound}]$$ we find  $$\frac{d[GFP]}{dt}=\frac{k_{45}[P_{tot}]\Big(-1+\sqrt{1+8\frac{AHL_i}{K_{d3}}}\Big)^2}{16\frac{K_{d4}}{K_{d3"

The NAD+-dependent ligase (LigA, <partinfo>BBa_K525710</partinfo>), which is also fused to S-layer proteins, ligates the two oligos so that the hairpin structure opens up and the fluorophore is able to emit light after extinction.

50 nM of excess TetR dimer
360 pM of Cruzipain (Positive Test)
30 nM of RNAP
30 nM of Ribosomes
We only used repressed DNA in this simulation, because that will give us the rate of production of hirudin without considering the leakiness of the promoter. In other words, this should give us the slowest production rate in the scenario.
[Fig 1]
From the graph above, we see that it takes around 31 minutes to produce the threshold amount of hirudin. This delay is too long for the hirudin to effectively inhibit blood coagulation. In fact, running the blood coagulation model using this output revealed the presence of a thrombin spike at close to 8 minutes, indicating the initiation of blood coagulation.
[Fig 2]
Blood Coagulation Model
Blood Coagulation Model
We used a blood coagulation model to get some insight into how the production rates of hirudin would affect blood coagulation. Since we could not test our system with real blood due to safety concerns, this was a very useful tool in helping us to evaluate the effectiveness of our systems.
We adapted a blood coagulation model developed by Chatterjee et al., that simulated both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of blood coagulation [2]. His model was originally used to evaluate the effectiveness of CTI (corn trypsin inhibitor) on the blood coagulation system, so we had to modify certain parameters to simulate untreated whole blood.
Initial amount of CTI was set to 0
Initial amount of Tissue Factor was set to \(3.5*10^{-13} M\) [3]
Reaction 28 for thrombin detection was removed
Lastly, the inhibition reactions of Hirudin binding to Thrombin were added [1]
$$ 58. Hirudin + IIa \leftrightharpoons Hirudin:IIa $$                     $$ k_{f} = 2.9*10^{8}, k_{r} = 1.7*10^{-5} $$
The full model can be found in Chatterjee et al. paper [2].

The relative expression and noise levels were quantitatively assessed using fluorescence microscopy of a YFP reporter system expressed on pSB1C3 in MG1655 at OD600=0.3-0.5. For this purpose an Olympus IX83 with a photometrics prime camera was used with exposure time for YFP at 200 ms.
Figure 16. Fluorescence microscopy of YFP under the control of PenI-regulated and Mnt-regulated promoters on pSB1C3 in E. coli MG1655 at OD600=0.3-0.5.
From the data obtained, it was evident that the PenI-regulated promoter mediated a substantially higher level of YFP expression than the Mnt-regulated promoter, as seen in Figure 16. Furthermore, the PenI-regulated promoter displayed a notably lower level of noise. On the basis of these results, the PenI-regulated promoter was chosen to control the expression of the photocontrol device.
Leaky Expression by the OmpR-Regulated Promoter on Different Vectors
The leaky expression by the OmpR-regulated promoter is reduced when cloned into a low copy vector compared to a high copy vector.
Proper regulation of the OmpR-dependent promoter, BBa_R0082 , is necessary for the implementation of a functional dormancy system, as the balance between RelE and RelB is imperative. To verify that the OmpR-regulated promoter is up to the task, a reporter system containing RFP under control of the OmpR-regulated promoter, BBa_M30011 , was cloned into E. coli strain SØ928 ΔOmpR, lacking the OmpR transcription factor, on a high copy vector. By using a ΔOmpR strain, the background generated by stimulation of the intrinsic OmpR system is removed, and the strain functions as a negative control.
RFP expression was assessed by fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus IX83 with a photometrics prime camera, with exposure time for RFP at 200 ms. Assessing the RFP expression by fluorescence microscopy, it was discovered that the OmpR-regulated promoter mediated gene expression even in the absence of its transcription factor, see Figure 17. This observation was confirmed by going through the literature Levskaya A, Chevalier AA, Tabor JJ, Simpson"

Background
Chromoproteins
All organisms in nature produce pigments. However, those are usually organic molecules synthesized through complex pathways. Anthozoa are an exception, as several species belonging to this class produce proteins that are intrinsically colored1. These chromoproteins are homologous to GFP and they can either be fluorescent or non-fluorescent. Non-fluorescent proteins are colorful in visible light, as shown by the fact that coral colors are determined by chromoproteins instead of other organic pigments2.
As chromoproteins are coded by single genes, it is relatively easy to produce them with synthetic biology compared to engineering a whole pigment production pathway. Also, given their protein nature, they can be fused to other proteins. This has historically been done with GFP. However, in the past few years, the necessity of having more colors available has lead to an increasing characterization of other chromoproteins2.
The scientific interest in chromoproteins has been so far directed towards their use as reporters. Indeed, when a fluorescent protein gene is fused to a gene of interest, the detection of fluorescence is an indicator of the expression of that particular gene. In our project, we are interested in producing chromoproteins not as a reporter, but to make use of their color itself. By fusing them with a cellulose binding module, a keratin binding domain, and silk repeats in different constructs, we aim to use chromoproteins as dyes.
The chromoproteins we chose for this project are PrancerPurple, mRFP, and sgBP. We chose PrancerPurple based on the good results of its thermostability3. RFP was chosen because a monomeric version was available and we were interested to find out if the smaller monomeric RFP folds and functions better compared to the normal chromoproteins. The blue chromoprotein sgBP was chosen because it was not found as a BioBrick. Unfortunately, the sgBP sequence did not work as we anticipated, so we could not submit it as a BioBrick and dropped it from the further experiments.

Explore the MARS Repository
When the team began designing the MARS Repository, we wanted to base it on the principles behind most complex synthetic biology protocols.
We began by generalizing synthetic biology protocols into three key stages:
Isolation: Acquiring the desired genetic material
Modification: Manipulated or processing genetic material
Quantification: Measuring the success of the previous two stages
These stages “fit” together to form the entirety of the protocols that are carried out everyday in synthetic biology labs.
In the existing fields of microfluidics, each of these stages is taken care of on individual chips. However, when it comes time to replicate a full synbio procedure using these chips - it becomes difficult to “fit” them together realistically. This is due to the fact that most chips:
Fabrication using different and complicated techniques such as soft lithography
Operated using varying hardware
Lack thorough documentation required to run them
Do not have easily accessible design files
Furthermore, the majority of these chips are highly specialised to specific experimental protocols. As a result, they are not relevant in the context of day-to-day procedures in most synthetic biology labs.
After consultation with researchers at BU’s Biological Design Center, we were able to identify nine essential synthetic biology protocols and generalize them into these three categories. After confirming that this chip selection was relevant with an iGEM team poll, we moved on to designing and iterating on chips. The resulting design files, fabrication instructions and usage protocols are housed here - easily accessible to synbiologists and structured in a standardised workflow.

We began our project by identifying a range of BioBrick parts present in the iGEM 2014 distribution kit which we required as part of our cloning strategy.  These parts primarily consisted of both constituitive and inducible promoter systems with ribosome binding sites which we could then use in conjunction with our azo-reductase BioBricks to assemble a functional azo dye degrading gene.  We also decided that we would use the Red Florescent Protein expresing BioBrick as a control for any further transformation experiments.   As the level of DNA present within each plate of the distribution kit is insufficient to perform digest and ligation reactions on it was necessary to transform each of these plasmids into our NEB5alpha competent cells.  After growing our transformed cells overnight we then mini-prepped each of them to obtain BioBrick plasmids at suitable concentrations for future experiments.

We learned basics, as running a PCR, and we got every reagent we needed in our project. And we set those reagents on appropriate place. We can find everything we needed in the lab.
We set about designing three primers and came across some trouble. PDE5A mRNA has three variants, we felt confused about choosing which variant.
Our team’s logo and the style of our wiki had been settled.

“Despite certain hydrophobicity provided by proline, the most important advantage of proline-rich peptides in biological systems is their high degree of water solubility, an essential property for their use in life sciences. [...] In general, it is accepted that CPPs offer several advantages over other known cellular delivery systems, including low toxicity, high efficiency towards distinct cell lines, and even inherent therapeutic potential.” - Handbook of Cell-Penetrating Peptides p 62 Ülo
Nina: Some CPPs seem to be somewhat well studied, now we maybe should find a couple of them that could be good in our project.
“[...] the metabolic degradation of the CPP and the CPP cargo is necessary for the delivery of the cargo after internalization and the final elimination of the CPP to avoid chronic toxicity. An equilibrium between these two aspects is required in order to avoid the premature release of the cargo and its cleavage once internalized.” - Handbook of Cell-Penetrating Peptides p 63 Ülo
Nina: We should learn more about the CPP degradation in order to understand and handle toxic levels.
“[...] permeability can be modulated by taking advantage of the amino side chain, which, in this case, is the a-amino function of the proline. Thus, through this side chain, several parameters of the CPP can be altered, such as hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity characteristics.” - Handbook of Cell-Penetrating Peptides p 63-64 Ülo
Nina: Maybe this information about this amino side chain is good for us to know during our practicals if we want to modulate this part.

We: Can we lose weight by just stop eating anything? 
Coach: Yes. But, I must say that if you stay in the condition of hunger for too long, the cell in your body may gradually reduce the consumption of energy. Thus, as long as everything is back to normal, your weight will bounce back rapidly. So, to sum up,   how to maintain is far more important, and also, far more difficult.  
We: We’ve heard of some activists on weight losing. They even take methods such as liposuction and gastrectomy. What’s your opinion?
Coach: Fat will still accumulate after liposuction, and gastrectomy is an irreversible harm to our body. To be blunt, I’m on the side of disapproval.

Nutritionist
Motivation : When visiting the fitness coach, he suggested that we also consult a nutritionist, assuming that the answers agreed by different professions may be somewhat different. Based on the recommendations of the fitness coach, we found a nutritionist from Cheng Ching Hospital, hoping to get the answer that is beneficial to our project.
Highlight :
Processed sugar intake accounted for a person's daily calories required 10%
Excessive diet can hurt the body
The amount of calories required for a day minus about 400 calories is the most appropriate calorie needed for dieting
Fat is also one of the main causes of obesity
Note the control of blood sugar
Conclusion :
After this interview, we found that the point of discussion nutritionist and fitness coach stand are similar in many ways : for instance, going on diet should not be excessive, controlling  food and drink is important. These are complementary to what we want to do. This interview also let us adjust our project in order to support the public in pursue of a healthy and better life.

It was observed, however, that cell lines used in different laboratories vary greatly in their biological characteristics, so that it is suggested that they were derived from different patients [2] . MCF-7 cells are estrogen-receptor positive and require estrogen for tumorigenesis in vivo. 17β-estradiol induces an TGFα-like activity [3] , which promotes tumor growth and progression [4] . Furthermore the cells express receptors for and respond to several other hormones including androgen, progesterone, glucocorticoids, insulin, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, prolactin and thyroid hormone [2] .

HeLa
The cells were originally derived in 1952 from Henrietta Lacks, who suffered from an adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The HeLa cells were the first human epithelial cells established in long-term culture [5] . There are three main characteristics of the genome of HeLa by which they can be recognized: hypertriploid chromosome number (3n+), 20 clonally abnormal chromosomes and the integration of multiple copies of HPV18 (Human Papilloma Virus) at various sites [6] . It has been shown, that the HeLa genome has been remarkably stable after years of subcultivation [6] , but it is also possible to select strains of HeLa cells with certain properties by putting them under selection pressure [7] .

U2-OS
U2-OS, formerly known as 2T cell line [8] , were derived from a 15-year-old girl with a moderately differentiated osteogenic sarcoma of the shinbone. Cell culture of U2-OS started at the time of amputation of the left leg on September 3, 1964 [9] . U2-OS cells express adhesion molecules such as integrins, Ig-CAMs and chemokine receptors as well as growth factors which are either constitutively expressed (such as IL-7) or inducible (such as TNF) by PMA (phorbol ester) or ionomycine. The adhesion molecules and growth factors support the growth of CD34 progenitor cells [10] .

Alternatively, Building upon the Cambridge 2009 iGEM E.Chromi project, the NO sensor can be incorporated to perceive abnormal levels of NO in the gut flora or damage to the gut, which can visually be seen in the form of colours in faecal matter (Cambridge iGEM team , 2009). For example NO levels increase during damage of the gut, potentially due to its role in functional repair ( Miller.M .et al., 1993). Therefore, an NO sensor would produce particular colours that could correspond to different levels of NO expected for certain diseases and disorders.
Another use is through the cells being stimulated to create a protein coat for resistance and persistence within the human body. These cells could be mass produced and contain vaccines which can be taken at birth. These cells can be used to target pathogens or other abnormalities that arise in the body.
Understanding Pathogens
(Henares, et, al., 2012). The process used by bacteria in which NO course quorum sensing through lux U within V.harveyi.
Pathogens have many different mechanisms and strategies of invasion and attack. For example, some pathogens produce biofilms. To create biofilms, bacteria signal to other bacteria to assess the population size and density (Tsou, A. et al. 2009). When numbers are sufficient, they switch on gene expression which leads to aggregation and adhesion. This is an example of quorum sensing, as has been demonstrated through Nitric Oxide responsive quorum sensing circuits though lux U within Vibrio harveyi (Henares,B. et al., 2012). A greater understanding of NO can be applied to research into pathogenic diseases which could lead to advances in the creation of cures and vaccines.
Construction and Buildings Emissions
In 2008 the Modern Buildings Services released an article detailing recommendations from the Buildings Regulation Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) encouraging construction and buildings companies to monitor levels of nitric oxide emissions. They detail nitric oxide formation through combustion reactions involved in certain construction methods and even household applicances (e.g. boilers) and the consequences of excess atmospheric nitric oxide, including the production of smog and acid rain. Production of a way to accurately sense nitric oxide levels in the form of the hybrid promoter would be an extremely useful analytical tool; further to this combining the hybrid promoter and the comparator circuit could see bacteria that could not only sense nitric oxide being released by these appliances etc, but could also express an enzyme to safely break nitric oxide down and prevent the formation of"

In order to achieve the functionality of pneumosensor, we must have a highly specific reporting system which will only give fluorescent signal under the presence of S. pneumoniae. In search for the suitable gene circuit, the discovery by Prof. Morrison on the competence for genetic transformation in S. pneumoniae which depends on quorum-sensing system to control many competence-specific genes acting in DNA uptake, processing, and integration has provided the ideal framework for this module. (Lee and Morrison, 1999) There is a link between this quorum-sensing system and the competence-specific genes, which is an alternative σx (ComX protein) that serves as a competence-specific global transcription modulator. (Luo and Morrison, 2003) In S. pneumoniae, competence (a state capable of being genetic transformed) happens transiently during the log phase growth, and is regulated by a quorum sensing system utilizing the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP). Upon stimulation by CSP, σx will be expressed and associated with RNA polymerase apoenzyme. The resulting holoenzyme will then be guided by σx to initiate transcription of a set of “late” genes enabling genetic transformation and other unknown functions. Characterized genes regulated by σx were found to contain an 8 base pairs consensus sequence TACGAATA known as the Cin-Box or the Com-Box. (Piotrowski, Luo, & Morrison, 2009). Taking advantage of this competence-specific mechanism, it is now able to produce the S. pneumoniae sensing device of high specificity by incorporating this system into E. coli.
iGEM 2014 Hong_Kong_HKUST Team has cloned σx from S. pneumoniae strain NCTC7465 and characterized its ability to initiate transcription of two downstream promoters with different lengths: PcelA ( BBa_K1379000 ) and PcomFA ( BBa_K1379001 ), which have the consensus Com-Box sequence. Though much information about the promoters is readily available nowadays, its characterization of promoter activity, specificity, sequence, as well as the biomolecular mechanism can be greatly enhanced with further investigations and experiments. Hence, we were interested in reproducing this gene circuit with all the associated genes and promoters to be combined into a single transcriptional unit. Despite the suggested susceptibility to leakage and other factors that may hinder or interrupt the mechanism, researches have reported that the pathway was highly specific to certain environmental conditions and stress, suggesting minimal or no leakage in the entire process.
PcelA and PcomFA promoters have high specificity to σ"

sfGFP(Sp) is a reporter gene originally optimized for Streptococcus pneumoniae. It has been shown when expressed in B. subtilis that the signal is even brighter than the one from sfGFP(Bs) (Overkamp et al. 2013) . To submit sfGFP(Sp) reporter gene as BioBrick ( BBa_K1930006 ) we cloned it in the pSB1C3 standard iGEM backbone.
PCR
Experiment:
06/10/16: sfGFP(Sp) was amplified from the pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) plasmid, that    we constructed during the project, with the primers prefix sfGFP(Sp) and    suffix sfGFP(Sp) (primer sequences can be found here ).
PCR mixture:
50 μl PCR assay was performed according to the following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gel see    following protocol .
Figure 1. DNA electrophoresis with amplified sfGFP(Sp)     gene (763 bp in size).
Conclusion:
The sfGFP(Sp) was successfully amplified from the pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) plasmid.
Procedure after gel validation:
PCR product was subsequently cleaned with PCR Purification Kit – Jena Bioscience .
Restriction digestion
Experiment:
The sfGFP(Sp) was cut with EcoRI and PstI. The backbone pSB1C3 (BBa_J04450) was digested with the same enzymes. This construct is carrying RFP reporter therefore it was used for easier screening after transformation. You could see self-ligations as red    colonies and the correct ones as white ones.

Further testing would be required to see if this would cause adverse effects.
When working with the mosquito traps, they would have to be at optimal distance from human residences. If they are too far, then the impact would not be as great, but if they are too close, it may lure more mosquitoes to humans. With the idea and knowledge of making mosquito traps, people might get the idea of luring mosquitoes into traps and killing them. This could possibly cause the extinction of mosquitoes, which can potentially have adverse effects on the ecosystem.

Instructors
We thank Xiaowo Wang and Zhen Xie, PIs in Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, for their tutoring and providing bench space for wet lab.
We thank Lei Wei and Weixi Liao, PHD students, for their support on experiment design and modeling.
Team training and Project start
The students in the Tsinghua-A team came up from different majors. We took courses together and had special training in synthetic biology and bioinformatics. All of the designs, constructs, models, human practices and experiments presented in Tsinghua-A’s Wiki were performed by students of the 2016 Tsinghua-A team. The instructors and teaching assistance were providing feedback and advice about the experiments and models. And they also give us lab support and help with the presentation coaching. We are proud of completing the project on ourselves.
Our instructors teach a synthetic biology course and we start the course in September, 2015. It is a pity that the syllabus and course materials are not freely available online but we are lucky to take the course since we have learned a lot of useful knowledge. We started our brainstorming in January, 2016 and we start our project and do our experiments in February, 2016. We are glad to have an opportunity to do a complete project by ourselves and we have fun doing it."

Biosafety. Open Day at the German Armed Forces.
English Version
Many people know those movies: an accident at a laboratory of a ruthless multinational company and soon almost whole mankind mutates to all sorts of strange creatures. In the majority of these cases muscled armed forces march up and shoot at everything that comes across their ways.  Thus it's not astonishing that some people I was talking to had exactly this pictures from movies and computer games on their minds during our conversation about synthetic biology and biosafety. But can this myth from Hollywood bear reality?
During my commitment at the firefighters I already got to knew some courses of action to ensure ABC-safety and experienced such an effort  myself (fortunately just a false alarm – as it turned out afterwards). Now the opportunity arouse to visit the open day at the ABC-defense regiment of the German military forces to receive an impression of the alleged “Rambos”.
After arrival at the barracks we were welcome by some friendly men in uniforms who gave us a tour and patiently answered our questions about their jobs. Numerous demonstrations and stands informed about the wide range of duties. We gained deep insights into a world beyond our cuddly lab. For instance, the armoured reconnaissance vehicle „Fuchs“ as a „mobile laboratory“ offers the opportunity to detect radioactive and chemical contamination directly on-site. In cases of biological weapons or compounds sample taking for analysis in an facility assigned for this purpose is also possible. Sophisticated filtering systems, mobile mass spectrometers and numerous other  assistive equipment enable missions at locations where most people would usually rather reluctantly go for a drive at.
After Missions within safety zones around contaminated areas, of course materials and persons have to be decontaminated"

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," is the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains.
Aims
Our objective is to make an antibiotic-resistant bacterial population sensitive again to the selfsame antibiotics.
Results
Construction and characterization of phagemids coding for small RNA targeting antibiotic resistance proteins.
Showed theoretically burden of a device is critical for the maintenance of a genetic element in a population.
Successful conversion of antibiotic resistant population of E. coli to a sensitive state (on two different antibiotic resistances).
Our synthetic phage conveys antibiotic-sensitivity to an antbiotic-resistant population. The anti-Chloramphenicol phage system effectively killed 99.1% of the Chloramphenicol resistant population and the anti- Kanamycine phage effictevely killed 99,5% of the Kanamycine resistant population.
Modelling
Population Dynamics Model
This model investigates the propagation of horizontal gene-transfer via phagemid/helper system. We study the effect of the burden of a desired device on the maintenance of the system in time.
Left: scheme representing the regular non-lytic M13 bacteriophage horizontal spread. Right: scheme representing the main processes of the phagemid/helper system.
Structure Based Modelling
SirA: Using Swiss pdb we demonstrated the superimposed 3D structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis SirA and Escherichia coli CysI highlighting their similarities and differences. Both proteins are important in their respective sulphite reduction pathways. We then predicted the effect of a small drug target based on SirA's structure.
FprA: Using LigandScout 3.1, we searched over 8100 drug compounds from the BindingDB and Chembl databases for drugs targetting mycobacterial Ferredoxin NADP reductase (FprA). We have modelled Pyridoxine's interaction to its active site.
Flux Balance Analysis
We used an E. coli model iJR904 obtained from BiGG database as a starting model and obtained a growth rate represented by the f value of 0.9129. We then deleted the reaction which encodes for the sulphite reduction pathway and obtained a f value of -8.63e-13 indicating that the sulphite reduction pathway is essential. We wrote a program which finds all essential reactions in M. tuberculosis and E. coli SBML models and attempts to restore growth for each essential E. coli model with essential reactions from M. tuberculosis to identify other metabolic pathways we could apply a targeted drug screen to.  We identified 100 other essential reactions we can target.

Module 1: Phyto-Route
Chemotaxis is the movement of bacteria based on attraction or repulsion of chemicals. Roots secrete a variety of compounds that E. coli are not attracted to naturally. Accordingly, we engineered a chemoreceptor into our chassis that can sense malate, a common root exudate, so that it can swim towards the root. Additionally, E. coli are actively taken up by plant roots, which will allow targeted IAA delivery into roots by our system.

1. Introduction
Chemotaxis is the movement of bacteria up a concentration gradient of chemoattractants (e.g. malate in our project) and away from repellents (e.g. poisons). E. coli is too small to detect any concentration gradient between its two ends. These bacteria resample their surroundings every 3-4 seconds, causing the cells to either tumble or to run[1]. Chemoattractants transiently increase the probability of ‘tumbling’ (or bias). This is followed by a sensory adaptation process that returns the bias to baseline, enabling the cell to detect and respond to further concentration changes. A small step change in chemoattractant concentration in a spatially uniform environment increases the response time from 1 second to 2-4 seconds[2]. Changes to the saturating level of chemoattractant can increase the response time to several minutes.
Each chemoreceptor on the bacterium has a periplasmic binding domain and a cytoplasmic signalling domain that communicate with the flagellar motors via a phospho-relay sequence involving the CheA, CheY, and CheZ proteins. The results of modelling the chemotaxis pathway will determine the threshold chemoattractant concentration for bacterial detection and the level at which the bacterial chemoattractant detection"

3.RT-PCR validation on transcriptional level
After failure of detecting target proteins using SDS-PAGE, we used   RT-PCR to examine the expression of the target genes on   transcriptional level. The results were shown in Fig. 5. We used 16S   rRNA gene as an house keeping gene to compare the expression level of   target genes. The results showed that DEBS1 gene was successfully   expressed, albeit the transcription level was relatively low compared   with other target genes (acc, pcc and sfp) whose transcription are   controlled by T7 promoter as well. The low transcription level of   DEBS1 gene is in consistent with our SDS-PAGE results. This result   might due to the large size of DEBS1, which could hamper both the   transcriptional and translational efficiency.
4.Fluorescence detection analyses
To further confirm the expression of DEBS1, we monitored the   fluorescence of RFP under Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope (Fig. 6).   The results showed that after excitation with lazer source, red   fluorescence was monitored in the RFP+DEBS1+TE transformant, while in   the BL21 strain, no fluorescence was detected. These results indicate   that RFP+DEBS1+TE was successfully expressed in the transformant.
Figure6: Results of fluorescence detection
5.UPLC-MS/MS Detection of TKL 1B
To test if RFP+DEBS1+TE was functionally expressed, the transformant   was grown in Luria Broth (LB) liquid medium and induced with IPTG.   After 48h of induction, cells were harvested and the supernatant was   used for the extraction of the product TKL1B. After extraction, the   samples were concentrated by 5 times and subjected into a triple   quadrupole mass spectrometry and monitored under an MRM mode using the   parent ion /product ion=173.1/155.1 channel. The results were shown in   Fig. 7. The retention time of the target product in the UPLC column   was 6.42 min, using water/methanol gradient elution protocol. We   monitored a strong response at m/z = 155.1 ion pair in the RFP  +DEBS1+TE transformant sample. The ion pair"

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

SynBio Map Entries of East Asian Countries
The SynBio Map identifies and locates companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in synthetic biology research. It is a good tool to compare the trend of synthetic biology around the world. This map was created at the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (""Synthetic biology project,"" ).
With 369 entries in the map, the United States has the most entries in the SynBio map. This value exceeds the sum of all the map entries of Asian countries combined. This indicates that the United States is an important player on the global synthetic biology stage - ""Synthetic biology project"".
In Asia, Japan, with 22 entries has the most entries followed by Mainland China with 20 entries. Considering the fact that no entries were listed in 2009, we can infer that the synthetic biology scene in Asia, especially in Japan and China is rapidly taking shape. Also looking at the map, we have noticed that how synthetic biology is developed in a certain country depends on the political or economic status of that country. For example, China, a socialist country, has no entries of private companies listed in the SynBio map, while Japan, a country with a free market economy, has around one third of the entries from private companies (""Synthetic biology project"").
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Many different teams all around the world participate in the international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. In this competition, teams use methods of synthetic biology to develop their projects. Because the iGEM competition and synthetic biology are closely related, we have searched for information on the number of teams that took part from East Asia to make a comparison and ultimately infer the trend of synthetic biology in these countries.

Week 15 Pre-Regionals
9/28/13-10/3/13
With the wiki frozen and the North American Regional Jamboree looming, we focused on getting all of our data together for the presentation and poster. Refinement of our presentation and poster were our top priorities before heading off to Toronto.
10/4/13-10/6/13
Time for the North American Regional Jamboree! We were glad to have our presentation early on Saturday, so we could relax and enjoy the other presentations. Everyone did an incredible job, and Toronto was a blast. We are thrilled to have advanced to the World Championship Jamboree and cannot wait to go to MIT.
Week 16 Post-Regionals
10/7/13-10/12/13
After taking a brief break to catch up on some sleep and schoolwork, we met with our advisors to discuss what we plan to accomplish before the World Championships. We decided on expanding our RiboTALs to targeting GFP under the control of the well characterized Anderson Promoter Collection. Since the Anderson Promoters are a family of constitutive promoters that have measured relative strengths, we believe they can give us predictable system responses. We plan to use 5 of the Anderson Promoters: J23100 , J23101 , J23105 , J23106 and J23109 , which have a wide range of activity and use our model to predict"

Weighing ship
Electrodes and Power Source
Procedure
Clean your working area by wiping down with 70% ethanol.
Weigh up 0.5g of agarose in a weighing ship for a 1% agarose gel.
Measure up 50mL of TBE buffer in a measuring glass. Note: Make sure to use the same buffer as the one in the gel box (do not mix different buffers and do not use water).
Add the TBE and the agarose powder onto a microwaveable flask and swirl to mix.
Microwave the mixture for 1-3 min and check for clarity and complete dissolvation while swirling. Note: Do not overboil the solution, as some of the buffer will evaporate and thus alter the final percentage of agarose in the gel. Many people prefer to microwave in pulses, swirling the flask occasionally as the solution heats up.
Once clear, let the agarose cool cown for some time (to not damage the gel trays), approximately 5 min.
Add 5uL of Gel Red. Swirl to mix.
Pour the agarose carefully onto the gel try with the well comb well attached and in place. Note: Pour slowly to avoid bubbles which will disrupt the gel. Any bubbles can be pushed away from the well comb or towards the sides/edges of the gel with a pipette tip.
Let it solidify for approximately 30 min.
Remove the well comb from the solid gel and place it in the gel box (electrophoresis unit).
Fill up the gel box with running buffer to the maximum marking, or until the gel is completely covered.
Prepare the samples with loading dye. Note: Loading dye serves two purposes: 1) it provides a visible dye that helps with gel loading and will also allows you to gauge how far the gel has run while you are running your gel; and 2) it contains a high percentage of glycerol, so it increases the density of your DNA sample causing it settle to the bottom of the gel well, instead of diffusing in the buffer.
Pipett a molecular ladded onto the first well and then continue with adding the samples onto the following wells. Note: When loading the sample in the well, maintain positive pressure on the sample to prevent bubbles or buffer from entering the tip. Place the very top of the tip of the pipette into the buffer just above the well. Very slowly and steadily, push the sample out and watch as"
UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Notebook#MeetingNotes_-_-_TEXT.html," it was more suitable to a symposium. The presentation was filmed, so it will be sent to all of the advisors. Discussion - Bi-weekly meeting with advisors o What do we discuss in this meeting?  Present our ideas for projects to the advisors so they can give us an indication of how we are progressing and if our plans are viable. o Introduction to Prof. Liu of Bioengineering as one of our advisors. - Team Operation o Would identifying a topic in the first week of summer be too late? o Brainstorming  Rules: · No idea is bad. Especially for the first 2 weeks, there should be no filter. Everyone should have the chance to speak. · After a few weeks start editing the ideas. Check iGEM.org to make sure that no one has done our idea before. This is also another good resource to check and see what type of projects went well and why. o Dr. Bhalerao advises to skip looking at the past projects of UIUC iGEM or other iGEM teams. Courtney agrees that we will never be proficient in synthetic biology, so it’s important to just come up with good ideas (which is the hard part). Looking at past presentations and projects is what we should all do individually, not at the meeting. o Our project should be feasible, something we enjoy, and something really cool. Our presentation should also be able to market and capitalize our idea, as well as convince everyone that it is better and more exciting than anything else. o Look at our old past projects and see if we can finish any or do any better. - Team Collaboration o Is collaborating with the University of Michigan team, or others, feasible?  Try to build bridges with as many teams as possible. That way we have as many options as possible. These contacts need to be made soon.  Our collaboration can be pooling human practices, sharing data or technology, or even sharing a project. It is possible to actually collaborate on the same project, especially if one lab blind tests the other’s idea, or one team plans and the other executes. - iGEM registration o Registration is now open. Do we have an iGEM account?  Yes. o Can we join iGEM – Entrepreneurship?  A good idea, ultimately we do want our project to be applicable in real life.  We need to acquire an additional advisor from the business school. Try Kathy Baylis in Agriculture/Consumer economics. She is a friend of Dr. Bhalerao’s and her husband is a professor in the business school. �"

LovTAP/Cph8
In addition to the primary UVR8-TetRDBD system, we are constructing a second genetic circuit. This circuit consists of well-characterised photoreceptors and transcriptional repressors that have been previously shown to work in-vivo, providing a practical alternative to the UVR8-TetRDBD-based system. Although LovTAP mainly acts as a blue-light photoreceptor, a minority of induced reactions are still caused by UV light (~16%). In our model, strong irradiance with blue light as well as red light serves as an indicator for sun light. The other states of our decoder filter out common light sources.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the activity of the enzyme enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which converts carbohydrates derived from glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway to plant metabolites and aromatic amino acids. It was identified as a biosensor target through our human practices when we attended the N8 conference. We attempted to design a system capable of glyphosate detection. With little information regarding mechanisms of glyphosate interactions within the cell, we could not identify a simple system in which a responsive transcription factor was able to affect the production of a reporter gene. This is a common issue in many biosensor projects.  To show the adaptor in action we chose to develop a part that would measure the level of glyphosate through the production of formaldehyde. There are known sensors for formaldehyde such as Tokyo’s 2012 biosensor . Our design relies on the natural biochemical systems, the c-p lyase pathways, in E. coli to convert glyphosate to sarcosine. We then designed a part, SOX, based on the production of the enzyme sarcosine oxidase, encoded by soxA to convert sarcosine to formaldehyde ready for detection by a formaldehyde producing input module. The mining of transcriptome data has previously been used to find responsive DNA elements to a molecule of interest (Groningen 2012). Therefore, we analysed differences in transcriptome data between glyphosate sensitive and insensitive plants. A number of genes were found which were differently expressed. However, it was determined that it is more likely that this differential expression was not due to glyphosate directly, but rather the aromatic amino acid starvation caused by EPSPS inhibition by glyphosate, making these systems unsuitable for direct glyphosate detection. Various other systems we designed were also far from ideal, with high levels of complexity and reliance on native plant machinery. Through conversations with biosensor developers, we found that this problem was common in biosensor development - large amounts of often unavailable data is required for system design. For the Sensynova framework, we needed a more generic solution to this issue. Therefore, we expanded our search to look for biochemical reactions which we could monitor instead. This resulted in our concept of “adaptor” devices which can biochemically convert a difficult to sense molecule into a molecule for which there is already a genetic sensing component.

Safety in iGEM
Please visit the main Safety page to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible research in iGEM.
On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can go beyond the questions on the safety forms, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto this wiki page.)
Safe Project Design
Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment
Including an ""induced lethality"" or ""kill-switch"" device
Safe Lab Work
What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!
Safe Shipment
Did you face any safety problems in sending your DNA parts to the Registry? How did you solve those problems?"
TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics conclusions_-_-_TEXT.html," limiting because there is always ""room to go deeper"". However, as innocent as reducing life may appear to be it also has the ability to devaluate our perception of life itself. It is this fate, more than any other possible negative consequence, that is the true threat of synthetic biology and science as a whole.
The reductionist approach is also believed to be limiting because it does little to explore the emergent properties of complex systems which may be at the core of our perception self-awareness and other concepts usually considered to be meta-physical in nature; the nature of our soul and the need to assign meaning to life.
As described by others, combining biological subsystems to make a bigger system that is considered to be living, such as a bacterium, is more than just the combination of their properties. The constituting subsystems are not inert with respect to each other. Instead there is crosstalk, which results in emergent properties of the entire system, none of which were part of the subsystems. This concept has nothing magical or superstitious about it. Emergence adds a layer of complexity that is much more difficult to unravel than to understand subsystems individually because it requires a full understanding of all subsystems and their mutual interactions. In any case, the reductionist approach is necessary to get to this stage because it simplifies the initial characterisation of subsystems.
Finally, one statement describes the relation between consciousness and life through a paradox: although life is not consciousness, strangely enough, for us, consciousness is life, referring to the fact that consciousness is not a necessary property of life.
Recommendations
As described in the conclusions, a big issue that comes back in different subject areas is communication. There is not only the issue of communicating scientific advances, but also discussing (ethical) issues that have emerged from synthetic biology and assessing the risks involved in certain projects. The current communication of synthetic biology by the media is generally not objective. Statements such as ""playing God"" draw attention but can give synthetic biology a bitter taste. We have experienced some issues with media because of biased description of synthetic biology in general and our project specifically. We recommend in the future, scientists and media work closely together to overcome these issues.
Secondly, both for biosafety and for biosecurity the scientific community has expressed its perception towards the risks involved in synthetic biology and they believe  that additional regulation can limit or even reduce these risks.
At last, with our survey we aimed to raise the awareness on ethical issues mainly focusing on the extreme application of the reductionist and bottom-up approach. We got great feedback from many participants and when looking at the"

Innovative funding approaches
Since 2000, the business model of the pharmaceutical industry has been challenged by numerous issues. Indeed, while regulatory bodies approve fewer new medicines, it has to face the « patent cliff », where many blockbuster drugs patents expire, leaving the industry to cope with a financial loss that often represent a large proportion of its income. For example, in 2009, Pfizer lost patent protection on its most profitable product lipitor which accounted for 27% of its total revenues. As a result sales growth of prescription drugs is on a declining trend. When a drug is under patent protection, only the pharmaceutical company that holds the patent is allowed to manufacture, market the drug and eventually make profit from it. When the patent goes off, after about fifteen years depending on the countries, the drug refered to as « generic drug » can be manufactured and sold by other companies and removing market monopoly from the company that produced the patented drug.
Although pharmaceutical companies can renew the patent by implementing significantly the original compound, this new competition results in a significant drop in drug costs, but also put pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to reduce drug research and development expenditure as they get more and more expensive. Plus, improving already patended drugs may require new clinical trials and re-application of the patent. In other words, « translating » scientific discoveries into useful therapetics is directly impacted by these issues, even if the pharmaceutical industry had foreseen the patant cliff and prepared for it in several ways, including mergers, acquisitions, agreements with generic producers post-patent expiry and investing into biopharmaceutics development. Nevertheless, with more than 60% of all worldwide deaths caused by heart diseases, stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes  according to the World Health Organization (WHO), medical innovation is greatly needed. It was estimated that new drug innovation was responsible of 40% of the two-year increase life expectancy from 1986 to 2000 (Lichtenberg 2005). This particular economic situation, greatly influenced by health preoccupation contributed to the develoment"

1.TRPC5 collection
Transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5) is a calcium ion permeable channel that can be activated by mechanic force. [1] In our study, audiogenetics is defined as a method of gene regulation by applying sound precisely and safely and the external sound signal is transduced through TRPC5. In order to get mutated TRPC5 with high sensitivity to mechanical stress, we need to find out the specific fragment of TRPC5 which is related to stress sensing. According to the structure of TRPC5, we finally chose the ankyrin repeats region as the mutated region. [2] We used GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit (Provided by Agilent Technologies Company) to make a library of mutated ankyrin repeats by error-prone PCR. We submitted 5 TRPC5 from our library and we used site-directed mutation to mutate EcoRI and PstI restriction sites in the coding sequence based on codon degeneracy.
2. mR-GECO
GECO family is a series of fluorescent proteins artificially engineered to response to changes in the concentration of calcium ion Ca2+. [3] They can help to visualize intracellular signaling activity by the intensity. According to Zhao’s article, there is optimally 110-folds of emission change. By recombining the GCaMPs and GFP, firstly they got the G-GECO1 (green). The indicator we used is R-GECO1 derived from mApple and G-GECO1.1.

We used a 21 gauge needle to load the silk dope into a 1 mL BD syringe with luer lok. We then replaced the needle with PEEK tubing of 0.127 mm inner diameter. We used a syringe pump to extrude the silk at a rate of 10 uL/min into a coagulation bath of 90% v/v isopropanol and water. After the fiber formed, we drew it out of the bath and wound it around a pair of tweezers that we spun by hand to collect the fiber as it formed. In later iterations of our spinning apparatus, we wound the fiber around a motorized godet to collect the fiber as it formed in order to automate the process. We designed the godet in OpenSCAD and 3D printed it in a Stratasys UPrint SE.

A later version of our setup. The glass dish contains the isopropanol bath. The godet is driven by a stepper motor.
A closeup of our spinner setup. The godet draws the fiber from the bath after it has formed.
Closeup of the co-spun silk wound around the godet.
Co-spun silk after removing from the godet. A small volume (~500 uL) of dope yields a very long contiguous length of fiber, but in order to remove from the godet without inadvertently stretching the fiber, we had to cut it.
Measuring fiber diameter and fluorescence
We used an EVOS light microscope to image the fibers under white light and blue excitation light. We used ImageJ to determine fluorescence of the fiber.
Testing the composite silk
We tested our co-spun fibers in an Instron model 5564 table mounted system with a 10kN load cell. To prepare our fibers for testing, we mounted them on cardstock frames with 10 mm gauge length. We then loaded the carded fibers into the Instron with pneumatic grips and cut the sides of the cardstock frame. We then had the machine extend the fiber at a rate of 0.1 mm/min and measure the tensile force of the fiber.

Combining the fast growth of Vibrio natriegens with powerful genome engineering methods like Crispr Cas, MAGE, CAGE, the ability for natural transformation and MuGENT, would allow rapid genome prototyping and could open up complete new possibilities for building up synthetic genomes from scratch. This would enable engineering customizable microbes with complete new properties specifically tailored for the individual needs for a broad range of applications.
VibriExpress
Sometimes it is really hard to part with old things and adopt to new ones. But as scientists, it is our responsibility to try out new and unexplored things in order to advance progress and improve on already known. To convince you all, to start working with a new chassis we will show that all commonly used techniques are transferable from E. coli to V. natriegens, without much effort. Since it is important to overexpress and purify proteins in heterologous systems, a fast growing protein expression strain is required. Before starting to overexpress a protein, you need to make important decisions: “What kind of system would be the best?”, “Which chassis could be the most effective” or “Do I need a chassis at all, what about cell-free-expressions systems?”
There is not the one and only right way to overexpress a protein. For each protein, other aspects have to be considered in order to make a good decision. These decisions depend on different characteristics of the desired protein, like its solubility, if it is a bacterial protein or a eukaryotic one or if it is toxic or not.
In E. coli, several expression systems are established to cover a broad spectrum, but the most commonly used is the T7 expression system. To enable scientists, to overexpress their proteins much faster and purify a higher protein yield,  we decided to establish the T7 system in the world’s fastest growing organism V. natriegens and did further analysis to learn which genetic modifications are needed to use its full potential. As a model, we were guided by the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). This E. coli strain is often used for heterologous protein overexpression. In our opinion, the most important features of BL21 (DE3) are the genomic integration of the T7 RNA Polymerase gene and the deletion of proteases like Lon and OmpT to improve the protein yield by decreasing the protein degradation (Dunn & Studier 1983) , (Kim et"

We visited Peking University in the end of August, aiming at establishing collaboration between the two iGEM teams. We have had an open and interesting discussion with their teammate about experiment, modeling, and thoroughly exchanged valuable information pertaining each other's project. During the meeting, both teams have received precious advice during communication.  We offered suggestion for their modeling part, and in exchange, Peking University iGEM team generously provided their fluorescence microscope. The two teams both agree that we should promote communication and collaboration between iGEM teams in order to the support development of synthetic biology.

Searching BioBrick in the Registry is an important activity in doing iGEM. Sometimes you kind of just want to search a part when you have the idea. Therefore, it would be great if we could conduct research on our phone everywhere we like.
Luckily, SUSTC designed BioSearch this year. It is an iOS software that supports searching the Registry on your mobile device. We tested the software using our teammates' iOS devices in searching parts by name, keywords etc., and wrote useful feedback to help them improve the app.  We sincerely hope that the app would become a popular and accurate way to search BioBrick in the Registry.
Our teammate helps test BioSearch.
Nanjing University
Social network is serving an increasing role in linking people with common interests. That's how we met with Nanjing University iGEM team. They are spreading out their iGEM questionnaire on Sina Weibo, the Chinese Twitter, when we received their message about their questionnaire. Their questions are about does the iGEM website serve a good role in distributing information and offering communication. The members of our lab were pleased to answer their question, and offered our own suggestions in building a more open and interactive iGEM website that can boost the communication and collaboration in the iGEM.
Our teammates carefully answered Nanjing University's questionnaire.

By BioBricking and characterizing this system, we wish to make it possible to get a Y. enterocolitica density triggered response. Our goal with this system is to control our two other systems, the Targeting and the Killing system.
System Design
While stealing the yenbox together with the wild type promoter fused with it, we had no idea about the strength of the wild type promoter or if it would even work at all. Because of this, we created an alternative version where we replaced the wild type promoter with a standardised one (J23113). In the wild type version there is an overlap between the wild type promoter and the yenbox. Hence, we mimicked the same while creating our customized version where we had an overlap between the promoter and the yenbox. Since the strength of the promoter would correspond to the leakage in our system, we wanted to have a weak promoter to minimize the leakage. We chose the constitutive promoter J23113 ( BBa_J23113 ) from the Anderson library. Unfortunately, the promoter J23113 did not begin with the same two bases as the end of the yenbox. We were left with the option of either changing the two bases in the yenbox sequence or changing the two bases in the sequence of the promoter J23113. In the article by Ching-Sung Tsai and Stephen C. Winanas [1] they discovered that the binding between the activator YenR and the recognition region of the yenbox is not dependent on the entire sequence of the yenbox. Depending on which part of the yenbox that is changed or replaced, YenR binds to the yenbox with different strengths. However, it still interacts with the yenbox and induces the strength of the promoter. Based on this fact, together with the knowledge that the Anderson promoters are very sequence dependent, we chose to change two bases in the sequence of the yenbox.
We also stole the coding sequence [2] of the activator YenR, from Y. enterocolitica, which we codon optimized for E. coli using a IDTs web tool [3] and synthesized it together with the RBS B0034 ( BBa_B0034 ). Since we always want production of the activator YenR, it was coupled to three different constitutive promoters from the Anderson promoter library with three different strengths.

PCR was preformed on LVA less GFP with tet promoter using primers yellow#8 and yellow#9. The PCR was purified using the gel purification SOP.
A digest was done on PCR products #11 and #12 in an attempt to ligate these. Ligation was done in 30 mins at RT whereupon the ligase was inactivated at 65 °C for 10 mins. Purification of the ligation product was done, diverging from the SOP and resulting in an unusable amount of product.
Sunday 6/7
The lacP promoter (BBa_R0010)and GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840) have been ligated but the concentration was low and therefore we made PCR on the product.
The PCR product was run on a gel. The band was hard to separate from other bands around the same length (1400bp). We cut out the right length and purified it. Nanodrop was measured.
PCR1 (consisting of template 2:2P) and PCR2 (consisting of template 2:2P) have both been fast digested with SpeI. PCR3 (consisting of template 2:24D) has been fast digested with XbaI. PCR1 and PCR3 were attempted ligated (for 30 min) and so were PCR2 and PCR3. These ligations did not show any bands around the expected length during gel purification. Two new ligations (of the same), with higher concentrations of digested PCR products, are reacting overnight.
Week 28 (7/7 - 13/7)
Monday 7/7
We realized that we have to step back in the process by inserting the different parts we want to ligate into a plasmid before ligating them to each other.
Therefore we started our day in the lab by doing a PCR reaction on PCR1 (consisting of template 2:2P) and PCR2 (consisting of template 2:2P). Unfortunately PCR2 didn't show the right band length when run on gel.
PCR was also done on the lacP promoter (BBa_R0010)and GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840). The sequences machted the lenght seen on the gel. The band from the gel was cut out and purified.
PCR1, PCR3 and LacP were digested.

The digested products from yesterday were purified.
Furthermore PCR on PCR 2 was repeated, this time with a gradient spanding from 53°C - 58"

  The history of Zhejiang University goes back to 114 years ago.As a university founded in 1897, Zhejiang university is one of the earliest Western academic new type schools in China. During the Second World War, Zhejiang University suffered disaster. but insisted on the school's spirits. And moved to the hinterland of China to avoid the aggressor. After called on Zhejiang Univeristy,     the British scholar Joseph Needham said, ""I found in this oriental Cambridge.""
  Zhejiang University survived the War and gradually become one of the top universitys in China. As a truly comprehensive institution with a full range of disciplines, Zhejiang University covers lots of subjects and aims at providing an outstanding education that will enable its students to build a future of professional, intellectual and personal success, capable of leadership in different areas, whether it be political, economic or academic. The elective system of the school is very flexible，so students can enroll whatever the courses they are interested in. That is why we could build such a team with various majors but have no difficulity in understanding each other.
  The school locates in the city of Hangzhou. A saying goes that:""Hangzhou is the most beautiful city in the world!""I don't know whether it is true,but it is the the most beautiful city I've ever seen.And I find that the school equips the beauty of this city.We have five campuses. The names are:""Yuquan"", ""Xixi"", ""Huajiachi"", ""Zhijiang"", and""Zijingang"". These names are all ""water"" related. In English,they mean spring, stream, pool, river, and port. Each campus has its own beauty. Yuquan is charming, Xixi is elegant, Huajiachi is simple, Zhijiang is ancient and Zijingang is modern.

We believe that a culture of yeast and bacteria that can be grown at home and supplements                         fermented foods with vitamins could reach far more people than the anganwadi centers:                         those cultures would only need to be distributed once, which would not be very costly as the                         packages can be made to be very small and light and one culture would act as a starter culture                         for many more. In this way, the culture would be maintained in the home, without the need for                         people to travel long distances to have access to nutritional supplements.
Amma Unavagam
Another way to cheaply give people access to micronutrient-rich foods could be to implement our product in the popular canteens called Amma Unavagam (meaning “Mother Restaurants) which are being developed by the Government in the state of of Tamil Nadu, mostly in the city of Chennai. Those canteens offer people dishes like idli and dosa, both made of fermented rice, for the very cheap price of Rs. 1 for an idli ($0.01).
Those canteens are visited by thousands of people. If they were using our product during the fermentation of their rice, those people would benefit from the micronutrients produced by the engineered strains.
An adaptable solution
Our product is also more accessible in that it doesn't have the same geographic and                         climate constraints as cultures of rice or other crops. Contrary to Golden Rice, the rice                         developed by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and the University of Freiburg that                         biosynthesizes beta-carotene and can only be grown in environments with very high water                         availability, a microbial culture can be grown anywhere. Even though this summer we mostly                         focused on microbial cultures of fermented dishes composed of rice, microbes are used to ferment                         any kind of cereals as well as other foods. So our product can be adapted to a very wide range                         of fermented dishes, and could also be used by people who don’t eat rice.
Acceptance
People's opinion
Since the very beginning of our project, we researched which solution would be convenient and acceptable to them, by asking them about their habits and opinions. For this we interviewed local indian citizens, and well as local authorities in India (find the details on the Acceptance page ).
We found out that people in India don’t want GMO to be associated with farmers, and they don’t want them to be dependent on one company that would have monopoly on the product. This fitted well with the idea of strains that can be grown at home by everyone. By focusing on yeast and"

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html," way only the rehydration buffer (with the activation reagent) and the DNA isolated from the milk sample need to be added. Furthermore, we came up with a creative way to regulate the temperature, by using the materials we already had in our toolbox thermos flask. By adding a meat thermometer that can measure up to 120 °C, we can bring the water to the right temperature and keep it around the optimum temperature for RPA an in vitro transcription.
For future research on DNA isolation from gram-positive bacteria in milk we advise to boil for at least 15 minutes and immediately put samples on ice for 15 minutes before centrifuging. We recommend testing the sensitivity of the whole tool by also testing the RNA prepared from all the different dilutions DNA with Cas13a. Lastly, it would be interesting to test an isothermal T7 RNA polymerase. In this way, not only the RPA-reaction works at room temperature, but the whole RPA and in vitro transcription can be done at this temperature, greatly increasing the user-friendliness of our tool.
Conclusions
We experimentally validated that boiling is an easy and effective method to isolate DNA from gram-negative bacteria in milk and gram-positive bacteria in LB. Also, that the combined RPA and in vitro transcription reaction can be performed at a constant temperature. Furthermore, we mapped out and tested all the sample preparation steps to get from gram-negative bacteria with our target gene to our target RNA, which activated Cas13a. We can state that we successfully prepared a biological sample for detection via Cas13a. We translated what we learned into a user-friendly protocol that can be followed by farmers to perform sample preparation on their farm.
CINDY Seq - Generating a visible readout
The goal of the detection module was to demonstrate our newly invented coacervation method, named Coacervate Inducing Nucleotide Detection of Your Sequence (CINDY Seq). CINDY Seq allows naked-eye detection of target recognition by Cas13a, exploiting the physical phenomenon called “coacervation”. This is the phenomenon that mutually attracting polymers phase-separate into polymer-rich regions (known as coacervates) and polymer-poor regions if the polymers are long enough and the conditions are right. More elaborate description of this method is provided on the design page , and a theoretical model describing the coacervation process is provided on the modelling page .

For this reason, pexiganan molecules lysing E.colis which contain pexiganan and get it out of the cells. The pexiganan which set the release of the cell will allow the elimination of Helicobacter pylori.
In this case, the protein that binds to DAMP and the tip imbedded in PEX. will be produced in the E. coli without rupturing the cell membrane. TEV Protease that produces in the presence of AND GATE and the active pexiganan will leave from DAMP,  and keep releasing the effective dose within and around the h.pylori. At the same time, we will provide eradication E.coli which is used as a producer and a carrier so that there won't be anymore possibility of colonization mucosa to have to be removed.
Background
Pexiganan
According to our researches, a very efficient protein called pexiganan, a molecule showing a broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activities against both gram negative and positive bacteria, seemed beneficial for killing H. Pylori.(Figure 1) Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are very popular because of their bactericidal activity and they seem potential alternatives to current antibiotics. Also, antimicrobial peptides are not affected by classical antibiotic mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, so this class of peptide have advantages to eradicate H.pylori instead of using current antibiotics. The other advantage of AMPs is that there aren’t any resistance to them-yet.  This was shown in a study too. (Figure 2)
In a paper, pexiganan’s killer activity is proved under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. (Xiao-Lin Zhang et al. 2015) It has exhibited a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro, and it has been tested against 3109 clinical isolate strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. (Ge, Y; MacDonald, D,L et al. 1999). By using normal H.Pylori treatment way, complete eradication is not possible because of the low antibiotic concentration in gastric mucosa. In addition, in the low pH of the gastric fluid, antibiotics are unstable. As a result of gastric emptying, the residence time is short for antibiotics in the stomach. Therefore, our strategy depends on providing production of pexiganan enter the mucosa according to presence of H.pylori or not. This system is based on"

May 14 – 20, 2012
The Distribution Kit 2012 arrived! Now we have a lot of new parts!
We prepared for second time samples of B2+ & B3+ to observe in the epifluorescence microscope the effect of time in the samples.
This time B2+ & B3+ presented much more fluorescence, and it persisted over time (at least 1 hour with no significant variation).
Additionally, we began to amplify the spider silk monomer ADF-3 from the plasmid that Christopher Voigt gave to us. But the amplicon was barely visible in the electrophoresis. We will have to try it again, or maybe try another technic like touch-down PCR. Or the primers are designed for repetitive areas?
May 21 – 27, 2012
We received the results of the DNA sequencing of Working Plasmid, GFP Reporter Plasmid and Protease Producer Plasmid. Fortunately, these results are coherent with our designs. Great news!
Also, we went to the confocal microscope

This isn't false. Hydrogen is explosive. Pressurised fuel tanks,however, are not a new mechanism of storage. A number of cars already run on compressed natural gas,a similarly explosive fuel source [8]. Toyota have engineered their hydrogen storage tank to withstand a 50 caliber rifle shot, without bullet penetration [8]. Able to withstand a localised pressure of 14-18 Kilojoules of force on impact, these pressurised gas fuel tanks are actually in many ways safer than the petrol ones found in the majority of cars [8].
MYTH #5: Hydrogen Storage Fuelling System Are Dangerous
John: To be honest, I wouldn't think they're too much more dangerous than regular petrol stations. Like, I mean, petrol and gas can also ignite, so what's the difference?
This isn’t too far from the truth. The technology to fill up compressed natural gas power cars is much the same as the technology to fill up hydrogen powered cars [1]. There are 16 million cars worldwide as of 2015, however, using compressed natural gas as a fuel source. And there hasn't been one pressurised fueling system failure [7].
MYTH #6: Hydrogen Filling Station Are Too Expensive to Build
Jessica: I reckon it'll be the same, why would it be more expensive than a regular petrol station? You'll still have a big fuel tank under the ground and still need a pump.
Fuel companies Linde North America and First Element Fuel have both stated that hydrogen fuelling station will on average cost around $2 million [3]. This is very similar to the price of a regular petrol station [3].
MYTH #7: Battery Electric Cars Are Obviously Better Than Hydrogen Fuel Cell
Brett: I'd want to look at the the science behind a statement like that.
To assess which is better, we conducted a comparison between the hydrogen 2016 Toyota Mirai and the battery electric 2015 Tesla Model S 60kWh.             The test showed:

When comparing the Hydrogen powered Mirai to the battery electric powered Tesla, we see that the Mirai is better in all three categories [4]. Although this is just one comparison, it indicates that battery powered"

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," we won the best presentation award. What's more, we were greatly benefited from Meagan’s lecture pointing out the importance of “After iGEM”. This strengthened our determination to contact the old members of XMU-China and luckily we got precious experiences and further understanding about this competition.
The 6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference
From July 30th to August 3rd, 2018, we participated in the 6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference hosted by National Chung Hsing University, Taichung. There was a total of 22 teams and 140 participants from Taiwan, China, and Japan, warming up for the final Jamboree in Boston at the end of October.
The conference invited wonderful speakers from the field of Synthetic Biology and Ambassador of the iGEM HQ to give a talk at the Opening Ceremony. Among them, Prof. Kenji Tsuge from Kobe University explained the emerging synthetic biology technology that can link quantities of large fragments of genes and perform these genes; Dr. Zhang Jui-Jen, an associate researcher at China Medical University Hospital, shared his experience in using synthetic biology entrepreneurship; iGEM Asian Ambassador Chen Hong explained some new systems and shared experience on behalf of iGEM. We gained tons of new ideas from these lectures, which had great influences on our next work.
In the five-day conference, we also had a 20-minute English presentation and a poster exhibition. It was the first time to present our project frankly to iGEMers from Asia, and a good opportunity to practice for the final Jamboree. At the end of the exhibition, professor Yang Wen-Ming from the field of molecular biology at National Chung Hsing University gave a comment on our presentation. Through the conference, we also made suggestions to other Asian teams, longing for more cooperation opportunities.
This conference has provided us tremendous new ideas to improve our project and final presentation.

SUSTech iGEM
This year, the SUSTech iGEM team used the microfluidic chip as the core carrier to build a complete hardware platform, which was very similar to the idea of XMU-China team in hardware design. On this basis, these two teams had an online communication on issues related to microfluidic chips.
SUSTech used high-precision and single-channel chip tubes to achieve cell sorting functions, with a peristaltic pump that provides driving force, and a flow meter that filters and encapsulates cell droplets. These devices greatly improve the precision of the entire device.

We  checked  our  plasmids  by  using  appropriate  restriction   enzymes and running gels. Another serious problem arose in case of ligation. The ligation was   carried out for 16hrs with an insert:vector ratio of 3:1 but we did not get any colonies at all! We   assumed that ligation was not occurring due to improper digestions of the insert. So we carried   out sequential digestion and again tried the ligation in the same procedure. This time we got a   single  colony  and  on  screening  it,  we  found  it  to  be  the  undigested  luxPR  transformant!  We   were terribly disappointed. Next, we tried checking whether there was any problem in the competent cells. For this, we took   a positive control of 50ug/ml of luxPR DNA and tried the ligation procedure again but with no   better result. After that, we started working on another way of cloning where we tried to get 55   bps  of  luxPR  cut  with  restriction  enzymes.  On  performing  sequential  digestion  of  luxPR  and   crtEBI, and running the product on 2% agarose gel, we were not able to get the 55 bps band   (instead, we got a gradient of bands of  same length). Yet, we did not lose hope. We  started   again  with  the  “3A  Assembly”  :  sequential  digestion  of  luxPR  and  crtEBI,  PCR  purification,   double digestion ­ luxPR with ECoRI and crtEBI with XbaI followed by heat kill for 5 mins. This   time we used 3:1:0.5 , 1:1:0.5 of luxPR:crtEBI:kanamycin backbone DNAs for ligation (16hrs)   and finally succeeded in getting colonies. Several other hurdles were also encountered by our wet­lab team. But our motivation boosted   our patience and perseverance to keep on struggling till we achieve the result.

Various gate designs may reproduce this truth table. The design we picked is the simplest one and is represented below.
NAND gate design with three biological transistors.
This gate accepts four types of gRNAs, two representing the state of the input A (0 or 1) and the other two representing the state of input B (also 0 or 1). We assume that only two different gRNAs (one for A, one for B) are present at one time; this assumption can be achieved experimentally by producing only the needed gRNAs. The output of the gate modeled here are fluorescent proteins: we have RFP for the state 1 of output C, while GFP represents the state 0.  Results of the simulation are presented below, where we used the model \(J=0\) (independent binding) for our transistors.
NAND output with (A0,B1) input
NAND output with (A1,B1) input
NAND output with (A0,B0) input
NAND output with (A1,B0) input
We see that our model reproduces the truth table of the NAND gate. This indicates that our design is promising (under the assumptions performed). Furthermore, we computed the response of a single transistor when activating and inhibiting dCas9-gRNA complexes are present at the same time to study the response of the gate when different concentrations of inputs are present.
NAND: GFP expression
NAND: RFP expression
We can see that this NAND gate design works as expected for any high concentration of the two input. In addition, we ca see that for GFP, there is some leakage when the output is A0-B1 or A1-B0. Finally, we see that the transition between output 0 and output 1 is very rapid at the boundaries. This is certainly caused by the fact that our inhibited level is zero (\(\alpha_{i}=0\)). Experimentally we won't expect such sharp transition.
Conclusion for E. coli
In conclusion, our model is able to quantitatively reproduce the behavior of the NAND gate. This indicates that the fine-tuning experiment worked well. We now own a computational tool which may assess the functionality of different gate designs (i.e different collections of transistors).

Our team went on to meet with the Chief Minister of Delhi, Mr. Arvind Kejriwal, to talk about collaborating with our team. As a consequence, Delhi Government has agreed to implement the project at a larger scale all throughout Delhi. So, basically, our project is going to affect the lives of people in an entire state, and what else can be a bigger achievement for us!
Not only that, we also made sure that the ethical restrictions on synthetic biology be eased out, thereby allowing a higher research scope and better outcomes. And, finally made him aware of the present scenario of Synthetic Biology, and made it a point that it gets publicised in a proper fashion all throughout India.
The literal impact our project can have on pollution control and the potential it has was enough for our Government to assure their tie up, which certainly is a big step taken ahead.

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project#Chemotaxis_-_-_TEXT.html," itself with flagellar proteins, thereby controlling the direction which flagellum rotates. However, in the presence of ligand, sensory kinase domain is not functional due to dissociation of CheA from chemoreceptor. This way CheY does nto associate with flagellar proteins and result is counterclockwise flagellar movement (Sourjik & Armitage, 2010).
In E. coli chemotaxis there is a number of other proteins, which have functions associated with the two component system and as a result it enables bacterium to move up or down a concentration gradient. This is mediated by CheR, a methyltransferase that methylates MCP (methyl accepting chemotaxis protein). This affects the receptor’s ability to associate with CheW and CheA. Dissociation of CheW and CheA from the chemoreceptor depends on the rising concentration of attractant, which in turn depends on the bacterium moving towards the source of attraction. This is driven by CheZ, a phosphatase that removes phosphate groups from CheY, while sensory kinase is dissociated. In addition, CheB  acts as a methylesterase and can remove methyl groups from the MCP receptor, to act as some kind of memory reset (Chelsky & Dahlquist, 1980).

The chemotaxis module is responsible for ensuring that our bacteria move towards roots. For this, the bacteria need to be able to sense a common root exudate. We have chosen E. coli chemotaxis to be rewired towards malic acid (also referred to as malate), compound found in TCA cycle, which is at low concentrations released form the roots. Since E. coli, the chassis we are using for lab experiments, does not normally exhibit chemotaxis towards malate, we needed to engineer a malate-responsive sensor into the microbes that will enable them to perform chemotaxis towards roots.
Following chemotaxis towards the roots, our bacteria should be taken up into the roots. We want the bacteria to get taken up into the plant roots to ensure that the concentration of indole-3-acetic acid in the plant is increased. If the bacteria remained outside the roots, this goal may also be reached but the risk that we would not increase the internal IAA concentration would be significantly higher. In addition, uptake of bacteria into the roots followed by secretion of chemicals presents a novel platform for modifying plants without engineering their genomes. In a paper published last year, Paungfoo-Lonhienne et al. showed that Arabidopsis and tomato plants are able"

Today was spent finalising anything we needed for the Westminster meet-up. Jack and Eloise practised the presentation some more, and we picked up the poster from Printing Services to check it over before we left.
As most of the team were doing last minute preparations for Westminster today, it was a slower lab day. The lab team - Dan, Eloise, Jack and Pablo - used Modular Cloning the clone DNAse1 and Lysozyme again, and transformed the products into DH5α E. coli cells. The Killer Red overnight cultures were glycerol stocked, miniprepped and had qubits carried out on them. The team prepared flasks of Killer Orange and Killer Red again, so Dan could test them in the light box whilst the others were away.
The Westminster team - Andy, Emily, Pablo, Joel, Hannah, Eloise, Jack and Alan - are currently on their way down to London by train, where they’ll stop overnight in preparation for the meet-up starting tomorrow!

Today was the first day of team presentations at Westminster - we had our talk at 2:30, and Jack and Eloise did an amazing job of presenting our project to the other teams. Our human practises aspect of the project was received very well by the others teams, as indicated by speaking with them later and the tweets we got about it.
It was great watching the other teams present and seeing how far they’ve come, and the guest speakers - Professor Jane Lewis (introduction), Dr Anatoliy Markiv (introduction), Edward Perello (CRISPR) and Dr Robert Smith (social and ethical dimensions of synthetic biology) - were all very interesting to listen to. We’re very much looking forward to tomorrow!
Yesterday’s DNAse1 and Lysozyme transformations turned out to be successful, so they were overnighted. Dan inoculated the flasks prepared yesterday with Killer Red and Killer Orange and took OD readings on them - the cultures were then incubated at 37℃ and 220rpm overnight. The DNAse1 and Lysozyme colonies were also overnighted in the 37℃, non-shaking incubator.

EDUCATION
Children are becoming the leading members of the society in the future, thus our team felt the necessity of alarming the students about the negative impact of plastic on environment and the solution to the problem: mealworms. Our team requested an educational institute for the gifted in Hankuk University of Foreign Studies to give a lecture to the students about the deleteriousness of plastic and the bacteria. As a result, about twenty students participated in the lecture in September 3rd and October 8th. Two of our team members made the lecture, mainly introducing the mechanism of mealworm decomposing plastic. We showed and explained the mechanism of mealworms’ digesting polystyrene. In addition, we offered the students the opportunity to touch and observe meal-worms.
RCNP EXHIBITION
Our team made a poster about our project to introduce it to students in Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies on July. RCNP is one of our school’s curriculum where students can participate in presenting their research on any topic they preferred. We exhibited our work in the main hallway of the school so that various school members including Humanities and Natural Science course students could see it. Our poster contained information about mealworms, bacterias inside of mealworms, and activities of what we did(campaigns, mini forums, visiting Korea University). The poster we created is shown below.
NEWSPAPER
“La Sociedad Espanola de Honor de HAFS' article”
On Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies’ official Spanish News website, one of our members posted an article about the mealworms’ digestion mechanism and the potential effect on Earth. The news website is highly accessible which allowed people from other parts of the world, including the Hispanics, could also get informed about the bio-degradability of mealworms. Also, the newspaper is printed and distributed to Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies making the information more accessible to the students in our school.

However, miRNAs present in saliva are less well documented. Saliva may also be less accurate as its composition can change depending on what was recently eaten so we didn’t look much more into this, but it could be a good area for further research.
Another cost involved in the test is the upfront equipment costs - see how we made a combined densitometer and fluorometer for less than £4 on our hardware page !
Screening cost-effectiveness model
To demonstrate that our test would be cost effective as part of a screening programme we built this cost effectiveness model. To do this it combines cancer prevelance data, the sensitivity and specificity values of our test, our cost analysis data and treament cost data.
We used Tammemägi et al.’s model to calculate the probability of someone getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. It is more sensitive than the simplistic criteria used by the National Lung Screening Trial, and thus a better way of selecting individuals for screening. Tammemägi et al. showed their model would be more cost effective method as more cancers were detected per number screened as it missed fewer cases of cancer. [16]
Although Tammemägi’s model was for lung cancer as a whole, we assume the risk factors put you at equal risk of non-small cell and small-cell lung cancer. As the miRNAs on which our test  is based do not indicate small cell lung cancer, we have built the model around NSCLC. All other figures are NSCLC specific.
A quality adjusted life year (QALY) represents one year in perfect health. The ‘quality adjusted’ part accounts for the quality of life for that year, for example 2 years with a 0.6 quality of life score would be 1.2 QALYs. QALYs can be used to measure the benefit a treatment provides (if any). Treatments costing less than £20,000 per QALY are deemed cost effective by NICE. Treaments between £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY may be decided to be cost effective by NICE if there is a high degree of certainty in the cost per QALY or when there are substantial benefits not captured in the cost per QALY figure.

∙ Vector+insert = 2205 bp (150 bp insert) (2055 bp vector)
∙ DNA: 649 g/mole/bp
∙ AB: 143105 g/mole
∙ 500 pg / 1431045 g/mol = 3.494 E -16 moles DNA
∙ 1.25 uL of 10 uM primers = 1.25 E -11 moles primers
∙ 1.25 E -11 / 3.494 E -16 = 35775.6
∙ log2(35775.6) = 15.1 cycles (assuming perfect PCR)

Gene doping as a result of the desire to be perfect is a substantial dilemma, making a strong focus on gene doping and the debate about it absolutely indispensable. The video below gives a summary of our expert discussion at the University of Stirling where we addressed the eminent threat of gene doping.

Video 1. An integrated discussion with experts on the treat of gene doping and how to combat it.
“Gene doping will probably already be happening given the huge amount of money going on in this industry.”

Due to lacking figures on actual gene doping use, unfortunately we cannot say gene doping is happening for sure. However, in this case the question should not be whether it is already happening, it should be whether we can afford not to worry. That is what we wanted to solve, because responsible innovation starts with anticipation.
Gene doping is a real problem. As the science improves the usage will expand. Testing is going to have an impact, in lots of diverse ways. This group have expertise and are willing to engage in transparent, open debate. I think @wada_ama and many others should talk to them. https://t.co/zrO6GQFSVz

In the meantime many (conventional) doping cases keep being revealed. Doping use is not only a risk for athlete health, but also has a big impact on his or her competitors. We interviewed Moniek Nijhuis , a former professional swimmer, who participated in many competitions including the Olympic Games, winning many medals. In the video we made, she tells about her experiences with doping and what it did to her when two years after a competition it was discovered that one of her competitors had been using doping. All these reasons sum up to ADOPE, since every athlete deserves a healthy and secure future and a fair chance.
2. Current Gene Doping Detection
Up until now no gene doping detection methods have been actively implemented. However, several research groups have been working on the topic, both with nested PCR and WGS.
2.1 Nested PCR
Last year, an Australian research group published one of the first detection method for gene doping ( Wilkin, T.et al, 2017 ). This method relies on a technique called nested PCR. Nested PCR is PCR modified to reduce non-specific amplification due"
