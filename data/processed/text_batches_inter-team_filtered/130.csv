PROBLEM
Problem: Bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics at an alarming rate.
Disease Causing Bacteria
This is an overview of several gram-negative bacteria that cause diseases in humans. Included are their mechanisms of infection and their virulence factors.
Click the arrow above for more information.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa {BioBrick BBa_K1683004}
Quick Facts:
Gram (-)
Aerobic
Extracellular infection
Types of infections that it causes:
Infecting burned tissue and causing lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis.
In burned tissue, the wound seeps plasma, rich in nutrients. P. aeruginosa then takes the opportunity of this nutrient rich “media”. We must fight these infections quickly, because this strain is notorious for its antibiotic resistance. Once it spreads to the bloodstream, it becomes even more challenging to fight, and this is what can cause death in patients.
In cystic fibrosis, infection is slower. Infection occurs in 80% of cystic fibrosis patients within the first few years of their life. [bacterial pathogenesis]. Once it exists in the lungs, antibiotics can help slow the infection, but eventually bacteria develop physiological traits that increase resistance, such as the alginate capsule.
Skin infections
Bloodstream infections
Urinary tract infections
Wound infections
Nosocomial (hospital acquired)
Infections are rare even though it has a widespread distribution. It inhabits wet surfaces, especially hospital surfaces, which contributes to its nosocomial traits. P. aeruginosa is originally a soil microorganism.
Virulence Factors:
P. aeruginosa has many virulence factors. They are categorized into physical characteristics, such as nonpilus adhesions and flagella. There are also enzymes that function as toxins. These virulence factors work to damage the surface and membranes of eukaryotic membranes. Pyocyanin is a cytotoxin that interferes with the a normal redox reaction in host cells, creating reactive oxygen. This damages our cells and causes tissue necrosis. In addition, it produces rhamnolipids, which form a barrier around the cell known as “shielding”. This barrier protects the cell against leukocytes, further barring our immune system from fighting the infection. The most important virulence factors of this opportunistic pathogen are the type three secretion system and the effector proteins/toxins it injects into cells, ExoS,"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)

Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Demand Curve
Price-health Model
Introduction
Question: What's the Cost of Our Diagnosis Method
In our project, we lower down the cost extremely by using engineered bacteria.
Biosensors’ main advantage is the ability to replicate, which make them really cheap. With little cost of culture medium, we can cut down the cost of production.                        .
Question: What's the Price for Early Diagnosis and Screening Now
Expensive.
Question: What’s the effect of cutting the cost.
Generally speaking, cutting down the price can improve its capacity to more rural and undeveloped areas.
Model: The Effect of Cutting Cost
We are building a model of the price of medical prices and the possibility of people to use them.
Grossman Model
The Grossman model of health demand is a model for studying the demand for health and medical care by Michael Grossman. The model based demand for medical care on the interaction between a demand function for health and a production function for health. Andrew Jones, Nigel Rice, and Paul Contoyannis call the model the ""founding father of demand for health models"".
In this model, health is a durable capital good which is inherited and depreciates over time. Investment in health takes the form of medical care purchases and other inputs and depreciation is interpreted as natural deterioration of health over time. In the model, health enters the utility function directly as a good people derive pleasure from and indirectly as an investment which makes more healthy time available for market and non-market activities.
The model creates a dynamic system of equations which can be cast as an optimization problem where utility is optimized over gross investment in health in each period, consumption of medical care, and time inputs in the gross investment function in each period. In this way, the length of life of the agent is partially endogenous to the model.
$M(t)=m[w(t),p(t),A(t),E(t),\Omega(t)]$
In this function, M(t) is the medical demand in t period, which can refer to the using rate of medical facilities or medical expenses. Others variables are: w means wealth, p"

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," other hand endogenous metabolic pathways could be redirected to our novel artificial compartment by changing the protein localization signal in the yeast genome with help of the Cas9 system. All these strategies would allow tremendous improvements for metabolic engineering applications by creating an artificial compartment, which can be rational designed and customized for specific metabolic pathways.
Optogenetic enhancements
Optogenetics provide a useful tool for controlling cellular processes with high spatial and temporal precision. These include the expression of certain genes as well as the interaction or separation of two proteins. As many of our toolbox’s aspects benefit from precise control, we wanted to include optogenetics as a way of increasing its variability. Our plans included optogenetically controlled protein import, control of compartment size and number, and control of product secretion.
Introduction
Our optogenetic toolbox enhancements can be divided into three subgroups: controllable protein import via Pex5, controllable protein import via Pex7 and controllable gene expression. Each of these sub-projects are of different design which will be illustrated in the following.
Pex5 import with LOV2
LOV2 is an optogenetic protein derived from Avena Sativa’s Phototrophin 1. In its dark state the J$_{\alpha}$-helix located at the C-terminus is bound to the core of the protein. Upon irradiation with blue light (~460 nm), a covalent bond between a cysteine residue on the LOV2 protein and a flavin mononucleotide chromophore causes the J$_{\alpha}$-helix to unfold, which in turn exposes the C-terminus (Spiltoir et al, 2016) . This property is very useful, as short amino acid sequences can be attached to this end of the LOV-protein, for example a peroxisomal targeting sequence! The idea for this project was to attach PTS1 to the C-terminus and the protein of interest to the N-terminus. Upon irradiation with blue light, the fusion protein would be imported into our compartment. We used a mutated version of LOV2 whose C-terminus has an increased dark-state binding affinity. This is caused by the substitutions and T406A and T407A. These mutations greatly reduce the possibility of the J$_{\alpha}$-helix being exposed in the dark state. Our PTS1 sequence consists of the amino acids LQSKL. As a proof of concept for this construct we fused sfGFP to its N-terminus:
Lv1 -plasmid containing the sequence coding for the GFP"

They also expressed curiosity in what being a scientist is like and we were eager to answer their questions. We were also pleased that last year’s Vilnius-Lithuania team members occasionally joined the visits and workshops.
What is more, we have paid a visit to ‘The Centre for Child Development’ twice. The aim of this centre is to organise and provide specialized and qualified secondary and tertiary health care for children with developmental, mental and behavioural disorders or children who have experienced abuse and violence. Our team gave these children the opportunity to feel like real scientists – we equipped them with automatic pipettes, dressed them in lab coats, gloves and lab safety glasses and taught them to pipette. We have also proposed them to draw a custom modified bacteria and the results were astounding. There were approximately 50 children who attended these workshops, all aged between 10 and 16 years old. We have to admit that we were amazed by the creativity of these children.
To summarize, our team visited 11 schools in 6 cities, met 530 pupils aged from 7 to 18 years old; the majority of students (about 60%) were 16 - 18 years old. We have also got filled 214 questionnaires by high school students. Adding to that, we had a chance to run workshops in ‘The Centre for Child Development’ and during an annual event ‘Children’s University’. In general, our team felt glad to be able to communicate with children and observe their interest. We have got the influx of motivation from knowing that these children believed in our idea

Urtė participates in science Olympiads and is keen to continue her studies in the life science field. During the whole summer, we taught her essential methods which are used in the lab such as Western Blot, Northern Blot, DNA and Protein electrophoresis, DNA and Protein purification and many others.

UCL,2013,Team:UCLA#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," be an Inker. Black and white go well together you see.
Naturally, the public was outraged. Accusations were made that we were harboring racial or political agendas. They called us unnatural and accused us of mocking the racial challenges our ancestors had go through. Thinking ourselves clever, we didn’t defend ourselves, we played along. Initially we had Bleaker rights protests and Inker Bleaker marriages. We had no common agenda, we simply wanted to rebel.
My girlfriend once said as a joke, “we are products of more enlightened times.” She hated the societal hypocrisy. She was young, beautiful, but hated that hypocrisy and cowardice built into the society that made discussion of race impossible over half a century. For her, inking was about protest. For me, it was about the inclusivity.   Aggression between two sides was part of the joke, but there was no denying a strange sort of rivalry developing. Egged on by ever critical responses from the media and social networking sites, both sides set out to provoke the nation. If one side had a protest, other side started a riot. When Bleakers had a swimsuit parade, Inkers had nude flash mobs. Each time both sides tried to outdo one another, the greatest in-joke in the world. Wasn’t it? Maybe I’m deluding myself. I have some responsibility for what happened.
I don’t know when we started taking it seriously. Maybe, I saw some preferential treatment from other Bleakers: better job offers here, little discounts there. Inkers weren’t happy about the preferential treatment. They felt that we were taking it too far. Of course, most Inkers are known for their recklessness in general. Often arrested for outrageous stunts and violence. They were in no position to criticize us.
My legs hurt. I can’t move, or they’ll find me.
It was just another mock-protest. I don’t remember too well what it was about, but there was a couple of picketers with the sign, “God, Save These Wretches”. Couple of Plainskins actually came up to us and started pushing us around. Idiots who couldn't deal with their own problem so they inflict themselves to others. Though this time they had real cause to be angry: a security footage of a Bleaker murdering a Plainskinned woman.
She said we should find other people. She didn’t want to be part of a joke gone stale.
While the offending parties were eventually taken away by the police. Strange mood settled over the crowd. No real accusations, but shift in a"

Indeed, to the question: Did our survey help you to better understand what synthetic biology is? they gave 4/5 or 5/5 as a grade.

We also asked people to explain their answers. Three main types of comments stood out: on one hand, people said that our survey was clear and well explained with a good point for illustrations and photographs, but on the other hand, it also appeared that it was too long and repetitive.

We thought that the HNH domain could be a potential site to engineer the Cas9 protein. The HNH domain is activated by the sgRNA conformational change and moves along to the target, if the sgRNA and the target are complementary the HNH would cleave; upon HNH activity the RuvC nuclease is activated commented Sternberg et al (2015) . Looking to establish a detection system we selected this conformational change as a profitable approach.
2. Adapting dCas9 to RNA
As we needed to detect an RNA biomarker for prostate cancer we next focused on the detection of nucleic acids by the Cas9. The HNH domain of the Cas9 needs to detect a PAM sequence next to the target sequence (but in the opposite strand) for being activated. The PAM sequence is only present in DNA sequences (O’Connell et al, 2014) and in our case, our target molecule is single stranded RNA.
Due to this problem we search for RNA detection mediated by Cas9 and found out that it is possible. There’s an approach to target single stranded RNA using a Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9. To target RNA the dCAs9 needs to recognize the PAM sequence in a DNA strand, a short DNA sequence containing the PAM sequence, called PAMmer, is needed the to target RNA upon hybridization between the PAMmer and the target argued O’Connell et al (2014).
We wanted to design a system that target specific RNA’s of interest, as PCA3 a biomarker for prostate cancer. Considering that the dCas9 needs a PAMmer DNA sequence to target the RNA, we started thinking of our system as a laboratory test in the PAMmer could be add as a reagent.
3. dCas9 insertion hotspots
After selecting the dCas9 as our chassis for the detection and noticing the conformational changes of the protein in the different states; we focused on how to design a synthetic system to generate an output, after targeting the RNA of interest using these conformational changes. Due to the potencial of targeting the genome there’s a lot of research in Cas9 applications. One approach elucidates that the Cas9 protein toler"

Through the interview we had, our team reinforced the main purpose of our project with the creation of the most effective heart failure diagnostic kit. Especially because not only its early diagnosis and treatment but also effective patient monitring are extremely important when heart failure occurs, our team was motivated once more to make a contribution into the world through making the diagnostic kit and in combination with mobile phones.
4. Heart Failure Campaign at Welfare Center
We have visited the Mapo Welfare Center to alert elders about the diagnosis and prevention of heart failure. Worldwide, despite the stark reality that heart failure has shown a high growth rate, unfortunately, Koreans are relatively less aware of the condition. Therefore, we conducted a Q&A session followed by a discussion on the topic of heart failure targeting Korean senior citizens (a high-risk group).
First, we explained the symptoms of heart failure and proper prevention methods. We prepared about seven large infographic boards for elders in order to make them understand the information easily. Elders whose acquaintances suffer from heart failure were particularly interested in prevention measures. We emphasized the steady exercise and a healthy diet as a necessary prevention method.
Our project of developing the HAPPI is based on the concept of Ubiquitous healthcare. U-healthcare is a healthcare service based on the combination of telemedicine and ubiquity. U-healthcare provides healthcare to patients regardless of age, location, and time, simultaneously increasing the quality of healthcare. U-healthcare system is a relatively new and unfamiliar concept even for the new generations. Particularly to the elders who have little exposure to the modern devices that enable the ubiquitous telemedicine, the U-healthcare system would be even more difficult to understand. Therefore, we thought that the biggest challenge was explaining this concept to the seniors. We introduced this concept through a hypothetical U-healthcare system where the elders’ smartphones are equipped with our HAPPI. If the HAPPI gets developed and commercialized, doctors can easily monitor the patient’s conditions just with the elders’ effort as little as dropping their blood on the chip-linked mobile phones.
The activity at the Mapo Welfare Center was very successful. Even after the campaign, some seniors showed enthusiasm for our project. Finally, we concluded our campaign was useful for all of us and our audiences by volunteering at the center and assisting the elders with their meals.
After the campaign, we volunteered to serve lunch to the elderly at the welfare center.

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#Project Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html," no. 3 has been inoculated in the bottom-left as a negative control, while strain no. 4 has been inoculated in the bottom-right as a positive control.
In the swarm plates that are presented in figure 1, only four of the positive controls (strain 4) showed signs of motility. In 1D, strain no. 2 is swarming. This was the only detected instance of swarming for these fifteen swarm plate assays (three replicates of assays for five different strains). Based on the absence of swarming in the positive controls, we concluded that the swarm plate assay was not reliable.
To improve the performance of the swarm plate assay, we changed the culturing conditions to prevent the swarm plates from drying out. Swarm plates were directly inoculated from restreaks or from frozen stocks, wrapped in parafilm and then incubated at room temperature for two days. The results of these extra motility plates are presented in figure 2.
Figure 2. Swarm plate assays performed at room temperature. Strain 1 and 2 were inoculated from restreaks, while strain 3, 4 and 5 were inoculated from frozen stocks.
The following strains are present in the figure:
1) positive control (RP437 with empty pSB1C3 plasmid) [220]
2) negative control (UU2685 with empty pSB1C3 plasmid) [216]
3) B0034_J23100-cheZ (UU2685) [170]
4) B0034_J23113-cheZ (UU2685) [171]
5) B0034_J23114-cheZ (UU2685) [172]
On all plates presented in figure 2, positive controls (strain 1) swarmed, while negative controls (strain 2) did not swarm. The altered protocol for the swarm plate assay was thus able to distinguish motile strains from non-motile strains.
Strain 3, containing a cheZ expression cassette with the J23100 promoter, swarmed all six times when it was tested, though not to the same extent as the positive control. Strain 4, containing a cheZ expression cassette with the J23113 promoter, also showed to be motile, although it only swarmed to a small extent.
The result of the strain containing the cheZ expression cassette including the J23114 promoter (strain 5) is not as clear as that of the other two constructs. The structures that have grown upon incubation resemble the negative control. For strain 5, these"
SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#HP#Activities_-_-_TEXT.html," ears to prevent more hearing impairment cases, together with elaborate studies on hearing using biological methods, tend to be the profound and lasting resolution. He mentioned that our project idea is good to solve the root of the problem.
Medication
After consulting with otologist, we learnt some knowledge about treatment for hearing-loss people.
Ear is composed of four main parts. Outer ear is the entry of sound waves. Middle ear amplifys sound waves. Inner ear is responsible for the transduction of sound energy to electric signals. Acoustic nerve transmits the electric signal to the nerve center. All parts are important for the ability of hearing and any damage will result in hearing loss or disability.
The treatment for hearing loss involves reconstruction of the ability of each component. Normally there are five major approaches, external ear reconstruction, tympanic membrane repair, ossicular chain reconstruction, hearing aids, and cochlear implantation. Those surgical cure methods generally recover the structures in the ear for normal function, and hearing aids create the sound vibration with engineering methods.
Sensorineural hearing loss is a hearing loss the most difficult to cure. At present, for mimicking function of cochlear, cochlear implants (CIs) are used to create special electric signals responding to different sound signals it catches. However, ear can sense more than 100,000 kinds of sound frequencies, while the manufacture we made can only generate about one hundred kinds of sound frequency. As a matter of fact, the signal generated by CI is also different largely with natural cochlear.
For the most important part, CI is more than expensive for a normal family.
Apart from those function and cost issues, CI is potential to lead to immune response and other problems for the body as an artificial equipment in a human’s body.
To deal with these problems, firstly, we believe that we should advocate people to protect their ears. In addition, for people who have suffered from these problems, we want to do something to improve their social acceptance and discover better resolutions for hearing loss treatment.
Charity associations
We consulted several local charity associations about the issues they concern related to hearing-impaired population. We also expressed our interests and we hope to further our Human Practices after the Jamboree.
Lions Club of Shenzhen: They irregularly hold activities to help blinds in rural areas of China under the help of government. In Shenzhen, they keep tight contact with community health center all over the city and they periodically organize health care for people with hearing impairment. Other events including helping them with employment and other living problems and holiday consolation are often arranged. They also have special service team formed by individuals and authorized"
McMasterU,2016,Team:McMasterU_-_-_TEXT.html," entire 100,000 steps, there was no factor production in the low-density region.
Here is how it works. A rectangular map is populated with bacteria in two populations, separated by some space. One is dense (a grid of bacteria separated by 3 distance units from neighbours) and one is sparse (a grid of bacteria separated by 15 distance units from neighbours). In each (again, unitless) time step, each bacterium does the following (parameters are in square brackets):
If the bacterium is active, produce [passive_signal_production] amount of signal
If the bacterium is active, produce [active_signal_production] amount of signal
If the bacterium is passive, and the signal at the bacterium’s location is above [signal_threshold], then switch to active state
If the bacterium is active, and the signal at the bacterium’s location is below [signal_threshold], then switch to passive state
If the bacterium is active, produce [factor_production] amount of factor
Then, diffusion proceeds, and the next step starts.
The results:
Bacterium locaions
Animated: steps 0 - 500,000
What the model is not
This model is not a simulation. It is not the computation of numerically known relationships, etc.. This is because we do not know, on a mathematical level, how the bacteria produce and handle signal and factor molecules. No-one has said exactly how much of the signal or factor molecules a single one of our bacteria produces while active or inactive. No-one has determined the diffusion and extinction coefficients of the signal or factor molecules used in our project. So this model is not the computation of things that we know will happen in real life, the same way a physics simulation of a block falling is such (because we know g = 9.81m/s, and we know the laws of kinematics).
This model does not explore how bacteria attach to tumour cells. That’s just outside the scope of what we programmed. The model only deals with stationary bacteria with locations defined manually beforehand. So the high-density region is the tumour where the bacteria accumulate - but that must all be accounted for before our model starts running.
What the model is
This model does three things:
Takes assumptions given to it by humans, i.e. us.
Takes parameters given to it by humans (or by a program that gives it parameters from a list)
Computes what the system does, following the assumptions, plugging in the parameters.
So it may or may not resemble real phenomena, depending on whether the assumptions and parameters are"

Induction of the light-switchable promoter systems in Y190 S. cerevisiae with red light
Investigator: Jeff, Ingmar
Aim of the experiment: Induction of the light-switchable promoter systems in Y190 S. cerevisiae with red light. The induced light-switchable promoter system will hopefully switch on the gene expresesion of the reporter Renilla luciferase.
Procedure:
The 2 days old transformated Y190 yeast cell suspension were diluted until it reach an OD600 of ~0.5-0.6.
Phycocyanobilin (PCB), which we extracted moths ago, was added after steril-filtration into the medium (cend(PCB)=25 µM).
3 samples of each system were induced with full red light intensity, 2 samples of each system with 1/10 intensity and 2 samples of each system remain non-induced.
Every sample contains 3 ml cell suspension and was pipetted in a 4 ml cuvette.
Before start of the experiment, we took one sample for luciferase assay and OD600 measurement for getting the start value. (PCB was added, but we defined this sample as without PCB because PCB needs about 30 min to get into the cells)
The induction red-light-box was set up as following: Every 5 min there was a 10 s lasting red-light pulse with intensities as described.
Induction was performed overnight (15 h) at 30 °C in a 200 rpm shaker.

Project goal: to genetically modify a phage capable of suppressing toxin production in C. difficile by integrating our genetic constructs into its genome. We are using a phage known to infect strains of C. difficile called phiSBRC. The genome of phiSBRC will be packaged with constructs to suppress toxin production either via a CRIPSRi (dead-Cas9) approach or via asRNA. The asRNA parts were created to target the two well characterised C. difficile toxins, TcdA and TcdB. These toxins are responsible for the characteristic symptoms of C. difficile infection. The parts were constructed in such a way that they targeted both toxins simultaneously because both toxins have been shown to have independent roles.
The asRNA parts are downstream of a PCac_thl promoter and a PCsp_fdx promoter. Between, the promoter-asRNA pairs, there is a transcriptional terminator (fdx). As a result of GusA and GFP assays, we determined that PCac_thl promoter was the strongest promoter, followed by PCsp_fdx promoter in C. difficile. Together, the basic parts produced our composite part.
Longer asRNAs give a higher degree of suppression but generally have more unwanted off-target effects which could be due to increased similarity with other mRNA transcripts. As the amount of DNA that phiSBRC can package is limited shorter asRNAs would be more desirable. As a result, we created two versions of the composite part which we named ‘asRNA Construct One’ (BBa_K2715007) and ‘asRNA Construct Two’ (BBa_K2715008). For each part we varied the length so that ‘asRNA Construct Two’ had 26 more base pairs complementary to the toxin gene mRNA than ‘asRNA Construct One’. ‘asRNA Construct One’ has a binding region of 24bp while ‘asRNA Construct Two’ has a binding region of 50bp.
We were able to directly measure the effect of our constructs on toxin production and toxicity of the C. difficile supernatant. We cloned the constructs into a plasmid vector suitable for transforming C. difficile. Supernatant cytotoxicity was compared between C. difficile containing the vectors with our constructs (coding for the asRNA) and wild-type C. difficile using African green monkey kidney epithelial ‘Vero’ cells. Supernatant samples from C. difficile cultures over five"

Experiment 1: Testing of MalE and MalE31 with literature established reporter constructs
Protocol:
We obtained degP and cpxR reporter constructs from Dr. Tracy Raivio's lab.  These constructs contain the promoters upstream of lacZ.  They were characterized with NlpE, an outermembrane lipoprotein that activates the Cpx pathway.  We made TOP10 E. Coli competent cells with plasmids of these constructs and then transformed in MalE and MalE31 circuits with arabinose inducible promoters. We also transformed in the NlpE expression construct which we received fro the Raivio lab as well. The purpose of this assay was to confirm that promoters coupled reporters could indeed be induced by misfolding protein and to show that the various maltose binding proteins that we received were functional. From plates, we made 5 mL LB cultures and induced with 1uL IPTG for cultures containing the NLPE constructs.  75uL of X-Gal was also added to each culture.  The cultures were then grown up overnight in a 30°C shaking incubator and observed for color.
Results
Figure 1: Image of overnight cultures.  From left to right: NLPE in cells with the degP reporter construct, NLPE in cells with the cpxR reporter, malE31 in cells with the degP reporter, malE31 in cells with the cpxR reporter, malE in cells with the degP reporter contruct and malE in cells containing the cpxR reporter.
Discussion of Results and Conclusion
Figure 1 indicates that malE31 is able to activae the cpxR and and degP promoers while malE is not.  This allowed us to conlucde that these parts are working as expected.  Although these parts are both entered in the registry, the sequences are not complete, so we are submitting new versions of them,"

The presentation given in the Judd medical society was focused on the issue of iron deficiency and excess iron in the body. The talk covered the prevalence of iron deficiency in the developing world and how our project is specifically designed for this demographic. The medical society presentation was a good opportunity to focus on the potential of our project in the real world before our interview with the haematologist. The medical society is attended by students from all years but primarily by sixth form who have an interest in studying medical sciences therefore the talk also covered why healthy iron is so fundamental to life and addressed common misconceptions surrounding anaemia and iron deficiency as well as discussing some of the latest research which illuminates just how harmful excess iron can be in body. We raised awareness about iGEM and synthetic biology among students who have expressed an interest in medicine and hopefully shown them the global positive impact can have in the medical field."

at the end of the spin, the silk was allowed to soak in the bath for 1 hour, then taken out to dry in the fume hood
Resulting fiber was incredibly brittle
Dried fiber collected on the godet
We were unable to take it off the godet without breaking it
However, it glowed.
Fragments of the Tamura fiber are in the dish on the right. On the left is a tangle of natural silk, barely visible. Image was taken in a blue light box with a UV filter
Some observations about the spinning process:
It was extremely difficult for several reasons
the silk emerges from the PEEK tubing tip too quickly
emerging silk fiber is too difficult to see in the bath
very hard to grab and guide the silk to the godet
Silk breaks frequently from the godet. This is probably because we don't know exactly what godet speed to use
Silk slips off the bottom of the godet often
Current setup requires us to hover over the solvent bath as we guide the fiber"
TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," DIHM setup, it is necessary to focus the brightest spot of the light source to the pinhole. Due to the tiny dimension of this setup, we need to manipulate the objects in the micrometer level.Therefore we tested different micromanipulators. We started with a concept of BDAn from Thingiverse, which lacks flexibility and proportion. Later on, we tried 3D printed joint micromanipulators, movable with a screw.They failed on accuracy and the ability to move in more than one dimension. Our last and final approach is to split the movement axes, using screws for control, as demonstrated below:
Fig: Micromanipulator with two degrees of freedom allowing planar alignment
 
In the above figure, the green stack functions as a frame to fixate the screws, with one end attached with springs, allowing more bounce and flexibility. The yellow and the red stacks enable the alignment control in the x and y direction, correspondingly. The camera is then placed on the red stack to record holograms once the light source, the object to be observed, and the camera is properly aligned.
 
Light Sources
We tested a variety of different light sources for DIHM. We started with an upcycling idea: why not use an old X-Box One's DVD Pick-Up, the advantage being the little cost for a reliable laser source. DIyouware Bros gives a detailed instruction on using the pickup, and a customized PCB board as a micromanipulator to align the laser source at desired position with micrometer precision, and to control the intensity of the laser. However, a fatal disadvantage was discovered during our tests with the experimental setup, a Fresnel lense is integrated onto the laser diode within the pickup, producing an undesired interference pattern, thus destroys the recorded holograms. Other approaches are using an LED, a collimated light source, and a pinhole, to produce a point source eminating spherical waves. The disadvantages of common LEDs is the low intensity, and the little coherence time compared to the laser source. The brightness can be compensated with high power LEDs, such as the ones used in fishkeeping, or even better, smartphone flash lights. Imagine an DIHM adapter for a smartphone: nowadays, most samrtphones has tremendously bright flash lights. They are common LEDs, with a high intensity peak lying in the blue light spectrum, making it easy to detect in our experiment setup.

Our initial plan was to use an Xbox DVD pickup as the laser source, as it provides 405 nm, 650 nm, and 780 nm laser point source, with possible laser"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 . In our simulation, the shift in equilibrium is made by introducing additional expression of RelE.
Two different models were used with two different approaches:
How a given configuration of RelB and RelE production increases the RelE concentration and whether it could induce dormancy within 2 hours.
The time required for the bacteria to exit dormancy for each of the configurations, that is, how long it takes the levels of free RelE to decrease again.
Rates and Reactions
The skeleton of toxin-antitoxin system inherent to E. coli in the model was based on the study by Cataudella et al. 2012 Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 . In an E. coli cell with a size of 1-2 μm, each nM of concentration can be approximated to 1 molecule. Thus all units are converted to molecules-1, as this fits the premises of the Gillespie algorithm. To simplify the model, the high affinity of RelE and RelB was used to ignore single RelB and only consider the dimer, RelB2 Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 UniProtKB - P0C079 (RELB_ECOLI) . Thus, all mentions of RelB in the model refers to its dimer.
Whilst RelB has a relatively low half-life at about 3-5 minutes Overgaard, M., Borch, J., Jørgensen, M. G. and Gerdes, K.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU#Medal Criteria_-_-_TEXT.html," and our forums on our Bioethics Forums page.
Through our forums and discussions, we realized that while our project is foundational and far from immediate downstream applications, it could still generate very opinionated discussions among individuals with diverse viewpoints. This forced us to look critically at our own research and evaluate directions of our experiments and design. Specifically, we decided to synthetically regulate expression of exogenous genes, and avoided attempting to target or regulate any endogenous genes. We also considered potential off-target capabilities of our system and public fears of unintended interactions, and intentionally selected gRNAs with the lowest chance of undesired genomic interactions.
2. Improve a previous part or project: Improve the function OR characerization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry.  The part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range.
We decided to improve characterization of a full length CMV promoter, BBa_I712004 , from Team Heidelberg 2009’s submitted parts. This part is one of the only available mammalian promoters in the BioBrick Registry, and was only tested thus far in HeLa cells.
We cloned the part upstream of a GFP gene in one of our mammalian expression backbones, and transiently transfected the device into HEK293FT cells. We also compared the expression of GFP under this constitutive promoter to several of our engineered minimal CMV “guide RNA-inducible” promoters. We quantitatively measured GFP expression using flow cytometry.
We saw that the pCMV device successfully expressed GFP in HEK293FT cells, and included this characterization data on the registry page. We also noted that our 1X gRNA operator devices expressed GFP at a level lower than the pCMV, while one of our 3X gRNA operator devices expressed GFP to a higher level. This result also improves characterization by providing the relative strength of the full CMV promoter compared to our new library of operator parts containing a minimal CMV promoter.
You can view our data on our Improved Part Characterization Page .
3. Proof of Concept:Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.
Our system, Gemini, was developed to combine digital and analog expression systems as method to develop a foundational platform to handle increasingly complex applications. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated that we could achieve both “digital” and “analog” expression patterns using standardized biological parts.

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Biodetoxification_-_-_TEXT.html," we have identified. These libraries and the dCas9 system will be co-transformed into P. putida construct containing the HMF pathway. These colonies will be grown for the furoic acid assay and we can determine from absorbance measurements whether the HMF pathway is functioning.  We will sequence the genomes of non-functioning strains and identify which genes were turned off via dCas9 knockdown.
The 19 target genes in P. putida were identified through manual genome comparison with the help of graduate student Iman Farasat.  These are genes that are likely involved in furfural catabolism and are present in P. putida but not present in E. coli.  Many of these genes encode cofactors, chaperone proteins, ATPases, and several other possible transport proteins.  Our hypothesis is that a key oxidoreductase in the HMF pathway requires a molybdenum-containing cofactor, which is produced by a separate pathway and inserted with a chaperone protein.   Manual comparison of genomes is time consuming, and another objective of our research is to develop a program that can optimize genome comparison. This program would employ “BLAST”, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, to identify homologs between species and potential target genes that are contained in one genome but not another.  Optimizing genome comparison would allow industrial and academic researchers to identify the likely missing genes in any pathway.
The final objective of this research is to engineer the HMF pathway in E. coli.  This is a late-stage goal, providing the missing ingredients of the HMF pathway are identified.  But if this objective is completed, it could be one step closer to sustainable fuels produced by bacteria.
Our Objectives
1) Validate the gene knockdown strategy using dCas9
This is our first objective.  Once we insert the dCas9 system, HMF pathway, and RFP cassette into the P. putida genome, we will use a crRNA targeting RFP to attempt to knockdown RFP expression. If we see white colonies, we will know that transcription of the RFP gene is blocked and the system works.
2) Validate the functioning of the HMF pathway
Along with our first objective, we will concurrently evaluate the functioning of the HMF pathway inserted into the P. putida genome using a 2-furoic acid assay. We will inoculate LB broth with P. putida colonies that have grown in the presence of 5-fluorouracil and add 3 g/L 2-f"

Finally, we are taking measures to get LearnSynBio incorporated into actual classrooms: We have established a          collaboration with the high school team Broad Run iGEM (see Collaborations page) to incorporate our modules into          their advanced science classes and after-school science clubs. Additionally, we are working with some of our former          high school teachers to introduce LearnSynBio to VAST, the Virginia Association of Science Teachers, for incorporation          in classrooms all around the state. Lastly, it is our hope that the presentation of LearnSynBio at the Jamboree          will encourage the spread of LearnSynBio to schools all around the world!
BwB
In addition to LearnSynBio, we also completed several public outreach events. We were awarded a grant from Building            with Biology  to host public outreach events over the course of the iGEM 2016 season.
We held a science workshop          targeted at at local children and their parents which allowed them to get some hands-on experience with the exciting          world of modern biology. We had more than 70 people in attendance and together we extracted DNA from strawberries,          learned about synthetic biology and the benefit of standard biological parts, and discussed our questions and concerns          with GMO food.
We also held a forum on the topic of Genome Editing targeted at the general public. At the forum, we briefly discussed          the implications of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool and explored various ways that it could be applied to real          world problems. Among the topics discussed were: stabilizing the Honeybee population by increasing expression of          ‘hygiene’ genes, engineering yeast for efficient biofuel production, and using CRISPR to decrease human susceptibility          to HIV infection. We had over 30 participants for the forum and we received great feedback from our attendees!

Our mentors from the Department of Biotechnology of the National Institute of Chemistry (NIC) were approached by the teachers from the Faculty of computer and information sciences if they could participate in this years's project. After some thought it become apparent that the simplest way to attempt to join those two fields might be using DNA binding proteins in order to achieve information processing in cells. Therefore at the meeting of student candidates interested in participating at iGEM in March 2010, we were given the task to explore the possibilities that DNA binding proteins might provide to achieve information processing and to prepare individual project proposals within a month. Initially we considered several different directions, since students of biotechnology saw the great potentials for applications in the biosynthesis. Among the suggesstions of the selected candidates there were also ideas to attempt to improve the bioynthesis of violacein and carotenoids based on DNA as a scaffold, particularly since the invividual genes for those two pathways were already deposited in the Registry of parts and were also experimentally verified. This in fact later become the main topic of our project. During the brainstorming sessions in summer, students of computer sciences proposed to investigate if we could extend the basic idea to genetic oscillators, since it had been proposed earlier that a cooperativity of DNA binding repressors (lac dimer, Tet tetramer) is a prerequisite for generating the oscillations.
 
The laboratory that hosted our iGEM team did not have any previous experiences with zinc fingers, engineering biosynthetic pathways or modelling oscillators, so the project was completely new for mentors as well. However mentors from the NIC seeked support of additional external advisors from NIC and from the University of Ljubljana, who are specialists in certain experimental techniques that could be useful for our project. They helped us learn and use techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and HPLC and TLC analysis of reaction products. All gene constructs were obtained from the Registry or ordered as synthetic genes exclusively for this project.
 
All the experiments connected to cloning, protein isolation, characterisation (SDS, WB) and purification, FRET experiments, EMSA, repression assays... as well as data analysis were performed exclusively by the undergraduate student team members. The only exception was that the advisors helped students with operating the instruments for SPR and HPLC ad MS analysis, which was done by the MS operator"

Simulations
For the simulations of the ODEs, we built a Simulink model. First, we set the extracellular As to zero and ran a simulation with the initial conditions for all variables set to zero, as well; then, we interpolated the graphs obtained for the variables ArsR and MT (both in protein and mRNA) and determined the following initial conditions for further simulations:
mRNAs: ArsR = 2.1058 nM; MT = 24.6324 nM
Proteins: ArsR = 887.7 nM; MT = 6748.4978 nM
We also set all the numerical integrators to have lower saturation limits equal to zero, to be in concordance with the mass conservation law. Here are the results for simulations at extracellular As set to 0, 0.1, 1, 5 and 10 μM (0, 100, 1000, 5000, 10000 nM).

The color code is the same in figures 1 and 2. In the first one, we show the simulations for the five different extracellular arsenic concentration; in the second one, we see the simulated dynamics of the total internal arsenic and the free internal arsenic.
Remember that we assume that the arsenic concentration in the total cell volume should be equally distributed; in consequence, the concentration inside a cell should be the same as the one at the total cell volume.

Expression and Purification of LacticinQ by Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Fusion in E. coli. The Journal of Microbiology, 50(2), 326–331. . LacticinQ is a class IId bacteriocin. It functions by forming large toroidal pores by disrupting and redistributing membrane lipid organization. The event causes ATP leakage of protein molecules from the target cell, and thus elicits important metabolites needed for bacterial survival. The pore forming event thereby introduce LacticinQ as a bactericidal agent. LacticinQ has an N-terminal formylated methionine, and gene sequencing indicates that it is synthesized without a leader peptide. The peptide sequence consist of 53 amino acid, and is cationic. It forms two amphiphilic alfa-helix with a hinge region between ZENDO, T. (2013). Screening and Characterization of Novel Bacteriocins from Lactic Acid Bacteria.

As the analysis told, these institutions mainly located in five provinces: Jiangsu, Guangdong, Beijing, Zhejiang and Shandong Province. Enterprises in these five areas attribute for 60% of total enterprises in China [6].
From the figure below, we can see that there are approximately 15~20 medical appliance institutions be authorized every year from 2004 to 2014. This data gives us the signal that Chinese medical appliances are developing slowly, which means we do not need to worry about the future of our project.

Week 4 (May11 – May17)
Wet Lab Overview
This week we designed the sequence of membrane targeting-ferritin and designed the T7 RNA polymerase and intein as thermo-regulator.
This week we successfully assembled the K115001 with E1010, K115002 with E1010, and K115003 with E1010. There are two reasons why we failed for previous experiments: a) we used buffer as assemble because of the wrong tag. b) The ligation system was incorrect, we summarized that the appropriate proportion of backbone and part is 10:1.
Mag-receiver
JieLian and Qingdian Mu continued constructing pET-28a in case that the first batch was false positive.
Renjie Shang and Jinyang Liang did PCR to identificate the correctness of pET-ftnA.
Fig.5. Lane 11 is DL2000 marker. Lane 1-10 are PCR products cloned from BL21(DE3) monoclonal colony that were transformed pET-28a with ftnA. The Agarose gel electrophoresis shows bands at 800bp, the target sequence band is expected at 794bp.
The same work was repeated for preparing sequencing.
Thermo-regulator
In case of the sequencing results is wrong, the ligation of E and K1 wasn’t stopped. Cun Wei and Zhuo Pan extracted J, K1, K2, K3, E and EK1. Zhuo Pan digested J, K1, K2 and K3 with SpeI and PstI, digested E and K1E with XbaI and SpeI. Ligations of J and K1E, E and K1, K2, K3 were down by Cun Wei after gel extraction and agarose gel electrophoresis. Transformation was down by Zhuo Pan. Only K3E grew on the plate and the PCR identification shows that the ligation of E and K1 last week is failed. Cun Wei did PCR identification of K3E, there are"

Demonstrate your work
✓We successfully demonstrate our product in real world condition that includes a bait trap, a IR counter and a smart phone app.
✓Our pest prediction website works well on the Internet. Visit our website here.
Integrated Human Practice
We want to bridge the science world to the society.
In field work, we visited fruit growers, enterprises, experts and interest group, discovering most control strategies failed because of inability for prediction. Thus, we freshman established a pest prediction website as a forecasting platform. Government researcher thought highly of our effort.
In education, precious iGEM teams presented us with various and intriguing approaches, we are, however, looking for bigger scale of science communication of the society. We developed a social study assessing the transfer effectiveness of gene-technology information. The outcome is so fruitful. We also evaluate the feasibility of World Café as an effective communication for iGEM teams, the outcome is highly positive.                     We also conduct policy study and comparison, host an interschool meetup and educate high school student. We hope what we have done can help further the scope of human practice in iGEM."
SVA-NYC,2015,Team:SVA-NYC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," LAB 14:
We revised all of the LaMotte protocols to accommodate quantity of samples and volume required for filling cuvettes. We also set up an assembly line to extract the first 35 samples using funnels, filters, conical tubes and universal extraction buffer. Tests for Chloride and pH must be extracted with other solution.
Week 15
DRY LAB 15:
- Focused on concepts of testing soil in NYC, and how we can visually represent the data and process of the scientific work being done.
- Use LEDS to represent location, so information displayed is not static, but can cycle through different results.
8/24 - Soil samples # 44, 45, 46, 47 are collected
8/25 - Soil samples # 48, 49 are collected
8/27 - Soil samples # 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 are collected
WET LAB 15:
- Created Standards and processed soil extraction for Nitrate, Potassium.
- After weeks of contacting suppliers we are a little concerned about getting refills on a few of the reagents needed to finish testing. LaMotte’s tablet pressing machine is out of order and none of the 32 retailers we contacted have any phosphorous tablets!
Week 16
DRY LAB 16:
We gathered to finalize possible installation ideas on how we can represent our final product. At this point all soil sampling is completed and so far we collected 55 samples total from all the boroughs.
Discussed visual representation of the all collected results: - 5 boroughs cutouts with an LED mapping according to location of the each sample.
- Incorporation of the human practices.
- Installation space logistics.
WET LAB 16:
Created Standards and processed soil extraction for Chloride, Magnesium, Ammonia Nitrogen, Manganese, pH. We finally found some replacement phosphorous testing reagents in stock that should be here by the end of the week.
Week 17
DRY LAB 17:
- Installation team continues working on wiring installation, mapping out the LEDs, working on coding.
- Team is processing samples back in lab.
- Organizing all the soil samples images for further placement on the website.
- Archiving all the soil sample documentation.
- Mike and Raul continue to work on the website.
- We 3D printed the final draft of the prototype device, ultimately deciding to pursue a stage-like platform, rather than a phone case.
- Progress on design of microfluidic chip, still determining the best process to manufacture the chip using"

June 16-29
After consulting with graduate students and advisors we tried to PCR amplify the CesA ! promoter using different annealing temperatures, concentrations, polymerases, and elongation times. After 12 unsuccessful attempts and two weeks of troubleshooting, we had our first successful band.
June 30-July 13
Gel extraction of successful band and PCR amplified again for better quality and higher concentrations. Moved into PCR amplification of CesA 4, CesA 7, and CesA 8 from the genomic DNA. Just as with the promoter, we encountered many problems and did not have a successful band with genomic DNA. cDNA had been ordered and arrived at the end of the week.
July 14-20
After cDNA arrived, we attempted to PCR amplify CesA 7 and CesA 8 as CesA 4 was backordered. It was successful after many failed attempts.
July 21-27
The successful bands were PCR amplified and we achieved high enough yields to proceed. Although, the construct could not be complete so cDNA was then ordered from Japan.
July 28- Aug 3
Since the cDNA from Japan did not arrive, we redesigned the construct without it and had to wait for primers to come in. CesA 7 and CesA 8 were then sent for sequencing.
Aug 4-10
Tried multiple times to isolate CesA 4 from a cDNA library, but we were unsuccessful.

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

The papers he published had more than 40 H-Index. He got the Distinguished Scholar of Georgia at 2003, and was selected as American Association for Advancement of Science Fellow.
In the lecture, professor Xu introduced their recent research progress. They investigated the transcriptomes of different tumor tissue and make big data analysis.  They made two major discoveries. One is that all the tumors went through the process of chronic inflammation, but not all of the chronic inflammation can lead to cancer; and the other is that the basis of tumor proliferation is Fenton reaction.
Finally, professor Xu suggested some useful suggestions to prevent cancers:
First: Stay away from meat, red meat have higher iron content, which is the main force of Fenton reaction;
Second: Stay away from alcohol, especially the person who would show red face after drinking, the body is telling you not to drink;
Third: Male should make regular blood donation to help prevent accumulation of iron in the body; women don't have to bother before menopause.

Zwitterionic Antifouling Protein
Another approach concerning the encapsulation of bacterial cells is to genetically engineer the cells in a way that enables them to produce their own coating. Therefore, we have designed a Zwitterionic Antifouling Protein (ZAP). A zwitterionic polymer can be displayed by an outer membrane protein on the cell’s outer membrane. In order to evade the immune system, a coating of these Zwitterionic Antifouling Proteins needs to be produced by the cell. Roughly, the zwitterionic encapsulation is the result of zwitterionic interactions of polymers consisting of mainly Glutamic Acid (negatively charged) and Lysine (positively charged). We have chosen for these amino acids due to the demonstrated antifouling properties of the combination of these negatively and positively charged amino acids. Sequences of repeats of these specific amino acids will interact with each other and are able to form a network which is imp"

Plasmid
DNA Fragments
Design PCR Primers according to the purpose of the experiment
The choice of the reaction system is dictated by the specific experiment
Taq System: to primarily validate the DNA sequence.
KOD System: to amplificate long DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Golden Mix System: for rapid amplification of DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Set up the reaction system according to the protocol of the product you use
If the target substrate is single colony, use pipette to pick up a minute quantity of bacteria. Inoculate the bacteria onto a plate for further use. Then pipet up and down for several times in the solution.
If the target substrate is liquid, add proper quantity of substrate according to the protocol of specific reaction system.
Choosing the Reaction Conditions
The choice of reaction conditions mainly depends on the reaction system you choose.
Validating the Reaction

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Application#Rollout_-_-_TEXT.html," sees use when there is an outbreak of a pathogen where no convenient diagnostic already exists. The device should have advantages that make it attractive to use, for example cost-wise or through ease of use.
Through evaluation of these practices and the data on the health threat, diagnosis can be improved and the disease can be tackled more efficiently. Mantis facilitates collection and sharing of this data, by e.g. clear labeling and data storage on a SD card. See more on the device page. Gathering this test performance data also facilitates approval of the diagnostic for later use by the WHO [1].
Performance assessment of diagnostics
How do you know if your OUD functions according to expectation? How can you ensure maximum specificity and robustness of your device? For this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidelines.
The basic requirements for a diagnostic test are collected in the ASSURED program (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free and Deliverable to end-users), developed by the WHO in 2003 [2]. If these criteria are met, the diagnostic can be applied for use in the local area. Performance tests are still required to improve its weak(er) points through a continuous feedback loop with the field team. A diagnostic test that would fit these demands would be of great value for neglected diseases like HAT [3].

Step 12.  Monitoring
Once an outbreak is over, one would conclude that the situation is relatively safe again and the danger of infection is minimized. However, the infective agent can always re-emerge and spread through the population again. To make sure these resurgences are noticed early on and handled quickly, detection kits are once again necessary. These are mainly used for ‘case finding’ in the population.

Introducing the AGO1 and DCR1 genes, together with an antisense sequence for the ERG9 gene, a separate module for the platform is generated.
Promoters for P. pastoris
When working with P. pastoris as an expression system, a need for a controlled expression evidences a lack of related parts in the registry. Therefore, the characterization of four inducible promoters is presented. The registry’s insufficiency of expression tools for alternative systems like this yeast is thus addressed. P. pastoris offers an expression system that has proven useful in substantial protein production, especially in molecules requiring post-translational modifications. Cultures of this yeast are able to achieve relatively large cell densities, allowing greater amounts of biomass to be used for production. Also, this organism is non-pathogenic and regarded as biologically safe, making it a relevant alternative for expression systems.
Using GFP as a reporter for the strength of each promoter, the detected fluorescence is registered as proportional to the level of expression of the gene. The emitted radiation can be quantified by a fluorescence microplate reader, as well as by fluorescence microscopy, using specialized software (ImageJ) for an objective appraisal of the images. The results here presented reveal the successful implementation of the promoters in the system and the functionality of this product of gene expression. Further characterization includes the detailed study of the effect of inducer concentration in the medium over time.
We are aware of the characteristics of GFP that make it a non-ideal reporter chromophore. The availability of molecular oxygen in its surroundings is a source of variability in its fluorescent activity. Also, the correct folding of the protein takes a certain amount of time and also depends on the medium’s conditions, inserting noise into the results. However, GFP provides an easy way to track gene expression in simpler systems. The data to be collected on promoter strength is purely relative and specific for its setup, providing a general baseline for their usefulness on other projects.
The availability of inducible promoters for a biosystem is useful when a tight grip on expression of the genes of interest is desired. Applying the modular biofatory design strategy, they come extremely handy if the purpose is for each module to be expressed at different times. It would be possible to construct a mathematical model quantifying the effect of each of the separate modules using distinct promoters for each group of genes associated to a specific function of the genetic construct.

As can be seen from the above figure, the ECF sigma30 promoter is only activated in presence of ECF sigma35, suggesting that that the parts and devices constructed worked as expected. The ON state, measured in Fluorescence/OD600, was up to more than 10 fold of the OFF state. However, it should be noted that there is a leak in the promoter in its OFF state as indicated by the significance difference in Fluorescence/OD600 when compared to the construct expressing only sigma 35.
Once the functionality of the promoter and its cognate pair was confirmed, the part was ligated in pSB3K3 to measure its strength relative to the standard promoter BBa_J23101. The strength of the ECF30 promoter in its induced state was measured to be of RPU 3.2 units.
Figure 3. Measurement of Activated Sigma30 promoter Activity in comparison to Promoter BBa_J23101.
Both parts are ligated in plasmid pSB3K3. The part containing the constitutive sigma35 generator was double transformed into the cell for measurement. Data represents an average of 3 samples and error bars represent the standard  deviation.

The second sigma factor that we have characterised and tested its functionality is ECF sigma16  from Pseudomonas entomophila.

As only cells with BBa_K2070026 is shown to fluorescence, it can be suggested that the devices works as expected.
Though we have checked its functionality on agar plate, due to time constraints, we were not able to measure the fluorescence of the Psigma16 GFP (BBa_using the spectrofluorophotometer.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," 168 transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 420 minutes with E. coli carrying a plasmid containing the fluoride riboswitch
This data seems to show a trend, that at low fluoride concentrations there is a positive relationship between concentration and A450, the A450 then plateaus, and then at high fluoride concentration the A450 drops again, this gives the overall data a bell shape. A possible explanation for this is that there are two conflicting effects, an increase in fluoride leads to an increase in β-galactosidase expression which, in turn, leads to an increased A450. However, the increased fluoride concentrations begin to become toxic and so limit the cell’s ability to produce β-galactosidase, leading to a reduction in A450. It would also seem that the linear region of the initial positive relationship seems to lie between 0μM and 100μM. We therefore repeated the assay, with a longer time course, and with greater resolution in this range, in order to see if the original trend could be reproduced, and also to better quantify this initial correlation. Included below are the results for the repeated assay.
The timecourse of the second run of the β-galactosidase assay using crcB knockout B. subtilis transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 790 minutes with crcB knockout B. subtilis transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 790 minutes with B. subtilis strain 168 transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 790 minutes with E. coli carrying a plasmid containing the fluoride riboswitch
For clarity, and to act as an internal control, the bar chart results are expressed as a percentage change from the same culture, after the same length of time, but with no fluoride added. This assumes that the cultures behaved the same across all fluoride concentrations over the assay, i.e. cell density and productivity were unaffected by the fluoride. This sort of assumption would no longer be needed if a ratiometric system were used, part of our motivation for developing ratiometrica. This data seems to confirm the initial findings, as well as giving greater resolution in the 0μM to 100μM range. The results for higher fluoride concentrations do not seem to quite fit the trend, but as this is consistent across all the cell types it is possible that this was due to errors in making up the solutions, rather than actually being representative of the riboswitch. This data is very encouraging"

PcelA and PcomFA promoters have high specificity to σx for activation, so genes downstream the promoters will be translated only if σx is present. Hence, by using fluorescence protein as a reporting mechanism, this σx, PcelA and PcomFA promoters system could be further utilized as a specific reporter device in E. coli DH10B strain that could be used by iGEM communities.
σx-ComW mechanism
Figure 2. σx - comW Interaction Diagram
σx and ComW protein are both produced by a constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 , which continuously expresses σx required for PcelA and PcomFA promoters induction, and ComW protein is required for σx stabilization. ComW protein acts as a barrier that protects σx from being degraded by ClpXP degradation enzyme, hence it increases the production of σx. The increase in σx production will increase the expression of green fluorescence protein by PcelA and PcomFA promoters.
To complete the story of competence regulation mechanism from S. pneumoniae, we would also like to integrate another positive factor involved in competence regulation which was later found out to be ComW. Prof. Morrison's lab released another research paper on the identification of a new component in the regulation of genetic transformation in S. pneumoniae. The gene comW (SP0018) was found to be       regulated by the quorum-sensing system and is required for a high-level of competence (Luo, Li, and Morrison, 2004). Coexpression of ComW with σx restores the accumulation of σx and the expression of late genes as ComW contributes to the stabilization of the alternative sigma factor X against proteolysis by ClpXP and is required for full activity of σx in directing transcription of late competence genes (Piotrowski, Luo, and Morrison, 2009).
Based on these findings, we tried to integrate this ComW into the mechanism to see whether and how the presence of ComW affects σx. First, we cloned out the comX gene expressing σx and comW genes from the genomic DNA of S. pneumoniae NCTC 7465 strain. We then used BBa_K880005 (consisting of constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 and strong RBS BBa_B0034 ) from the BioBricks to express those genes.

A. Finalized component average results for each component in varying inducer concentrations using their lab’s protocol. E. coli strain BL21 is designated by “BL,” and strain MG1655 is designated by “MG.” Values were obtained by taking the average of the fluorescence at each inducer concentration. Negative controls, which consist of the wildtype strain grown in each corresponding inducer concentration, were averaged and then subtracted from each component value. Results from this experiment were variable and followed no set pattern.
B. B. Graph of finalized component average results with error bars showing standard deviations. R0010 in BL21 is designated by blue, R0010 in MG1655 orange, K314100 in BL21 gray, and K314100 in MG1655 yellow. Steep deviations were common for all cell lines at higher inducer concentrations. The results from this experiment were inconclusive.

DgrA/DgrB
The concentration of c-di-GMP is varying, and for our experiment we will promote its expression to inhibit rotation of flagella. It will bind to DgrA and DgrB. The resulting complex will have two routes to go: one is the [c-di-GMP&amp;DgrA] complex which will inhibit FliL, a protein bound to the membrane playing a key role in rotation of flagella. And the other route is that the DgrB will directly affect the rotation of the flagella.
HfiA/HfsJ
Ref: A Cell Cycle and Nutritional Checkpoint Controlling Bacterial Surface Adhesion
In this paper, author describes a novel regulatory mechanism by which the C.c. bacterium integrates cell cycle and nutritional signals to control development of an adhesive envelop structure known as holdfast.
They discovered a novel inhibitor of holdfast development. HfiA, that is regulated downstream of lovK-lovR. They also discovered a bio-synthesis related gene named HfsJ. And the suppressing mutations in HfsJ attenuate the HfsJ-HfiA interaction.
These results support a model in which HfiA inhibits holdfast development via direct interaction with an enzyme required for holdfast biosynthesis
In conclusion, author says: We demonstrate that the predicted glycosyltransferase, HfsJ, is a required component of the holdfast development machinery and that residues at the C-terminus of HsfJ mediate a direct interaction with HfiA, leading to a post-translational inhibition of HfsJ.

We strongly hold a belief that it is our arduous responsibility to not only develop synthetic biology by working on a project day and night but teach and enlighten the public to be intrigued in biology and understand what scientists are doing on genetic engineering and other biology technology so that the public is capable of judging whether genetically modified organism (GMO) is safe and personalized gene sequencing and therapy are reliable enough.
Our iGEM team is also called Coding Life Association (CLA) in the University of Science and Technology of China(USTC) and CLA spares no time for making the public discover and marvel at the miracle of life. We hope the public can go forward with scientific development and we are trying our best to eliminate the estrangement between complicated methods and public cognition. Science, existing because of our curiosity to the amazing nature, will prosper and benefit mankind with our  endeavor to let everyone enjoy and understand. This is the core idea of human practice.

Contribution to the pSB1C3
The iGEM team Nevada contributed with correction of pSB1C3. Megan Tabor detected an error in pSB1C3 (the chloramphenicol resistant backbone).  pSB1C3 is the submission plasmid for iGEM, and was also used for a thiamine knockout construct to make Synechocystis PCC 6803 an auxotroph.  When trying to make the primers for isolation of the chloramphenicol resistance protein from the plasmid using PCR, the mapped out section did not blast as chlormamphenicol resistance and did not fit with the ORF. Megan contacted the MIT team that created the pSB1C3 to find more information and a correction. Below are the emails of the conversation.

Hello Austin,
My name is Megan Tabor and I am a currant iGEM member.  I am trying to work with the plasmid backbone pSB1C3 (the chloramphenicol resistant backbone).  I would like to isolate it out of the plasmid but there does not seem to be a start or stop codon associated with where on the plasmid the resistance is supposed to be.  I was wondering if you know for sure that is resistance is where it was stated.  Thank you so much for your time.
