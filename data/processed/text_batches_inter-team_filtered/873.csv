Communication
CCIC(Conference of China iGEMer Community)，as one of the best communication platforms for iGEMers in China, has gone through its fifth birthday. SMMU-China, the new team for iGEM, participated in CCIC for the first time. We communicated with iGEMers from other universities and got inspired by their experience.

Media promotion
Mainly, there were 3 media used in the process of our project promotion.
WeChat public platforms, as a popular form of media for all-round communication and interaction of text, pictures and voice among groups, have been widely used in recent years. In order to promote our project, to let more people know about our project and to achieve the promotion of synthetic biology and iGEM project, our team established our own Weichat public platform, the Internet Work Number. Whenever our team has a influential social practice, we will send a WeChat push to record the moment. For example, the summer camp, attending CCIC, you can find the details in our WeChat public platform.
As a new media, Shakes is appealing to the youth for the characteristics of short, fast and trendy. Our team used Shakes to record the details of our experiment, both happy and sad memories. Through this comedy form, we can record the problems we encountered in the operation of the experiment. In this way, we can not only spread the idea of joyful experiment, but also record our team's best memory of youth.
Himalaya FM, as the initiator of audiobooks, has great influence in China. We rely on this platform to introduce synthetic biology to our readers on the basis of the book Synthetic Biology and Applications written by Dr. Markus Schmidt. Through all the new mediums we talk above, we are able to achieve a more diversified level of promotion work, which is an important reason for our use of these. By popularizing synthetic biology in a way popular with the mediums, we can achieve the final goal of human practice: to let more people understand synthetic biology, and really let synthetic biology come into the general public.
Summer camp
Since the formation of the SMMU-China team, our members have been thinking about how to effectively promote synthetic biology and IGEM. In August 1st, outstanding students from 12 provinces/cities and 13 middle schools across the country have participated in the summer camp organized by our school. Learning about this news, the iGEM team members are both excited and a little worried. We were excited about this excellent opportunity to"

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#8 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," derived later from working notes I made that day.
Originally, I had planned to keep most of the functionality for my DNA parts in a single script. But, the DNA needed to know some hardcoded information about itself: what its name is, what the name of the next part in the DNA polymer is, what type of DNA element it is, and what protein it is repressed by / activated by / produces, and I didn't want to generate a new version of the script (with different hardcoded values) for every single DNA part I made. I decided to use a second script, which would have unique hardcoded information for each DNA part, this information could also be modified for purposes of building custom DNA devices later. I had thought I could make this 'identity script' nice and short, and contain most of the changes to each part in the main 'dna script'. The problem is that this introduced an extra level of communication between the main DNA script and its identity script... and because so much of the DNA's function relates to what it is, the identity script wound up being longer than the DNA script!
I wanted to merge these two scripts into something better organized, but I still needed a way to record the DNA's important details. I briefly used an internal notecard (text document) to store this information, but Second Life doesn't allow objects to edit notecards, which would be a problem when we get to building custom DNA in the Biobricker. In the end I settled on storing this information in the part's name and description fields, the only text fields that are persistent across sessions and resets, but also editable. The only problem with doing this is that these fields are user accessible, it's very possible for someone to edit their object's name and break its functionality the next time it resets or is moved from inventory! Yet, it's the only way I could find to get the DNA construction system to work, and it also has a hidden feature: capable users can change the traits of their biobrick parts without needing to build entire new devices in the HUD.
The new DNA script uses a much simplified system to keep track of what it is, and what it can do. There are three parameters: number one is the part's type, with each of constitutive promoter, repressable promoter, coding sequence... etc as possible types. The DNA learns its type when it is created from inventory or reset, and that type is permanent until the next reset or recreation. Type also informs the DNA of what transcription factor it should pay attention to, if any.
The type of the DNA determines the"

These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the synthesis and display of gold nanoparticles.This part has many future applications and will allow for the attachment of gold nanoparticles to many kinds of protein structures and will be a future key player in the emerging use of nanotechnology in synthetic biology.
BBa_K2045002 CDC28: Cyclin-dependent kinase catalytic subunit
In order to have effective cell battle with our microgladiators… It was important to ensure that cell division of our nanoparticle coated cells didn’t occur. Cell division would not only make it difficult for cell isolation in our microfluidic battle dome, but it will also compromise the integrity of the cell’s nanoweaponry; since the coating of nanoparticles will be halved as the cell membrane goes through cell division.  The solution was CDC28, a gene that allows users to control the growth of their cells by steadily controlled external temperature. The cells will only be active and capable of cell division at 24oC and inactive, therefore incapable of cell division, at 37oC. By attaching nanoparticles to our yeast cells with CDC28, and keeping them at 37oC in the microfluidic battle system, we can ensure an effective battle between our micro-gladiators without compromising their attached nanoweapons. Since the presence of the wild type CDC28 gene in the yeast genome would mask the phenotype of the temperature sensitive mutant we decided to knock out the wild type version of the gene using CrispR. We designed 2 primers that would amplify the T.S. CDC28 with 3 silent mutations. CrispR gRNAs were then designed to bind to the wild type sequence of the gene but were unable to bind to the newly mutated version of the T.S. CDC28 due to the 3 silent mutations. The gRNAs and the mutated T.S. CDC28 were introduced to the wild type yeast and were selected for by antibiotic resistance. Future iGEM teams will be able to use our primer and gRNA designs in order to turn wild type yeast into cell cycle temperature sensitive yeast mutants.

Judging Form
The beginning of our project
During a regular seminar of virology, we discussed about different possibilities to engage into scientific research as soon as possible. Annabel and Nicole came up with the idea to participate in the iGEM competition. We were motivated by the outlook to conduct our own research project with all tasks and responsibilities but with close supervision by experienced researchers. Mostly we were eager to gain experience working in the lab.
After collecting more information about the competition online and from other participants, we decided to bring iGEM to Wuerzburg and founded the first team of our university. Together with two additional bachelor students we motivated Prof. Jochen Bodem to become our PI. He also provided us with lab space to get started with the lab work. By advertising our project among friends, we soon got more and more students, until we were a huge group of 50 participants.
After various brainstorming sessions we decided to start exploring new methods in the detection of infectious diseases.  This led us to our project, designing a rapid diagnostic test to distinguish different types of Plasmodium, the pathogen which causes Malaria.
Organizing the team in different subgroups meant that every student could contribute to the topic they liked the most. Unfortunately, many students did not spend as much time and passion on our project as necessary, so our team shrank to the final number of eleven student members and three advisors. Our final team consists of an interdisciplinary synergy of bachelor students from biology, biomedicine, medicine and mathematics.
German Meetup in Marburg
As a newly established team we were excited to get in contact with the other teams at the German meetup in Marburg. Especially, we exchanged some ideas about the different projects and talked about problems we had to face in the wet lab. This exchange of experience resulted in a huge benefit for our project in the following weeks.
We were introduced to team Marburg’s project for the first time. Later we established a collaboration with team Marburg by participating in their Vibrio natriegens InterLab Study. Moreover, we learned much more about the iGEM competition itself and got contacts to students more familiar to the iGEM"

•LovTAP activator activity: Reporter system  trpL promoter fused to lambda Repressor cI: Part:BBa_P0451 + Part:BBa_K098991 regulating GFP protein:Part:BBa_E0240.
Experimental Procedure
First attempt
Zepeda searched in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts for an appropriate inverter which is a repressor followed by its binding site. We chose an inverter because it is going to be constitutively repressing anything downstream of it, but when it gets transcriptionally repressed (by LovTAP), whatever is downstream of it is going to be activated.
We chose the cI inverter from Lambda phage (BBa_Q04510) and proceeded to extract it from the 2009 kit plate 1, Zepeda transformed it by heat shock, extracted plasmid and digested it with EcoRI and PstI.
When checking the digestions on an agarose gel, the 1kb band expected from the cI inverter was absent or very thin, so He performed a PCR using the prefix and suffix as primers.  The PCR came out very well with the expected size. As the double digestions were good enough to ligate, we hypothesize that not all plasmids had the inverter that is why it looks very weak on the digestions, but comes out very well in the PCR.
Zepeda did more PCRs for the cI inverter using RTTH polymerase (hot start), purified them and digested with EcoRI and PstI in order to ligate them to GFP.
In order to introduce the GFP with the new RBS he digested the GPF with SpeI/PstI and plasmid pSB1T3 with XbaI/PstI then he ligate them.
He tried several times to ligate the cI inverter to the GFP-PCR with new RBS in the plasmid pSB1T3 with no success.  As non of the attempts to ligate the 2009 cI inverter PCR were  successful and the digestions were doubtful, he decided to extract the cI inverter from the 2010 kit plate.
After the transformation, plasmid extraction and double digestion with EcoRI/P"
Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," from Aspergillus niger is widely used in glucose-related diagnostics and biotechnologies including biosensors and food industries. In the redox reaction, GOX requires FAD as electron mediators and finally transfer electrons to oxygen to generate hydrogen peroxide with the reduction potential of -97 ± 3 mV at pH 7.4 ( Anal Chem. 2014 ).
ALCOHOL OXIDASE (AOX)
 
 
 
 
 
Alcohol oxidase (AOX) is also an oxido-reductase that catalyzes the oxidation of alcohol and produce aldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The substrates of AOX are primary alcohols including methanol and some short-chain alcohols such as ethanol. AOX is present in the methylotrophic yeast like Pichia pastoris , which has two genes, AOX1, AOX2 under a strong methanol inducible promoter. The yeast uses AOX genes to metabolize methanol as a carbon and energy source. The AOX enzymes were used in biosensors ( Biosens Bioelectron. 2005 ) but with a limited application because its electrochemical properties including reduction potential are not well studied.
DISPLAYING AOX ENZYME ON THE CELL SURFACE OF E. COLI
Protein induction and purification may cost much time up to 12 hours and need tricky technical skills. To simplify the procedure of AOX enzyme application, we obtained the idea from the project of an iGEM Team – NCTU_Formosa in 2015. A protein can be displayed on the cell surface of E. coli by fusing to Lpp-OmpA. Lipoprotein ( Lpp ) is a major outer membrane of E. coli which interacts with the peptidoglycan to maintain the structure and function of cell membrane. Another transmembrane protein called outer membrane protein A ( OmpA ) is involved in bacterial conjugation and phage infection. A study showed that Lpp-OmpA hybrid can direct the heterologous protein GFP to the external surface of E. coli ( Enzyme Microb Technol. 2001 ). Bacillus lipase ( J Microbiol. 2014 ) and Fungi xylanase ( Curr Microbiol. 2015 ) were demonstrated to be displayed on the cell surface of E. coli and maintained the functional enzyme activities. We’d like to display the AOX enzyme on bacterial surface by fusing with Lpp-OmpA and apply to the electrochemical analyzer by depositing on the test strip.

Kingsborough_NY,2016,Team:Kingsborough NY#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Other teams in the past have attempted to address the issue of biological nitrogen removal, but with limited success. The 2013 DTU Denmark team attempted to import traditional nitrifying and denitrifying enzymes from different species into E. coli. While they demonstrated a certain tolerance of E. coli to ammonia and nitrates, the altered metabolism of their engineered cell produced a toxic side effect.
In contrast, the 2013 AHUT Chinese team attempted to import several different anammox components from K. stuttgartiensis. While this is a more desirable approach, they did not report any expression from their constructs. There are several, potentially solvable technical reasons why this result was obtained.
The Kingsborough iGEM team will build upon the work previously done by both the Danish and Chinese teams. Instead of importing all the K. stuttgartiensis enzymes, we will focus only on successfully engineering a hydrazine synthase in E. coli. This enzyme is a key step in the anammox pathway, and it combines ammonia and nitric oxide to form hydrazine. Hydrazine is an intermediate towards nitrogen gas production, and it is useful on its own as a rocket fuel. Since E. coli can tolerate the presence of the substrates for this reaction, it will not be necessary to import all enzymes; in theory, the in vivo activity of hydrazine synthase can be tested and verified before trying to develop the complete anammox system.
Recent work has identified the gene cluster encoding the hydrazine synthase complex. These genes will be codon optimized and cloned into E. coli under an inducible promoter. Growth of the modified bacteria in the presence of ammonia and nitric oxide will be monitored. After expression of the new cassette is activated, hydrazine production and concomitant hydrazine toxicity induced cell death should be observed. If time permits, this project will be expanded by identifying an ammonia or nitric oxide responsive promoter and incorporating it to control the expression of the hydrazine synthase.
Our Motivation: Jamaica Bay
The Kingsborough Community College is unique in the City University of New York system for several reasons, including the fact that we are the only campus with our own beach. Located on the shores of the Rockaway Inlet, we are reminded everyday about the importance of marine life and ecosystems. We were motivated to use synthetic biology to help preserve these waterways from the effects of pollution, and investigated the impact sewage and wastewater runoff had on the local environment.

Today we carried out double digests of limonene synthase on an ampicillin backbone, R-linalool on a chloramphenicol backbone, promoter J23119 on a chloramphenicol backbone, TET and AMP backbones.
Limonene synthase was ligated to promoter J23119 and onto a tetracycline resistant backbone, using 3A assembly. This was transformed into E.coli, spread on agar plates and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
R-linalool was ligated onto a ampicillin resistant backbone, transformed into E.coli, spread on agar plates and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
Colonies that had been transformed with promoter and RBS were inoculated in LB and grown up overnight at 37°C.
E.coli was transformed with a blue light promoter and also with RFP on a tetracycline resistant backbone. These were plated on agar and left to grow overnight at 37°C
 
Day 49 (4/09/14):
We had colonies grown of the assembly of promoter J23119 with limonene synthase onto a TET backbone, and of the light promoter. We had a lawn of colonies of R-linalool onto ampicillin suggesting this had been contaminated. We had no growth of RFP on a TET backbone.
Colonies of the limonene synthase assembly and of the light promoter were selected and inoculated in LB. These were left to grow overnight at 37°C.
E.coli that had been transformed with promoter and RBS and grown up overnight were miniprepped, and the plasmid stored at -20°C.

It has been found that dormant conidia are predominantly bi-nucleate (85%), the remainder being uni-nucleate. Therefore, if one stains the giant cells with DAPI, which colours the nuclei, one can assess whether the nuclei within the cells are actively dividing. This appears to be the the case and thus indicates that the cells are not in a vegetative state.

Finally the search has begun, this week we have started with literature research for the Lovastatin project. Some topics were for example what is Lovastatin, which genes are involved in Lovastatin production in Aspergillus terreus, and how to measure Lovastatin production. The first idea was to introduce the Lovastatin pathway of A. terreus into A.niger. During the research we found that one of the bigger genes involved is composed of several domains. Our new idea now is to synthesize these domains, making several modules that we can assemble as we wish.

Week 9: First simulations, Skype with Paris Bettencourt, Chip fail
Wednesday, July 23rd
We started to simulate diffusion experiments on a Comsol model. We consider cells will lay on agar for the moment.
We will have a chip with these four different channels 1 to 4 mm long. The model still has to be refined because at the moment it doesn't take into account internal/external concentrations of AHL.
Our first mold didn't enable us to peal the PDMS correctly. We have to make it less deep.
5 of 8 regulator plasmids are done. We have to repeat construction of producer plasmids.
Parameter estimation for integrases is not working at the moment.
We skyped with Paris Bettencourt for human practice collaboration and are participating to their newsletter project.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

They also assumed that the promoter strengths for all genes are identical and constructed a lumped parameter $c$. The parameter $c$ is the strength of the repressive coupling, which is calculated by \begin{equation} c=\frac{\beta_1\cdot K_{tl}}{K_R\cdot K_P}. \end{equation}
They found that there is only a fixed point $p_m$ when $c$ is small enough and  the uniform solution $p_m$ becomes unstable via a Hopf bifurcation as $c$ increases, resulting in a stable limit cycle.
Then how the promoter strength of each gene influences the final result? We tried to use average promoter strength to simplify this question. Comparing four different mean values, we found that the harmonic mean of the promoter strengths exhibited good competence in distinguishing these two cases. If the harmonic mean of these three genes' promoter strengths is large enough, a stable oscillation can be observed easily in theory. While any one of the promoter strengths is too weak, the harmonic mean will be too small to lead to a stable oscillation, because harmonic mean is easily affected by the minimal value.
Figure 6. Distributions of average promoter strength for two cases. The red areas represent the average promoter strength distribution for those systems with a fixed point attractor. The yellow areas represent the average promoter strength distribution for those systems with a limit cycle attractor. The orange areas represent the overlapping areas of these two distributions
The model for genetic toggle switch, by contrast, is more simple. It has been acknowledged that the relative promoter strength is more important to the steady states. If the promoter strengths are approximately equal, or, in other words, if they are in the same order, the topological structure of toggle switch creates two stable and one unstable steady states. If one promoter strength is considerably larger than the another one, only one stable steady state will be produced.
4.2.2 Situations after rewiring
Not only parameters but also the initial state decides the final steady state of the toggle switch. We set $\beta_1=(30,15,20)$ and constructed an index $S$ to estimate which steady state the toggle switch reaches. $S$ is calculated by \begin{equation} S=\lim_{t\to\infty}\log_{10}\frac{x_1(t)}{x_2(t)}. \end{equation}
The simulation results indicated S had two values which represent the two stable steady states. In our"

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design Regulatory_-_-_TEXT.html,"otides. For example, droplets with large amount of biomolecules may produce a large number of Product Nucleotides and vice-versa .
Using such logic, we can hypothesise that any sequence element that can adjust the expression of the catalytic biomolecule can be measured and its influence on the Product Nucleotide - recorded. In other words, this influence is the activity, or strength of regulatory element.
Proof of concept
To demonstrate that CAT-Seq can be applied to record the activity and cross interactions of regulatory sequences we have chosen two main objects: Ribosome Binding Sites and synthetic Toehold Switches.
1. Regulatory part activity recording
Ribosome binding sites (RBS) are sequences that are responsible for recruiting the ribosomes during the initiation of protein translation. RBS can have different sequences, and depending on those sequences, the frequency of ribosome binding rate to the RBS will be different. In this way, gene of interest translation rate can be controlled in a constitutive manner.
Having a large RBS library with known activities would allow to precisely pick an RBS sequence with a specific activity, while engineering sensitive and complex genetic circuits. Yet, it is not easy to screen large libraries of RBS, as each individual known sequence must be selectively placed in a physically separated compartment and then measured.
With CAT-Seq, such activity recording becomes much easier. While keeping all the workflow from the main Catalytic Activity Sequencing design, all we need to do is to change the way we prepare the library. Firstly, instead of using a library of catalytic biomolecules, we can use a single esterase enzyme. Then, specific or random RBS sequence library can be prepared and attached to the esterase enzyme sequence. After that, every step of CAT-Seq method is the same.
After the library is encapsulated into droplets, depending on the RBS sequence strength some droplets may have different amounts of the esterase. For example, the droplets with more esterase will produce more Product Nucleotides and vice-versa. After the amplification and sequencing steps we can learn two main things about the measured library - the RBS sequence and its relative RBS strength in the form of Product Nucleotide concentration for every library variant screened.
For our proof of concept experiments, we have chosen to measure multiple already established RBS sequences from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. First, we measured the activities of RBS using standard methods as a control. Next, we have measured the same constructs using the CAT-Seq system.

Virginia,2016,Team:Virginia#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," forms of biocontainment. For example, a team of undergraduate students from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands successfully developed and implemented an E. coli kill switch over the course of four months.  Kill switch methods are great, when they work. Often, however, selective pressures allow cells to escape the kill switch mutation and revert to their normal state. In short, kill switches are relatively quick and easy to implement, but also allow for easy escape.
Conversely, protein engineered auxotrophy (PEA) methods provide robust containment, but are too specific; they are limited to single pathways in specific organism strains. In PEA mechanisms, genes for specific proteins are recoded to accept synthetic amino acids in place of naturally occurring amino acids. Only humans can provide the synthetic amino acid, which cannot be found in nature.refReference:
Kato, Yusuke. ""An Engineered Bacterium Auxotrophic for an Unnatural Amino Acid: A Novel Biological Containment System."" PeerJ. PeerJ Inc., 2015. Web. 08 Oct. 2016. Basically, the cell is put on a very specific diet, and scientists control the food supply.  While robust, PEA methods are restricted to a single pathway in a single strain or species. Every iteration constitutes its own independent project started from scratch. While effective, PEA methods are highly inefficient.
Our proposed method, Synthetic Translational Control, provides the robustness of PEA methods with the efficiency of kill switch designs. Rather than target an exclusive biological pathway, we intentionally selected a universally conserved enzyme, leucyl tRNA synthetase. Cells are constantly making proteins. Amino acids, the building blocks, are carried to a growing protein chain where they are added as “links”. There are 20 common amino acids, each with a unique tRNA molecule that carries the acid to the protein chain. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase, our target enzyme, allows leucine, an amino acid, to bind to its unique tRNA. We coined the name “Leu-Lock” for our mutant enzyme because our system targets a leucine pathway to “lock” the organism to a specific area. Unlike PEA methods, this type of protein targeting does not require recoding to accept synthetic acids, and therefore requires less time to implement. Our method also targets a universal system versus a strain-specific pathway.
Protecting groups are secondary chemicals that can be reversibly added to other molecules. In the lab, we add a special protecting group to leucine. We modified the leucyl t"

Dosing the cells with Tet/dox will make shSox2 and shPTB expressed, so that PTB gene (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 ) will be knockdown, inducing MEF cells to transdifferentiate to Neuron. Adding TM to the cell growth medium will make Sox2 overexpressed, inducing MEF cells to reprogramme to iNScs. Adding dox and TM together will make four transcription factors OSKM (Oct4,Sox2,Klf4 and c-Myc) through connecting by T2A linker overexpressed, inducing MEF cells to reprogramme to iPScs.

Biobrick Construction
Brief Introduction
To create this biobrick, we utilized a combination of overlap PCR and thermostable ligase chain reaction (TLCR) to extract a sequence that contains all the functional parts to build our system. The brief introduction of this procedure is listed below.
PCR to generate gene fragments:
In this step, all separate fragments of the final system are amplified from several plasmids via PCR. We add necessary overlapping sites to the 5' and 3' ends when designing primers.
Details see PCR Method\Pfu PCR.
The PCR product is then purified.
Details see DNA purification\Xygen Gel Extraction.
Overlap PCR to make all fragments into three parts:
Every part is made from four or five fragments. In each part, every two fragments have complementary overlapping sites, and all of them are connected one by one through PCR.
details see PCR methods\overlap PCR.
The overlap PCR products are purified then.
Details see DNA purification\Exygen gel extraction.
Thermostable ligase chain reaction (TLCR) to insert each part into the vector.
All sticky ends of these three parts should be completed by T4 ligase first. Then each part is inserted into a vector pBluescriptIISk by TLCR, with the help of helpers. Helpers are DNA strains that contain the same sites of two to-be-connected ends of two DNA fragments.
We planned to insert"

SVA22:  This is a composite part of SVA17 (LacI promoter+RBS+eforRed) before SVA4 (double terminator).  This part was created for sequencing to be compared to SVA21 to help determine SVA21’s difficulties.
SVA23:  This is a composite part of SVA3 (strong RBS) before SVA5 (mCherry).  This part was made to allow for subsequent addition of a terminator to be used as the indicator region.  This SVA3 came from reordering BBa_B0034 due to the previous batches complications.
Basic Parts
SVA1:  This part is a complete genetic circuit with a LacI promoter, Strong RBS, mRFP1, and double terminator made to verify the functionality of mRFP1 in the use of a biosensor.  This is all on a Ampicillin resistant backbone.  This circuit was simply transformed from BBa_J04450.
SVA2:  This part incorporates the Mer Operon, including: MerR, MerT, MerP, and MerA. This part should give the chassis Mercury resistance and give it a mercury-activated promoter region.  All of this is on Chloramphenicol resistant backbone.  This part was simply a transformation of BBa_K1355004.  The intended purpose of this part was to add a fluorescent marker after the Mercury sensing domain to make a functioning mercury sensor.
SVA3:  This part is only a strong RBS transformed from BBa_B0034 on an Ampicillin resistant backbone.  Its purpose is for subsequent restriction and ligation for more complex circuits.
SVA4:  This part is only a double terminator from BBa_B0015 on a Chloramphenicol resistant backbone.  Its purpose is for subsequent restriction and ligation for more complex circuits.
SVA5:   This part is only the region encoding for mCherry on a Chloramphenicol resistant backbone; it is lacking a promoter, RBS and terminator.  It was transformed from BBa_J06504.  Its purpose was for subsequent restriction and ligation as the indicator to be attached to a sensory domain of a biosensor.

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara_-_-_TEXT.html,"Synthetic biology is a field where  natural sciences and engineering sciences go  together hand in hand. It is an emerging science that requires the literature  search, knowledge  of natural sciences  and methods of engineering sciences. Synthetic biology is the engineering of  organisms to give them desired properties, except their regular metabolic  activities. These desired properties are entegrated into genome of the organism  with molecular cloning procedures.
There are lots of studies going on to introduce this newly  emerging science field to people from all age groups and producing an  information repository and improving it at the same time. One of this studies  is the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) competition.
We, as METU iGEM teams, are attending this competition  for four years. For this newly emerging science field to improve more, we  believe that it should be spread out to other universities and more and more  people should attend this competiton. We are sending you our study about the  videos of lab protocols that are mainly used in synthetic biology and  references that you can search for more information.  We feel honored to tell that these sources  are available for everyone who would like to reach them.

For  this web page, we have prepare the course notes and they were uploaded to reach many students from all around  to inform and contact for further relations about Synthetic Biology.
In addition, we distributed hand outs about our project and Synthetic Biology at METU campus, when the registration of new students were done. We aimed to  inform students about our project and about Synthetic Biology to attract their attention on the issue.

3. Comparison other team’s fim switch
Our biggest achievement is that we have established a tripartite relationship between the three fim related parts, the fim switch and FimB/FimE.
In this chapter, the novelty of constructing and assaying all three fim related parts (the fim switch, FimB, and FimE) is shown by comparison to the past iGEM teams’ fim related parts.  Some teams have submitted fim related parts.  However the information of the fim related parts are so complicated that we felt that it is necessary to clarify the situation.
These submitted parts which show some data, are divided into three groups as shown in the figure below (Fig. 3-3-3-1.)
Fig. 3-3-3-1. All past iGEM teams’ fim related parts.
From the results of each group, we evaluated each group’s data as shown below.
From these evaluations, we concluded that our establishment of a tripartite relationship between the fim switch and FimB/FimE, is an unprecedented achievement in iGEM.

Magnesium chelatase plasmid
BBa_K1998000
The chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway shares similar precursors and enzymes with the heme biosynthetic pathway. The main common precursor between these two pathways is Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). PPIX is a tetrapyrrole that can be synthesised by many organisms from simple precursors such as glycine, succinyl CoA or glutamate.
The fate of the PPIX is dependent upon which enzyme is present to convert PPIX to the next product. For instance, ferrochelatase converts PPIX to FePPIX – a precursor for heme. Our Magnesium chelatase plasmid is an assembly of six biobricks previously registered by a past Macquarie iGEM team.
Each individual biobrick was assembled in the following order using 3A assembly: pLac-chlI1-chlD-gun4-chlI2-cTH1-pLac-chlH [BBa_R0010] , [BBa_K1326008] , [BBa_K1080011] , [BBa_K1080005] and [BBa_K1640019] . Five of these genes code for different subunits of the enzyme Magnesium chelatase, with the cTH1 gene encoding a component of a later enzyme in the pathway, the oxidative cyclase.
Magnesium chelatase is responsible for catalysing the insertion of Mg2+ into Protoporphyrin IX which is the precursor for chlorophyll biosynthesis. All genes within this plasmid are sequences obtained from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and codon optimised to be expressed in E. coli. Lac promoters are also present at the front of the chlI1 and chlH gene with an RBS sequence at the beginning of all genes.
The magnesium chelatase is a complex enzyme consisting of a chlI1:chlD:chlI2 hexameric enzymatic motor complex which forms in the presence of ATP. The ch"

Overview
To support our colleagues in the lab, we outlined different models for different parts of our project.
Figure 1: Photoconversion cross sections calculated for various receptors. ""-a/d"" indicate activation and deactivation of a receptor.
Photoinduction
To calculate the activity of light receptors, we devised a model that takes emission spectra of different light sources and absorption spectra, quantum yield and extinction coefficients of the receptors from literature as an input and returns the activation and deactivation constants for the given light conditions.
This model can be used to calculate the activity of a light receptor in a light condition. Together with an mechanistical model of the receptor, it gives an estimate of the transcriptional activation due to light input.
See all the details in Photoinduction model .
Sun Protection Factor
The sun protection factor (SPF) model gives the sun protection factor we can achieve with a given amount of PABA and also what amount of PABA we need to get to a SPF.
See how much our E.colipse protects you from sun radiation in the Sun  Protection Factor model !

To decode our light receptor input, we created a full deterministic ODE model. As systems of interacting proteins with possibly multiple homodimerisations can grow quickly in size, modelling requires a systematic approach. In order to span the ODE system, we employ rules-based models. For this methodology, we define seed species and rules on how they can interact. In"

Forum at the Bund Center
On the afternoon of July 21, we held a forum at the Bund Center, Shanghai. To begin with, we introduced our project, the background of the problem, and the approach we took to resolve the problem. Then, we watched a video sent from our PI, Prof. Xiao, conveying his high expectation for the team from Cornell University.
After that, the experienced cyanobacteria researcher, Prof. Wang from Fudan University, talked about the existing methods in coping with cyanobacteria- introducing competing species, building algae-water separation station, and salvaging manually, etc. Right after, Mr. Luo from a last year's outstanding collegiate team, ""Shanghaitech 2017"", shared his experience on how to accomplish the research step
For the next part of the event, our team enthusiastically presented a well-prepared talent show. Thanks to our talented team members, our performance, including traditional cross talking, singing and dancing, won large rounds of applause
Approaching the epilogue of the event, we organized a fund-raising activity at which we sold our uniquely designed items, such as T-shirts with our team logo. In the end, we raised 5903 RMB from the activity, which would later be used to support our project. Through this activity, not only were we able to lay a financial foundation for our subsequent activities, but we were also able to publicize on our project.
Reception at the Xuhui Center Hospital
In order to hear from more people their opinion on our project and spread our idea more widely, we held a promotion reception at Xuhui Center Hospital. We invited people to learn what we are doing. And if they would like to help, they would put a sticker on our promotion poster. We put the basic summary, as well as the usage, necessity, benefits, disadvantages of our project on the board for people to view. We also held a Q&A part during which our student representatives would answer any question from the visitors. Lots of patients in the hospital participated, and they said that this would be a very worthwhile project if it actually comes true. Amazingly, we got "
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Interlab Study
Measurement of Fluorescence
The samples were measured according to the guidelines of the manufacturer using the TECAN ULTRA microplate reader. The fluorescence measurements were performed in a qualitative way due to lack of a fluorescence standard.
Bacterial cultures were directly used for determination via fluorescence emission measurements. The cultivation media Luria-Broth (LB) and cells without fluorescent protein were used as standard and control, respectively.
Two different set-ups were used for measurements depending on the fluorescent marker.  Due to variation in fluorescent protein expression gains had to be adjusted throughout the measurement. Thus, plain LB-medium was used for standardization. Configuration data is shown in table 2.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Practices#DualUse_-_-_TEXT.html," of active consideration to questions of biosecurity, mainly because they have little awareness of possible dual-use implications of their work. In the iGEM competitions, a lot of emphasis is placed on working safely, with required questionnaires, which, however, mainly cover biosafety aspects of their work. This is an excellent procedure and imperative to working responsibly. While the efforts of the iGEM organizers to promote awareness of biosecurity issues are growing steadily, the same rigorous questioning about dual-use biosecurity risks in carrying out the iGEM projects has to my knowledge not yet been applied. The proposal of the Bielefeld-Team to assess possible dual-use biosecurity risks in the context of all iGEM competition projects is a step in the right direction to promote awareness of biosecurity concerns among competition teams and to allow them to demonstrate that they are acting responsibly not only with biosafety concerns, but also with those related to biosecurity. I consider this relevant and necessary in light of the steadily growing reports of work involving dual-use research of concern (DURC) in the scientific literature that have generated much controversy and debate in the scientific community and in the general public about the need for carrying out research in a responsible manner. In my opinion, the proposal of the Bielefeld CeBiTec Team is a needed step that can definitively complement the standing efforts of the iGEM organizers to foster conscientious members of the synthetic biology community.""

""The aspect of dual use deserves highest attention, both in science and politics. Therefore, national  states as well as international organisations are obliged to monitor all relevant trends and to apply regulation, where necessary. Equally important, however, is the responsibility of scientists and their organisations. The training of young scholars, the implementation of clear and expedient rules and monitoring mechanisms, and the obligation to take dual use aspects into consideration at any step of the research process are important components of scientific self-regulation.""

""The iGEM competition could strengthen responsible decisions on the dual use research while respecting freedom of research if it provided the necessary resources. The competition offers already one resource by its very nature: iGEM is a good forum to discuss the issue. The second one needs to be developed: well-founded decisions about dual-use research need factual knowledge and normative considerations. Information about the facts and different normative perspectives on the problem could be published within iGEM and institutional points of contact might be established. It would be great if such"

We used the method of griess reaction to test if our biobrick can successfully work. When the broth contained nitrite, the color will turn pink and have absorbance at wavelength 545 nm
Ammonium Assimilation
From ammonium to glutamate
In order to convert ammonium to glutamate, we go through the GDH process and with the gene gudB which encodes the sequence of glutamate dehydrogenase. The gene comes from Bacillus subtilis and the activity is almost twice higher         than the gene gdhA which has the same effect in E. coli. The reaction formula is shown below:
ammonium + 2-oxoglutarate + NADPH + H+ ↔ L-glutamate + NADP+ + H2O
Hence, we designed primers which contained the restriction sites of BamHIat 5’ terminal and PstI at 3’ terminal to get the gene from genome. We digested the gene with the two restriction enzymes and then ligased into the pSB1C3 vector         which is the same as before.

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," during the furious battle between rats and frogs described by Homer”.
… And sexual practices submit to scientists’ voyeurism.
Theories of “generation” – that is of reproduction – had aroused passionate quarrels. One of them was about fecundation: what part plays the man seed? The frog, as a very common animal, and reproducing quickly, has the merit of transparence… It reproduces by external fecundation, the eggs laid by the female are straight after recovered by the male seed.
Jan Swammerdam, Biblia naturae, Leyde, 1737-1738 [manuscript from 1679]
In the XVII th century already, Jan Swammerdam was interested by the frog’s reproduction. With a small magnifying lens, he observed the cellular division of a fecundated frog’s egg. In 1768, Lazzaro Spallanzani dressed a male frog with a little panty made of leather, not without difficulty, because the animal tried to get rid of it!
“What assure the whole, is that I’ve putted some straps to these panties. I slipped it on the harms of the male frog, under his head, between his body and the female’s one”
The females mated with these males wearing panties freed their eggs, but these ones decayed and didn’t transform in tadpole. But, inside the panties, Spallanzani found drops of transparent liquor. He took a sample of virgin eggs in a frog’s ovary, knowing by experience that they can spontaneously develop. He damped them with the collected seed and noticed a few days after that the eggs developed as well as if they were naturally fecundated by the male.
“He just came to realize the first artificial insemination in a laboratory” wrote Jean Rostand. This series of experiences – with more than 200 frogs – allowed Spallanzani to ruin the hypothesis of fecundation at distance: the direct touch of the egg and the male seed is essential.
It has nerve, and tight!
In the middle of the XVII th century, the Dutch naturalist Jan Swammerdam explored another field of life: the transmission of the nerve impulse. A frog can keep on swimming even if one’s take away its heart, while it comes to a standstill if one’s take away its brain. The blood circulation is not necessary to move (at least for the frog). In 1568 he demonstrated, in front of the Duke of Toscane, the contraction of the frog’s muscle, separated from the frog with its nerve, under the action"

To express a photocaged protease, in our case subtilisin E, we developed three lab strategies. Their milestones can be seen below in three different timelines, one for every sub-division. Details about reaching these milestones will become visible, if you click on the corresponding circles. On the page Project Idea the theory beneath our lab work is described and on the subpage Protocols & Methods the exact protocols can be seen, if you would like to repeat the experiments. It can also be helpful to have a look at our primers list .
Photocaging - Targeting Serine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Expression of Subtilisin E
As the first step to reach our aim of producing an inactive photocaged subtilisin E variant, which can be activated by light, we researched on the recombinant expression of subtilisin E in S. cerevisiae . The native subtilisin E is a gene of Bacillus subtilis which we could receive from the institute. In the following steps our procedures can be traced.

Modeling of intracellular bisphenol A degradation
Regular model
The modeling was done with the software Berkeley Madonna using the common fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve the equations. The model was fitted to the measured data shown above by the function ""curve fit"" in Berkeley Madonna to calculate the parameters, constants, etc..
To model the BPA degradation by E. coli carrying BioBricks for BPA degradation (<partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo>), first the cell growth has to be described to calculate a specific BPA degradation rate per cell. The observed growth of E. coli on (our) LB medium was diauxic with two different growth phases. Cell growth is a first-order reaction and is mathematically described as
(1)
with the specific growth rate µ and the cell count X. The specific growth rate is dependent on the concentration of the growth limiting substrate (e.g. glucose) and can be described as
(2)
with the substrate concentration S, the Monod constant KS and the maximal specific growth rate µmax ( Monod, 1949 ). Because LB medium is a complex medium we cannot measure the substrate concentration so we have to assume an imaginary substrate concentration. Due to the diauxic growth two different substrates with different Monod constants and consumption rates are necessary to model the cell growth. The amount of a substrate S can be modeled as follows
(3)
with the specific substrate consumption rate per cell qS. The whole model for the diauxic growth of E. coli on LB medium with two not measurable (imaginary) substrates looks like:
(4)
The specific BPA degradation rate per cell qD is modeled with an equation like eq. (3). In the beginning of the cultivations, when E. coli growths on the ""good"" imaginary substrate S1, no BPA degradation is observed. When this substrate is consumed, the BPA degradation starts. The model for this diauxic behavior is as follows:

Figures 9 - 12 show a comparison between modeled and measured data for cultivations with BPA degrading E. coli. In Table 1 the parameters for the model are given, obtained by curve fitting the model to the data.

ProtoCat 3.0 - Project Description
Background
Two years ago the Michigan Software 2014 team began development of ProtoCat 1.0. Like many innovative ideas, ProtoCat began because of a problem. Studies have estimated that only 10-25% of published scientific results are reproducible.  A 2014 survey conducted by the Michigan Software team confirmed that the repeatability problem exists in synthetic biology, with every scientist surveyed reporting prior struggles with replicating protocols. The majority of these scientists indicated unclear language and missing steps are the greatest contributors to the irreproducibility of synthetic biology protocols. A second study conducted by last year's Michigan Software team only further confirmed the sentiments of the first study. These issues are what ProtoCat has been designed to solve.
Solution
Every respondent of the second survey indicated that they would use a database to browse and download protocols, with over 85% indicating that they would upload and maintain their own protocols if such a site existed. ProtoCat 3.0 is a free database of crowd sourced protocols designed to make existing protocols more repeatable and enable more accurate computational models of biological systems. We believe this can most efficiently be accomplished with a commitment to open source protocols and a broader more active community of digital troubleshooters. ProtoCat 3.0 works to establish such a community by giving anyone with an internet connection or smartphone access to a repository of synthetic biology protocols collected from all over the world. Additionally, ProtoCat 3.0 encourages the development of higher quality, more repeatable protocols by allowing users to document, rate, review, and edit existing methods.
What's new in ProtoCat 3.0?
ProtoCat 3.0 is a complete re-imagining of the ProtoCat software that has been in development for the last two years. By making dramatic changes to how we store protocols, we have been able to add new features that would have been impossible before. These features include variable reagent calculations, allowing users to scale the amounts in a protocol to their liking, and timers on a per-step basis. We have also made it possible to link to specific reagents so that users can immediately learn more about the reagents used in the protocol. Another benefit to the new protocol model is that the user is able to upload fully customized steps and, unlike in previous versions of ProtoCat, add warnings"

""What we do for ourselves dies with us. What we do for others and the world remains and is immortal.""
As the primary cause of death, cancer has contributed to 1/6 of the total death number all around the world. According to the report of WHO in 2017, every passing minute means that another 17 names has been added to the victims of cancer. That's why it's become more and more urgent to find a method efficient enough for cancer treatment.
Compared to other means such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, cell therapy has emerged with better results, higher speed of development as well as much more potential.
The current cell therapies mostly take advantage of existing or synthetic cell-surface biosensors to target and kill tumour cells. These biosensors include chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), synthetic Notch (SynNotch) and T-cell receptor (TCR). Up till now, the most successful case of cancer cell therapy is CAR-T, which uses engineered CARs – whose ectodomains are single-chain variable fragments (scFv) from monoclonal antibodies - to target certain cell-surface antigens on tumour cells1. These kinds of ectodomains can also enable TCRs to recognise specific tumour markers, and activate the intracellular signal pathways naturally existing in T-cells.
The two kinds of transducers take advantage of natural cellular pathways, but are also restricted by it, as the downstream could not be engineered and variant cellular reactions is hard to achieve2. SynNotch, which was firstly applied in tumour treatment in 2016, utilizes the same principles, the only difference being that the signal pathway was replaced by a cleaved transcription factor which is released into the cytoplasm and activate gene expression in nucleus upon recognisation3. By changing the transcription factor to non-human ones, the SynNotch system first realized orthogonality of biosensors used in cancer cell therapy.
However, receptors like CAR and Syn"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," for the single droplet to house k DNA molecules. λ shows the average number of DNA molecules per droplet.  For example, if you want to have a single template per droplets, you might choose λ to be 1. The Poisson distribution predicts, that 36.7% of droplets will have one molecule. However, it also predicts that 18.4% of droplets will house 2 molecules and 6.1% - 3 molecules. Following this notation, In order to avoid artificial data, caused by multiple DNA templates in one droplet, the concentration of the DNA template was kept at 1 per 10 droplets (λ = 0.1).  As seen from the graph, 90.4% of droplets will be empty and 9% will have 1 template. On the other hand, 0.4%. of droplets will house 2 DNA molecules, meaning that droplets with 2 DNA templates are generated rarely
3. Catalytic biomolecule production
General description
Once the encapsulation is finished, biomolecules are then produced in the droplets. In principle, there are two major approaches of producing catalytic biomolecule in the CAT-Seq system:
1. Nucleic Acids: encapsulating DNA or RNA molecules encoding the catalytic biomolecule. After the encapsulation the droplets can be incubated in order to produce the biomolecule. If the catalytic biomolecule is an enzyme, in-vitro protein synthesis (A) kit can be used in order to produce it. Otherwise, if it is a Ribozyme (B), it can be produced using in-vitro transcription reagents. Also, there are cases where the catalytic biomolecule is a Deoxyribozyme (C). Then, all that is required is to encapsulate the DNA library!
During one of the collaborative meetings with experts from microfluidic technology field in Life Sciences Center located in Vilnius, we have received information that synthesizing biomolecules from a single DNA template is an extremely inefficient process. That is because when there is only a single  template of DNA, the mRNA synthesis yield is extremely low and there is not enough mRNA to make an enzyme.
After doing in-depth literature research to try to solve this problem, we have found out that around 1990s people immensely increased short microRNA synthesis yields by circularizing DNA templates. As RNA polymerase goes around the DNA in circles it produces long strands of RNA molecules. Within those long molecules were the repeating small units of microRNA. They coined this"

This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Tsinghua-A,2015,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," for esophageal cancer that are currently in clinical application?
No. There are currently many researches focus on miRNA working as potential biomarkers for esophageal cancer. But none of them is fully demonstrated enough to be used clinically. The most popular research method is screening large number of miRNAs, measuring their expression level in subjects, and find possible relations. However, limited by time and expense, the sample capacity of these researches is not able to be large enough to represent the entirety. Thus the results of these researches have limitation. Even so, as statistics of each research accumulating, and human technology developing, biomarkers are a promising trend of disease detection.
What do you think about our project?
It’s a really interesting one. Your test paper can work as a preliminary screening of esophageal cancer high risk people, because it’s convenient and noninvasive. To do this, you need to ensure the sensitivity, not specificity, of the test paper. Though at present you may not be able to work out a test paper that can be used in clinically, it’s a very good idea, or concept.
The Result of Our Questionnaire
Q1: Our country(China) is one of the areas of high incidence of esophageal cancer in the world, there are more than ten million people died of esophageal cancer each year. Do you know the causes of esophageal cancer? (Nitrosamines and other chemical carcinogens, fungi, micronutrient deficiencies, poor diet, genetic factors, etc.)
Q2: Have you ever heard which poor eating habits are related to esophageal cancer? (Tobacco and alcohol addiction, swallowing hot or irritating esophagus excellent food, etc.)
Q3: Do you know how the hospital diagnose esophageal cancer? (Ultrasound, barium meal, endoscopy, etc.)
Q4: Do you know the symptoms of esophageal cancer? (Weight plummeted, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, indigestion, etc.)
Q5: If there is a strange feeling esophagus (such as dysphagia, pain, etc.), will you immediately go to the hospital to check it?
Q6: Which of the following is the main reason that you do not choose to go to the hospital to check?
Q7: How much would you like to pay for the test paper if it’s result is trustful?
Q8: Which of the following choice is the most acceptable one for you to diagnose cancer?

The team developed a better idea of how we are to make this software thanks to the advice and guidance from Professor Bhalerao.
Donny
I spent the week brainstorming possible ideas and applications of our project as well as researching some of the considerations we might need to account for. I also looked into what software tools have been made in the past to ensure originality of our design. We made a list of ""Donny's Crazy Ideas"" for the project. After a lot of brainstorming, we decided to stick with our original idea after all, but the planning process was very beneficial because it gave some direction on how to get started.
Im not sure what Nate thinks he will get by sucking up to me, but I don't trust him for a second.
Nate
Nate learned some fun basic stuff about Python.  Also, he looked into graphical options that we hope to use in the future in conjunction with our program with help from Kanishka.  Graphviz was the main application investigated, as well as the modules that would be needed to run it via Python, such as Pydot, Pygraphviz, and Networkx.  Not sure what Donny is talking about, given that the software has yet to be written.  However, he is very thankful to have Donny ""The Ultimate Programmer"" Amfahr on the team for his infinite knowledge and wisdom about programming and such.
Palak
I read papers by Dr. Price about constraint based modeling and the factors that need to be taken into account when genome-scale models are created. I also read another paper that described a program called COBRA that is used for constraint based modeling. I began learning how to program in python.

Introduction
The main aim of our project is to sequester cadmium in the environment into the spores of our engineered B. subtilis, but what happens after the cadmium has been sequestered?
Do we attempt to retrieve the sequestered cadmium? Or, do we simply leave the sequestered cadmium in the spores of our engineered B. subtilis?
For our project, we have chosen the latter. We will not be attempting to retrieve the sequestered cadmium. However, then comes the question of, would there not be chances of the cadmium entering the environment again?
Our solution to this question would be to disable germination of the spores, thus retrieval of the sequestered cadmium becomes unnecessary, as the spores can persist intact for thousands of years.
In order to disable germination of the spores, we would require non-germinating spores, and we were fortunate enough that Prof. Anne Moir from Sheffield University kindly sent us two non-germination spores, with inactivated genes, namely cwlD, and sleB and cwlJ.
While we would like to disable germination for the spores that contain sequestered cadmium, not all the cells would have sequestered cadmium, and it is also essential that we still have some cells germinating, so that our population of bacteria can continue to live and grow, reaching a balance, and not simply deplete totally.
Therefore, a mechanism is needed to allow us to choose to turn on germination, when the cell is not a ""metal container"".
Using the treatment protocol for the non-germination spores from Prof. Anne Moir, we performed lab experiments for the two"

Aim
The iGEM category Human Practices deals with informing and teaching the non-scientific public about synthetic biology. The main target of our sub-group is to include people of all ages, so every person gets to know the possibilities but also the risks of synthetic biology. Furthermore, we want to encourage them to deal with the advantages and disadvantages, to think critically and build up their own opinion.
Children & Teenagers
To ensure the scientific and technical progress, we think that it’s really important to raise children’s and young adults’ interest in Biology in order to facilitate the contact with Synthetic Biology. To reach this aim, we followed different approaches. In collaboration with iGEM FAU Erlangen, we designed the Game of Cells – a board game for children in kindergarten and primary school – which we presented at the summer fest of the local Max-Planck-Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology. In this game, the player starts with nothing and has to collect organelles to build up a whole cell. With every component you collect, its function is explained in comparison to a city (e.g. the cell membrane as analog to the city walls). To raise the tension in the game, the cells have to fight against each other, components can be stolen from other players and some organelles offer a big advantage in certain situations!
Figure 1: The preparation of the Game of Cells is running on full blast.
We also prepared a practical lesson with primary school students in which we performed some microscopy experiments as well as the extraction of DNA from paprika. The theoretical part included getting an understanding of the differences between living and non-living objects and facts about the general structure of cells and the human gut microbiota.
Figure 2: The primary school students we visited were pretty excited about performing their own experiments.
Furthermore, we wanted to give teenagers the chance to visit our laboratory and learn some basics about synthetic biology. We hence invited high school students from Blista, a school for visually impaired students in"

Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," the opportunity to collaborate with them. We have helped each other through continued mentorship and project guidance via video conference calls. FSU was also able to mail us two of their constructs BBa_K2367009 And BBa_K2367010 so that we could in vitro transcribe them in our transcription and translation system. We quickly learned from our first failed attempt at transcribing their constructs that their promoter was not compatible with our system. This helped us to realize a flaw in both our transcription and translation system as well as commercially available systems. After talking with FSU we decide that to better address the needs of synthetic biologist and make our system more dynamic we should look to incorporate native E.coli RNA polymerase into our system in the future.  Throughout our reiterative talks, we have both benefited immensely in being able to constantly design and refine our projects and goals."
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Project#Biosensors_-_-_TEXT.html," available in the registry. Early thoughts of mercury and arsenic testing proved to be unfeasible within the time constraints as our laboratory does not usually handle these materials and so was not already equipped for their use.
Copper BBa_K190024 and Zinc BBa_K190022 inducible promoters were selected from the registry, as they seemed promising, with our focus on the copper part as this was labelled as 'working' by the original team Groningen_09 . We have sadly been unable to replicate this result through our work over the summer. The capacity of metal ions to induce these promoters is highly dependent on the heavy metal transporter protein BBa_K190018 , also used by Groningen_09.
One of our initial concerns was that the system may not be compatible with B.subtilis as it was designed in E.coli. Tests in both species were unfavourable however. After several weeks with little success we sent these biobricks to Source Bioscience Ltd for sequencing. While we can now confirm the sequences of the inducible promoters, we found sequencing inconsistencies in the transport protein. This experience has been added to the parts registry.
These inconsistencies seem to have rendered the protein non-functional, or at least sufficiently less functional, and time shortages prevented us from looking for an alternative. As such we have been unable to test the capacities of these biobricks in relation to our system.

Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html,"0 for a booth at the Jamboree’s career fair (2015.iGEM.org, 2015). iGEM alum and co-founder and CEO of Caribou Biosciences Rachel Haurwitz told synthetic biology media company Synbiobeta that Caribou had success recruiting interns at the 2014 Jamboree and planned to do so again in 2015. This is because Haurwitz, who was named to Forbes’ Top 30 Under 30 (Herper, 2014), knows what an effect iGEM has on those who participate: “I was an iGEMer in 2005, and it definitely helped shape and fuel my own personal scientific curiousity,” (Chatsko, 2014). This sentiment is echoed by Steven ten Holder, former iGEM participant and co-founder and CEO of Acorn Cryotech, who described iGEM as “a place [he] knows [he] can recruit great talent,” (ten Holder, 2016) and noted that his co-founders are also iGEM alumni. Kevin Chen told us that his experience with iGEM helped him land a job at Synbiota immediately after graduating, a step on his path to co-founding Bricobio and Hyasynth Bio (Chen, 2016b).
Even if one does not get recruited at the Jamboree, engineering competitions like iGEM can still help turn skills into jobs. Shehata and Schwartz (2015) point out that that engineering competitions provide useful fodder for open-ended job interview questions and résumé enhancement, as well as industry contacts among sponsors and judges. Cheung et al. (2015) note that competitions provide a basis for external assessment of one’s abilities, particularly relative to one’s peers; it follows that if that external assessment is favourable, it will make a job applicant more attractive.
According to academic literature, iGEM confers myriad benefits on those who participate, including specific lab skills, transferable problem-solving skills, higher cognitive functioning and a better understanding of the social aspects of synthetic biology. These effects have been proven to exist when tested empirically, albeit according to self-reporting in surveys. One self-reported benefit that we can take at face value is a passion for science and research, which will increase the supply of professional synthetic biologists, benefiting greater society. Participation in iGEM also connects one to employers and boosts résumés. While tangible impacts of iGEM form the basis for the rest of this paper, iGEM"

Hypothesis 1: Cloning of cumate regulatory system gBlock into pSB1C3
The cumate regulatory system gBlock was amplified via PCR, digested with EcoRI and PstI, and ligated into the pSB1C3 iGEM backbone. The colony PCR performed on the transformed bacteria shows a band matching the size of the fragment (1909 bp). The purified plasmid was sent for sequencing. The results showed a mutation from a hydrophilic amino acid codon (R for arginine) to a hydrophobic one (L for leucine) in the sequence of the CymR regulatory protein; at position 498 of the sequence the nucleotide has mutated from G to T. The mutation appears not to affect the DNA binding site of the repressor according to protein databases. However, no information regarding the binding site of p-cumate was found.
The successful cloning was confirmed with colony PCR using prefix/suffix primers showing the amplification of an insert of the appropriate size, sequencing of the isolated plasmids from said culture (sequence contains a mutation from R to L, which does not affect the DNA-binding site, but it may affect the binding"

If we know the existence of a new kind of hazard, the use of new ways to prevent accidents or how to react in case they occurred, we can help to develop new security measures or apply them if necessary.
During our experimental work, we detected certain cultures which weren't reacting as expected. We caracterized those cultures and identified a mutatuion as the reason of this malfunction. Thus we continued our experiments using aliquots of the original stock culture, avoiding any problem that could arise if we kept using the mutants.  We want to highlight the importance of being on the alert and keeping a well preserved stock to turn to when things go wrong.
Characterization of biological material, is essential given the complexity of biological systems. The more we know about them, the safer we are. And it is important to know how well-studied those parts are. In particular, biobricks could be rated. The more tested and improved by other teams, the more trustworthy they are, so they could be better ranked. This could be added to the “Experience page” of each construction.

Business plan - Nutrition Generator
Give a man some food, and you feed him for a day, give a man a Nutrition Generator and you feed him for a lifetime
Edible coli is a fantastic bacteria that can be used for many purposes and benefit many people. However, it  can be difficult to understand the basic idea behind the innovative bacteria without explaining it with a final  product. Therefore, we have written a business plan, describing one of the many possible end products  Edible coli can be used for. This business plan explains the implementations of our idea by outlining the  amazing food tank: Nutrition Generator.
Please note that the GMO (Gene Modified Organism) legislation does not allow the production and  marketing of a Nutrition Generator, as it is not allowed to sell edible gene modified bacteria.

As we used antibiotics and transition metal salts, we had to determine their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) before effectively using them. Fortunately, we worked with experienced researchers who are familiar with antibiotics concentrations commonly used in labs. Then, we were taught that we should use these concentrations :
Ampiciline : 250µg/mL
Kanamycine : 50µg/mL
Vancomycine : 3µg/mL
Concerning our transition metal salts, we conducted experiments to assess the effect of different concentrations of NiCl2 or ZnCl2 in our bacteria growth medium. We tested the following concentrations for both salts : 2mM, 1mM, 0.5mM, 0.25mM and 0.1mM
We selected the highest concentration at which no toxicity could be observed through the experiment, 0.25mM for both salts. We used this concentration for all manipulations onwards.
Control of the basic material :
Plasmids (pIV* and pIV WT)
The pPro30 vector is used for the expression of the wild-type and the mutated pIV porin. The insertion of the gene is performed in the multiclonal site downstream of the PprpB promoter. Selection pressure is provided by the ampicillin resistance gene (AmpR). The propionate operon promoter, PprpB, is regulated by the positive regulator, prpR. This system induces the expression of the porin in the presence of propionate (0,5 mM) and suppresses the expression when adding glucose (1%).
Figure 1: Representation of the pPro30 vector used for the expression of the pIV porin
Analysis of the pIV WT and PIV* constructs
To check the quality of these constructs, we performed a restriction reaction with HindIII. This restriction enzyme is expected to give 2 fragments when cutting the plasmids, one at 3917bp and the other at 2789bp (see figure 1).
As expected, we obtained these two bands for each construct after restriction (see figure 2).

Design:
Selection of chassis organisms:
The choice of chassis organisms is very important to our entire experiment. It determines not only the feasibility of our experiment, but also the difficulty of our experiment. We chose the chassis organism as Nissle e. coli because its genetic manipulation is relatively simple and it is also a intestinal probiotics without damage to the host. The exocrine system of Nissle e. coli is relatively mature, and some breakthroughs have been made in recent years [1,2]. Therefore, Nissle e. coli is one of the most promising engineered strains currently used to deliver proteins to host cells. This is also why we choose Nissle e. coli.
The plasmid we use is pet-22b. We commissioned CPT to synthesize our gene fragment at the polyclonal site of pet-22b and used Amp resistance genes on the plasmid to screen our transformed strains. We initially used the BL21 escherichia coli strain to express our protein and used the dh5-e escherichia coli strain to store our plasmids.
Signal peptide selection:
In order to successfully secrete our uric acid oxidase outside the cells, we used 4 different signal peptides for secretion experiment, and selected the signal peptides with the best secretion effect to be added into the sequence. We used the signal peptides to deliver GFP and measured the fluorescence data of GFP to compare the effects of 4 different signal peptides.
We decided to use 4 signal peptides (OpmA, PeLB, phoA, STiI) for secretion test, and designed the following 5 sequences to test our secretion system:
1.Sac I-Uric acid oxidase-Sal I；
2.Nde I-OpmA-Sac I-GFP-Sal I-TAT-Terminator-Hind III；
3.Nde I-PeLB-Sac"

The roles that microorganisms play in souring of oil wells, as well as the roles they play in industrial corrosion were also covered.  The breakdown of coal, oil and gas by microorganisms was examined and shown to be very significant. Of particular interest was the concept of microbial enhanced oil recovery and real data showing that by giving the microorganisms in oil wells adequate nutrients, one could recover a considerable amount of extra oil in a very economically viable manner.
Attending the ISMOS3 conference proved to be a valuable experience for Murray and Kayla, as it was their first scientific conference. The scientists presenting their research at the conference were personable and knowledgeable. The poster sessions provided a great opportunity for learning. The conference was an excellent overview on the large scale effect that microorganisms have on our environment, the magnitude of their diversity as well as the enormous potential that synthetic biology could play in the future of the coal and oil industries.

aGEM is a mock iGEM competition held by Alberta Innovates     Technology Futures (AITF). It was held this year in Edmonton,     Alberta at AITF headquarters from Saturday September 24th     to Sunday September 25th. Four teams were in attendance: the     University of Lethbridge team, the University of Calgary team,     the University of Alberta team, and one representative from     the University of British Columbia. On the Saturday the teams     gave presentations of their projects to the other teams and a     panel of distinguished judges. The judges gave critiques and     advice on how to improve the presentations for the iGEM regional     competition. On the Sunday students had small     group sessions with the judges and other experts to disscuss how     to better achieve at iGEM, and how to become more involved in     synthetic biology, and scientific research in general, in the     future. These experts included:

MntA transport
Yu Zhong and Xiaojun Cai were responsible for the combination of constitutive promoter added in front of the MntA protein with the double terminator behind. After that, they just tested the parameters of the relationship of the concentration of cadmium out and in the E.coli. They spent all their summer holiday finishing it.
Cadmium adsorption
Ruiming Xiao, Xiaojing Li and Jionghui Li managed CsgA transport part. Ruiming Xiao and Xiaojing Li was in charge of the construction of PcadA +CsgA-EC(n)+TetR+RFP+ter. Jionghui Li also made efforts to assist both of them. Ruiming Xiao made brilliant contributions and devoted himself to testing the MerR/CadA operon using red fluorescent protein and he also helped Li to measure the AU of the RFP. As for Xiaojing Li, she was diligent and she made great efforts to construct different number of EC protein in order to find the best one. Also, because of deleting the wild CsgA will help efficiently express EC, So Minghui Deng and Yulong Zhang were responsible for the CsgA deletion.
Sensor system
Xiaomei Lin and Xunxun Luo buried themselves in this part. They just made the device such as Ptet+cjblue+ter. And also, Xiaomei Lin had finished the measurement work with the help of Xiaojing Li. In addition, combining with the device of CsgA transport system, Li and Lin successfully tested the fluorescent protein and checked if the system worked.
Design work
Yihong Gu, Shuoyu Chen, Jiahui Zhang and Yunan Lin had undertaken all the tasks of designing of the whole team. They did a lot work including logo, ppt templates, wiki and uniforms. Taking step by step, as a result of clarified division and efficient cooperation, they sophisticatedly design uniforms and posters for the IGEM."

To verify this we ran a variety of different single output configurations on a 96 well plate, using color and fluorescence as markers.
We created two initial configurations on the 96-well plate using colored water as a preliminary run. The first is of two simple blue circles and the second is the phrase “igem”. The sample volume in each well was 0.0479 mL.
After testing the system with colored water, we ran a single output microfluidic chip with GFP to obtain quantitative measurements. We created an output design of a smiley-face and verified the selection locations by running the plate in a plate reader. As shown in the diagram, the GFP mixture is appropriately dispensed onto the well-plate.
Fully Automated
Automation for TERRA is key because it reduces human error and frees up time for the researcher. Manual selection between outputs on the TERRA Adapter reduces the efficiency of the overall run because it not only requires the user to be on standby but introduces variable pressure differentials on chip during actuation. To automate TERRA, a control syringe system is used to select and redirect outputs on the TERRA Adapter, which is especially important for multi-output chips. To verify that TERRA is fully automated, we ran multi-output microfluidic chips. However, due to manufacturing issues with our microfluidic chips and lack of time, we could not run a multi-output chip on TERRA.

The Theory
Mixing in microfluidics occurs in two ways: via diffusion or the introduction of turbulence. In order to encourage mixing in a microfluidics chip, one must induce it in either or both ways.
Firstly, diffusion is the movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. For instance, when the blood and stock solution are flowing side by side, lipocalin would move from the blood into the stock solution since there is higher a concentration of lipocalin in the blood as compared to the stock solution. This also holds true for the siderophore-iron complexes, which diffuse from the stock solution into the blood. Over time, there is an equal concentration of reagents on both sides and thus the solutions are mixed. In order to increase the rate of diffusion and hence mixing, the distance that the particles need to diffuse across needs to be shortened by minimising the width of the channel. For the protocol
used, the minimum width that is feasible is 0.5 mm.
Introducing turbulence encourages mixing much like how stirring liquid in a mug helps to mix the contents.There are two types of flow: laminar and turbulent. Laminar flow is when the liquid particles travel in an orderly manner parallel to the channel length and in a single direction. The velocity of the liquid can be represented well using equations. In turbulent flow, the direction and speed at which each particle moves is unpredictable. The Reynolds number quantifies whether a flow is laminar or turbulent1. It is defined as follows, where a higher Reynolds number indicates a more turbulent regime.
With respect to the lengths of a microfluidics chip (maximum 10 cm) , viscosity (3.5 × 10−3 Pa.s) and density (1060 kg/M3) of blood, the Reynolds number is around 102, which indicates laminar flow with minimal turbulence. The viscosity and density of blood remains constant throughout the test and the velocity cannot be easily controlled. However, the flow can be made more turbulent by increasing the length of the channel.
The Design Ideas
Design 1: The Capillary Stop Valve Idea
The initial design for mixing is shown in figure 4. Due to the surface tension of the liquid, the stock solution contained within the middle chamber would not flow out into the main channel. This design is called a capillary stop valve and has been shown to work in literature3. The flow of liquid from the middle channel can only be initiated when the blood sample flows past it.

SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Applet_-_-_TEXT.html," is currently no platform for normal publicity and exposure to synthetic biology in the country. The public has little understanding of synthetic biology, and they naturally contradict this product. In this way, when our project is going to conduct extensive public research, it is also difficult.
To solve these problems, we intend to increase communication and exchanges of the participants and create a new systematic HP platform.
Introduction
It is a software that is installed on the chat software WeChat (a software used by almost everyone in China). Our applet integrates the advantages of WeChat. So you don’t need to download another app. While using our software, you can also chat with friends, purchase movie tickets, play mini games and so on. It is a new-concept software that can be used regardless of the system’s mobile phone.
It has three core competencies:
Sharing and communication
Popular science platform
Timely feedback & Team promotion
Progress of Applet
Motivation
For the reasons above and with the functions mentioned, our applet contribute to public engagement and the iGEM projects in the following points:
1. We hope this will be the HP platform for iGEMers, providing a platform for online communication and collaboration between teams, and get public participation and feedback for project improvement.
From the perspective of the entrants, each iGEM team is in the process of conceiving and selecting topics at the beginning of the competition. Compared with traditional cross-regional meetings and exchanges, we hope that each team can communicate more conveniently and on time online, no longer limited by geography and time. Receive feedback and suggestions from within the various IGEM teams to achieve timely sharing and communication.
Most iGEM projects are linked to the actual situation, and the details and scope of application need to be adjusted in time during the experiment. This requires timely identification of the group targeted by the project, allowing potential users to participate in our projects. Product experience, testing and feedback from online to offline. We continually correct and adjust our projects based on their feedback.
2. We hope that the iGEM team will not only stop at the iGEM competition, but also find follow-up support and motivation in this platform, continue to improve the project, and truly let synthetic biology benefit humanity.
For the iGEM team, many of their projects are stopped at iGEM and rarely progressed. The reason may be that the system is not mature enough to find sufficient financial support. We hope that the iGEM team on this platform will be able to find like-minded teammates who also have a deep understanding of certain projects or have professional knowledge. Through the"

2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Aside from general safety issues, none of the new BioBrick parts raises any particular safety issues; they are all well-known biological parts implemented in the best known (and safe) lab bacterium and budding yeast. That is because the different components of the constructions (promoters, protein products…) are highly used in molecular biology. Moreover, the protein obtained under the variety of conditions are not toxic, and they are widely known and commonly used in different types of studies (since the Green Fluorescent Protein was discovered the scientists have been improving it in order to get fluorescent proteins based in the original GFP but with better characteristics).
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
There is not a specific biosafety group either committee at our Institute Cavanilles of València University to evaluate how safe our project is, but we have specific contacts in our iGEM team that are on bioethics and biosafety boards. For example, Manel Porcar, our main supervisor is in the national committee of biosafety. Moreover, among the audience of the projection of the short film in Norway there are members and ex-members of Norwegian and European ethics committees.   In addition member of the ethical committee of the Clinical Hospital of València, took part in the debate. To read her letter, click here .
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Fortunately, whenever safety and security protocols are properly followed, environmental, researcher and public safety are well protected (unless, of course, the damage caused was impossible to predict by the current human knowledge). However, accidents may occur. This could carry undesired or even tragic consequences. Therefore, it is our responsibility as researchers to identify, describe and characterize all the biological and laboratory material we are working with, as well as the facilities and all the interactions between these elements in order to minimize the risk of any unwanted situation.
In order to reach this goal, we believe that communication is essential. This is one of the reasons behind our short movie “Talking Life”, one of the goals of which was to promote critical dialogue on the safety of synthetic organisms and mutants arising from them. Learning about the experiences experienced by other groups in security issues could also help preventing dangerous situations. If we know the existence of a new kind of hazard, the use of new ways"

Additionally, further mutations to residues can be used to enhance the binding of the protein with the various types of autoinducers to generate specificity for different strains of bacteria.

I am the leader of the biofilm group at the INRA Micalis Institute. I have focused my research on microbial biofilms present in the food chain with special emphasis on their role in the persistence of pathogens. One of my main scientific line of interest is to identify the link between the 3D spatial organization of biofilms and the survival mechanisms of cells in face to the exposition of antimicrobials. Recently, my team reported that a tiny proportion of certain Bacillus species can tunnel through biofilms, creating pores that allow molecules to flow in. We are now evaluating the industrial benefit to pretreat target biofilms with swimming Bacilli cocktails to increase their efficacy and reduced their ecological impact.

Hi everybody, here is Chambix!! I just graduated from the INSA Lyon in Biotechnologies but after two participations at the iGEM Competition, I couldn’t do anything but continue my studies with a master in bioinformatics. After two years working in the lab for the team, I came back this year trying to help out the new team, sharing my experiences. Actually, they didn’t really need my help. They’ve done a great job with Bacillix. And for sure you’ll have to deal with them in Amsterdam and Boston.

In order to minimize this risk, every student is required to wear special heat-stable and thick gloves. Since Antibiotics encourage the emergence of resistant microorganisms (Bacteria and Fungi), adequate precautions were taken to minimize the chances of the same. The concentrations of the antibiotics used in this project are relatively low and steps were taken to minimize exposure; to both the skin as well as general work environment. As it is necessary to guarantee emergency service; therefore there are always two or more students present in the laboratory for the same. Additionally, during the S1 security briefing, we were introduced to the emergency eye shower system and shown the emergency exits. The risk of a fire through the Bunsen burner is very low. In case of a fire, an alarm signal would start immediately.
2. Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
The chances of any biological material to escape from the laboratory are none, because all biological materials are disposed of separately after proper inactivation. The strain of E. coli used DH5alpha was developed in the laboratory, for laboratory cloning procedures.
3. Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
The biological wastes disposed, do not pose any threat to the environment, since they are autoclaved as per instructions and disposed in suitable containers. Moreover, the bacterial strain we use (E.coli DH5alpha) for genetic engineering applications like cloning was developed in the laboratory, for laboratory cloning procedures, and therefore has no 'natural' environment or habitat as it does not exist in nature. It is also incapable of transferring its genetic material to other bacteria in case if it is accidentally released into the environment.
4. Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
We are currently working with cDNA/RNA of S1 and S2 level organisms cloned in E.coli DH5alpha and protein parts expressed exogenously in S.cerevisae. These organisms or the protein parts are not a threat to the environment or to humans. In infinitesimal chance of malicious misuse by individuals, groups or countries, the organisms / parts do not pose any security risk as they are not in anyways toxic/pathogenic to humans or the environment.
5. What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
Safe lab practices and strict safety measures are followed in the lab. All biological materials are disposed of separately in special waste containers after proper inactivation by sterilization"

Meet Ronja Kothe
Hello! I’m Ronja Kothe, a student at Winston Churchill High School. This is my second year in iGEM and I have had an amazing time. I joined iGEM because I find the field of synthetic biology very fascinating. I also want to gain more experience in lab work, which is my favourite aspect of iGEM. However, the Human Practices component of iGEM interests me very much as well. In the future I would like to continue to perform experiments and venture out into the biomedical field. In addition to iGEM, I also enjoy playing the clarinet and going camping with my fellow Girl Guides.

My name is Jessica Semmelrock. I am seventeen years old. Art and science interest me, which is why I plan to continue studying the subjects in post secondary. I joined the Lethbridge iGEM team because of the unique experience it offers. The opportunity came up a short while after I discovered what synthetic biology is and I was psyched to learn more. It is incredible that a team of high school students and a few advisors can create innovative solutions to world problems. I love getting involved in various activities, including sports, volunteering, and visual arts. A belief I hold close is that learning is the best part of any activity, which makes IGEM all the better.

ProtoChat
ProtoChat is a messaging service built into ProtoCat to allow users to contact one another directly, as opposed to leaving comments on a protocol. Users have their own inboxes, where they can keep track of messages as they arrive, and respond to them. This can be used to communicate between collaborators of a protocol, or between researchers in order to share ideas prior to publishing them to ProtoCat.
Protocols.io Import Tool
     To read more about our import tool, please check out our Human Practices Gold page.
Visual Protocol History
     ProtoCat enables users to 'version control' their protocols; anyone can create a variant of a protocol and make modifications as they see fit. However, once multiple revisions are made, and the subsequent tree of protocol revisions gets unruly, it can be quite difficult to figure out which version one should be using. In ProtoCat 3.0, the only way to navigate through a set of protocols was to do it one level at a time, which was incredibly arduous and hard to keep track of. To address this issue, we have created a way for a user to view the history of protocols visually to make navigating to the best version of a protocol as efficient as possible.
     Protocol nodes are color coded from red (1 star) to green (5 star), and are transparent should they be hidden from search. These visual cues, in addition to the tree diagram,  makes finding a well-written, tested protocol much easier. On hover, a user can see the title, author, and change log of that specific version of a protocol.
Favorite Protocols
     ProtoCat allows users to find protocols for a variety of disciplines, and gives easy access through an online catalog. However, a Primary Investigator may want his/her students to only use specific protocols that are, for example, optimized to the equipment in the lab. This PI could send everyone in the lab a link to the protocol that should be used, but what if a new version of the protocol becomes available? In addition, every time the PI finds a new protocol, it needs to be sent out to everyone in the lab. To address this, we have built a favorites system into ProtoCat, which allows users to signify a select set of ""favorite protocols"". Now"

Questionnaire
public views on allergen testing
Introduction
A questionnaire survey that aims to investigate public views on allergen testing has been done at the first stage of our project, which also made a contribution to finding the stakeholder and potential users of the products we developed. The questionnaire is designed carefully, as it spreads in social networks. However, it is a pity that we can run more statistical tests to estimate the characteristics of the population as we do not have an unbalanced and random-sampling sample. Whereas we use biased sampling method, the analysis of results indeed gives us hints about how to improve our project and help us to find the proper application field.
Objective
To investigate the popularity of allergen testing in public
To find out the people's views on the allergen testing the have done
To find the stakeholders and potential users of our projects
Improve our project and design Human Practice activities by analyzing the survey results
Methodology
Convenience Sampling
The convenience sampling is simple and easy to do. With this method, we can timely access to required information, saving the time and fund. From the point of view of convenience, investigators randomly selected a certain number of samples within the scope of the survey object for investigation. However, in practice, not all individuals in the population are the same, so the sampling results deviation is large, the credibility is low and the sample does not have enough representativeness. As we know little about the population that has got an allergen testing, in this survey we use convenience sampling at first to test our questionnaire and gets the basic data, which let us have a preliminary understanding of the respondents.
Snowball Sampling
Snowball sampling refers to interviewing randomly selected respondents and then asking them to recommend subjects that accord with the overall characteristics of the study objectives. This method can control the sample according to some sample characteristics and is suitable for finding some respondents who are very rare in the whole. This method can greatly increase the possibility of contacting the survey group, with relatively low funds and strong feasibility. In this survey"

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Our Project#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html,". transcription factor- DNA binding) has a direct impact on the amount and speed of lysing
We ran a platereader experiment with multiple cultures, each culture containing a plasmid with a different T7 promoter mutant driving the lysis cassette. Induction with IPTG shows that having different promoters results in varying lysis strengths and speeds. This approach with promoter mutants supplies an alternate way of showing that favorable transcription-factor mutants will lyse cells more rapidly and efficiently then their peers. The resulting supernatant will therefore contain a proportionally high number of the better TF mutant DNA, which can be recovered and sequenced.
Characterisation
We decided to work with TetR, as a proof-of concept trascription factor characterization. We characterised our mutants both in vitro and in vivo. We started by testing the wild-type and went on with some of our 12 TetR mutants. The strategy we used consisted of:
1) producing interesting TetR mutants
The mutants were created by site-specific and PCR-induced mutagenesis. Based on the literature, we introduced point mutations at key amino acids involved in DNA recognition, in an attempt to alter the specificity of the TetR mutants.
2) determining the binding energy landscape of each mutants
This is the in vitro characterization, which was performed thanks to a microfluidic chip. The technique, called MITOMI, allows parallel testing of one mutant with 756 different DNA sequences. The absolute binding energy is then measured, and an enoLOGO is generated.
3) determining the binding of each mutant to the wild-type TetO sequence in vivo
For this characterization step, we set up a reporter construct: TetR constitutively expressed and RFP with a wild-type Ptet promoter, as you can see on the illustration below. The more RFP is expressed in the cells, the less the TetR mutant recognizes Ptet.
We ran platereader experiments for 6 of our mutants. Increasing concentrations of ATC were added to force expression of RFP, which allowed us to appreciate the repressive effect of TetR on fluorescence expression. The following graph shows wild-type TetR characterization. Increasing ATC concentrations do lead to increased fluorescence, which confirms that tetR was initially repressing RFP:
4) comparing the results of both characterization
Three of our mutants plus the wild-type were tested both in vivo and in vitro. The results were consistent between the two experiments. The V36F exhibits the same behaviour as the wild-type while the P39K shows no interaction to the DNA at all. The E37A triple mutant, however, has contradictory"
