DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ene pathway, we introduced 2 more genes - crtYB and crtI, and they catalyze 4 new reactions. These reactions are introduced into the GSM as below: 3
phytoeneSynthase (crtYB): 2.0 geranylgeranyl diphosphate < --> 2.0 diphosphate + 2.0 H+ + phytoene
caroteneDesaturaseStep1 (crtI):  phytoene <--> 6.0 H+ + neurosporene
caroteneDesturaseStep2 (crtI): neurosporene <--> lycopene + 2.0 H+
lycopeneCyslase (crtYB): lycopene --> beta-carotene + 2.0 H+
To be able to optimize beta-carotene product flux, we must define a sink, or demand reaction in the GSM, this is done by creating a boundary exchange reaction where beta-carotene is, in silico, secreted into extracellular space, this reaction is defined as:
DM_bcarotene: beta-carotene →
DM_bcarotene is then set consequently as objective function when optimizing for production flux.
Using FSEOF to Identify Gene Amplification and Inhibition Targets to Optimize Yield
Any organism will, by its evolutionary nature, maximize growth rate. As bioengineers however, we want a maximum of desired products while keeping a reasonable growth rate. Therefore we want an organism that is optimized for both growth rate and product yield. We do this by manipulating its genes, forcing product yield and growth rate to go hand-in-hand. In other words, we want an engineered strain that, in order to maximize its growth rate, it must also produce the desired product. This is called coupling of product yield to growth rate. In our study, we couple beta-carotene yield to growth rate, and find out what genes should be amplified, inhibited, or knocked out, to achieve this coupling. This can be done by manipulating the genes, changing the flux bounds of certain reactions, to force the overall flux distribution towards the optimal solution.
We can also use constraints to reflect the effect of gene manipulation. As genes are defined and associated to reactions and metabolites in the GSM, we can simulate gene amplification, inhibition, and KOs, by giving the flux associated with that gene a value larger, smaller, or zero value, respectively.
We used FSEOF to identify gene amplification targets.

We were made to understand that there exists cases where there is a surplus of grains, especially at the peak time of harvest in May, and in cases of “BUMPER-HARVESTS” where the grain storage capacity of all the store houses get exhausted.
This results in storehouses  Being forced to leave the grains in unscientific warehouses and even in the open. In these cases, it becomes extremely important to protect the grains from rodent infestation and that is exactly where TOMCAT comes out to play. Our stakeholders raised their concern that in the situations where TOMCAT is kept in the open, windy conditions, its effect would drastically reduce, which we believe is a genuine concern to tackle. Therefore, we plan to target the use of TOMCAT in the temporary shelters used by the large corporation at the time of surplus grain hold and in farmers' individual grain reserves. We wish to implement the industrial scale BioReactor to mass-produce our genetic engineering product and circulate it in the form of Spray tanks to smoothly and gradually replace environmentally harmful Chemical Sprays.

Technion_Israel,2016,Team:Technion Israel#Modifications#EstoTar_-_-_TEXT.html," a 3D model was made using the Phyre2 Fold Recognition server (3).  Later, in order to confirm the correct localization at both poles of the bacterial membrane (4), a GFP reporter protein was fused to the hERα-Tar chimera and tested with fluorescence microscopy.
Finally, a “Chip Microscope assay” was conducted to study the effects of 17- β-estradiol on the chemotaxis system of the UERT strain. In short, a suspension of the UERT strain was added to an ibidi microchannel chip, and the bacterial concentration was monitored in a fixed point for the whole experiment, as the estradiol was added to the channel.
Results
The 3D structure of the hERα-Tar, as can be seen in figure 1, clearly indicates an incorrect folding of the HAMP region, and thus an overall incorrect structure. Nevertheless, the rest of the tests were conducted in hope for successful results.

b.

The results of the fluorescence microscopy were not promising either. That is due to the fact that           although the GFP was expressed, the signal indicated that the chimera failed to localize at the           poles and stayed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). In other words, in case the chimera is expressed it           probably will not be localized to the membrane, and thus the chemotaxis system will not function correctly.

Despite the discouraging results from the GFP assay we attempted to conduct the “Chip microscope assay” to test for any real time response. Our first tests ended abruptly as we discovered that the estrogenic solution kills the bacteria almost immediately.
Later, we concluded that the solvent that was used to dissolve the compound, 17-β-estradiol, was lethal for the bacteria. Since this is a hydrophobic substance, it is only possible to dissolve it in hydrophobic solvents, such as Ethanol or DMSO, which are lethal for bacteria. When the stock solution of 17-β-estradiol in DMSO, was diluted to a concentration that was not lethal for the bacteria - 0.1% DMSO content, no signs of response were visible.

Wed, June 12: Sravanti and I came up with a new design, influenced by UML, that utilizes a tree visualization of rule creation, and Orit absolutely loves it. I think this design is more of what the biologists are looking for, but I'm still pretty attached to our game-ified icon design. We spent today simulating Eugene's built-in rules and Swapnil's rule examples with both of our implementations to make sure that our visual languages were expressive enough to cover everything that's needed. Now that we've come up with two solid rule creation models, our next problem to tackle is how to visualize query results; there can be anywhere from one to thousands of search results, so we need to figure out how to show this without overwhelming the user. It sounds relatively simple, but it's actually a formidable problem.
Some examples of our icon design
Thur, June 13: There isn't much to report on for today; every team spent all day today preparing for tomorrow's brainstorming session with the BU team. The Eugene DeSyne team worked on making handouts and poster prototypes of our preliminary designs, which meant I got to bust out my old Intuos 3 tablet to draw up some examples for our icon design.
Fri, Jun 14: We had our brainstorming session with BU today, and it was extremely helpful. Among other things, we got to practice our public speaking skills (which still need work, but were vastly improved compared to our last presentations) and received some valuable feedback from our BU counterparts. They all seemed to like the idea of integrating both the tree and the icon designs to create some kind of hybrid design that utilized both visualizations; in addition, it became clear that we have to restructure our designs to work at a higher level. Basically, we've been designing our visualization assuming that synthetic biologists will be working on what we call ""Level 0"" (working with specific promoters, genes, RBS's to make transcriptional units), when in fact they want to work on the ""Level 2"" domain (working with series of transcriptional units to form devices). I anticipate making some major changes to our work when we come back in on Monday.
Week 4: June 17 - June 21
Mon, June 17: WE GOT TO START CODING TODAY!! Hooray! As somebody who briefly but seriously considered art school and/or a studio art major, I thought I'd enjoy the design process a lot more, but to be honest, it's beginning"

Pre-Summer
Meeting 1
On our very first meeting, we had a brain storm about possible projects. The first ideas can be seen on the mind map below.
Meeting 2
On our second meeting we tried to refine the ideas and come up with more possible projects.
Meeting 3
After doing some further reading, we narrowed some of the topics down.
Meeting 4
At this meeting we discussed the possibility of our team participating at the St. Andrews annual outreach event during the NSEW (National Science and Engineering Week) between the 11th and 20th of March.
“National Science & Engineering Week shines the spotlight each March on how the sciences and engineering relate to our everyday lives and helps to inspire the next generation of scientists with fun and participative activities.” from British  Science  Association
The plan was to tell children about the functions of specific sections of DNA – promoters, ribosome binding sites etc., and create a simple game which could enhance their understanding of genetics. We decided on using mega-blocks of different shapes to represent a promoter, a ribosome binding site, a gene and a terminator and allow the children to put the pieces together in the correct order to make a “bio-brick”.
Meeting 5
For the NSEW event we decided to use a poster and instructional cards to aid in our ability to help children understand the functions of different segments of DNA. After a lot of deliberation, we came up with the following poster.
Meeting 6
At this meeting we discussed the idea of using apoptosis as a means of drug delivery and thus using the cell as a factory for drug creation. We realized, however, that the destruction of the cell's organelles and components upon apoptosis may lead to the destruction of the drug.  We then discussed other means of transport of the drug such as a pump that could release the drug molecules when it encounters an environmental trigger such as pH.
We also discussed contacting members from last years’ St. Andrews iGEM team to familiarize ouselves with various laboratory procedures that we would use over the summer.
For our next meeting we decided to do some research into whether the pump"
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#14 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," the items for each activity are more specific to that single activity as well as scientifically accurate, including the names for each specific PCR. I will be completing bacterial transformation after I brainstorm questions.
I also have to go back to the water bath script and incorporate it into the activities as well because as of now it is just a stand-alone activity. All I will have to do is change the names of what is added and given to and from the water bath respectively and this also means modifying phosphatase treatment. I am also beginning to make more visual instructions for restriction digest. So far sections that are explained will flash as instructions for that specific section are given. I would like to expand on this later this week.

Colony PCR (cPCR) of Pqrr4+I13500
Unlike the R0040 promoter driving the expression of I13500, Pqrr4 promoter is not constitutive, so it cannot be tested visually. Since I do not have any overnight cultures to perform Restriction Digest as of now, the only method I can use today is cPCR. 3 colonies were chosen, and 2 different sets of primers were used: BBK CP F/R primers and Pqrr4 F and BBK CP R. The following is a picture of the gel:
Only colony 3 seemeed to have worked. Pqrr4+I13500 is about 1013bp, and because biobrick primers anneal outside of the circuit (adding about 250 more base pairs), it seems to match the band in the lane of colony 3. Since I only tried 3 colonies, tomorrow, I will pick more and perform another cPCR.

Second Life Lab & Interview
Continued scripting DNA extraction. I learned how to rotate objects in scripts, which requires conversion of a quaternion scale to vectors (which I still don’t really get). Anyways, it works, mostly, up to the point where different buffers are eluted through the cartridge to get rid of debris not taken care of by RNAse resuspension fluid or proteinase K. I am still figuring out a way to ensure that it only works if the buffers are added in the correct order. Also, I am considering eliminating the centrifugation step between each elution, because that makes it a very complicated activity.
Stefan and I found some information about Pathfinder Linden, the guy responsible for promotion and helping educational areas in Second Life. We will hopefully be going to his office hour (which starts at 8:30 am) next week to talk to him."

Slovenia,2012,Team:Slovenia#TheSwitchDesignedTALregulators_-_-_TEXT.html," of inhibition of reporter expression. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with NicTAL repressors under CMV promoter (50 ng), and firefly luciferase reporter plasmids (Figure 3C) with different number of NicTAL binding sites upstream of the CMV promoter (100 ng). Luciferase activity was measured 3 days post-transfection. The experiment was executed in threebiological replicates and repeated three times with similar results.
Designed activators
Figure 7. Schematic representation of activation experiments. (A) In the absence of a TAL activator, there is no expression of the reporter gene. (B) When TAL activator is present, it binds to its DNA-binding site upstream of the minimal promoter and activates transcription of the reporter gene.
Due to the mechanism of action of the VP16 domain and our previous results with TAL:KRAB repressors (Figure 5, position of the effector domain does not influence repression); we decided to test only the C-terminal variant of the TAL:VP16 fusion (Figure 3A). Both tested TAL activators exhibited over 1500-fold activation of the mCitrine reporter at reporter to activator ratios 1:2. In addition, we confirmed that the minimal promoter used to drive the expression of the reporter gene shows no (or minimal) leakiness - this trait makes this promoter an excellent element for genetic systems, where tight transcriptional regulation is needed.
Figure 8. TAL activators strongly activate the reporter gene expression. The number of DNA-binding sites specific for NicTAL12:KRAB repressor dictates the efficiency of inhibition of reporter expression. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with TAL activator constructs under the CMV promoter (different quantities, for ratios see the x axis), and mCitrine reporter plasmids (Figure 3B) containing 10 copies of binding sites for the designated TAL activator upstream of a minimal promoter (50 ng). Along with the tested constructs we transfected cells with 20 ng of mCherry fluorescent protein under the CMV promoter as transfection control. Fluorescence was measured three days post-transfection. All experiments were executed in 3 biological replicates and repeated three times with similar results.

KEVIN LI
Hey! As the text above me says, I'm Kevin. I am a current Senior and this is my second year on Lambert's iGEM team. I work mainly on the Wiki, and this team is like a second family to me. All of its members care for each other and wish to see one another succeed. iGEM has also given me countless opportunities in which I can immerse myself in genetic engineering. When you don’t see me buried in a pile of homework or in the lab, I can usually be found in the middle of an episode of The Office or hanging out with friends.

SAI METTUPALLI
When you first see Sai, you probably will ask him either what middle school he goes to...or how tall he is because he looks very much like a kid. But when you actually meet him, you figure out that he’s even more childish than he looks! :) In case you haven't already been introduced to your supreme leader, Sai Mettupalli, this is his first year on the iGEM team as a sophomore. His joking manner and tenacious attitude makes situations light-hearted and cheers everyone up. But, he knows when to be serious and is often referred to as “The epitome of leadership”. He is passionate about 3D printing, debate, music, medicine, and with everything he does, he is successful because of his hard work. Outside of his love for change, you can probably find him playing a game of fortnite or watching a marvel movie for the fiftieth time. With this balance in his life, Sai hopes to become a doctor in the future, so he can forever change the lives of people around him.

Research almost always involves collaboration,  this is why it is so essential for progress. In the scientific fields especially, collaborations spread all over the world and this can be easily noticed when looking at the number of co-authors of a paper. iGEM Grenoble-Alpes team, guided by this ideal, first collaborated on a small scale, with its own team members, to give birth to innovative ideas, resulting in SnapLab. On a larger scale, iGEM Grenoble-Alpes team collaborated with other 2017 teams.
Collaborations are fun!
Collaborations are fun and awesome! Especially when it comes to participating to a discussion with 5 other iGEM teams. In fact, we had a discussion about social responsibility towards the scientific progress with iGEM DTU-Denmark , iGEM Wageningen , iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec , iGEM TECHNION-ISRAEL and iGEM Uppsala which hosted and organised the debate. Prior the debate, iGEM Uppsala sent us multiple questions to further think about the subject so it could be more constructive.  After introducing our projects to the other teams, the idea was to discuss on how to prevent safety related problems. It is crucial to realise that even when working on a project in the iGEM context, social responsibility needs to be considered. It is not because we are in a contest atmosphere that we can forget about putting our project into their contexts and working on the social and ethical issues they might bring.
In the end, we learned a lot from the other teams: each country has its own regulations and might think differently. Hence, this cultural aspect has to be considered as well. We would like to thank iGEM Uppsala for organising this debate it was a lot of fun!

Helping honey bees and beekeepers with BeeT
How would BeeT work in the real world? Who would use it and how would they use it? More importantly, how can we ensure BeeT is embraced? To explore these questions, we sought out experts, beekeepers and designers. They helped us prepare BeeT for real life conditions. Scroll down to learn more about how our design changed in response to feedback, practical problems and new information.
Initial Considerations
We started our project by talking to bee specialist Tjeerd Blacquière from Wageningen UR and Frank Moens, spokesperson for the Dutch association for Beekeepers. They assured us that the parasitic mite Varroa destructor is indeed the main cause for the high mortality of honey bees. With both, we discussed current methods to treat these mites. They explained that, in the Netherlands, beehives are treated year-round with combinations of formic acid, oxalic acid and thymol. Each of these compounds has its own disadvantages:"

Overview on Synbiome's results
At the beginning of the summer we aimed at having the whole consortium ready before the regional jamboree and probably we undertook too hard a challenge.
We believed that engaging a tough challenge would definitely be a good way to prompt us to do our best, and so it was.
Synbiome was not perfectly tuned for the regional jamboree in Amsterdam but the original idea and the extensive validation of the submitted biobricks have earned our team the access to the final jamboree in Boston.

iGEM Stockholm
Since 2017, iGEM Uppsala and iGEM Stockholm have been collaborating to host panel discussions. This year we have evolved the concept making it a science symposium with two sessions, the first about how to maintain a healthy mental state while working in science and the second about biohacking. What’s also new is that Lund has also joined the event and the work in arranging it. The work started in June and we starting having meetings in early July, with a session every second week. The symposium was held at Uppsala University in late September where students, professors and previous iGEM participants attended. You can find more information about the event on the human practices page!
Furthermore, iGEM Uppsala and iGEM Stockholm have had a close relationship this year and held several social events together such as BBQs.

At the end of the conversation we received some advice on how to pitch our idea: our main advantage is the reduction reliance on fossil fuels over traditional methods of styrene production, and the reduction of CO2 emissions.
The second meeting was with Jaco Westra, a coordinator of synthetic biology, and an expert on safety and GMO regulations. This meeting took place on august 14th, 2018.      We talked about our progress in the lab, which was going slower than expected at that time. Jaco was especially curious how progress on the Safe-by-Design assignment was progressing compared to the last meeting, and how we are integrating the associated principles into our project. We described the changes we had made, for example the consideration of using recycled toilet paper as cellulose source, or the plan to focus on toy makers as customers for our product. We discussed the best ways to market our product, and agreed that the focus should be on the reduction of CO2 emissions. Our plan is to do a Carbon Footprint Analysis to come to an exact figure, to make a better comparison. At the end of the conversation we also received advice on how to improve our infographic.

The PCR did not work out and therefore, the same PCR was performed with different concentrations of Betain (0,5 M and 1 M) and DMSO (3 %, 5 % and 10 %)
This did not work as well and therefore, new primers are designed to anneal at 72 °C (PP_013 and PP_014). The PCR worked out and a gel extraction was performed and the PCR product AP_destructase_g2-g5_PP013-PP014 is used for further CPEC.

After we decided in our group to pursue the challenge to build Si-C bonds in vivo building on the intriguing paper >„Directed evolution of cytochrome c for carbon–silicon bond formation Bringing silicon to life“ by Francis Arnold (2016) and use PACE to lastly modify the catalytic enzyme, we began forming a strategy. Combining various literature methods, our plan more and more assumed a form. We wanted to use a riboswitch, detecting the Si-C bond containing small molecule Rma cytochrome c forms, to logically link the specificity and activity of our evolving protein to the Phage production.
To start this, we wanted to use the mutated version of cyt c  to enantio- and chemoselectively produce our target molecule.
Next, the so generated molecule should enable the direct evolution of our RNA riboswitch with the method SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment). Lastly, the respective implementation of the riboswitch and cyt c DNA in PACE should give rise to new mutants with an improved catalysing mechanisms for our desired molecule. The educt for the reaction requires a molecule with a diazo functional group plus one with a Si-H bond. The ethyl-diazo propionate forms, under nitrogen split-off, a carben intermediate with the iron ion of the heme cofactor of the cytochrome c. This in turn insertes itself specifically in the Si-H bond, giving rise to a product with a chiral carbon which is now covalently bound to the Si atom of the other molecule. After we consulted Reiner Tacke for a deeper insight of the relevance of Si-C bonds in industry, we decided that especially enantio- and chemselective biocatalyst are of high importance, narrowing the pool of possible substrates for our reaction. Me-EDA, are used in the paper, was commercially available, whereas 4"

5. We flanked the whole sequence with the iGEM prefix and suffix.
6. Most importantly, we replaced the FokI nuclease at the C-terminal end of the protein by one of our inventions: The Plug and Play Effector Cassette.
This whole construct was synthesized by Genscript.
Plug and Play Effecor Cassette: Our project was designed to enable future iGEM teams to easily use the powerful TALE technology. On top of that, we wanted to built a TALE platform which allows iGEM students to develop their own TAL constructs. We therefore invented the easy-to-use Plug and Play Effector Cassette (PPEC), which can be used to fuse BioBricks, that are in the Golden Gate standard , to the c-terminus of the TAL protein.
The PPEC consists of two BbsI binding sites that point in opposite directions. Digestion with BbsI leads to removal of the PPEC and to the formation of sticky ends at which the upstream sticky end (GGCA) is the last 4 nucleotides of the TAL protein and the downstream sticky end (TAAA) contains the stop codon. When an equimolar amount of the effector containing plasmid (flanked also by BbsI sites and the same overlaps) is added to the GGC mix, the effector is cut out of the iGEM vector and ligated into the eukaryotic TAL expression vector in-frame and without a scar. We have optimized this reaction by systematically testing different reaction buffers and thermocycler programs and came up with the following protocol:

3. Ions Dependency
Different concentration of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium ions were added to the aptamer folding reaction mixture of N2-694 and N9-545 probes, mimicking the addition of nasal fluid to our freeze-dried aptamer kit by household users. These 2 aptamer probes behaved similarly in different selected ions concentration. In the range of the ionic composition of nasal fluid, they performed well for sodium, potassium ions and magnesium ion, though an increase in calcium ions concentration will result in a decrease of fluorescence signal of both probes.
Overall, the aptamer system would not affected by sodium, potassium and magnesium ions in nasal fluid, except calcium ion. Note that the aptamer folding buffer used composed of 10mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2.

Future works
1. Expand the scale of our database.
Projects in iGEM and literature field are grow at a remarkable speed, thus it's a responsible for us to update the data in our database regularly so that our users can catch the latest ideas and utilize into reproduction and testing. In next year, every team and publisher will be invited to redraw their genetic circuit on our design platform for seamless reutilization in future works, which is the most fastest and accurate way we can imagine for expanding the database. For display aspect, a wiki plug-in tool of S-Din will be developed so that all the teams next year can using the same editable tools in their wiki so that no more PS will be needed and also benefit us for gathering data from the first hand.
2. Evaluating an uncarried-on project by Artificial Intelligence.
In the future, we are going to adding a crowdsourcing feature in our software. To evaluate the project, a reliable auto-judging system will be created. The evaluation system will not only consist of simulation results but also variety of aspects that may affect the reliability of a project to function well (not only for Competition Awards but also for TRUE scientific & social effect it has). Machine learning and other method in big data mining area will definitely be used in the coming feature.
3. More validation experiments and feedbacks.
According to basic principles of engineering, iteration of the design-test-redesign circle for a product could never be enough. More efficient and user friendly features will be added"

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#alternatives to microcompartments_-_-_TEXT.html," collision rate. As such, we cannot state the exact reaction rate and have normalized our data so that our highest data point takes a value 1 and subsequent reaction rates are expressed as fractions of this.
Oxford iGEM 2014
The star peptide- model results
The resulting relationship suggested that diffusion rate (defined as 1⁄t_end ) was proportional to 1⁄r^2 . In addition to this, we predict that the relative likelihood of a substrate colliding will an enzyme will decrease as the distance between the enzymes’ active sites increase. This will likely follow a 1⁄r^2  relationship if we consider the fact the likelihood of collision is inversely proportional to the fraction of the surface area of a sphere of the distance r that the enzyme occupies. Thus, we predict that the overall rate-distance relationship will take the form:
reaction rate ∝  1⁄(peptide length)^4
Thus, the smaller the distance of separation, the higher we expect the rate of reaction to be. However, we must note that this model does not take into consideration stearic hindrances and instabilities that set in when the peptide is made too small. Furthermore, the model is only valid for a minimum radius which is defined as the sum of the two enzyme radii.
The normalized rate against star protein length results yielded by the model imply that reaction rate is proportional to peptide length^-4.
Calibrating the model
Calibrating the model
Calibrating the stochastic diffusion model
To make our stochastic model realistic, we had to calibrate it against known diffusion distributions from Fick’s Law. The exact solution to Fick’s law suggests that the concentration spread will follow a Gaussian (Normal) distribution such that:
Calculation of the diffusion constant of formaldehyde in cytoplasm proved difficult to find through literature. Thus, a theoretical value had to be substituted. From standard databases, the diffusion constant of formaldehyde in water is given as 2*(10^-5) cm^2 s^(-1).
Through comparison with this Gaussian, we could then calibrate our stochastic model to achieve maximum closeness of fit defined by:
The parameter being varied in the stochastic models is defined as ‘w0’- the relative likelihood of a molecule staying still within a certain time period, dt, rather than diffusing a pre-defined distance h. By varying w0 and calculating the median accuracy, we have identified the variable set [w0, h, dt] as [29, 0.25nm, 0.25ns] gives the closest resemblance"

aGEM is a yearly competition held by Alberta Innovates Technology Futures in Edmonton. It's a friendly experience where the teams from Alberta get together to show their projects and have a chance to practice before iGEM. This year it took place on the 24-25th of September.
Saturday
Saturday was the big day, the chance to present to the other teams, followed by a question period, and practice for iGEM. UBC actually sent a delegate this year, though as they are not from Alberta, they were not including in the judging. After UBC it was time for the team from the University of Lethbridge to present. They have been working on their project for three consecutive years now and had lots of data to present. After a quick break it was time for the University of Alberta to present. Their project on N. crassa had come a long way since we last spoke to them. Then it was our turn to present and the question period was filled with numerous questions from judges and students alike. Lunch was called while the judges deliberated and after that there was a keynote address by Andrew Hessel. After this it was announced that the team from the University of Lethbridge was the winner of this years aGEM competition. Short sessions with some members from the judging panel followed this to answer any questions the teams may have had.

Digested and gel extracted Sam's 4xFF4 gene entry  backbone, pushing the Mnt-VP16-4xFF4 and Delta-mCherry-4xFF4 assemblies  forward a bit. DNA work seems to have slowed considerably over the past  few days\- we should make more (non-Tango) LRs. Ephrin stuff will  hopefully be verified tomorrow. Takers?
Charles: Passed cells. Doing bunch of wiki work now.
Jon - Miniprepped and nanodropped 19 samples. Prepped SDMs for sequencing. Analyzed odd sequence results. Reinoculated Rescue 28 plasmids; put into incubator at 5:40pm, although many are already at high OD (wildly inconsistent though) so I'd check after a couple hours to make sure the E. coli don't reach stationary phase.
Summary of Week 12: August 22 - Later
September 1
Grant: Inoculations of the aforementioned LR constructs.

- Shenzhen University
During the summer, Shenzhen University kindly shared their laboratory with us, since we needed the microplate reader—which we didn’t have one in our lab—to test the enzyme activity of FruA and Dextranase we expressed with escherichia coli. Also, they gave us some instruction in the experiments of Interlab. Their project this year involves comprehension of the property of chitin. Since our project last year required study of chitin, we shared sufficient information about chitin and some experience we went through with them to push forward their project.
- Shenzhen College of International Education
On October 15, we invited Shenzhen College of International Education (SCIE) to our campus to hold a lecture on synthetic biology and iGEM competition together in order to prevail the idea of synthetic biology and iGEM among high-schoolers. SCIE introduced synthetic biology and explain their project this year to the students, while we introduced iGEM and our project this year.
- Shenzhen Foreign Language School (SFLS)
After a meet up in Shenzhen, SFLS offered to provide us with some modeling resources since no member in our team has modeling experience. Also, we keep helping each other to increase the popularity of our WeChat official accounts by reprinting articles. Noticeably, SFLS kindly shared one of their sponsors with us. We gave SFLS permission to reprint some of our high-quality articles like the Interview of Experienced iGEMers, helping them with exploring the deeper layer of iGEM as experienced insiders. Additionally, SFLS made project propaganda and street interview in Lotus Hill Park, where we went for the same reason last year, so we shared some experience with them to validate their activities to advance their human practice.

About our project
Bacto-Bandage
Our goal was to create an E. coli strain, which inhibits S. aureus biofilm formation in wounds by producing RNA III-inhibiting-peptide (RIP).
S. aureus is one of the largest causes of hospital infections, each year infecting millions of people around the globe. S. aureus is normally commensal, but can create bacterial biofilms on implanted medical devices and in post-operational wounds. Biofilm is becoming increasingly hard to treat, as a result of growing resistance to many types of antibiotics.
By manipulating E. coli to express the synthetic RIP peptide, we have reached this goal. RIP has been shown to hinder the quorum-sensing processes essential for biofilm development in S. aureus, making it harder for the bacteria to spread, and at the same time, improving the chance that conventional antibiotics will work.
We propose making a bandage that contains our engineered bacteria behind a semipermeable membrane, allowing only small peptides such as RIP to pass through, into the wound. We hope to show that biological machines can be used to fight different kinds of bacterial infections intelligently, to contribute with our RIP and export-signal parts and by better characterization of the older parts we've used.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a phage. This ensures that only the C. difficile cells are targeted and due to the specificity of the “silencers” only strains capable of producing the toxins will be silenced allowing the now non-toxigenic strains to remain part of the gut microbiota to protect against other opportunistic toxic bacteria. In addition, with this approach the lack of a lytic phage is no longer an issue as using the ability of temperate phage to integrate into the host cell chromosome to express the “silencers” results in stable repression of the toxin while keeping the cells alive which allows the strains to become part of the gut microbiota. The presence of toxin silenced C. difficile strains in the gut microbiota can have a protective effect to reduce the likelihood of toxic strains colonising and causing future infections.
Abstract
Antibiotics serve a critical role in remedying bacterial infections, however a major disadvantage to their use is the non-specificity of broad spectrum antibiotics that drastically kills off beneficial bacteria reducing the diversity of the gut flora. The use of antibiotics allows opportunistic pathogens like Clostridium difficile to take advantage of the dysbiosis caused.
A consequence of antibiotic misuse and the capability of bacteria to readily adapt to versatile conditions, has allowed antibiotic resistance in bacteria to become a major dilemma. Each year in the United States alone 2 million people are subject to infection from antibiotic resistant bacteria. Phage therapy is an alternative to antibiotics. The goal of our project was to engineer a bacteriophage which will infect C. difficile and express genetic constructs designed to suppress toxin production. We will pursue two strategies to achieve this; asRNA and dCAS-9, both of which will target the toxin genes tcdB and tcdA. Ultimately, we aim to produce a phage therapy which will reduce toxigenicity of resident strains of C. difficile without significantly affecting the native gastrointestinal microbiota.

Yale,2010,Team:Yale#Our Project#Methods#_-_-_TEXT.html,"imilatory reduction of inorganic thiosulfate to hydrogen sulfide and sulfite. • 1995, phs locus of Salmonella chromosome located, sequenced, and confered H2S production to E.Coli. – Sequence similar to reductases in other bacteria – Later confirmed to contain structural gene for thiosulfate reductase • Since before 1970 people have observed bacteria producing H2S. The earliest samples were taken from patients (Stoleru and Bouanehaud of Institut Pasteur, 1972 and 1975). Better yet, they showed that H2S production was mediated by a plasmid! A later study in 1978 by Jones et al of Texas Tech characterized another one of these plasmids, saw that it could be used in and transferred between E. Coli as well! • In 1987 an extensive review was written collecting lots of existing research about sulfate-reducing bacteria (SFB). In this broad review of SFB, it mentioned that sulfate reductases are membrane bound. Possibly useful for us, purified samples of thiosulfate reductase can also apparently be controlled, stopped in the presence of NADH , NADPH, and cysteine. Anyhow, the main development in this paper showed that thiosulfate-reduction ability is fairly common, usually used by anaerobic bacteria as an energy source (although some aerobic variants have been reported) and that one of the key players is thiosulfate reductase, which by this point had been isolated and had some characterization available. If required, there are lots of other sulfur-reducing pathways that are common as well, with a notable one being the reduction of tetrathionate. • Perhaps not surprising, the same authors of the review paper actually in the same year published a paper on the phs gene mediating hydrogen-sulfide production! Better yet, this gene is not coupled to methyl-viologen, which is common in anaerobic bacteria! score! Of note, the authors write that the phs gene is not actually the structural gene itself, but instead codes for a regulatory protein important for the reduction of thiosulfate to H2S. This paper also looked at different ways to optimize H2S production. • Something happened over a decade (particularly, see 1995 paper by Erika Barrett analyzing the phs sequence), because by 1999 a study from UC Berkeley, in Keasling lab, had the actual structural genes!

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Template:NotebookDataJuly2_-_-_TEXT.html," because the spec did not diffuse evenly. We will be re-plating all of our samples later today, on new LB+spec plates.
PCR of product from isothermal assembly of expression plasmid
We also ran a PCR on the product of the three-part isothermal assembly (omega+linker, ultramers, spec backbone). We used the cross-junction primers and the same recipe as our PCR on Tuesday . Once again we expected a product of 1.4 kb.
1.2% E-gel of our ultramer isothermal assembly reaction product
There were fairly sharp bands underneath the band we expected. Additionally, the expected 1.4 kb band was not visible for samples 80 and 81, although they were successfully grown on plates. Sample 85 had no bands, not even primers.
Since 80 and 81 grew on our plates yesterday, we continued with our plan of re-plating our original transformations, especially since the chemically transformed cells do have the appropriate isothermal assembly product to insert. We re-plated all the transformations on the LB+spec plates made today, and will leave them overnight in the 37* incubator. We also made cultures from the colonies on plates 78-82 to mini-prep tomorrow.
Rerunning of PCR products (ultramers and isothermal assembly)
In addition, we decided to see if the streaking was possibly caused by the gel instead of a PCR problem, and so we ran three of our products in a 1% agarose gel instead of an E-gel, with the results below.
Products ran in an agarose gel.  Note that wells 78-80 on the left side of the gel are empty due to sample mysteriously floating out of the well.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html,". We wanted an affordable, open source product that is easy to use for everyone. We immediately thought about using a commercial syringe pump, but that absolutely did not come to terms with affordability, because prices for equipment like this usually start from around a thousand dollars.  Not only that, also the communication between the printer and pump would be hard to achieve with a commercial product.  Since we would need a CNC printing system anyway, we decided that it would be best if the printer just printed its own extension pack. Developing a whole new FDM printer and optimizing the printing process would have been a task for a much larger engineering team. That is why we decided to go for an Ultimaker 2 plus and modify it. It is one of the most precise printers in its price segment and also easily customizable. Additionally, many tech-savvy people own that model.
This way, our syringe pump can be easily spread on open source platforms to get user feedback and maybe it even push research in the bioprinting segment to a new level. Unfortunately, a 3D printer cannot be expected to work in tolerances as small as in steel constructions, so some parts (like threaded spindles) have to be bought. We found a similar project of an open source syringe pump, which we would like to give credit to here [1] , for we reverse engineered that design and constructed our own, improved version.  After lots and lots of construction and prototyping, we proudly present to you a precisely functioning liquid printer that could not be easier to set up and use.  Currently, our friends at TU Darmstadt are testing our device and so do a lot of users on open source platforms, and so can you. How you get from printing plastic to printing cells will be explained step by step in the following manual and description.
This is how easily you can print your own printer extension.
Basic principle
The basic function of our printer is easy to understand:  A syringe filled with bioink is placed in the syringe pump, which then precisely moves the plunger. The thereby displaced cells are pushed through a capillary into a cannula that is mounted on the print head. By using the printer's electromechanics, the printing motion is achieved. The Ultimaker already has an opportunity to install a second extruder motor, which is usually responsible for conveying the plastic filament to the hot end printing nozzle. By using that second output, the printer is able to communicate with our syringe pump by making minor changes to the firmware , which can be downloaded and easily installed. This is"

There are a lot of exciting Parts in the Registry, but many Parts have still not been characterized. Synthetic Biology needs great measurement approaches for characterizing new parts, and efficient new methods for characterizing many parts at once. If you've done something exciting in the area of Measurement, describe it here!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to"

The heatmap shows an increase of fluorescence from blue (no fluorescence) to red (high fluorescence). It is clearly visible that the induced chips are exhibiting a significantly higher fluorescence than the non-induced chips. This again shows that the constructs work as intended: The TEV protease cuts the linker so that the fusion protein is separated into GFP and a dark quencher, disabling the quenching. GFP has a clear fluorescence emission after the fusion protein has been successfully cut into two pieces by the TEV protease.
K1319003
Human galectin-3, codon-optimized for E. coli
Galectin-3 is a 26 kDa protein that binds certain LPS patterns. It especially bind the O-section of the LPS.
Galectins are proteins of the lectin family, which posess carbonhydrate recognition domains binding specifically to β-galactoside sugar residues. In humans, 10 different galectines have been identified, among which is galectin-3.
Galectin-3 has a size of about 31 kDA and is encoded by a single gene, LGALS3. It has many physiological functions, such as cell adhesion, cell growth and differentiation, and contributes to the development of cancer, inflammation, fibrosis and others.
Human galectin-3 is a protein of the lectin-family that was shown to bind the LPS of multiple human pathogens. Some of them, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa protect themselves against the human immune system by mimicking the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) present on human erythrocytes.
Usage and Biology
K1319003 was used to create K1319020 , a Galectin-mRFP fusion protein with a C-terminal His tag in the Heidelberger expression vector pSBX1A3.
We also cloned our K1319003 into the pET17 expression vector and expressed all combinations of fusion proteins in E. coli BL21(DE3). An SDS-PAGE showed that all fusion proteins were fully translated:
Pellets of different fusion protein expressions
Expression in the pET17 vector was much more leaky than the expression in the pSBX vectors.
SDS-PAGE of K1319020 expression
The fusion protein was fully translated to the correct molecular mass of 74 kDa.

Methodology And Results
In order to reach our goal of breaking down fats, which are a major component of buildups in wastewater systems, we created a novel biobrick which would allow our bacteria to produce an esterase under control of an inducible-promoter.
Design
- First, we researched an esterase-producing gene that could be expressed in E.coli. We decided to use the EstA gene, which is found in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
- For our promoter, we decided to use pLAC, which is lactose-inducible and is naturally found in E.coli.and was available in the registry (Part:BBa_B0011) .
- We chose the B0034 RBS (Part:BBa_B0034) .
- Finally, we chose the double terminator B0015, which is the most common terminator and is known to be reliable. (Part:BBa_B0015) .
- After we had chosen all of our biobrick parts, we had them synthesized together, creating our new biobrick: (Part:BBa_K2694000) .
Figure 1: Our part BBa_K2694000
Qualitative Testing
Once we received our DNA, we transformed it into DH5α E.coli. We then did a plasmid switch to clone our part into PSB1C3 for submission to the Registry. To test our new part, we grew up cultures of our bacteria overnight. We then subcultured them for three hours before beginning the testing.
We first did a qualitative test. From the literature, we found that we could use 4-nitrophenyl palmitate and 4-nitrophenyl octanoate to test our esterase activity. Both substrates, when cleaved by an esterase, would go from clear to green, allowing us to monitor the cleavage activity visually. We set-up a time-course assay where we mixed 1mM of each nitrophenyl ester with 1% v/v Triton X-100 in 0.1M pH 7 phosphate buffer. We also"

Digital Media
Because our subject is something that these students can understand, we thought about giving them some of our documents, protocols and results in order to increase their awareness of lab work.
We thought about different ways to disseminate these resources. We could use the eduLab Biotech Toulouse website: the GREEN (or the academic biotechnology site currently under construction or via a dedicated mixed site IGEM Toulouse - biotech). Another possibility is through the national association of biotech teachers (UPBM), or the Eduscol ministerial site. We also gave teachers the idea to use labspace.io as a manageable and interactive labbook. This website was really helpful for our team and it can surely be used in an educational way.
Figure 2: Screenshot of an article about us on the GREEN website
Equipment
As an educational tool, we have remastered the ""Microbioworld"" card game of our fellow iGEM Toulouse predecessors. So we decided to use it. Cathy Metge came up with the beautiful idea of an educational wallet that can deliver a lot of science resources for student such as orientation tips, help in biology, professional advices and our Microbioword game to raise interest in Microbiology. This is a really big project since it will concern all French highschools, on the national scale.  It will be diffused with the help of Philippe GARNIER and the French Educational Ministry.
Conclusion : A long term relationship
This collaboration will go beyond iGEM Toulouse 2018 and there is a strong motivation on both side to make it last.
“The possibility of building this partnership over time is particularly important to us. It will be easier to bring this action to the greatest number, by mobilizing partners at the national level, if it is a long-term project rather than a one-off action.”
Cathy Metge and Aurélien Despierris
It is great achievement for us since it means that our Human Practices efforts will have long term repercussions on the national scale.

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety: NO
public safety, or : NO
environmental safety? : NO
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? YES
What does your local biosafety group think about your project? Unknown, will be stated at the Jamboree (poster, presentation)
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?  NO
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? /
When we say no, we mean no but in terms of probability there is no ""no"". Because as we deal with biology there is always the chance that something does not behave as expected. However we believe that with more than 99,999999999999999999% our project is safe if the prevalent security and safety norms are followed.

Successful transformation to the IMPACT vector.  K2018015. Date: 16.09.08
Before purifying the bacteriocin by IMPACT, the bacteriocin must first be transformed into the IMPACT vector bacteria, E. Coli:ER2566.  To do this, we  incorporated  the  pPCR product into the IMPACT plasmid, pTXB1. Thereafter  the products are digested by following the SOP0025. step. 8.1.1. and afterwards ligated by following step 8.1.3 → 8.1.4 in the same SOP.
The following gel image were used to verify that K2018015 were successfully cloned into pTXB1 (the IMPACT vector). We used three different primers to ‘cross amplify’ the gene and a part of the vector plasmid, getting 2 different DNA bands. All of the given results were, as expected, at 330 bp and 494 bp.
What we had done with the BioBrick K2018015 can be read in the protocols: < Cloning composite part K2018015 into pSB1C3 and IMPACT Purification of K2018015

Made more 1X TAE
We checked the colonies from yesterday and did not see any colonies. Therefore we decided to re-transform on a Chlor 50 ug/μL LB plate.
We transformed HSP+pACYC184 ligation with -80 C DH5α cells and also using C-medium and T solution protocol on page 41 of the lab notebook (see attached photo?) except that after that protocol was followed we added 50 μL of T solution and cells to 5 μL of the ligation. Then we added 500 μL of 1X SOC and put it in a water bath at 37 C for an hour. Then we plated on the chlor plates.
We found 3 promoter and 3 reporter genes for the high school kids (Promoters and Reporters doc).
we took the 4 2014 parts from the above list of 6 that we got from the IGEM registry by adding 10 μL of ddH2O to the proper wells on the IGEM trays and then we transfered that to ependorfs that we put into our box. Then we followed the transformation from page 41 again with the same added steps as above with the expection that we used 2 μL of the biobrick instead of the 5 μL of ligation that we usually use.
We then streaked out those transformations and incubated overnight.
6/20/14
We looked at our plates from yesterday and saw 4 colonies on one of our HSP+pAYA184 plates! It was the one made from the frozen DH5α cells. So in order to see if it has our construct or not we colony PCR'ed the 4 colonies on #130. We also used a positive control of HSP G-block to make sure that the PCR would work because someone deleted our protocol in the machine and so we had to re-do it and hope for the best. These five PCR products were run on a 1.2% gel. For the four colonies, we took 5μL PCR,"

MARCH
We, totally strangers, were drawn by the recruiting poster on the board of our teaching building. After several rounds of selections, the blurry figure of our team was barely to be seen.During this month, our knowledge about iGEM was indeed an explosion.
APRIL
Although the team was growing, we didn’t know who we would be working with, the faces that were going to be the most familiar ones through the whole summer. This month, our future team was registered by our instructors. None of us knew how much that would mean to each of us and how far the young team would go.
Also in this month, we invited two previous iGEMers from Zhejiang University(Zukai Liu) and Natinal Chiao Tung University(Haoxian Wang) to communicate with us about the experience of building a team, selecting a track, running a project. We learned so much from them. For new iGEMers like us, it was really a great encouragement. Meanwhile, we were getting organized like they suggested, getting us scheduled for frequent communications in the team.
MAY
We wandered among previous wikis. Weekly meet-ups for brainstorms promoted us to bring up our own cases. Each time, we shared our information, results, problems and thoughts with each other and our instructors. It was not easy to form a new pattern of study, where we were totally free to go for or against others opinions rather than taught by just one teacher in the class. We finally could enjoy ourselves in this kind of free atmosphere.

Instead of just glancing over other teams wikis, we urged ourselves to get some insights into those successful cases to seek every spark that might inspire us, followed by designing our own case in details.After several times of discussions and debates, we set our case in environment track and decided to do something about the heavy metal contamination.

It can be observed from the graph that the groups with 2% arabanose are inhibited in their growth throughout the time measurements were taken, both with and without IPTG.  It can also be seen that the un-induced group had the highest OD600 at 3.75hrs suggesting that overproduction of the enzymes coded for by BBa_395704 does have a deleterious effect on the cells.
While growth rate is important for the successful production of our target compounds, what is more important is the net amount of zeaxanthin made by the cells. To measure this we let the cells grow for 14hrs, towards the end of log phase, and measured cell denisty and amount of carotenoid produced.  The total carotenoids produced was measured by extracting pigments for a set volume of cells and measuring their absorbance at 450.  From this number we were able to calculate an approximate number of molecules of zeaxanthin produced per cell.

Sake is a kind of fermented liquor and produced by three kinds of bacterial co-cultivate. Most sake is made from rice, water and rice Koji. At first glance, you might think sake is so simple and modest. However, while we refer to them all as sake, there are large varieties of sake like wine and beer. Sake is classified by criteria which is defined by Japanese national tax agency. The sake is distinguished by the following four criteria, what is used for, how much is the ratio of rice polishing, how much ratio of the Koji rice is and what smell is it. According to Japanese national tax agency, rice polishing ratio refers the ratio of weight of white rice to brown rice. Koji rice refers to white rice used for manufacturing rice Koji. Also, rice Koji is bred the Koji to white rice and can glycosylate starch of sake rice. Now you know, sake is not simple and modest but luxury.
・History of sake
According to “Harimanokuni Fudoki ”(records of the culture and geography of the Harima province) , there has been clearly described about the oldest sake which was made from rice(A.C.700). After reaching the culture of rice cultivation from Mainland China, people started to make sake mainly using rice. Sake brewing was started as a part of offerings that is dedicated to a god. As a part of offerings, the sake was made by the first rice of the year. At that time, people make sake by the way which is called “Kuchikami”( =mouth chewed). By chewing the heated crops, amylase contained in saliva converts starch into sugar. After that, wild yeast ferments sugar into alcohol. In Japan, people say “Kamosu”(=ferment at the process of brewing sake). It is said that the word of “Kamosu” came from “Kamu”(=chewing).
After this era, according to some historical literature, the culture of sake brewing spreaded to the whole country. However, in those days, sake was high viscosity because the proportion of water in sake is low. Therefore, people ate sake with chopsticks.
Early in the Nara period(710~794), brewers started to use the brewing method of using rice Koji. The way of sake brewing was the same as modern and there has been applied a lot of kinds of sake in Heian period. At that time, the sake was yet cloudy sake. From this period, “Sob"

Idea Exchange
In the end of August, we attended FAFU_CCIC
Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University Conference of China iGEAMer Community , and had a fulfilling time in CCIC. Besides sharing ideas with many other teams, we offered the plasmids to team BGIC-Union (click here for details in collaboration page), and communicated deeply with team Lanzhou, whose project is A novel method in controlling weeds and pests by tandem RNA Interference. Their project showed us an example of RNA Interference in plants, which made us think about the potential application of microRNA antagonist therapy in plants.
Policy
Attentions on policy-making
MiRNA antagonist therapy is a brand new area that there is no policy to regulate it; however, we decided to grasp the trend of policy. As the product developer, we also shoulder the responsibility of advising the government when needed. Thus, we consulted Professor Li Ling and teaching assistant Tu Shuo on what should be paid attention to when making a policy for miRNA antagonist therapy.Besides transparent price, cure rate and specific gene sequence measurement for patients, they both stressed on public's right to know. However, miRNA is not familar to the public, So we decided to open the black box and let more people know about it.
Popularization
Publizing with new media
This year our track is foundational advance，and the product---miRNA inhibitors is not familiar to the public. Therefore, if we want to have the public engaged in our work, the very first thing is to let them make friends with miRNA and our project! In order to achieve a greater influence and outreach, we decided to have our popular science article pushed by WeChat subscription (The WeChat ID of the subscription account is zaxue8, it aims to spread knowledge to the masses). In addition, we used many internet memes in this article for a more vivid expression, and it worked just as we expected!  By now, 2666 people have read this article, and the number is still increasing. Since it is on the internet, people can open it without limitation of time and space. And we can acquire the effectiveness of the publizing conveniently by reading rate and top comments.

Human practices overview
Welcome to the Nottingham iGEM 2018 Human Practices pages. This overview will introduce you to the projects that we investigation for our Human Practices efforts, as well as why we investigated them and what our results showed.
For our silvery medal criteria, we complied 3 reports on the impact of our project, how people feel about phage therapy and what current legislation there is on phage therapy.  The objective of compiling these reports was to investigate whether our work was responsible and good for the world. We engaged with a variety of communities including field experts, community discussion groups and scientific articles and research papers to gain a wide scope of information to demonstrate the positive impact of our work.
For our gold medal criteria, we analysed how we could integrate the findings of our discussion group and field expert interviews into our project. We chose to document this via a clear flowchart so that we can explain how we have taken on board feedback and modified our project as a result.
For outreach, we hosted 3 events to teach children aged 4-16 about synthetic biology. We hosted these events in schools, libraries and our own University to engage a variety of community groups.  For our collaborations, we were lucky enough to work with 4 amazing teams on a variety of projects including characterising our promoters, collecting water samples and completing wiki grammar checks. We chose these collaborations to showcase the variety of teams and projects that take part in iGEM and to learn more about different projects.
Finally, we had 4 articles published in 4 different newspapers/blogs across a range of platforms. This enabled our team to showcase our work and engage a wide range of community audiences in the iGEM competition. We hope you enjoy learning about our Human Practices work on this year’s project.

Minnesota,2011,Team:Minnesota#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the N-terminal module is responsible for targeting and surface anchoring, while a central domain is a series of repeating units that dictates the ice nucleation activity (INA) 2 , 7 . It has been shown the central domain has no impact on anchoring a foreign protein 9 . In E. coli, fusing a heterologous protein to INP does not affect the functionality and expression of INP, and the fusion product is stable even in stationary phase 1 . In addition, even when INP is expressed at a high level, it will not typically disrupt the cell membrane structure or interrupt cell growth 3 . In comparison to other anchoring systems, INP has been shown to be capable of carrying proteins up to 119 kDa, whereas other display systems, such as PgsA, can only carry up to 77 kDa 9 . A good carrier protein candidate should have a strong anchoring structure to secure the passenger proteins on the cell surface; it should be compatible with heterologous proteins for the process of fusion; and it should be resistant to proteolytic enzymes in its surrounding 4 .
Our INP-Silicatein fusion protein showed good results when subjected to the silicatein activity assay.
Figure 3. Silicatein activity assay for INP-Silicatein fusion protein. The contents within the tubes is unreacted monomeric silicic acid stained with molybdenum blue that was recovered after a 20 minute incubation in cells containing expressed INP-Silicatein. The silicic acid remaining represents the amount of silca which did not undergo polymerization. The tube on the left contained no cells and therefore had the largest amount of un-reacted silicic acid whereas the tube farthest right contained 1 mL of cell culture and shows the least amount of un-reacted silicic acid. These results met with our expectations if silicatein is being displayed on the exterior of the cell. As can be seen in the graph, as cell volume is increased, the silicatein assay shows a marked reduction in the amount of silicic acid monomers left in solution after incubation which suggests that the INP-silicatein fusion protein is nucleating silicic acid at the cell surface. Appropriate negative controls were conducted which showed little to no silicic nucleation activity of cells which were not expressing INP-silicatein.

NCTU_Formosa,2014,Team:NCTU Formosa#human practice_-_-_TEXT.html,"We visited the Weng Lai Farm to prepare moths for our experiment. The farm owner not only instructed us a suitable place but also showed us how his farm deal with the moth. Nowadays, they used a device with blue light to attract the moths. Besides, it is equipped with a fan for sweeping the insects into the device. We are inspired by those ideas and utilize it to improve our device.

In order to test the efficiency of our insect capturing device, we also went to Eighteen Peaks Mountain near our school. We put several bottles with sugar solution and the blue bulbs to attract the insect. One night over, we caught  full of insects and moths. It's a great success.
Fund Raising
Even with the funding support by our school, iGEM is still an economically taxing project. With our many spendings on materials for our device developing and testing, we need to find sponsorship. We planned reach out to several corporations and propose our project. We went to our alumni association for contact information of alumni founded enterprises.
SEE MORE
Due to privacy concerns, we were not granted this information. However, our team member Rachel, who proposed to the alumni association and met with the CEO, was invited to an alumni dinner meeting. She was given a five minute timeslot onstage to explain the iGEM competition, the workings of our team, and how we need their support. This immediately drew the interest of the many successful entrepreneurs who graduated from NCTU. We successfully raised five hundred thousand NT dollars that night, right at the venue.
We also received emails showing giving encouragement and support to our team from many alumni who went on to tell more alumni who were not present about iGEM and us.  It is this spirit of always helping out one of our own that established NCTU’s excellence. We cannot be more thankful to their help. There are also several other corporations that we are still communicating with. The whole experience really allowed us to get in touch with the real world and society.

Purification of plasmids for fungi
Materials
The GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit from Sigma-Aldrich is used to isolate our plasmids to use in fungi. QIAGENs EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit is used to purify plasmids for use in mammalian cells.
Preparation
The agents are thoroughly mixed. If any reagent forms a precipitate, warm at 55–65 °C until the precipitate dissolves. Cool to room temperature before use.
The solution is resuspended. Spin the tube of the RNase A Solution briefly to collect the solution in the bottom of the tube. Add 13 μl (for 10 prep package), 78 μl (for 70 prep package) or 500 μl (for 350 prep package) of the RNase A Solution to the Resuspension Solution prior to initial use. Store at 4 °C.
Wash solution; Dilute with 95-100% ethanol prior to initial use.
Procedure - according to the manufactures protocol.
Harvest cells by centrifugation of 5 ml of an overnight recombinant E. coli culture. The optimal volume of culture to use depends upon the plasmid and culture density. For best yields, follow the instructions in the note below. Transfer the appropriate volume of the recombinant E. coli culture to a microcentrifuge tube and pellet cells at ≥12,000 3 g for 1 minute. Discard the supernatant.
Completely resuspend the bacterial pellet with 200 μl of the Resuspension Solution. Vortex or pipette up and down to thoroughly resuspend the cells until homogeneous. Incomplete resuspension will result in poor recovery.
Lyse the resuspended cells by adding 200 μl of the Lysis Solution. Immediately mix the contents by gentle inversion (6–8 times) until the mixture becomes clear and viscous. The lyse reaction must not exceed 5 min.
Precipitate the cell debris by adding 350 μl of the Neutralization/Binding Solution. Gently invert the tube 4–6 times. Pellet the cell debris by centrifuging at ≥12,000*3 g or maximum speed for 10 minutes. Cell debris, proteins"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#FutureApplication_-_-_TEXT.html,"GFP is a well-known reporter used by many iGEM teams and researchers. Such visual reporters have limited use                 in some context such as soils, because it can only work in the presence of oxygen and the color output can                 be hardly detected under layers of soils.
Recently, Rice University researchers have developed gas biosensors that can track the presence of horizontal                 gene transfer without disturbing the soil matrices. This discovery can further aid the study of soil environment                 and horizontal gene transfer i.e., how hydration affects horizontal gene transfer.
Using our construct as a proof of concept, we can use gas biosensors to detect the release of constitutively                 expressed recombinant products and, at the same time, use our method of recombination to knockout the recombinant                 genes. Moreover, this may also provide additional knowledge about the fitness of genetically modified organism                 comparative to the wild-type bacterium.
When horizontal gene transfer is detected, recombinase can knockout the gene of interest and later knock out                 the reporter gene after enough concentration of reporter is established.
This allows scientists to study bacterial interactions in a selected sample environment, and investigate the                 prevention of gene transfer between engineered and wild-type bacteria.
As extracting products from organisms require many purification steps and it is costly, it may be more favorable                 to be able to use engineered organisms equipped with safeguard system in the field.
3. Reduced allergenic response by immune system for transgenic expression in mammalian cells
Hiroshi Ochiai (2010) reported that positive feedback system provides efficient transgenic expression in Hela                 cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Additional papers regarding gene therapy suggested that using a plasmid that lacks bacterial backbone due to                 deletion by site-specific recombination will improve the efficiency of transgenic expression, because the                 host immune system will most likely reject foreign vectors such as bacterial plasmids. The example of such                 plasmid is the ‘minicircles’.
The recombination of origin of replication and marker gene or antibiotic resistance gene can reduce allergic                 responses in an individual should the application be used in eukaryotic cells such as gene therapy.
4. Reduced GM pollens dissemination
The propagation of GM pollen by GM crops has been a major concern, especially in its effect on undesired gene                 flow. Removal of transgene in pollen prior to its dissemination is, thus, a crucial step to prevent gene                 flow happens.
Our sensing module can be adjusted to detect specific stimuli and temporally produce proteins of interest, necessary                 for plants for a controlled period. Recombinase can later knockout the gene of interest safely.

It's kind of overwhelming to learn yet another JavaScript framework after just starting to learn jQuery. I'm going through tutorials online in the hopes of understanding how to program using AngularJS.
Wednesday: The progress of our project seems to be at a standstill. Morale is low as we continue to struggle incorporating drag and drop into the web app. Apparently, on its own, drag and drop works, but once the code is added to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, it is not functional. Today, a representative from zSpace came to give a presentation about zSpace, in particular how the hardware works in conjunction with the software. It was quite amazing to see how they were able to make the 3D glasses so lightweight, and how they made the physics of moving objects with the pen is so realistic and intuitive.
Thursday: Today we went to see a talk given by Michelle Borkin ( http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~borkin/ ) about her work on data visualization. It was a great talk, especially because it was so relevant to the work we're doing in the lab. She mentioned a piece of software that she was involved in developing that has the capability to display multiple ""views"" of the same data, as well as highlight areas of corresponding points of interest--this is exactly what we want to happen in our program, Eugenie. She visited the lab and we were able to talk with her in person. She mentioned that her work is very similar to human computer interaction research, since we both heavily rely on user studies to dictate the path of our projects. It was great to have the opportunity to show her our work and hear her input on our research.
Friday: Outing with BU iGEM at the Museum of Fine Arts. The samurai exhibit was quite interesting and awesome to look at!
Week 6: July 1 - July 3
Monday: Well, it looks like we're moving on to making the application a surface application that can also be used on tablet devices. Based on careful consideration of time limitations and the abilities of our lab group, we decided to put our efforts towards making a surface application. A web app would be the most accessible format to create, but the limitations of our working time makes this project an extra challenge. Looks like we're back to the drawing board! Even though we're abandoning the web app, we learned a lot about programming and design in the process.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"lnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production"

The ligation was plated with a red-white screen.  On the pictures of the plate below you can see many white colonies, and only a few red.
A second miniprep, digest, and gel was conducted using the transformant cells.  The two rows.  The entire first row shows potential KerA colonies, and the second row shows entire KerUS colonies.
Characterization: We have set up our own independent assays, and Lisa (our mentor) has been replicating these in her lab.  She had time to begin these 15 hours before us so the results shared below are hers.  Our tests are still running and results will be incorporated into our presentation and shared during the poster sessions.  The test conducted was the ‘Semi-quantitative Hair Degradation Assay’.  The changes made were to take out the weighing step to make it a fully qualitative assay, and to incubate at two different temperatures.  The feathers used were purple so clouder and more purple cultures would mean keratin degradation.  The pictures of the initial cultures are shown below
KerA cultures grown overnight and induced with 0.1 or 0.5 mM final IPTG.
KerUS cultures grown overnight and induced with 0.1 or 0.5 mM final IPTG.
DH5alpha with C003 (which is a different plasmid with no keratinase genes), and with no IPTG.

After growing for 18 hours this is what the cultures looked like (shown above).

KerUS 0.1 mM IPTG, KerUS 0.5mM IPTG, and control at 30 degrees Celsius.
At 37 degrees Celsius there is not a very large difference between the control and the cells.  This is either from the dye coming (dye bleed) off the feathers at this temperature, or this"

Edinburgh_UG,2017,Team:Edinburgh UG#HP#Interdisciplinarity_-_-_TEXT.html," interdisciplinarity was detected between medal winners in any year (p > 0.1                 for all combinations; ANOVA).
Figure 1: distribution of interdisciplinarity measure grouped by iGEM medals. Whiskers represent                     the range of values. Box indicates median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentile).
This was surprising as the interdisciplinary that benefitted on our team was not reflected in the data. Why is                 that? Here are some possibilities:
While interdisciplinary may theoretically facilitate innovation and skill exchange, practical difficulties in communication and cooperation remain a great obstacle, as reflected from the skill exchange survey. The benefits were offset by poor integration of a diverse skillset.
A diversity in discipline fails to capture the exchange of skill and knowledge within the cooperation – the essence of interdisciplinarity.
iGEM is an interdisciplinary competition with a core of synthetic biology. Thus, a focus in biologists and engineers in team composition is often required for most tracks in iGEM. The optimal interdisciplinarity was a balance, rather than a complete diversity.
These results were thought-provoking, as we expected the potential of interdisciplinarity can be fully realised in iGEM. This expresses a dire need to improve the integration of interdisciplinarity in iGEM.
How can we better promote diversity and innovation in iGEM? We went back to our skill exchange survey to address the problems of interdisciplinary collaboration. We start by making SMORE a tool accessible to researchers from all backgrounds and disciplines, encouraging an influx of perspectives and ideas.
Take a look at how we did this on the Accessibility page.
Below are the codes for the interdisciplinarity analysis. The code is written in iPython, which needs special software for viewing. We have provided a guide on viewing and working with our iPhyton code. We also provided the text in .txt file but please note the content may have changed. Similarly, we have included the data of past iGEM teams in an excel file. Finally, we have also included a word document where scores along each Biglan Axis are defined.

Overview
The goal of NEU_China_A this year is to design a biological system aiming to alleviate intestinal inflammatory diseases and prevent potential colorectal cancer. We chose E. coli Nissle 1917 as our chassis, a probiotic that is safe for humans. On the one hand, when it senses an inflammatory signal in the intestine, it releases an anti-inflammatory compound (interleukin-10) to put out the fire in the intestines. On the other hand, it can release myrosinase to convert the glucosinolate contained in cruciferous vegetables into sulforaphane. The sulforaphane can both alleviate inflammation in the intestine and prevent colorectal cancer induced by chronic inflammation.

For details of whole project design, please click to Design
As a therapeutic project, we know that it is very difficult to verify the entire system in less than a year. We split the entire system into three core parts to verify separately: the nitric oxide sensor (nitric oxide is a marker of inflammation), protein transport and production, and the kill switch. In addition, we test them in DH5α and BL21. We believe that the success of these core parts will ultimately make the system work in the real world"
