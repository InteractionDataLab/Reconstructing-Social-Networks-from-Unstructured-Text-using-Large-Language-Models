Blog #19 - Noneffective Antibiotics (Part III): Have the Pharma Giants Lost The Race?
By NBailly 15:39, July 15 2014 (CDT)
David and Goliath
Small Companies have taken leading position in antibiotics research. Picture by  LegalIT Lawyers.
It is not the big pharma companies that will develop the desperately needed new generation of antibiotics that can even cope with multi-resistant bacteria such as MRSA. Instead, some smaller companies who never gave up researching this field are now future market leaders. As the German business news magazine Wirtschaftswoche reported this June, it is companies like the British-Swedish Astra Zeneca or Hoffmann-La Roche spin off Basilea that are now in a leading position.
Astra Zeneca, for example, brought the very effective antibiotic Ceftarolin to the European market. Ceftarolin can also cope with MRSA. But this is not the company’s only success: Another highly interesting remedy, Avibactam, was developed. This drug tricks multi-resistant bacteria into lowering their defense against antibiotics. In a combined treatment with the broad-spectrum antibiotic cephalosporin, it is running through the last two phases of authorizing trials on humans. Astra Zeneca hopes this treatment will be admitted to urinary tract infections and pneumonia by 2016. Basilea’s fifth generation cephalosporin, Ceftobiprol, has also been admitted to help people with pneumonia. It can kill a multitude of killer germs at the same time, and is expected to yield more than one billion dollars on the market.
The latter example shows that a lot of money can be made with antibiotics nowadays when the old ones keep"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," our Targeted Next Generation Sequencing platform.
We processed the data obtained from ONT MinION sequencing runs with our tailor-made data analysis software tool . The software consists of an algorithm that aligns all the files generated by our sequencing run sequences with our pre-existing database, containing expected gene doping sequences. Based on the alignment score, the sequences are classified into gene doping DNA or non-gene doping DNA, eliminating any false positives that might have been sequenced. The software strengthens the robustness and reliability of our method, allowing us to determine whether gene doping DNA was present in the athlete’s blood sample. To go a step further, our algorithm has the capacity of expanding the database as it detects new gene doping sequences, thereby simultaneously evolving with gene doping.
Impact
We proved our designed fusion protein could direct DNA integration to a specific sequence by the use of a sgRNA. We also demonstrate that this novel protein could be used to perform targeted next generation sequencing with ONT MinION device. Therefore, we believe that by establishing and integrating our novel detection method into valid testing systems, we could discourage athletes from using high-risk gene doping technologies. Not only has the Dutch Doping Authority, the Delft Sports Engineering Institute and Dutch Trotting and Flat Racing Association (NDR) shown interest in our technology, but so have various other non gene doping related stakeholders. Sanquin, the Dutch blood bank, and the Dutch Research Department for Food Safety (RIKILT) at Wageningen University also emphasized the potential and value of our targeted sequencing technology. These stakeholders’ interests highlight the possible applications of our targeted sequencing method in other fields, such as cancer detection, non-invasive prenatal screening, food safety regulations, and even strain identification.

Implementing diversity
For our directed evolution system of binding proteins, we designed and constructed two libraries, containig proposed randomized CDS for Monobodies or Nanobodies as initial Evobodies. The detailed construction of our libraries is discribed in ""Design and Construction"" . Plasmid libraries, coding for useful proteins, are a powerful tool in synthetic biology, but underestimated in iGEM, yet. Unfortunately, the construction of a library is a difficult and time consuming task. To supply this tool for future iGEM teams, we provided our libraries to the iGEM community and want to implement a new category in iGEM parts registry for libraries, coding several different proteins categories, like enzymes, binding proteins or aptamers. By doing so we want to establish libraries in iGEM and pave the way for every team to access the advantages of large diversity libraries as well as creating and submitting their own.
As a starting point, we submitted our Monobody and Nanobody libraries as plasmid mixes. These collections comprise over 100,000 (Monobodies), respectively over 160,000 (Nanobodies) of distinct sequences for binding proteins out of a"

The Cardiff iGEM team members each had distinct but flexible roles in the team. Here they are documented briefly, but more detail about what each member did can be seen on the diary page . Also, we had a great deal of help from other people, including supervisors, lab owners, other researchers, friends, and even company CEOs! These are also all documented here.
The Team Roles
Sarah Clinton: Largely in control of all aspects of human outreach and collaboration, but took part in some lab work too. Sarah looked after the plants with Jade.
Ryan Coates: Mostly carried out lab work, wiki design and modelling. Ryan was one of the 'stores' people, which involved picking up deliveries and placing orders for new lab equipment.
Niall Coates: Having worked in labs previously, Niall took part in lab work almost exclusively. Niall was in charge of sequencing.
Jade Hughes: Partook mostly in lab work, but also looked after the plants with Sarah, and made competent cells with Tom.
Helen Davies: Most of Helen's time during iGEM was spent doing lab work, writing up protocols for the protocols page , sequencing, and leading health and safety .
Tom Sage: Tom mostly carried out lab work, but also was a 'stores guy', managed the liquid nitrogen, and made competent cells with Jade.
Emily Heath: Carried out lab work almost exclusively and was another 'stores' person.
The Supervisors
Dr. Geraint Parry: The man most in contact with the team. Geraint was the main team supervisor, and was in charge of designing primer sequences, ordering the expensive parts, and generally giving advice about how to overcome scientific problems we encountered. Geraint initially organised the team, and led the Cardiff iGEM team.
Dr. Amit Jathoul: Amit was able to give scientific advice when needed and advised the team on how to approach the human practices section early on. He helped with the lab work in Professor Jim Murray's lab after our official 10 week lab period was over.
Dr. Daniel Pass: Dan was able to give the team scientific advice, and offered his help for any wiki problems that were encountered. He attended every meeting with the"

Introduction
Our plasmids are based on pUAST+3xHA, for which works for UAS-GAL4 system in Drosophila, and we transform it to pUAST+oligo which removed UAS and inserted a new MCS for constructing needs.
pUAST-3xHA is an expression vector commonly used in Drosophila research, and it is based on pUC8 vector.
The P3 and P5 are the integrated efficiency elements from viruses, which lead the parts we constructed integrate to the Drosophila’s genome.
Hsp70 TATA is the site of contact for RNA polymerase II, in which will start the transcription of downstream gene inserted into MCS.
SV40 will start the expression of gene mini white, which could change the eyes’ color into red (white in wild type) when we integrate successfully. So it can help us screen out the modified flies.

Pale is a tyrosine hydroxylase, the first and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of dopamine (and eventually, melanin). Dopamine has critical roles in system development. This part is a 452bp sequence in 5' upstream of the ple exon. This promoter starts in cell which express dopamine specifically. So we use it to start the expression of downstream gene GAL4 and GAL80ts in tissue which express TH.

The model for regulation of the mer promoter
The current model for MerR activation of transcription proposes that expression of MerR (in the absence of MerR and Hg (II) in the cell) proceeds from the PmerR promoter. In the absence of Hg(II), the MerR homodimer binds to the operator region within  the divergent  promoter  with binding centered on the dyad symmetrical DNA sequence between the -35 and -10 sequences of  PmerT, slightly repressing transcription of the structural gene promoter, and repressing transcription of merR from the PmerR promoter. This is probably due to MerR interfering with RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding, or open complex formation. PmerT is unusual, it has a 19 bp spacing between the -35 and -10 sites , rather than the 16–18 bp  spacing found in most prokaryotic promoters (Harley & Reynolds 1987). This makes PmerT suboptimal for RNAP recognition of, and binding to, the -35 and -10 sequences, preventing formation of the open complex and transcriptional activation (see Browning & Busby 2004). In the absence of Hg(II), the tight binding of the apo-MerR homodimer to PmerT causes a further bending of the promoter DNA to itself, making it even less ideal for RNAP binding (Ansari et al. 1995). Once the MerR homodimer has bound to merOP, recruitment of RNAP to the mer promoter occurs (Heltzel et al. 1990), and MerR has been shown to cross-link to several subunits of RNAP (Kulkarni & Summers 1999). In the absence of Hg(II) the ternary complex of MerR, RNAP, and merOP represses transcription of the mer structural genes. In the presence of mercuric ions, one Hg(II) per MerR homodimer (O’Halloran et al. 1989; Shewchuk et al. 1989a) coordinates in a trigonal manner to three essential cysteine residues of the MerR homodimer, two cysteines from one monomer, and one from the other (Helmann et al. 1990; Utschig et al. 1995). Hg(II) binding to the MerR homodimer results in both a relaxation of the DNA bends"

Long ago when I studied biology in high school, I’ve been very interested in creating functional synthetic systems in biology. To me, this is really a miracle to introduce a new system into an organism. I believe participating in iGEM2010 will surely seize my horizon in the field of biotechnology. And I find myself become more engaged in studying biochemistry as well as molecular biotechnology through the competition. MIT, here I go!!!

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," separation of proteins by gel electrophoresis, the proteins can be fixed and visualized by different staining procedures. The Coomassie Brilliant blue-staining procedure is a fast and very easy method that is commonly used to detect proteins. Coomassie Brilliant blue is the name of two similar triphenylmethane dyes that were developed for use in the textile industry but are now commonly used for staining proteins in analytical biochemistry. Coomassie brilliant blue G- 250 differs from Coomassie Brilliant blue R-250 by the addition of two methyl groups. The name ""Coomassie "" is a registered trademark of Imperial Chemical Industries.
The Material
Fixation solution
Staining solution
De-staining solution
The Procedure
For staining, place the gel in a plastic container and cover the gel with fixation solution. Shake the gel for 10 min at room temperature. You can also stain the membrane after doing a Western Blot with this technique.
Remove the fixation solution and cover the gel with staining solution. Incubate the gel for 10 – 20 min at room temperature on a shaker.
Remove the staining solution (it can be re-used). De-stain the gel over night with 10 % acetic acid under rigorous shaking at room temperature. Adding a paper towel to the solution speeds up the de-staining process. Boiling the gel in a microwave speeds up de- staining.
Silver staining
Silver staining is a very sensitive method for staining polyacrylamide gels (sensitivity 5 - 30 ng/protein band). It is widely use to check the purity of protein extracts and to identify protein-protein interactions. During staining, silver ions build up complexes with glutamate, aspartate and cysteine amino acid residues of the proteins and thereby get reduced to metallic silver. Thus, the intensity of the silver staining depends on the amino acid sequence of the different proteins and can vary considerably. Moreover, in contrast to Coomassie staining, silver staining is not appropriate for protein quantification (Winkler et al. 2007).
The Material

Workshop with Business Developer Ann Zahle Andersen
For the purpose of getting a business perspective on our project, we met with Business Developer Ann Zahle Andersen. She arranged two workshops for us based on a business model canvas. She encouraged us to view our project, as if we meant to make startup business. These workshops gave us a better comprehension of society’s pull and pushes on a project like ours. This forced us as a team to get to the bottom of what we found important about our project.
Upcoming Meeting with Borgernes Hus
Borgernes Hus i.e. House of the Citizens is a new initiative offered by the City Central Library. The initiative aims to offer guidance and advice to projects such as ours. It is meant to aid Odense in its journey towards the status of becoming a modern Danish city. Unfortunately, the building remains under construction until after our trip to Boston, meaning that they have been busy with the construction while our project was underway. It is for this reason that we, along with director Jens Winther Bang Petersen, agreed that a future collaboration would be the most suitable solution.
It is our hope, that a collaboration with Borgernes Hus will be of assistance to future iGEM teams from SDU as well as other students from Odense."

Finally!!!! We have our second biobrick ❤ ❤ ❤ : the composite part consisting of BBa_K413103, BBa_B0034, TPH1 and BBa_B0015:
We have also got a confirmation for successful transformation of BBa_J04450 from the registry:
Thursday 23rd
Unfortunately, last time our ligation of GFP and the promoters from the Interlabstudy did not seem to have worked. So we started again with a ligation and we ran a gel to see if the digestions worked. In the first lane you can see the backbone and the GFP insert. The second digestion should have shown the same result but did not (for some reason) and the other three wells show us the backbone we opened for the ligation. Let's hope that we get the ligation working this time.

Mind the Gut: Effectors
We have been doing so much cloning that we have run out of backbones! Today our primers for backbone amplification arrived and we have successfully PCR-amplified all three backbones so that we can do lots and lots of cloning!
Interlabstudy
We used some of our successful cultures to make minipreps and to digest to see if we got what we expect (GFP in backbone). We picked several colonies for each promoter and used GFP from cultures from the 13th and from the 22nd of July.
Wednesday 29th July
Interlabstudy
We ran the gel with our 19(!) digestions from yesterday and got very pretty results. So, our ligation using 2A assembly (finally) worked. Unfortunately, we did not make any glycerol stocks of our cultures which means we had to transform our our minipreps into new competent cells again and hope for the best, losing one day for the colonies to grow. But we have the feeling"

--------------------------------------------------
To Do:
Meeting at 9:30 am.
Make dropout plates and LB media
Buy more microcentrifuge tubes AND sterilize them
Purchase ingredients for yeast transformation if not done already
Acquire access to a roller drum
--------------------------------------------------
Need to make dropout plates as well as dropout media.  The plates will consist of dropout for LEU and URA and also URA and TRP.  This will allow us to select for yeast that have successfully integrated both a transcription factor construct (activator or repressor) and a reporter construct specific to each transcription factor.  We can also do a dropout for TRP, LEU, and URA in preparation for conducting Test #2, if we choose.  Media will have to have the same dropouts as the plates, with the addition of a methionine dropout.  This is so that different amounts of methionine can be added.
The scheme for making all of this is as follows:  Mix 27.26 g dropout media and 2 g histidine in 1 L of distilled water.  Then split this into half, adding 10 g bacto agar and 1 g methionine to one of the halves.  This will become the plates.  Each of these 0.5 L volumes will then be split into halves once more.  To one half of each, we will add 0.5 g tryptophan.  This will serve as the plates (A1) and media (A2) for the activator tests because it makes LEU and URA dropouts.  To the other halves, we will add 1 g leucine.  This will create the plates (B1"

Whereas，Currently antibiotics (including tetracycline) detection methods are more complex. Not only the instruments are very expensive, but also the cost of detection is high, which brings many inconvenience to the sample detection. Our group hopes to use synthetic biology to provide a simple, reliable and efficient method for the detection of antibiotics. And we hope it can serve testing organizations and the ordinary families to ensure their food safe.

ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," aim of this experiment was to check if cancer cells effectively undergo apoptosis after incubation with TRAIL and how long the incubation should last.
To test the predisposition of cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis we chose Jurkat cells, which are an immortalized human T lymphocyte cell line; and HL-60 cells, a line derived from acute myeloid leukemia. For a control with healthy cells we used a murine fibroblast cell line (3T3).
Scheme 1. Scheme of the experiment for TRAIL sensitivity.
Methods and Results
Our first experiment consisted in incubating Jurkat and 3T3 cells with TRAIL for 4h and 6h (see protocol about apoptosis sensibility ). Concentrations of 0, 50 and 100 ng/mL of TRAIL were used with each cell line. A positive control for Jurkat cells was applied by incubating these cells with PMA and ionomycin overnight Park et al, 2001 . After that, FACS analysis was performed. To differentiate between apoptosis and necrosis, PI dye was used to stain necrotic cells Rieger et al, 2011 . Apoptotic cells were detected by using Annexin V labelled with Alexa 488 1).
Unfortunately, despite doing several trials in which we incremented the number of hours for incubation (up to 48h) and tried different concentrations of TRAIL , we were not able to replicate the results we found in the literature [ Johnstone et al, 2008 ; Zhang et al, 2005 ]. To see where the problem was, we decided to incubate the cells with 1000 ng/mL of TRAIL over a period of 48 h. If our TRAIL was functional, we would expect to see a change in the cell's morphology after this time, indicating that our cells are apoptotic but our Annexin V-based detection system is not working, despite apoptosis being properly induced. If TRAIL was not functional, we expect not to see morphological differences. After the 48h we saw that there were no differences in the morphology of the cells, which lead us to suppose that probably the sTRAIL we bought was not working as expected.
Our next step was to purchase another TRAIL called SuperKillerTRAIL , for which we found promising entries in the literature [Mandal et. al (2014)] . To check whether this time our experiments were working, we added 100 ng/mL of TRAIL to Jurkat cells and measured the apoptosis at 2 h and 4 h. We observed that in "

Overall, QGEM's first year being involved with the Kingston Science Rendezvous was a huge success, and we hope to continue being involved in the future to help inspire young students to pursue STEM-related careers. We had an amazing time introducing members of the Kingston community to the wonderful world that is synthetic biology, as well as discussing with them details about our 2017 project and how we will be using synthetic biology as a tool for cleaning up the environment.

Bioremediation and Arctic Oil Spill Educational Interview Series
About the Interview Series
This year, the QGEM team has once again partnered up with various professors at Queen's University to offer a new educational interview series on this year's project. This interview series focused on topics regarding bioremediation, oil spill toxicity on marine environments, and biofilm production to supplement the design of the 2017 QGEM project as well as offer a range of perspectives on the applicability of the project. This year's interview series features three Queen's faculty members: Dr. Juliana Ramsay from the Department of Chemical Engineering, Dr. Peter Hodson from the School of Environmental Studies, and Dr. Virginia Walker from the Department of Biology. Through each of these interviews, we were able to gain insight into factors such as environmental safety, scalability, and adaptability of our project, and integrated the advice we received from these interviews into the design of our project for real-world application. You can watch the videos from the interview series on our Integrated Human Practices page .

The bees were transported to the University of Lethbridge and stored at room temperature until 8:00. Prior to experimentation, the tubes were supplemented with a sugar water solution to ensure that the bees would not starve. Following feeding, 2ml of each treatment were added to the 5ml tubes containing the bees and set horizontally along the bench. The abdomen of each bee was immersed in the treatment no matter what orientation the bee took. The bees were observed for 1 hour and subsequently euthanized in 70% EtOH.

We visited the environmental protection department of Zhejiang province. We communicated with the environmental protection bureau about the current situation of the discharge of antibiotics and resistance genes in Zhejiang province. We learned that there is no clear laws and regulations to limit the emission of resistant bacteria and resistance genes in Zhejiang province.We introduced our project to the stakeholders, they supported our project very much, thought of our project is beneficial to human development, to solve the problems facing the world, they put forward their views about the project for many times, to help us more professional, more practical way of looking at bacterial drug resistance.We are aware of the new environmental pollution research of the resistance gene will cause the public and the government authorities to the attention of the genetic pollution, formulate the corresponding policy and strengthen supervision, eventually, genetic pollution assessment, reduce or control the damage to the ecological environment and human health, and promote the healthy development of public health

1. What did we discuss?
We discussed the current state of resistance gene contamination. We learned that at this stage, the factory mainly uses E. coli systems and yeast systems for research. Laboratories are generally resistant to three methods: alkaline cooking, high temperature inactivation, and organic reagents. The bacteria are processed. However, this does not completely eliminate the resistance gene. In addition, she is very supportive of our project, believes that our project has certain value for environmental protection, and provides valuable suggestions for our project products, we have also made improvements.
2. What have we learned and what impact it has on our projects?
Zhang Wei mentioned that if the drug resistance gene in the engineered bacteria is removed         before the cell is discharged, it is valuable for solving the problem of resistance gene contamination, and to some extent, preventing the contamination of the resistance gene, so that it does not So easy to spread. Our project will have great prospects for use in the market; in addition, Zhang Wei has put forward suggestions for our project. If the actual application is to be carried out, the most important problem is that in terms of cost, the cost mainly comes from two aspects. Control system hardware, on the other hand, is from the cost of electricity, electricity is mainly converted into light energy and heat, so there is a need for further cooling systems.

Chemoinduction
Module Integration: Chemoinduction
Module 1 is induced by the addition of a compound, IPTG. This allows the user to 'kickstart' the system once the culture has reached a sufficiently high cell density.
Autoinduction
Module Integration: Autoinduction
Module 2 is triggered by a switch from glucose consumption to a secondary carbon source consumption. When the initial preferential carbon source (glucose) is exhausted, the system will metabolise the secondary carbon source that is available. This switch triggers the promoter that controls the start of Module 2. By knowing the initial concentrations of each carbon source, this acts as a programmable time delay system for the activation of encapsulation.
Thermoinduction
Module Integration: Thermoinduction
Module 3 is initiated upon an increase in temperature. The system is initially grown at 28°C, at which point Module 3 is repressed. When the temperature is raised to 42°C, this repression is blocked, triggering the start of Module 3. This temperature sensitive system was chosen as after encapsulation, chemical induction may be less effective due to limited diffusion.

TecCEM,2018,Team:TecCEM#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," of 4 to avoid chitosan aggregation and solution concentrations of 3 mg/mL                 chitosan and 1 mg/mL TPP. This resulted in an encapsulation with an average size of ~27 nm.                 Like proposed by team TAS Taipei 2016, RFP encapsulation was verified by centrifugation of                 particle suspension and UV irradiation of the formed pellet.
Figure 1. Fluorescence detected after centrifugation of                             RFP loaded chitosan nanoparticles at pH=4.
Figure 2. RFP loaded nanoparticles result from TEM                             imaging at a 150000x magnification in two different quadrants.
We performed a particle analysis in NanoSight NS300 to obtain the particle size distribution. A dot                 graph for a triplicate analysis is presented below.
Figure 3. Size distribution of RFP-loaded                                         chitosan nanoparticles prepared at pH 4
The particle sizes obtained from NanoSight NS300 differ from those observed by transmission                         electron microscopy (TEM), but we hypothesize this discrepancy is caused by particle                         conglomeration rather than different particle sizes. Water at pH 7.4 was the solvent in which                         particles were resuspended for the NS300 analysis, while samples were treated beforehand for                         the observation in TEM. This treatment helps to enable a clear observation of individual                         nanoparticles. This effect may not be reached in an environment like an aqueous solution.

To proof the possibility of modifying chitosan solution pH, an encapsulation procedure was                         carried out using bovine serum albumin (BSA). BSA has a pI ranging from 4.7 to 4.9 as chitosan                         is soluble in acidic environments while acquiring a positive net charge. By adjusting the pH to                         5.5 BSA charges become negative, improving the interaction with chitosan. Encapsulation                         efficiency may be optimized with this adjustments.
The standard curve was derived with the Bradford assay to determine the concentrations of free                         protein in the supernatant after encapsulation and centrifugation.
Figure 5. Standard curve for BSA supernatant                                     concentration of nanoparticles.
Encapsulation efficiency was then determined from:
The resulting efficiency for BSA loaded nanoparticles was 42% from a four encapsulation sample                         assay. BSA has a molecular weight (MW) of 66.5 kDa and a pI of 4.6. As it has been proved,                         encapsulation efficiency increases with decreasing MW. Though BSA has a high MW,"

7. The flow through was discarded and then the column was dry spun at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes.          Note: Dry spinning is important to remove all of the ethanol from the wash buffer because this can interfere with transformation.
8. The column was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and 4 µL of dd H20 was added to the column.
9. The column was allowed to sit for 1 minute.
10. The tube was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes and then the concentration of the DNA was measured via nanodrop.
Ligation Reaction
Purpose: This procedure is done to add a segment of DNA into a vector backbone that has compatible digested restriction enzyme sites. When digestion occurs, a “sticky end” of DNA is left over. This section of DNA is complementary to the other digested restriction site of the backbone or insert. This makes it possible for these nucleotides to connect and form a new plasmid that incorporates the desired insert. The plasmid then can undergo PCR clean-up and it is then ready to be transformed in to a cell.
Procedure:
1. The following solutions were added to a PCR tube
1000 fmole insert - varies
10 fmole cut plasmid - varies
T4 Ligase Buffer - 2µL
T4 Ligase- 1 µL
ddH2O - to 20 µL
** In order to calculate fmoles, DNA(fmoles) = DNA (ng/µL) * 1515/ ( # bp in DNA)
2. The reaction was allowed to run for 5-10 minutes at room temperature.
3. The ligated product immediately was used for PCR clean-up.
Note: This is so that the ligation does not start to generate non-specific ligation products.
Resuspending PCR Primers Protocol
Purpose: In order to proceed to PCR, primers shipped as lyophilized DNA must be resuspended and diluted to a known concentration. This allows consistent and correct amounts of primers to be added to PCR reactions. It also ensures that stock solutions are protected for future use.Modified from: http://fg.cns.utexas.edu/fg/protocol__resuspending_PCR_primers.html
Procedure:
1. Spin down tubes of dried primers (ensures the pellet is in the bottom of the tube)
2. Create a 100 uM solution of primers by resuspending with 10 ul water for each ng DNA in the tube. For example, if there"

To realize high-throughput screening, we designed a device as shown in the figure below. Cells are seeded at the larger area side of the bottle, and the bottle is fixed above vortex through a holder and foam. Then we are going to place this device in cell culture incubator with vortex running for 20 hours, to fulfill long term mechanical force stimulation.

Figure 21. Self-designed Device for Long Term Stimulation
After the first round of mutation and screening, we still need to continue mutation based on the previous result. We will extract genomic DNA of the screened-out CHO-K1 cell, performing polymerase chain reaction with the mutation primer and sending the PCR product for sequencing. Through alignment of the mutated TRPC5 with normal one, we could clearly see which base site has been mutated. Combing with the TRPC5 structure we’ve known, we may explain why the specific site mutation could induce channel’s greater sensitivity to mechanical force. Then we could specify the mutation region every time, repeating then huge-library mutation and high-throughout screening procedure, thus realizing directed evolution.
Ideally, we would like to screen out then mutated TRPC5 with high sensitivity to mechanical force. As for the audiogenetics, we hope to screen out cells which are able to response to specific sound frequency, achieving precise and orthogonal audio regulation.

To test the promoter response to tyrosine repression, we also inoculated cells transformed with the AroF-TyrR construct into various concentrations of tyrosine (ranging from 0 to around 250 mg/L)
Tuesday
Designed and ordered more oligos that we needed. We continued the Quikchanges and ligations from yesterday. Sequencing results came back, which allowed us to confirm MutS mutagenesis working. However, we’ll probably have to jump ship on ParC unfortunately, because there was an internal cut site that we only just now discovered/bothered to check, which means we only ligated in half of ParC :/ Sadness. We continued trying to PCR out, fragment isolate, and ligate the mutators (Dam EmrR, and MutH) into the ARM construct that we can use for FREP. Measured various OD’s from yesterday’s inoculation for the mutation rate assay, plating a humongous number of plates also (literally hundreds of plates). We also got plate reader data for the assay for promoter response to tyrosine repression, though it looks kinda sketch for one of the strains (appearing to be induced rather than repressed).
Happy birthday Ryan! ^This was at 2 AM on Wednesday morning since that’s how long we were in lab for. Stayed in lab till it was already Ryan’s birthday the next day, what a way to celebrate it XD
When the last people finally left lab at 3AM wednesday morning, we were all incredibly happy as we walked out the door. :D
Wednesday
We needed to make more competent cells (which we inoculated last night), but sadly overgrew it, so we’re gonna reinoculate and try again tomorrow. We transformed ARM ligations from yesterday, PCR’d to get linearized amp backbone we’ll need for the final functional TyrR construct (right now it’s on a chloramp backbone, but we need it on amp since the mutator construct will already be on chloramp). We ran colony PCR on the MutL and DinB ligations, both of which luckily showed lots of colonies.

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Jilin_China,2017,Team:Jilin China#geneguard_-_-_TEXT.html," growth curve was drawn to detect the effect of IPTG towards bacteria at indicated time.
3.The recovering effect of CbeA towards CbtA validation
Result:The Abs600 values were measured within TA group and vector group from 0 to 16 hours and the Abs600 curves were drawn (fig.7A and B). After adding IPTG, the growth rate of TA group is significantly larger than that without the addition of IPTG. However, in vector group, the growth rate is smaller.
Discussion: After adding L-Arabinose, bacteria in TA group is poisoned. After that, the addition of IPTG accelerate the growth of TA group. So we think that CbeA can release the toxicity of CbtA in some degree. However, the value of Abs600 is smaller than that of normal growth group at last. We think it is because the measuring time is not long enough. Just like previous observation, in vector group, the addition of L-Arabinose first accelerate then slow down the growth rate. Then the growth rate recovers to normal condition. However, the existence of IPTG lower the growth rate.
Figure 7. Detoxication curve. The growth rate with addition L-Arabinose and IPTG in vector (A) or TA group (B). When OD600 value reached 0.15, L-Arabinose was added to induce the expression of CbtA. After the OD600 values remained unchanged for a while, IPTG was added simultaneous to induce the expression of CbeA. The growth curve was drawn at indicated time.
cellular morphology observation
Result:As Figure 8. shows, bacterial shape in control group didn’t have evident change in 1.5h, 3h, 6h, all in rhabditiform. Arabinose induction group appeared bacilliform in 1.5h. in 3h observation, part of bacterial turned into roundness. In 6h observation, most of bacteria became rounded. The arabinose and IPTG co-induction group appeared bacilliform, in 3h observation, part of bacterial turned into roundness. In 6h observation, most of bacteria were bacilliform.
Discussion:E.coli in control group didn’t express inducted heterologous protein. Thus, they appeared bacilliform. While in arabinose induction group, part of bacteria became rounded in 3h and most of them turned into roundness in 6h. we can consider that toxin CbtA led to the transformation in bacterial morphology.Part of bacteria in"

In an interesting way, only 1 of 4 winemakers was against using genetically modified vineyards to fight climate disorders because they are not well looked upon by society and legally their cultivation is not possible.                                       But, all of the 4 winemakers are agreed to use SofterShock on their vines to fight against climate disorders.
Opinion about our project
Only 3 of them gave their opinion about SofterShock:
Winemaker 1 and 2:“Is an interesting project for the wine industry”.
Winemaker 3 :“It has many possibilities but it is a little far from reality”.
The majority of the winemakers think that SofterShock is safe for vineyards.

Keep in mind that the amount of fluid in a wound is very important.
Also keep in mind that a wound can be in various stages of its healing process.
He saw a lot of potential in solutions that are not directly working towards antibiotic resistance. If we can guarantee that it is safe, it should be a very good solution.
Keep in mind that the condition of the patient also plays a huge role in the healing process.

Insights
Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are indeed most of the time the cause of wound infections. Streptococci however are also problematic.
5% of surgical wounds get infected.
Current treatments of surgical wound infections usually comprise incision and drainage followed by targeted antibiotics. The use of targeted antibiotics however requires results from the culture of wound samples, as possible resistances must be recognized. Before the results of these tests are known, doctors use Augmentin, a type of penicillin. It is used systemically. When the wound smells like Pseudomonas, the antibiotic Ciproxin or bandages drained in acetic acid are used. The use of intravenous antibiotics is burdensome for patients, while the application of soaked bandages is labor-intensive. Therefore, new treatments options are desired.
Follow-up
This exchange confirmed us that our strategy of eradication S. aureus and ultimately also Pseudonomas and Streptococci is relevant.

What type of wounds do you have?
Diabetic wounds which heal slowly. One of the wounds on my feet got infected. It took six (!) weeks of systemic antibiotics to get rid of it. This had a great impact on my well-being.
How are your experiences with continuous wound care?

UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile#Cyanolux#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," global gene expression in Synechocystis aided on finding adecuate promoters 7 , 8 . (Images at right from cited papers.)
To try our approach, we selected various promoters which could serve the purpose.  Our rational for selecting candidate promoters involved amplitude of oscillation, peak activity, hour, absence of restriction sites, predicted strength of promoter according to the role of the gene and reproducibility between experiments (based on the literature available).  We looked for promoters which would have peak expression nearby dusk hours and that were slightly out of phase to optimize production of bioluminescence according to our mathematical models . We prioritized promoters from genes that would be involved in central energetic metabolism as we believe that their expression would be most robust and reliable.
We choose the transaldolase promoter to direct the expression of the LuxAB genes and we found a couple of other promoters which filled the other requirements from above. Pcaa3  and PsigE, the former being already in Biobrick format (courtesy from the Utah team iGEM 2010).
Building constructs
When confronted with the different available strategies to express the genes from the Lux operon in Synechocystis, we concluded that the one that best suits our need is by using integration plasmids. The reason for this is that the available plasmids that replicate in Synechocystis are very large (8 Kb) without even considering the genes we need to include in the constructs (that would sum up to a final 16 Kb aproximately). Such a large plasmid would prove very difficult to handle through molecular biology techniques, let alone transform Synechocystis.
Using integration plasmids also proposes an additional advantage, that is to produce successive integrations which allow accumulation of different desirable elements in the genome. Integration in Synechocystis is undergone through double recombination of homologous DNA which also allows interruption of genes if wanted. In our case we have designed our system to produce suceptibility to copper as a biosafety measure to have further control over our recombinant Synechocystis.
We designed two constructs that have different recombination locations in the Synechocystis chromosome. We named them according to what Utah iGEM team from 2010 proposed for naming conventions :
pSB1C3_IntK
BBa_K743006
This construct is an integrative plasmid which targets neutral recombination sites (slr0370 and sll0337). We selected this locus because it has been extensively used in the literature ("

After many thorough discussions with BIT-China, we fully understood the background of their modeling , and what problems they wanted to settle. Meanwhile, we helped them find some problems. For example, the variable numbers of each equations were inconsistent, and the parameter settings of some equations didn’t accord with the fact.
First of all, by adjusting a series of independent variables and correcting the parameters, we solved the problems above. We gained the numerical solution of the equation by applying the Runge-Kutta Method as well. The method is suitable for differential equation system in different dimensions with high efficiency. According to concentration of hydroxide ion in equation ABCDE group , we got the pH and use the pH to judge the termination condition. In equation C and F, we jumped out the conditions according to concentration of specific substances. The initial value of every equation group is the terminal value of the last equation group. By this way we achieved the whole cycle process and finally got dynamic image of pH.
Fig. 1 The dynamic change of pH during the regulation process
The initial concentration of OH- is 0.2×10-6, and the initial pH is higher than 7, so the whole reaction starts from Group A, and the reactions are, in order, Group A, B, C, D, E, F, A, B, C, D, E, F.
2.  We helped BIT-China to detect protein NhaA and NhaB.
BIT-China’s project this year is about regulating pH, thus they need to express two kinds of membrane proteins, NhaA and NhaB. Taking account of the fact that membrane proteins are especially hard to express and detect, we offered to help them with this part. To this end, we reviewed an amount of relevant literatures and consulted several professors of this field, on which basis we tried various protocols to express, purify and detect NhaA as well as NhaB.
Initially we did SDS-PAGE of the whole protein of bacteria, and the result is showed as below (Fig. 2). To put it in detail, we centrifuged 5 mL bacterium solution under overnight shake culture at 4"
UESTC-China,2018,Team:UESTC-China#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," as a lot of parents. They both expected us to hold this great event next year.
DIY Classroom
a) Making a leaf vein bookmark
Based on cellulose, which plays an important part in our project, we set up our first course called “Making a leaf vein bookmark”. Through the process of making vein bookmarks, the children can easily learn about cellulose which leads to the toughness of leaf veins.
b) Making cell model with plasticine
The second course we set up is called “Making cell model with plasticine”. We introduced the cell model to children simply and took them to make cell models with plasticine. Under our careful guidance, the children succeeded in making beautiful cell models. After class, the children said they were happy to learn the structure of cell today.
Exploring the micro world
After finishing the course of “Making cell model with plasticine”, we led the children to observe the real cells with microscopes. We also offered different types of slices, inviting them to operate the microscope and introduced related knowledge to them.
“Cellulose Go” Stage Play
We have adapted our project “Straw-Degrading Energy E.coli” into a stage play called “Cellulose Go” to explain our project. In the stage play, our protagonist “Cellulose” is an adventurer who is aiming at exploring ways to change herself into clean energy. But she was prisoned by the big devil, lignin. At this time, 3 warriors from UESTC take their plasmid sword to save the cellulose and help her change into clean energy.
It was a play that combined knowledge and fun. The stage play was so interesting that the children all burst out laughing.

We were impressed by a girl who not only gave us the right answer of “Why butanol is harmful to bacterial” but also explained her choice perfectly with the plot in our play.

Therefore, in iGEM 2017, we have decided to investigate the suitability of different CRISPR/Cas systems: SpCas9, SaCas9, AsCpf1 and LbCpf1 endonucleases as therapeutics to target the deletion mutation in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene related to non-small cell lung cancer. This deletion mutation, namely Del(E746-A750), refers to the in-frame deletion of exon 19 of the EGFR gene. The investigation was performed in the PC9 cell line, which is derived from human adenocarcinoma from lung tissue and harbors the Del(E746-A750) mutation in the EGFR gene, instead of using the Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line as in the previous year."

Surprisingly, the glyA knockout greatly increased the amount of hydrocarbons (almost 3x the amount of hydrocarbons per cell) produced compared to both controls.
Putting OSCAR into Action!
Once we had tested FRED and shown that we could use him to detect toxins in tailings samples we wanted to put OSCAR into action in his home the bioreactor. By the end of the summer, we had designed and built a lab scale prototype of our bioreactor system. However, to better understand the needs of the oil sands industry we approached Kelly Roberge , an oil sands consultant specializing in tailings ponds. Through speaking with Mr. Roberge, we were able to better understand the concerns that the oil sands industry has with the use and building synthetic biology systems to solve the challenges they face. In particular, Mr. Roberge had questions that surrounded the feasibility of scaling up our bioreactor to an industrial scale. As it turns out there are a number of considerations that should be made when moving from the lab scale to industrial scale. Particularly, because these transitions can be an imperfect when moving from the lab scale to industrial scale (>1000L tanks). Therefore we thought it would be important to test the feasibility of using our bioreactor, belt skimmer, and Petrobrick, to demonstrate we can produce and isolate hydrocarbons.  These results are illustrated in the video below!
In short, the bioreactor was filled with 50:50 LB:Washington Production Media and we allowed the Petrobrick to grow over a 72 hour period.  Afterwards, we demonstrated how our belt skimmer could be used for removal of the hydrocarbons.  Because the hydrocarbons need to be extracted, we added ethyl acetate to allow for extraction, and demonstrated that our belt skimmer could selectively pick up the organic layer.  Finally we ensured that this organic phase contained hydrocarbons by running this segment on the GC/MS as illustrated below.
Figure 5: The GC chromatograph from the solvent layer which was selectively used with the belt skimmer.  A large peak was observed much greater than any of the others, suggesting that hydrocarbons were being selectively removed with the belt skimmer.
Figure 6: MS data for the peak with a retention time of 12.7 min.  The spectra suggests that the compound is a C16 hyrocarbon, validating that the upscaled bioreactor/belt skimmer combination can be used to isolate hydrocarbons.

The fused gene fragments was afterwards blunt-end cloned into pJET 1.2. Correct cloning was verified by a restriction digest and an analyzing gel (Fig. 1).
As both esaR_cepR_esaI as well as cepR_esaR_esaI_v2 still contained esaR-sequences with deletions site, directed mutagenesis with a primer-pair for each construct was performed to correct the sequence at the respective positions. After the PCR the methylated template plasmids were digested with DpnI to minimize the background still containing the deletions. After digestions, the corrected vectors were transformed into E. coli Top10.
Last weeks OE-PCR of bla_p15A was repeated to obtain more of the fragment. The PCR product was purified and digested with BglII. The gene fragment with the sticky ends was ligated again into pPIC9 that had been prepared last week. After ligation the circular vector was transformed into E. coli Top10.
This week pPIC9_p15A_bla transformation resulted in way more transformants. Plasmid isolation of several constructs was performed. To check for the correct insert the vector was digested with SacI and BamHI (Fig.1) . Correct vectors resulted in ~5600 bp and a ~2000 bp band. Clone 9 was found and used for further experiments.

Background on Last Year's Project
The following diagram summarizes the process used to synthesize a DNA sequence using the Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT).  TdT is an enzyme that adds nucleotides to the three prime end of a DNA molecule.  The idea of creating a DNA synthesizer using this enzyme was originally conceived by Ud-Dean et al. in the paper a theoretical model for template-free synthesis of long DNA sequence[1].  Our project builds off of and improves this idea in a number of ways.  One such improvement was the idea of using heat-labile nucleotides.  Heat-labile nucleotides are nucleotides with a blocking group on their three prime end that prevents polymerases like TdT from adding to them.  Conveniently, this blocking group falls off of the nucleotide when it is heated, thus the name heat-labile.  By using heat-labile nucleotides, TdT can add a single base pair at a time.  By cycling the heating, washing, and addition of different nucleotides in the proper order any sequence can be created.
Project Description for Biological Components
The biology component of our project focused on two main concepts crucial to the functioning of the complete device.  The first of these was to test the idea of bonding DNA to a glass microscope slide as a means of preventing it from being lost in wash steps.  We also sought to characterize different variants of Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) to find one best suited for the synthesizer.  A third but less pursued topic of study was the possibility of making a heat stable TdT variant using an intein system to circularize the enzyme.
We considered a number of chemical means by which one can bind DNA to glass [2].  The system we chose involved bonding DNA with a five prime thiol modified group to a silanized glass slide.  This method was chosen because the silanization process could be carried out in-house and adding a modified thiol group to the five prime end of DNA is a relatively inexpensive modification.  The methodology was based on a paper by Rogers et al. at Johns Hopkins [3].  After the reaction is complete, the DNA should"
EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Our Project#T7 promoter variants#t7make#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," In layman's terms, it indicates how strongly the promoter reacts to induction. Here again, our results indicate that some promoter variants (T7 80 in particular) stand out with respect to this feature. Here too the importance of the lac operator in producing high induction ratios is not to be underestimated.
For the three sets of randomers for T7 with and without the lac operator, we tested seventy-two different variants and characterized their expression using the same IPTG induction protocol as with the designed variants. The goal of using these variants was to examine the range of expressions that can be produced by random mutations as opposed to directed mutations. The results, as presented in the graph, indicate that the designed variants (with and without lac operator put together) produce a much higher average normalized fluorescence than the randomers.

TrinityCollegeDublin,2015,Team:TrinityCollegeDublin#Malaria_-_-_TEXT.html," experience:
Getting drugs to people in Africa is an issue. We are trying to work with the supply chain. We know that when people come to clinics, they take their drugs home and give it to their kids and don’t give the full dose and so they get it again and come back again.
We also interviewed Ingrid Chen, who is academic coordinator at Malaria Elimination Initiative, Global Health Group, at UCSF Global Health Sciences, and had her take on the subject. Even though she also emphasized on the importance of getting the drugs to people in the right dosage and quality at an affordable price, she commented on the fact that artemisinin remains a strong contender in the war against Malaria:
The phenotype for artemisinin resistance is pretty soft. It’s not like chloroquine like in several parts of Africa where people get sicker and sicker. Artemisinin history has shown that it’s an awesome drug- it’s so effective and so fast. It works against young gametocytes which are in the transmission stages. A lot of drugs don’t do that
This means that Artemisinin and ACTs will remain the main drugs to combat malaria in the coming years but of course, with the ever advancing technologies and developments there is greater hope for the future.
Conclusions on the current situation
Ingrid Chen gave a vivid picture of what it was like to face Malaria in person and how most dispensaries treated the disease in Africa for a long time:
Before the Gates money permeated Africa,  I went to an island in Lake Victoria in Kenya. We found this abandoned building infested with bats and faeces and we cleaned it all up. Everybody from the island heard about it and went there. A lot of the people had malaria and typhoid. We got drugs in big bottles and we would write basic instructions on papers on how to take them. We also walked around the island and gave them education on nutrition and sanitation, Malaria and HIV. I thought Africa really needed money. It was really devastating. It was beyond what I could do with my own hands and energy. We also went to a hospital in Kendu. People were so emaciated. There was no treatment for them and they were just lying there waiting to die. They were waiting for us to give them injections. They would get bed sores and were really skeletal. It seemed really, really painful. It’s therefore, very inspiring what Gates has now done; They launched that project because the crops were different every year and the supply was insufficient and it’s changing things out there for the better by a"
Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#diary_-_-_TEXT.html," We also began designing the banner and poster for the UK meetup next week. We had a frantic late night session at Todd’s house to finish off the presentation and poster, in order to send off the poster for printing the next morning at 9am!
Jasmine also skyped NAIT Edmonton and talked about Policy and Practices within the New Application track.
September
Week Fourteen   31/8 - 5/9
In the morning of bank holiday Monday, we had a skeleton crew of three working on the presentation, fine tuning it, ensuring it was the best it could be, and deleting unnecessary slides. We spent the first half of the week preparing for the UK meetup at Westminster University in London later on this week. On Thursday morning we got the cheap and cheerful Megabus up to London, and settled in the Travelodge, practicing the presentation to be performed the next morning.
On Friday, four of our bravest team members presented our project to a plethora of other UK teams. We also supported our supervisor Paul James, who had his own presentation to give on the work of the Exeter Microbial Biofuels Group. We spent the two days of the meetup mingling with other teams and learning about their projects. A huge thank you to Westminster, who were so, so welcoming and wonderful as hosts, and thanks feeding us pizza before the mad dash to the train station to go home!
Week Fifteen   07/9 - 11/9
We are nearing the end and all areas of the project are being pushed to finish. Lab work has been carried out into the evenings and weekends, and this has resulted in some good news - our construct Green J23100 works! In the presence of trigger RNA the switch is on, and in the absence of trigger it switches off. This is major news for the team and provided a much-needed morale boost. Work has begun on turning the constructs into BioBricks, keeping the lab team busy!
Our outreach team has also been working hard, arranging visits to local sixth form colleges and engaging with the public to get footage for our outreach video. We Skyped our team member Amy in Iowa, to keep her up to date on the project and discuss modelling solutions.  The week in general has seen a lot of discussion with our advisors about all aspects of the project. Todd created a prototype test tube in Open SCAD, and we consulted the physics department on the finer details of this prototype.
Lastly, we spent some time arranging our swag to give out in Boston - to see what we have you’ll have to visit us at the Giant Jambore"
Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Society#Questionnaire#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," encouraged to participate. This is likely to be popular, since almost all the students appeared to have enjoyed their first experience.
Students from all backgrounds should be able to participate in all aspects of the project - although restricting students to their specific areas of expertise did not seem to have too much effect on their appreciation of the science, in our personal experience we believe it to be a lot more enjoyable when all the students take the opportunity to step out of their comfort zone and explore new fields - bringing a new sense of perspective that we value highly.
Funding has been said to be an issue facing many teams, that have hampered efforts to both expand projects beyond the jamboree and also to start up new teams. If iGEM could perhaps lower the cost of participation, and/or offer special grants for particularly promising  applications, this could help to over come the problem.
Despite leaving much room for improvement, within a few weeks of research we have managed to identify some key learning points that could be extremely useful for both the iGEM administrators and others hoping to lead similar outreach programmes. The most accurate and efficient way for organisers to find their strengths and weaknesses is straight from the participants themselves. We would like to encourage such practice to optimise outreach, in order to create enjoyable programmes that are maximally effective.

It was observed that interestingly, membrane fractions that had been previously incubated at 30 C presented a dramatic change in Congo Red binding. This proves not only that the AcsAB is active (at least to some extent) in the absence of AcsC and AcsD, but also that it may be optimal for the cellulose synthase to be folded and functional at lower temperatures, as it occurs in the native host G.xylinus.

However, we can tackle this problem by always using fresh batteries or USB power when available. A proper voltage regulator on the LED supply voltage should be considered in the future experiments. We can see from LED9 oldbatt graph that the intensity decreases to a tenth of its original value when the batteries are depleted.
Programming
The Arduino source code used for the measurements is available on our GitHub pages . An example of the source code used can be seen in the .
The most important thing to understand when varying the LED brightness is that the perceived brightness is logarithmic. So the difference between 10 and 20 is clearly visible to the eye, but the difference between 3000 and 4000 is not.

The LED rig is very customisable.
Here's a short video of the rig .
Fluorescence Measurements
Fluorescence measurements were carried out in Thermo Scientific Varioskan. It is a microtiter plate reader capable of exitation and measuring the corresponding fluorescense at user defined wavelengths. All measurements were made with overnight cell cultures diluted to the same cell density. In the LED rig there are 16 different LEDs but also many additional wells that can be used for control samples. That way we can ensure identical conditions between our test and control samples. We always used two controls: blue chromoprotein BioBrick ( BBa_K592009 ) without a promoter as the negative control and a constitutive GFP generator from Measurement Interlabs study ( BBa_I20260 ) as the positive control. All experiments were carried out in E. coli Top10 strain.
Our LED rig is controlled with programmable Arduino Nano computer. The light intensity parameters vary between 0 and 4095 where 0 corresponds to the dark state and 4095 the maximal intensity. Whereas measured intensity depends linearly on this value, the light intensity observed with"

For Monte Carlo simulations would be straight forward to code, for it simply describes the system in computer language then runs thousands of simulations to empirically determine the probabilities. For the Bayesian network it will be a little bit complicated. For an investigation of a DNA and b TALE, we first compute the probabilities of 1 DNA binding, existing on the same space with {b,b-1,b-2,¡­,1} TALE respectively. Then to find the probabilities of n DNA we assume no interaction and apply binomial distribution to get the result from the corresponding 1 DNA case. Thus we obtained the probability of moving from the state of n DNA with m TALE to, the state of n-1 DNA with m TALE (if DNA exists) or the state of n-1 DNA with m-1 TALE (if DNA binds). Then the entire network from n DNA with m TALE to 0 DNA m-x TALE will give us the distribution where we can ask the expected number of DNA binds.
For now the simulation method is very easy to code so work has been started on that front. The Bayesian network approach is very interesting in its own right and we wish to develop the method further.

TPA detection for kinetics measurements:
We transformed WT and variants LC-Cutinase to E. coli BL21 and we raised each one of them in M9+PET medium+CMP+IPTG.
We took samples of 200uL daily from each Erlenmeyer into 96 wellplate anti UV.
We took the plate to a UV table for 1 hour, and insert it into a plate reader for checking the absorption according to the time and date samples, and the change in TPA concentration in time according to our TPA detection protocol. The results show significant raising in the absorption but we didn’t succeed to detect the TPA.
The reasons why we didn’t succeed to detect TPA can be contamination of the medium with another carbon source or maybe because we didn’t filter the samples so there are some materials that can cause quenching and disturb the fluorescence.

Plates containing LB+chloramphenicol were prewarmed to 37 degrees Celsius in the incubator before plating of the transformants.
Cell/DNA mixtures are incubated on ice for 10 minutes before cells are rescued in 200 uL SOC and placed in 37 degrees Celsius shaking at 300 RPM.  The entire outgrowth is then plated on the prewired plates, spread using sterile glass beads, inverted and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius overnight for 16 hours.
Plates were checked the following day for growth of colonies, check out tomorrow for observations regarding the cells.

It was very difficult to find out information that correlates the promoter strength to transcription rate. It was assumed its value to be 10^-9 M*s^-1. (Beisel and Smolke, 2009)
Coding
The model was coded using Matlab.
The code was done in four time intervals using sub-functions for reiterations of differential equations.
The initial conditions of the subsequent intervals were set to be the same as the last value of the previous intervals.
In the first interval, the initial concentrations of all items (R1, R2, R3, Bin, Bout, F) were set to zero and let the system get to an equilibrium. Then, the next three time intervals were calculated sequentially. The second and third intervals represented the lag1 and lag2 phases and the fourth interval represented the exponential and stationary phases of E.coli growth. In the second interval (lag1 phase), it was assumed that no mRNA containing riboswitches was produced, no cell division occurred and the membrane pumps were not functional due to lack of ATP, therefore kr = 0 and µ = 0, and no vitamin B is present in the system. (Alon et al., 2013) Then, the vitamin was “added” as an initial condition of B of the third interval since the cell was assumed not producing any GFP at all (Alon et al., 2013). It was assumed that vitamin B enters the system almost instantly. In the third interval (lag2 phase), it was assumed that there were still no cell divisions, but they grew in size over a long period of time and mRNAs were being produced. Therefore, µ was small and kr > 0. Modeling the change of kr in this period was difficult, so it was assumed to begin at its maximum value. The length of the two intervals is about 3 and 5.4 hours in M9 minimal media. (Alon et al., 2013) In the fourth interval, it was assumed that the cell behaved the same in both exponential and stationary phases due to lack of information on many components in the stationary phase. It was assumed that the division rate of the cells did not change but the death rate caught up and the GFP production rate per cell was not affected by the dead cells.

Danish Ethics and Wiki Workshop at SDU
In the spirit of the iGEM community, we hosted a meetup in August for our fellow Danish iGEM teams: InCell from the University of Copenhagen (KU), and the Snakebite Detectives from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).  A total of seven members from these two teams joined us for breakfast and attended our meetup. This was the first ever iGEM meetup hosted by our university, so we decided to make it memorable. We took advantage of our interdisciplinary team roster, and thus designed a wiki and ethics workshop to aid our fellow Danish teams.
We utilised the broad interdisciplinary profile of our team, to have Emil S. and Lene present the perception of science throughout the history and the meta-bioethical aspects of GMO, respectively. Emil S. has a Bachelor of Arts in History, and Lene has a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. The ethical presentation was purposely turned into an ethical debate, where viewpoints of ethical conduct were exchanged and discussed. After the presentations and discussions on metaethics, it was time for the wiki workshop.
The SDU-Denmark iGEM teams have won the Best Wiki prize several times in the past. As such, we wanted to share the knowledge gained from our university's experience. To facilitate this exchange of knowledge on wiki development, we recruited our current supervisor Thøger Jensen Krogh, to facilitate presentations on how to design a good wiki page. Thøger was qualified for this task through his role as the designer of the SDU iGEM 2013 and 2014 team wikis, both of which won the special prize on both occasions. During the presentation, Thøger had arranged several exercises where the attendees got to mingle, discuss and evaluate their wikis. This resulted in a steady flow of information and constructive feedback between all three teams.
After a long day of learning and discussing, we went for a tour around campus under the summer sun. This concluded in a visit to the roof terrace of the campus dormitory, followed by dinner. It was requested, by our fellow Danish teams"

Active site accessibility of chitosan
For investigation of active site accessibility of chitosan for all three enzymes, chitosan was preplaced in the active site and distance between the ligand and an important residue in the active site of the enzyme was measured in every time step during simulation. In figure 4, the results for active site accessibility of chitosan are shown.
These results implicate that chitosan is not accepted perfectly by any of the investigated enzymes. For an active bound state of chitosan, the distance to Oγ of Serine should not exceed 0.5 nm. In case of CALB (Figure 4, A), chitosan leaves the active site after the first 15 ns and then stays bound to the protein in a non-active manner for about 150 ns with an average distance of 1.2 nm. After this time it leaves the binding pocket area.
For PLE (Figure 4, B), this distance is higher right from the beginning (approx. 2 nm) but stays bound to the enzyme for about 100 ns. In case of FSC (Figure 4, C) chitosan leaves the active site in the first 5 ns of production leading to the conclusion that it is not accepted very well as a product. Interestingly, chitosan seems to re-enter the active site at the end of simulation in the last 10 ns.

For investigation of active site accessibility of rhamnolipids for all three enzymes, dirhamnolipid was preplaced in the active site and distance between the ligand and an important residue in the active site of the enzyme was measured in every time step during simulation.

The overarching goal behind our project is to introduce nitrogen fixation within plants. Through the introduction of this technology, the need for fertilizers would be greatly diminished, which would provide many positive environmental impacts and cut costs.
Most of our fertilizer today is produced through the Haber Process. The Haber Process is widely believed to have triggered a population explosion, fueling the growth of human population around the world from 1.6 million to 7 million. [1] However, there is evidence for detrimental effects surrounding the use of nitrogen compounds. Near areas of heavy industrialization, the development of dead zones have been observed.

Le vecteur se fixe puis il se détache de la cellule.
Le vecteur se fixe puis il se fait internaliser au sein de la cellule.
On peut modéliser cela en fonction du temps et des Constantes d’Association (kon), de Dissociation (koff) et d’Internalisation (kint).
On obtient ainsi:
Avec kon = 5.10^3 M^-1s^-1, koff = 8.10^-3 s^-1 et kint = 5,78.10^-4 s^-1.  Si l’on calcule la constante globale K’, telle que IDP = K’ x t, on obtient K' = 361,5s^-1 Ainsi plus de 360 phages sont internalisés par seconde au contact d’une paroi.
Si l’on compare le temps nécessaire pour internaliser un phages, par rapport au temps d’attente avant que la cellule n’entre en apoptose suite à l’entré d’un vecteur cellulaire (1 heure), il apparait logique de négliger l’internalisation des vecteurs cellulaires (IDP = cte =  360 phages/s ) dans l’équation finale.
Ainsi, avec une efficacité totale de la diffusion des phages, et un temps d’internalisation négligé, on peut dire que la constante d’efficacité λ est égale à 1.

Our Approach
Cornell iGEM’s multifaceted approach to tackling bovine mastitis is innovative and unique. In order to facilitate the development of our novel ideas, we have spent each stage of our project visiting and interacting with experts in the field, making decisions carefully with the feedback of current dairy farmers in mind. We approached the project with human-centered design in three stages [1]. First, inspiration. We derived our ideas from what was needed in the mastitis industry. Next, ideation. We sketched out prototypes and brought them to the farmer. And finally, implementation. We created our product. And at this stage, we knew that what we had created would be useful, because it was, in essence, the farmer, who had directed us throughout the process. Check out our continued discussion on cost, safety, and legality here.

QUESTION: What is the biggest problem facing the dairy industry? FINDINGS: There needs to be better methods for detection and prevention of bovine mastitis.

ProDAIRY
Cooperstown, NY
We began our journey by speaking with Caroline Potter and Rob Lynch from ProDAIRY , a dairy educational organization in New York. We discovered that cows infected with mastitis have to be taken out of the milking process and are treated with antibiotics in quarantine. Even after a cow is cured, they have to be withheld from milking for several more days until all traces of antibiotics have left the milk. The treatment process and loss of milk is costly and Caroline and Rob emphasized the pervasiveness of bovine mastitis in the dairy industry.

Digital Inline Holographic Microscopy - An iGEM Approach
In light of the iGEM competition, the need for analyzing the 3D structures of hydrogel and E.Coli at micrometer scales has arisen. Our project aims at constructing a low cost Digital Inline Holography Microscope (DIHM). The DIHM features on its ease-of-use, lens-less inline structure, and the state-of-art reconstruction algorithms from holograms to 3D visualization with micrometer resolution. The working principle of a DIHM starts with a point laser source, emanating a spherical wave through a pinhole, illuminating the object to be observed, and forming a magnified diffraction pattern at the image sensor, followed by reconstruction algorithms. The holograms collected by the image sensor already contains the difference of intensity and phase shifts, compared with the reference beam from the spherical wave, thus the inline structure without the need of a lens or beam splitter. Our project uses easily accessible hardware components: an xbox 360 pickup as the laser source, DIYouware PCB board for the alignment and laser intensity control (TO BE REVISED LATER), a 1 µm pinhole, a Pi-cam and the Raspberry Pi for taking pictures, and certain 3D printed parts to assemble the microscope. The open source library Holopy is then deployed to reconstruct the 3D volumes from the holograms.
Introduction
Digital inline holography microscopy is a special technique to recover object properties from interference patterns. We explain the working principle in greater detail, but first let us show the basic properties of our DIHM setup in short video. A the light from a bright LED is send through a pinhole. The light waves are spherical diffracted. At small samples e.g. E. coli, the wavefront is scattered. Small fringes are created. The unscattered waves serves as reference template. Everything is captured on a camera screen.
The resulting hologram needs to be computational analyzed. We present  an 'easy-to-use' interface for a commonly used analyzation package in our software section . First, we invited to check-out what we could achieve and then how to get our own DIHM.

To align our DIHM setup, it is necessary to focus the brightest spot of the light source to the pinhole. Due to the tiny dimension of this setup,"
