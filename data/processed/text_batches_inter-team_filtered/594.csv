Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," have, so the system can reach a stable state after a while. The initial differential equations and a simulation with appropriate parameters are both shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. The initial differential equation set and its simulation. For convenience, we use A to represent for the PC chain, B to represent for the TC chain carrying the transcription factor, P to represent for their coalition, and R to represent for the transcription factor. Meanwhile, we use the footnote ""l"" to indicate that the substance has lost the transcription factor. That is, a TC chain out of transcription factor represented by Bl, and a coalition of Bl and A is represented by Pl.
There are product terms of independent variables in the initial equation set so that we can only obtain the numerical solution of it. We use the linear approximation system, obtained by the Taylor series expansion of those product terms, to find the analytical solution which is necessary for our exploring the relationships between system properties and parameters. Although Lyapunov Stability Theory states that the stability of the primary system can be represented by the stability of its linear approximation system only if some conditions are met[6][7], there is no doubt that the whole system will eventually reach a steady state[4].    By letting the equations of the linear approximation system to be equal to zero, we get the function about the relationship between dynamic range and the production abilities of the two chains. In order to be more realistic, we consider the effects of random errors, downstream leakage measurement errors and other factors on dynamic range, which are not significantly related to experimental parameters. In other words, we can regard their mean values as constants and consequently get Figure 3, in which we show the original dynamic range function on the left and the graph of ultimate DR function on the right.
Figure 3. The DR function and its graph. The horizontal and vertical coordinates indicate the production rate of TC and PC chains, respectively(the transfection concentrations of the two chains can be used to replace them in wet experiment), and the color indicates the size of DR.
Conclusion
The figure shows the existence of the maximun value of dynamic range, which is verified by the wet experiment. For instance, we can get the curve of DR when the ratio of the horizontal and vertical coordinates is constant, which is equivalent to the vertical cutting through the origin of Figure 3, as shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. A way to maximize dynamic range.
In conclusion, our model reveals the intrinsic link between production rates and dynamic range. Thanks to it, we now have a clearer way to achieve a higher dynamic range.

Exploring Site-Directed Mutagenesis
To facilitate the engineering of our enzyme, we also investigated a rapid, site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) technique called SAMURAI [5]. This novel method can be used to easily introduce the various site-specific mutations suggested by modeling results. It allows the user to introduce multiple or single mutations in the same gene in only one experiment. In projects such as ours, where one wants many variants of the same gene with multiple modifications, this is a very useful tool. Read more about it here .
Putting Our Enzyme Under Scrutiny
Finally, to test our enzyme we developed several assays that can be used to characterize the wild-type and mutant enzymes. We performed kinetic testing using the model substrate ABTS, to measure the enzyme’s activity and determine its Michaelis-Menten parameters. To estimate the ability of our enzymes to remove SMX, we used reverse phase HPLC to analyze SMX-containing samples that were incubated with laccase for different time periods. In addition, as it has been reported that the degradation of antibiotics can actually result in toxic products itself [6], we decided to develop two assays testing the ecotoxicity of the reaction products: a growth inhibition assay in E. coli and the standardized bioluminescence assay with A. fischeri.
Bringing Our Enzyme Out of the Lab
To make our enzyme ready for implementation, we experimented with several ways to immobilize it. First, we considered using the EnginZyme immobilization system, which relies on the affinity of polyhistidine tags to the EziG resin. The advantage of this method is the low mass transfer limitation, resulting in a higher retained enzyme activity after immobilization. However, this immobilization is not stable enough to withstand the chemically and mechanically harsh conditions in wastewater treatment plants.
The demands on our carrier to be used multiple times before it is reloaded with enzyme, led us to an alternative method that was previously used for this purpose [7]. We chose to immobilize our enzyme on magnetic beads, using an amine-to-amine cross-linking approach with gluteraldehyde as a cross-linking agent. As a proof of concept, we also used biotinylation to immobilized laccase on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads.

Today we have been preparing for the Big Bang Science Fair. We finished and printed off a poster showing how biology, chemistry, engineering and maths are all important in synthetic biology, a Synthetic Biology leaflet and an iGEM leaflet, the front and back of which are pictured below.
Also, we completed two presentations on Synthetic Biology and iGEM which we intend to run on a loop on two iPads for the duration of the fair.
The abstract for our project was written up and a basic form was uploaded to the Wiki. It focuses on how we can improve killswitches, as opposed to the initial killswitch idea of characterising the parts extensively. We intend to submit KillerOrange as our new part, and compare its functionality against that of KillerRed with a continuous culture. We also want to test if it is beneficial to have two killswitches in a system as opposed to one and look at the difference in stability of the killswitch if we integrate into into the chromosome.

In our collaboration with Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (FAFU), we helped them develop a mathematical model of the PSB-assisted phytoextraction process to verify the validity of the new technology in real life application. Their corresponding page can be accessed here . We also produced the structural images of some key proteins for them. The corresponding page of FAFU can be accessed here .
Because of the polarity of microtubule, the two kinds of monomer we display on the yeast may lead to different experiment results, so we decided to display the both monomers onto the yeast, one of which was helped by our collaborators. Besides, we need to see the effect of mGFP on our tubulins, FAFU also take part in the work.

Overview
Heavy metal pollution of the soil is plaguing vast areas of lands across the world. In a process called phytoextraction, hyperaccumulator plants can extract the heavy metals in the soil and gradually make the soil return to its natural conditions. An existing method to accelerate this process is to apply phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) to the soil around the plant. These kinds of bacteria can produce organic acid and release heavy metals from their insoluble states in order for hyperaccumulator plants to better absorb them. However, the growth process of these plants are typically inhibited by high concentrations of heavy metals, which results in low biomass, decelerating the phytoextraction process.
The FAFU team aims to engineer bacillus megaterium, a type of PSB, to produce heavy-metal-binding proteins to counter the downside of its phosphate-solubilizing effect by lowering the concentration of free heavy metal ions in the soil. This modification can promote the accumulation of hyperaccumulator plants’ biomass, which, as mentioned above, will accelerate the phytoextration process.
Different from lab conditions, this process is far more complicated in real-life application in the soil. To help our FAFU collaborators examine the feasibility of their design, we developed a mathematical model to describe and simulate this process.

Modeling the Transcriptional Cascade
The modeling of the transcriptional cascade had several objectives:
to provide the delay team with design guidelines which would maximize the delay time
to asses the affect of parameter variation on the delay time
to determine areas of instability in the parameter space
A schematic of the system to be modeled can be seen below. A full description of the Transcriptional Cascade can be found here .
Transcriptional cascade assembly and overview
The system shown above has one input: IPTG and one primary output: GFP. It is characterized by the delay time, which is measured as the time between the induction with IPTG and a certain expression level in the final product (GFP).
ODEs
The kinetic equations were written out in a Matlab script. A total of ten equations were used: one for the diffusion of IPTG into the cell, one for the binding of IPTG to LacI, as well as four transcription equations, and four translation equations for the various levels of the cascade.
The notation in this system of equations can be seen in the table below:

As no bands were seen for both TYR and CHAP after digestion the PCR reaction to add prefix and suffix was repeated yielding visible bands for both genes. Half of each chosen reaction (reaction 2 for TYR and 1 for CHAP) was purified before digestion, the other half was digested unpurified. Both TYR and CHAP were cut with EcoRI-HF and PstI. Digestions were analysed via gel electrophoresis and the presence of both TYR and CHAP was confirmed (Fig. 2) before both were ligated into pSB1C3 and transformed. Colonies were seen on all plates with more colonies on samples that were cleaned up prior to ligation.

Week 11 (7.9.2015 - 13.9.2015)
Our last week was used for the characterization of the synthases of pCERI after receiving the reporter strain Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 that is used to detect homoserine lactones in its surrounding. Due to a mutated native homoserine lactone synthase the HSL regulated violacein expression gets only induced by external synthesis of HSLs . To proof functionality of our synthases EsaI and CepI, we cloned BBa_K1670000 and BBa_K1670004 downstream of a constitutive promoter and transformed the vector into E.coli BL21 and Nissle 1917. Transformants were streaked along C. violaceum. Additionally control groups were streaked along our reporter strain too. On the one hand the HSL-synthases were characterized individually but on the other hand HSL synthesis was also determined with pCERI in both E.coli BL21 and Nissle 1917. In a first try none of the"

Figure 2. Graphic representation of the toggle switch in ON state only when PhiC31 and gp3 are expressed. Only when the promoter is activated under stress conditions (e.g. Production of salicylic acid or Jasmonic acid), corresponding color protein will be expressed.
This circuit is fundamented on the utilization of an invertible and stress-inducible promoter.  First, the constitutive expression of PhiC31 recombinase keeps the inducible promoter in OFF state (i.e. in opposite direction to the CDS). However, when a Recombination Directionality Factor (RDF) protein expression is up-regulated by a controlled external stimulus, the stress-inducible promoter will be inverted. Once inversion led by RDF-phiC31 complex occurs, promoter acquires the proper orientation to regulate the transcription of a CDS coding a determined color protein (Fig.2). In this situation, if the plant is experiencing some kind of stress the respective stress-inducible promoter will be activated and the expression of a determined color protein up-regulated. Finally, the user will see a change in plant coloration and will allow him to apply corrective measures.
PHYTOBRICKS
In order to build the aforementioned genetic circuits several parts and genetic devices were generated. However, the usefulness of these parts is not limited to the context of our project since all of them have been generated following Phytobricks standard. Thus, the plethora of different Phytobricks we provided the registry with can be now used in any other Plant SynBio project. Bearing that in mind, we have provided iGEM’s registry with four different types of parts.
First of all, the basic parts required to implement PhiC31 recombinase in plant genetic circuits have been submitted. Thus, enabling the possibility of developing more elaborated circuit networks which allow plant to carry out more complex tasks. The implementation of these parts could even confer memory to a determined circuit.
Second, the required parts for implementing an optogenetic toggle switch in any plant genetic circuit have also been submitted to the Registry. Thus, enabling the construction of plant genetic circuits which can be easily and accurately controlled by light stimuli.
Third, different stress-inducible promoters have also been submitted to the Registry, which expand plant genetic circuits possibilities by increasing the number of available signal inputs that can actuate over them (i.e. pathogen presence).
Finally, we have submitted to the Registry new plant-codon optimized chromoproteins derived from Uppsala 2012 Team’s chromoprote"

ChatterPlant’s results
Aiming to establish a bidirectional communication with plants, two different channels for interchanging information with them were developed (these channels are addressed in modules 1 and 2). Furthermore, seeking the goal of obtaining a future sustainable agriculture, a hardware device was designed and built (module 3) and a software tool that facilitates Plant SynBio knowledge was developed (module 4).
Module 1: An optogenetic toggle switch circuit capable of tuning the expression of a desired protein depending on the wavelength of the light stimuli was developed.
Red activation of the optogenetic toggle switch was characterized.
Root-aerial part transport by viral autoreplicative vectors was demonstrated.
Module 2: A Color Code System triggered by external inducible stimulus together with stress-signals was achieved in order to flag any change in their status accelerating corrective measures.
PhiC31 was characterized.
Metabolic load vs unproductive complex theory hypothesis were assessed.
Recombination Directionality Factor (RDF) action was demonstrated.
RDF was characterized.
Stress-inducible promoter feasibility was demonstrated.
Color code protein expression through a viral vector strategy was achieved.
Chromoproteins expression in Nicotiana benthamiana was tested.
Module 3: A hardware device (ChatterBox) was engineered in order to provide a SynBio-based solution to improve agriculture sustainability.
Module 4: PlantLabCo, an open-access platform aiming to unify Plant SynBio researchers work, was developed.
MODULE 1: Human – Plant communication channel
ChatterPlant is a SynBio-based project that works as an interface between plants and humans to increase control over plant physiology. The human-plant communication channel comprises a root-specific modular optogenetic circuit that enables low-cost control on plants´ endogenous gene expression, therefore linking desired physiological outputs (e.g flowering) to precise, cheap environmental signals (light pulses), rather than expensive-to-create artificial environmental conditions.
Therefore, we demonstrated the performance of the light-inducible system based on red/far-red light in order to control the expression on any desired protein (Müller, Na"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," a shorter time frame. In the blood, the reticulocytes mature into red blood cells which increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood. If the partial partial pressure of oxygen in the blood drops below normal due to an excess of red blood cells, the endogenous production of EPO in the kidneys decrease. A low enough concentration of EPO in the blood will trigger macrophages to phagocytose young red blood cells. The process is referred to as neocytolysis and allows the body to quickly respond to changes environmental changes including changes in altitude ( Rice et al. 2005 ).
Erythropoiesis: The Production of Red Blood Cells
With the doping DNA degradation and doping EPO formation determined, the effect of EPO on erythropoiesis, the process which produces red blood cells, is determined. We developed a model using an anemia EPO treatment model by Fuertinger et al. 2012 as reference.
Red blood cells begin as stem cells and progress into different cell stages as they age. As progenitor and precursor cells age, they proliferate or undergo apoptosis at a rate dependent on the cell stage they are in. The resulting growth or decay rates may either be constant or dependent on the concentration of EPO in the blood. Burst-Forming Unit-Erythroid (BFU-E) cells have a very small number of EPO receptors. EPO concentration has no effect on BFU-E proliferation, their proliferation is assumed to be constant. After leaving the stem cell stage, cells stay in the BFU-E stage for 7 days, after which they enter the Colony-Forming Unit-Erythroid (CFU-E) stage. In this stage, the cells divide at a higher rate than in the BFU-E cell stage. The CFU-E cells have a large number of EPO receptors and are strongly dependent on EPO for their survival. Their rate of apoptosis is inversely related to the concentration of EPO. Under normal conditions within the human body, a large portion of CFU-E generated do not survive. As the concentration of EPO in the blood increases, the number of cells which survive increases.
After spending 6 days as CFU-E cells, the cells enter the erythroblasts stage. Here, the number of EPO receptors decline. During this stage, there is no evidence that additional divisions occur when production of EPO increases. For this reason we assume that the proliferation of erythroblasts is constant ( Lichtman et al. 2005 ).
The cells stay in the erythroblasts"

Introduction
For our project, we decided to submit seven BioBricks to the iGEM Registry in the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone. Our submitted parts can be divided into two separate collections (Named as Collection One and Collection Two). Collection One is associated with Engineered biofilm subunit CsgA, while Collection Two is relevant to construction of hydrogenase gene clusters.
All of the constructs are protein-coding parts have been confirmed with gene sequences, demonstrated with expected functionalities, and thus it would be easy to handle for other users. Specifically, in order to make hydrogenase expression more productive, we optimized the gene sequences of 5 hydrogenases parts with the help of OptimumGene™ (GenScript). We changed the codon usage bias in E. coli by upgrading the CAI (Codon Adaptation Index) from a low level (around 0.30) to 0.97.
Characterizations of the parts are included on the webpage of the parts section, but for more information about the submitted parts in real use, please go to Biofilm or Hydrogen page.

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

Only 0.01% of the model's changes cannot be explained by the model. Moreover, accuracy is used to describe the signal-to-noise ratio of the model [4]. The signal-to-noise ratio is 359.0217. Usually, the ratio is greater than 4, and the model can be applied to guide the experimental design and also to indicate an accurate signal. From the significant coefficients of the regression model, it was found that each factor had a significant effect on the yield of butanol.
1.3  Model optimization
The optimization of the model makes the partial derivative of the equation, and the derivative is 0, which constitutes a ternary equation system. By solving the equations, the optimal fermentation conditions are obtained [5]. The optimal results of the model: the temperature was 33.685 ° C, the initial OD was 12.932, the initial pH was 7.993, and the maximum yield of butanol was 0.334 g / L.
The kinetic response surface of butanol synthesis, the three-dimensional response surface and the corresponding two-dimensional contour map are shown in Fig. 2. The figure shows that three levels of each of the two independent factors explore their effect on butanol synthesis in an optimal range. It can be seen from the figure that each response surface has a distinct peak, indicating that the optimal fermentation conditions for butanol are within the selected experimental design range.
figure a and b show the effect of initial OD and temperature on butanol fermentation. Butanol production increased with the increase of initial OD, and then increased and then decreased with the increase of temperature. The change in temperature is more affected by the amount of butanol synthesized relative to the initial OD. Figure c and Figure d show the effect of initial pH and temperature on butanol fermentation. Butanol production increased with the increase of initial pH, and then increased and then decreased with the increase of temperature. The initial pH change is more affected by the temperature and the amount of butanol synthesis. Figure e and f show the effect of initial OD and initial pH on butanol fermentation. Butanol production increased with increasing initial pH. The initial pH change is more affected by the initial OD and the amount of butanol synthesis.
In summary, the three independent factors affect the size of butanol: initial pH > temperature > initial OD. If the temperature is too high or too low, the initial pH is too acidic and"

About: I am currently entering my third year in BioChemical Engineering at Queen's University. I garnered an interest in iGEM due to my fascination of the field of biofuels, especially the use of engineered algal strains for biodiesel production. As a volunteer member of the QGEM, my focus is mostly on the technological aspects of iGEM: maintaining the Wiki, compiling data, and animations. Outside of QGEM I'll be working on the Queen's BAJA SAE car, as well as getting some of the paperwork filed for a new chemical engineering design team a few of my friends and I are developing. In my free time I'll be playing my guitar & Halo 2, surfing the net, and of course doing a metric tonne of homework.

About: I am in my fourth year at Queen's after transferring degree programs from chemistry to biochemical engineering. iGEM is a competition that grabbed my interest immediately because of the unbelievable possibilities synthetic biology makes available. Solving problems in general is incredibly interesting to me, and solving them in unconventional or obscure ways is even more exciting. I came into iGEM with a few project ideas like including engineered microbes in specific waste water treatment processes, creating a more conclusive indicator test for aggressive prostate cancers, and creating some microbial suspension which could be ingested and used to break down cellulose in the human stomach, a hugely abundant source of food and energy. For iGEM this year I was a 'wet labber' responsible for creating, engineering and testing our Heme/Heme-Oxygenase system which would be used as one of our plaque degrading effectors. In order to keep from going nuts from talking with bacteria all day I bar tend at night, I compete in triathlons and varsity rowing for Queen's, I am deeply in love with traveling and hosting travelers, and I have just entered the wonderful (and expensive) world of skydiving!

We show the ratio (C/D) as follows.
The ratio of RNA cyclization was 2.5%. The abundance ratio of stepⅠwas 4.7%. In other words, the rate of reaction was 95.3%. The abundance ratio of stepⅡwas 92.8%. In stepⅡ, the sequence of the 5’intron attack on the 3’intron. It shows that this reaction is the rate-limiting step in the process of circularization. Why this step is the rate-limiting step? It is conceivable that because distance of 5’introns and 3’intron is far. So we think that the shorter protein coding gene is, the more efficiency of RNA cyclization increase. If you can streamline this step, usability of the circular mRNA may widen.
Support from other team
Because our theme “Circular mRNA” is qualitative experiment, we had a hard time with Modeling. That’s why a member of UT-Tokyo advised us the Modeling about our theme.
Growth curve of E. coli and overexpression of protein by circular mRNA
→How much does the synthesis of long-chain protein influence growth of E. coli?
By comparing our result with control (empty vector or non-plasmid), we decide parameter. We also learnt it   from UT-Tokyo that past studies will be good references for these population dynamics.
https://2013.igem.org/Team:British_Columbia/Modeling
Does the strength of circular mRNA depend on the length of exon?
If we can make a parameter which shows how long the insert is the most stable when we had Circular mRNA, this will be helpful for the correction of the model.
We greatly appreciate UT-Tokyo taught us Modeling despite their busy.

It was probably due to the permeability of cell membrane was limited for NH4+ and Cl- ions. Eventually Glutamate at concentration of 10mM supported cell growth the best and thus chosen as part of optimal environment condition.                              With CASAmino solution’s buffering utility, the pH was controlled little bit below 7 but close to 7.                              To protect the iron core of the nitrogenase, temperature of 30°C and Anaerobic were both determined not for cell growth but for nitrogenase activity testing, which is the next phase.
Phase 3: Measurign nitrogen fixation activity under determined optimal conditions in E. Coli Strains.
-2014
We used  an Acetylene Reduction Assay to examine the nitrogenase activity for JM109, BL21(DE3), Top10, DH5α at different cell density referred by OD600 values.                              Acetylene (C2H2) has an triple bond similar to that of atmospheric nitrogen (N2). Because of this structural similarity, the nitrogenase enzyme can cleave the triple bond in acetylene just as it would cleave the triple bond in N2. Ethylene (C2H4) is produced from this enzymatic activity, so a gas chromatograph can be used to detect the presence of ethylene and, consequently, nitrogenase activity.
Results
Of the five E. coli strains tested, JM109 and WM1788 showed strongest nitrogenase activity.
The linear relationship between nitrogen fixation activity and time matches that seen in nature.
Optimal conditions determined:
Glucose as carbon-source
glutamate as nitrogen source
LB as inoculating media
minimal M9 as testing media for GC assay

Constraints
For the parameter estimation of the optogenetic kill switch, all the assumptions mentioned in the above sections hold. Further, we assumed a lumped mazEF complex formation, where we disregard potential intermediate stages of complex formation. In addition, we defined the following constraints:
As we have literature data supporting that mazF degrades faster than mazE 5 , we exploited this as a constraint in our parameter generation procedure.
Another constraint was added to the system as the ratio of free A/T is assumed to be bigger than one 6 under non-inducing conditions.
Lastly, we added a logical constraint which describes the underlying biology of the system. Under the highest simulated light intensity, the A/T ratio has to be smaller than one to show that toxin wins over antitoxin and kills the cell.
Results
We can show that our parameter estimation procedure found two parameter sets, out of 1,000 sampled sets, which satisfy these constraints as shown in Figure 15 and 16.
Figure 15. Response of the two parameter sets which satisfy the conservative constraints. The legend in pDusk is also valid for pDawn.
The two parameter sets give us an indication where in parameter space we will have to focus on for further analysis. These two sets also both describe a functioning pDusk and pDawn based optogenetic kill switch. Although, one might argue, that set number one (blue and red lines) is to be favoured as the change in mazE in pDusk compared to the change of mazE of set two (yellow and purple lines) in pDusk is higher and thus more likely to function and kill the cell. With this information, an indication can be given on which relative kinetic parameters are needed to make the system work.
Figure 16. A/T ratios per light intensity of the two parameter sets which satisfy the constraints. Where blue = set 1 and red = set 2.
When plotting the A/T ratio against the increasing light intensities, it becomes more evident that parameter set 1 has a higher change in the A/T ratio within pDusk between different light intensity conditions and is thus to be favoured. To further evaluate these findings, more data from the lab is needed.
Methods
Adding the mazEF module to the pDusk/ pDawn system requires another 10 parameters to describe the system. We constructed our parameter estimation similar to the parameter estimation of the previously described procedure and evaluated the system based on the constraints described above. It should be noted, that this is a qualitative evaluation and is not backed"

Brown,2010,Team:Brown#Project#Light pattern#Logic design_-_-_TEXT.html,"-Lausanne's work from last year is the essentials of the Conversion Module: <partinfo>BBa_K191003</partinfo> generates the LovTAP protein and <partinfo>BBa_K191005</partinfo> is the response system to transmit the conformational change of LovTAP to a change in transcriptional output. <partinfo>BBa_K191003 SequenceAndFeatures</partinfo> <partinfo>BBa_K191005 SequenceAndFeatures</partinfo>
This system functions as follows: LovTAP is produced (given IPTG is in the culture - this must be changed for the final product to a constitutive promoter) and is expressed to saturation in the cell. When the cell is not exposed to 470nm(light), the TrpR promotor is on, and TetR is expressed, which represses the p(TetR) promotor. Thus, there is no expression the proteins downstream of p(TetR) when the light is OFF. When the light is ON, LovTAP changes conformation to its active form and represses the TrpR promoter. This ceases expression of TetR, which in turn no longer represses p(TetR), and the protein downstream of p(TetR) is expressed. This general system forms the sort of ""grand central"" of our circuit, and we will revisit it later with the modifications made to it by our team when considering the circuit in whole.
Memory Module
The memory module has the requirement of switching from one, original state, to a new state given some input. Furthermore, it has to remain in that new state, even if the input is taken away, thus ""remembering"" what has occurred. Again, we looked to past teams' work, and found the bistable switch of team PKU '07 to be a perfect match for what was required. The following two illustrations are taken from PKU 2009:
Situation when the system has no memory
The bistable switch has two components that give rise to the two distinct states. In the ""no memory"" state, or original state, the switch predominantly produces CI434, a repressor of the PRM promoter. Thus, the system is dominated by the PR promoter, and GFP is produced, signifying state one (and no memory). However, when CI is introduced, the PR promoter is repressed and the PRM activated. Because expression of CI is also controlled by the PRM promoter, this acts as a positive feedback loop to stably switch the bistable part to state"

Welcome to the world of creation and imagination!
As the world enters upon an age of human nature destructions, of resource starvation and the ignorance of ecological balance, the earth is more and more under the control of human beings, there is less room for the survival of animals, various kinds of microorganism are being killed and regenerated circulatory in laboratory.
However, there exsits a special kind of bacterial, who is too diligent to be willing to be controlled by human, they use their magic power to learn certain skills to being survived successfully. Reviewing their developmental history, their ancestors made great contribution to the world under successive human experiments. They show us the meaning of Biobrick, they grasp the ability to adapt themselves better to the outside world, they know how to realize their value furthest and greatly, they are the E.COLI!
Now let us begin the E.COLI magical mystery tour~~
Input
In order to give users a clear and definite goal on input. The whole input process is divided into two main steps: Compartment Construction and Plasmid Construction. In the first step, users only need to focus on the input of environmental condition, compartment, spatial structure of compartments, and the species contained in each compartment. In the second step, only plasmids are editable, and users can click on each of them to assemble biobricks into functional device. Of course, useful tips will be given along with your input process.
We here give a design of our user interface of input. It is under construction.
Step#1 Compartment Construction
Left:
When you enter in our interface,the first step is to choose the environment of our system . A flask is like a container , all the  reactions are happening in it . After that you may pick a appropriate condition for our lovely E.Coli . One E.Coli isn't enough for some specific problem , so you have to decide how many you will pick up . Small molecule is also available in our interface , you can decide  their amount per second . They can be static or changing all the time . It's up to you !
Right:
You can choose E.Coli and set their parameters one by one . Plasmid must be set up"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Rutgers,2011,Team:Rutgers#Etch a Sketch_-_-_TEXT.html," further increasing transcription from pRM. Finally, T7 polymerase levels will increase, allowing the creation of mRFP1.
Activated
        After entering the Activation 2 state, the light may be removed, and the cell will continue to produce mRFP1.
Mapping the circuit back to the engineering problems
Light - Our light response depends entirely on LovTAP. If it proves ineffectual, we will either need to introduce mutations that will help its function, or switch to a different system.
Sensitivity - The amount of time necessary to keep the laser pointer on the bacteria should be related to the time it takes for the locking switch to flip to the activated state and the length of time LovTAP remains in its activated state once illuminated. The former should be small by design of the switch. The latter may be improved by mutations or changing to a different light response system, if necessary.
Selectivity - The circuit should respond to only to wavelengths and intensities of light that can flip LovTAP from the dark state to the light state. Since LovTAP responds primarily to blue light, we may need to work in red ambient lighting.
Speed - The delay from the moment the locking switch is activated to the appearance of color will be related to the time it takes for the bacteria to synthesize mRFP1. This will hopefully be minimized as transcription from T7 promoters is very high when T7 polymerase is present.
Noise - Unwanted splotches will be created if there is unwanted transcription from the T7 promoter or if the locking switch is accidentally turned on by unwanted transcription from the pRM promoter. The former should be minimal as the T7 promoter is very specific to T7 polymerase. The latter should be reduced by placing the locking switch on a low-copy plasmid.

Summer Workshop
This was the second conference put on by the Alberta Innovates Technology Futures for the three iGEM teams from Alberta. It was great to be able to communicate with the other two teams and see how their projects were progressing. On Saturday we spent the day with two entrepreneurs, and on Sunday we presented our progress thus far and sat with experts to discuss the future of our project.
Saturday
On Saturday, we participated in an entrepeneurship workshop hosted by Randy Thompson and Don Chapman.  Randy and Don taught us about market analysis (the first step in creating a successful company), the value of believing in your product, marketing, sales, 30 second sales pitches, how to be an interesting speaker, intellectual property and other start-up costs, and the make-up of an entrepreneur. They also amused us with their stories and we learned a lot.
Sunday
The day began with each of the Alberta iGEM teams (that is Calgary, Lethbridge, and Alberta) presenting mock iGEM presentations on their progress so far. The teams were then questioned by a panel of judges and by the other teams about the various aspects of their projects. This was then followed by sessions wherein each team sat with an expert who advised them on how to improve their presentations and provided guidance on various issues of the projects. We received quite a few helpful tips from the guests and are very thankful that they took the time to sit and discuss our project with us.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#FerritinJournal_-_-_TEXT.html," as a reporter enzyme.
We also met with two U of C professors in nanoscience to discuss the feasibility of our magnetism idea. Dr. Max Anikovskiy, an instructor from the nanoscience program, allowed us to use a 50 lb. pull force rare earth magnet to manipulate native horse spleen ferritin. However, there were no changes over a three hour period. We also spoke to Dr. Simon Trudel from the nanomagnetism research group. He seemed to think our idea was feasible, but might require optimizing with respect to the solvent system in which the particles are dissolved. From both these meetings, it emerged that modelling the fluid dynamics is beyond our capabilities. Our best bet is to test these ideas experimentally, one step at a time, by first synthesizing and testing magnetoferritin.
MAKE A FIGURE OF LATERAL FLOW STRIP
Week 7: June 10 - June 14
We visited the Cargill Meat Solutions plant and discovered that our system would be most applicable in identifying cattle who are super shedders, which would require our system to be quantitative. One possible approach utilizes a fusion of TAL and a reporter protein, although this system may subtract from quantification due to binding of multiple DNA strands to the nanoparticle.FIGURE?? An alternative approach utilizes a ferritin-TAL to immobilize target DNA, which can then be visualized through a second TAL fused to a reporter enzyme. FIGURE??
One question we currently have is in the construction of the ferritin genes.  Lee et al. (2002), and Huh and Kim (2003) have successfully created heavy-light chain ferritin subunit fusions, allowing better control of the subunit ratios. Therefore we intend to use a similar approach as it would halve the number of subunits involved, and in turn halve the number of bound TALs, reducing our concerns about steric hindrance. E-coils will be bound to the N-terminus due to its presence on the outside of the nanoparticle,  ensuring exposure to the environment (Luzzago and Cesareni 1989).
Upon further investigation, we found that the creation of Prussian Blue ferritin nanoparticles involve the use of potassium ferrocyanide, a compound that has the potential to evolve hydrogen cyanide. These fears were abated upon contacting members in the nanoscience department, stating the conditions and concentrations involve in our experiment were too low to be of concern.

Part A: Constitutive promoter
Part B: amber stop tRNA.
Linearized plasmid: pSBA1A3
Since the RNA made from the amber stop tRNA gene will not be translated into proteins, a RBS in front of the gene is not necessary. I therefore  ligated the promoter directly to the gene.

Media
We ordered a new cell line, NEB Express Iq, for testing against 10-ß.  NEB tech support recommended the Iq strain as an alternative to 10-ß, claiming that it had no auxotrophies and should grow without amino acid supplements.  A test was done in which Iq and 10-ß were grown in BG-11 without ammonium chloride and with 1.0 mg/mL (18.7 mM) ammonium chloride.  In both cases the media contained 50 mM glucose.  This test was done with 100 mL cultures in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks.  The results indicated that Iq cells could not grow with ammonium chloride as the only nitrogen source.

Trc Promoter
LT:Half of the PCR products were loaded onto a 1.2% gel to verify that the Trc promoter was successfully isolated. Results: TRC was successfully isolated by PCR.
Remaining PCR products were combined and run on a 1.2% gel. The band correspond to the Trc promoter was cut out and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction of PCR products protocol.  Nanodrop analysis was then used to quantitate the amount of DNA present.
Trc promoter was cloned into the TOPO2.1 PCR vector, transformed into One Shot Top 10 Chemically Competent cells, and streaked onto LB-Amp plates with x-gal.  Control cells were also plated on LB-Amp plates with x-gal. Results:  The transformation seems to have been successful. There were both dark blue and white colonies.  The control cells contained only blue colonies!
Fifteen white colonies (#1-15) were selected. Half the colony was single colony streaked onto LB-Amp plates for purification and the other half was inoculated into LB-Amp broth. The cultures were purified using QIAquick miniprep and analyzed using the nanodrop. An Eco RI and Pst I restriction digest was set up  and run on a 1.2% gel to confirm that the transformation was successful.  Results: The restriction digest did not confirm a successful digest. However, 4 colonies were selected from colonies #1-15 to continue.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

Community Outreach
Outreach: St. Elizabeth Seton Junior High with UrbanTundra_Edmonton iGEM Team
Team member Mirat Sojitra presenting the concept of synthetic biology to junior high students at St. Elizabeth Seton Junior High, Edmonton, Alberta.
As part of our efforts to reach out to the community, our team collaborated with the local high school iGEM team. To celebrate this, we organized an event at a local junior high school, St. Elizabeth Seton, and introduced the concept of synthetic biology.
The children were not fully aware of how the properties of everyday items can be used to create scientific reactions. A protocol using household belongings, designed by the high school iGEM team, showed how it is possible to extract DNA from strawberry. This was very successful, with the junior high school students receiving hands-on experience. We were thrilled to collaborate with the high school team and also inspire the next generation of students by introducing them to iGEM and synthetic biology.
Outreach: SCU China iGEM team 2016
In order to gain a better global understanding of intellectual property rights in emerging markets. Our team lead, Dawson, was in Chengdu, Sichuan, China in July to visit family relatives. While in China, he couldn’t help but seize the opportunity to meet with SCU-China iGEM team in person to exchange ideas. This eventually lead to a knowledge exchange where both teams researched on copyright, patent and trademark laws in the respective countries. In the end, we exchanged our information to compare and contrast the nuances in regards to IP rights within each country.
We realized that both respective countries had their differences in IP laws due to cultural differences, and we devised a mock business plan in order to accommodate for the differences in intellectual property laws to ensure our venture is successful in an emerging global marketplace."

The purpose of the questionnaire was supposed to give us a better idea of how much people know about GMO and what the common opinion is about these organisms. Furthermore we want to know if people see any problems with eating  bacteria.
The questionnaire was answered by 271 people from Denmark, the United Kingdom, Ghana, Singapore and Argentina. We didn't use the data from Singapore as they were only four survey participants. Most of the survey participants were between 19-25 years old and most of them had a natural science or  health science as a field of study. In the end ofour questionnaire, we asked for elaborations of the ethical aspects regarding our project. Some of these are displayed as speech bubbles accross the wiki section.

Denmark
We received 152 answers from people living in Denmark.
The data seen above shows that more than 82 % of the survey participants had heard about GMO before and would eat bacteria if it would be nourishing to them. The data show a tendency of open mindedness regarding GMO as a food source in Denmark.
We received very different answers to the question: Could GMO help reduce malnutrition in your country? Many of the survey participants pointed out, that malnourishment isn't a problem in Denmark, which might explain, why most people answered Maybe and I don't think so.
United Kingdom
We received 22 answers from people living in United Kingdom.
All survey participants from the United Kingdom had heard about GMO before. Please note that the surveys were completed during an iGEM Meet-up, which means that all asked people were familiar with synthetic biology.  72.7% would eat bacteria, when it is nourishing, but only 22.7% think it could help reduce malnutrition in  the United Kingdom. Based on this low percentage we wonder if many of the survey participants don't regard malnourishment a problem in the UK.  The answers from Denmark and the UK were difficult to interpret and conclude from, due to the fact that both countries primarily answered maybe and I don’t think so to the question: Could GMO help reduce  malnutrition in your country?
Ghana
We received 36 answers from people living in Ghana.
As in Denmark and the UK, most of the survey participants had heard about GMO before, and most of them would eat bacteria, if it would be nourishing. But the percentages of people who answered Yes to both questions  are clearly lower, compared to Denmark and the UK. On the other hand, 27.8"

In the presence of formaldehyde the yellow and fluorescing diacetyl-dihydro lutidine is formed. In the reaction catalyzed by the Mdh methanol is converted to formaldehyde which can be detected by the mentioned assay.
First, the different cells as well as their respective fragments and lysate supernatants were screened for formaldehyde production. The samples were taken 6 h after induction from shake flask cultures. Several cells, fragments and supernatants showed a production of formaldehyde but the Mdh activity in the intact cells was higher for each strain.
The formaldehyde assay was repeated only with whole cells and additional samples taken 20 h after induction. Moreover, the assay was conducted not only at 37°C but also at 30°C. The GlgC expressing BL21 Gold was used as a negative control. Again, in several strains functional Mdh could be detected and some general conclusions could be drawn:
More formaldehyde was produced in the samples taken 6 h after induction
Strains cultivated at 37°C show a stronger response than the same ones cultivated at 30°C
The assay works better and faster at an incubation temperature of 37°C
Comparison of different strains at varying cultivation conditions.
The highest activity could be shown in BL21 Gold (DE3) at a cultivation temperature of 37°C in M9 in a sample taken 6 h after induction. Fluorescence measured at a gain of 75.
By far the highest formaldehyde production was observed in the BL21 Gold (DE3) cells 6 h after induction cultivated at 37°C despite its formation of inclusion bodies.
To show the significance of the production of formaldehyde the assay was conducted with the Mdh expressing BL21 Gold (DE3) cultivated in the labled methanol experiment along with the BL21 Gold (DE3) expressing GlgC as a negative control, both in multiple replicates.
Formaldehyde formation during in vivo assay
Expression of Mdh and glgC as a negative control (4.5 h after induction). Both constructs were incorporated in vector pSB1A30 and the BL21 strains were cultivated at 37°C. Each value is made from at least 35 replicates of each construct. Fluorescence measured at a gain of 100.
The Mdh expression strain showed significantly more formaldehyde production indicating a functional expression of the Mdh.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved"

Having a dimple in my cheek is what I need the most for iGEM. I coordinate all the outreach activities we do and present our ideas to the public, therefore my smile with dimples is what helps the most. People love them and as much as I love smiling. Aside from meetings and presentations, I work to secure funding and also work in the laboratory. Next year will be challenging for me, because I will move to London to study Genetics of Human Diseases at UCL.
Mykolas Bendorius

Bachelor of Biochemistry
Together with Mykolas I coordinate and plan lab work. iGEM is a great opportunity to learn how to control all the project. People say, that I have good critical thinking, so it is an encouragement to make sure all things go according to plan. This year I will start Masters studies of Biochemistry at the University of Copenhagen.

Integrated Human Practices
Finding an innovative and reliable solution to a problem does not happen in a vacuum, on the contrary, there is a continuous relationship between our work and the world. On how our work affects the world and how the world affects our work. Acknowledging this, we went out into the world to get feedback on many aspects of our diagnostics.
To review the feasibility of our project, and to continually improve our final product, we contacted stakeholders either invested or interested in the issue of snake envenomings.
Here we summarize the feedback that is of both technical and economic nature:
- Rapid identification of snake species will give valuable insight into the proper course of treatment
- Our approach on choosing a project has been a pragmatic one that is, avoiding having a solution without a problem.
- We looked into how we could meet the requirements for our solution to be viable for treating snake envenoming.)
We looked into how we could meet the requirements for our solution to be viable for treating snake envenoming.
Andreas Lausten postdoc, VenomAb, an entrepreneur and researcher, is using a rapid and effective manufacturing process which includes human phage display libraries and synthetic biology, to produce monovalent antivenoms, targeting specific snakes. He has given us feedback on several aspects of our project, including the design of our snake detection device. The concrete technical feedback relates to rapidity of our prototype, means of lowering costs and issues surrounding a device employing a single variant of an oligopeptide for screening.
- Rapidity: He deliberated the importance on the rapidity of the response. This led us to investigate the amplification mechanism of the signal. This is important, as certain snakes have more potent venoms and that detecting the type of envenoming prior to symptoms begins to show would be valuable. In this case, the earlier the treatment, the better. Hence, we went ahead and modelled the amplification mechanism using x-Gal.
- Low cost: Furthermore, he emphasized on the importance of our device being a low-cost detection system.
We met this requirement in two ways:
- Disposable lab equipment: Our prototype consists of modules that all are based on standard disposable tubes and vials. This is to ensure that the prototype can be used across clinics, countries and continents. It will also enable the rural clinics, or those with restricted access to state of the art lab equipment, to use the device as a means of detecting snake envenoming.
- Complexity of venom: Our device is measuring the proteolytic activity of the venom."

This summer, we modified the cGMP metabolism in mammalian cells using techniques of synthetic biology. This could potentially be developed into molecular medicine for the treatment of ischemic heart disease and hypertension of the lung.
In our Human Practice part, we investigated the law and regulation in China concerning gene technology, especially the gene modification and synthetic biology.
To a certain extent, it’s undeniable that gene modification is equal to gene therapy, and our project is about gene therapy to myocardial ischemia, imperceptibly we may put ourselves in the center storm of ethical and juristical issues. At the same time we want to have a deeper perspective about the ethical and juristical issues in China, so we choose to have dialogues and communications with expects in law and biology and amateur philosophers who have a greater critical thinking of moral and ethical issues, and thanks for their generous help and assistance, we finally get a complete result in the Human Practice.
A. Dialogues
Dialogues with amateur philosophers
There is an online philosophy discussion group with more than 60 people who have great interest and we have some debates whether synthetic biology based on the synthetic gene circuits makes people machine if synthetic biology is applied to human being.
The Ship of Theseus, a theory proposed by Plutarch, is one of the oldest paradoxs that we can search for help in demonstrating the question whether a man can still be defined a human being if his gene has been modified and in what degree modification can a man be ruled out of definition of human. The ship with vicarious components is definitely different from the initial one, but it’s no doubt that it was not a brand-new ship either. Well, that is a diploma that the gene modification can bypass.
Actually, the definition what human being is has perplexed people for a long time since human being come to exist. The definition of natural person has exhausted us, let alone non-natural human. But sooner or later, based on the development of gene therapy, the technique used to modified human being will come true and what should we do to distinguish natural person from non-natural human? By the proportion of gene modified or by the number of genes modified, that is a question.
We are really glad to see Merry"

Results of Colony PCR
Colony PCR of 3 iGEM IL 2015 Devices.  Devices show high amplification at 1200 kb roughly, expected size of insert using VF2/VR amplifying primers from plasmid backbone.  From left to right: NEB 1kb DNA Ladder, 3 Digestions from Vinson Lam, Device-Colony 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 3-1,3-2, 3-3, 3-4, and negative control (sterile LB only--no colonies).
Colony PCR results indicate a positive screen for all 4 colonies in each device transformation. Some nonspecific binding does occur, but opportunistic binding and amplification of a 1 kb average insert suggests presence of the insert in between the VF2/VR binding regions.  This correlated with an insert approximately 950 bp in length with added overhangs, which is what we expect for an insert of the device length.
However, the negative control was disconcerting, with a 1.5 kbp band generating.  No band was expected in the negative control, suggesting template contamination of the LB, water, master mix, primers, or equipment.  Care must be taken to decontaminate and discard all contaminants from now on.  However, specific binding of the insert at the correct size in the clones indicates proper presence of device"

Though of particular importance in India and Bangladesh, contamination of ground water by arsenic is a global issue with its presence being felt in over 66 countries of the world spanning all continents. Argentina, Chile, Mexico, USA and China are among the other major sufferers of the crisis along with India and Bangladesh.

HKU-Hong_Kong,2010,Team:HKU-Hong Kong#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," from bacteria growth of cells where activity of the killing genes was suppressed (i.e. with the presence of arabinose), because of this inhibition the unexpressed genes had no control on cell division and growth resulting in the relatively rapid increases to the curve. The curves that appear more flat are those where the expression of the killing genes were induced (by the presence of IPTG) meaning that cell lysis occurred, resulting in cell death. These curves show very low optical densities which indicate almost nonexistent bacterial growth in those samples, meaning the killing genes successfully work.
Possible further research
A key area for future research would be to engineer the plasmid in such a way that promoters could be more readily interchangeable, so that the killing genes can be induced by molecules relevant to their purposes (e.g. heavy metals or rganic materials).
With interchangeable promoters we would also need to make chosen bacteria code for certain proteins that are specific to intended functions (e.g. cancer digesting proteins from bacteria).
By making it easier for the promoters and coded proteins to be selected individually, the “bio-safety net” would become a universal safety mechanism that could be incorporated into engineered bacteria performing any function, and would be regulated by a user-defined substance.

Safe project design
The safety aspect of our project was always in our minds while working, since the primary goal of the sun badge is to be used outside of the lab. We decided to design it in a way that would prevent our modified bacteria from escaping into the environment. The badge includes a ring filled with bleach which is mixed with the bacteria contained into the capsule once it has been used. The bleach will rapidly kill the bacteria and ensure that no one of them can escape.
Although it ensures that no bacteria will leave the badge alive when discarding it, another biosafety mechanism could be used in case of a capsule leak or even a break upon a hit. One way to prevent this kind of escape road is the introduction of a kill switch inside our bacteria. Several kill switches have been designed and registered as biobricks by multiple iGEM teams during the past years. The implementation of one of them would add another barrier and lower even more the risk of our bacteria escaping.
Environment concern
We decided to make our badge in a way that limits its impact on the environment. The badge is mostly made out of Polylactic Acid, which is a biodegradable polymer. The badge is also fully reusable. The support can be kept by the user and the two other parts can be easily cleaned and replenished. The badge is also fully manufacturable using only 3D printers and polymers that are easily accessible.
Public Commitment
We noticed that synthetic biology is not yet a common topic among students. In order to explain our project in front of a large audience and at the same time introduce what synthetic biology actually consists in, we decided to collaborate with ""Café Numérique"" . The concept is to attend a presentation and then participate in a debate with a good Belgian beer in your hands. We started the conference with the presentation of our IGEM project and then we had the pleasure to discuss with Gauthier Chapelle. He is a scientist who worked as scientist officer for the International Polar Foundation, he promoted Biomimicry in Europe and he is now a co-founder of a sustainability consultancy firm."
Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Restriction Enzyme_-_-_TEXT.html,"icillin carrying plasmid would be lost not only due to the absence of selection during growth and basal expression level of I-SceI (as for the control), but also due to digestion by the restriction enzyme.
As a control, we compared the number of CFUs formed by non-induced cells, plated with a single antibiotic and with both antibiotics. We expected that the plates with only Cm selection would have the biggest number of colonies. A smaller number would be on the plate with two antibiotics (Amp and Cm). It could be explained by the loss of the plasmid carrying Amp resistance and basal expression level of the I-SceI meganuclease.
We calculated the ratio between plates with only one or both antibiotics for both the induced (with IPTG) and uninduced (w/o IPTG) case according to the formula:
The experiment was repeated four times. Average value with error bars for both cases are shown on the next diagram:
Proportion of cells with ampicillin resistant plasmids.
From the diagram we can see two times the difference between induced and uninduced cells. The results suggest that the plasmids with AmpR which carry the I-SceI restriction site are digested by the I-SceI meganuclease.
Future experiments: We suggest a few ways to improve the efficiency of Restriction Enzyme System Safeguard:
Firstly, to increase the probability to cut ampicillin resistant plasmids, we could increase the number of restriction sites it contains;
Secondly, as we have showed, I-SceI meganuclease without the LVA-tag cut ampicillin resistant plasmids very efficiently even without induction of the regulated promoter. So, we could try to clone our constructs with weaker RBS or weaker LVA tag, two find a balance between the two states we describes in our experiments.
Characterization of pRha
We have submitted to the registry a new characterized promoter: pRha K914003 .
Experimental setup
In order to characterize this promoter, we made a construct with a medium RBS ( B0032 ) and an RFP ([]) cloned downstream of the pRha, on the pSB3C5 plasmid. We induced the expression of RFP by adding L-Rhamnose. As a negative control, we used cells without the inducer, as well as cells repressed with Glucose.
Results
First, by simple observation under a fluorescence viewer, we have seen that the addition of 1% L-Rhamnose leads to a significant expression of RFP"

CHARACTERIZING aequorin and CHR2 together:
We have to shine light, add coelenterazine, and calcium.
HOW TO CHARACTERIZE EACH PIECE:
you have to use a high powered microscope, which is beyond the scope of what we are doing?
CHR2: use fura dye, these compounds act as chelators, they aggregate around calcium ions which increases their fluorescence (they’re only very fluorescent in agreggation with other dye molecules attached to a calcium)
Using a confocal microscope, you can see inside the cell.  This makes sure that you won’t assume that light emitted by the outside of the cell itslf is what you’re seeing, but that the characterization is actually accurate
These dyes have a background fluorescence, but you want to do ratio imaging (compare the fluorescence before pulsing with the laser to the fluorescence after hitting the cells with the laser) this method takes 3 months of training on expensive equipment
CHR2 alternate option: we already have characterized it as much as we can
Aequorin: transfect cells with aequorin, wait 24 hours, but we don’t know the maturation time of the aequorin protein (its structure? would compare well with the gaussia), and since we saw with the gaussia? that 24 hours was good, this should work

COLLABORATIONS
The iGEM Team NAWI_Graz looked for different possibilities to collaborate with other teams. These ranged from simple e-mail                 communication and skype conferences to learn more about the competition and the support provided by iGEM, online discussions in                 the field of security, material support for other teams with our own constructs, and the development of a                 software to improve our robot algorithm and therefore giving other teams the possibility to support us from                 their own location. They all looked much more difficult and complicated than we originally thought, but they                 all helped us to realise our project in this form.
European Meet Up
Tu Delft send us an e-mail and invited us to their European meet up. The idea of ​​an earlier, smaller version of the Giant Jamboree in Europe excited the whole team and we decided to send seven people to the Netherlands to get in touch with other iGEM teams.  Due to the meet up we gained our first experiences in poster presentations. With lots of euphoria and motivation we enjoyed the various lectures at the TU Delft. They arranged excursions in Delft and Rotterdam (lovely Pannenkoekenboot, really delicious) and above all, the large poster presentations of all the different teams. It was a great opportunity to meet other iGEMers and to improve our skills by presenting our project to them. The provided summary of all presented posters helped us to find and rework our own poster design for Boston.
Fig. 1: All participating teams at the Meet up in Delft.
General Support
We have communicated more intensively with the team Tu_Darmstadt in Delft already. Even as the third iGEM team from Graz, we had less information than thought about the competition and standardized support of long-standing partners of the iGEM Foundation. As an example, they have drawn our attention to the free sequencing of MycroSynth. We wanted to form an even closer cooperation by detecting a degradation product from their experiments and thus directly prove that their experimental setup and our construct function. We organised"

Day 34
TCA-Precipitate
TCA-precipitate cell-free supernatant of EJKN# and run SDS-PAGE
E#MG, N#MG no secretion; J#MG, K#MG, J#DF, K#DF, N#DF lysed; E#DF successful secretion.
Week 8
Day 36
Supernatant Acquisition
Wash 1.5mL of overnight cultures of E#, J#, K#, L#, N#, ctrl MG1655 in antibiotic-free LB Broth twice and grow them in 1:50 dilution with 0.2% arabinose in conical flasks. Obtain 4x1.4mL aliquots of their supernatants after 4 hours incubation at 37degC.
Do the same for H# MG1655, except don’t obtain aliquots of its supernatant. Instead, obtain aliquots of culture so that we eventually can lyse the cells to obtain MccS from the lysate.
SDS-Page
Obtain supernatants of deltaFliC constructs from cold room - carry out standard SDS-PAGE protocol.
Day 38
Assaying
Run PAGE on the supernatants obtained from the M9 MG1655 cultures from yesterday. Do this first thing in the morning and hopefully as we move onto doing the interlab stuff the gel will develop enough to show some bands.
If bands formed on the PAGE we left to develop overnight, we will incubate the now cleaned biofilm plates with the same supernatants used to PAGE yesterday.
Day 38
So far, only E# has worked for SDS-PAGE. Need to optimize for the rest of the constructs - (D,E,H,J,K,L,N,O,P)#
Today, let’s just focus on the Art-175 constructs because it’s too difficult to do all of them. So, that’s (L, N, O and K)# overnights - see TCA precipitation (taking up8 flasks)
When setting up flasks for supernatants, wash with antibiotic free media.
→ Also try Art-175 supernatants against the biofilm degradation plates

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," to encapsulate various forms of cargo, like nucleic acids and small molecules, and deliver their cargo to different cellular and intercellular locations. Certain PNCs are able to target where they deliver their cargo with the use of surface peptides making them not only more specific, but also more efficient and can help limit off targeting effects when using PNCs to deliver therapeutic cargo (Rahovie et al., 2016). Due to their simple architecture, small size, and broad applicability, PNCs have the potential to become an extremely valuable tool for future iGEM teams and for the scientific community as well.
But where do PNCs come from? PNCs are derived from viruses. Viruses are comprised of a protein capsid, which house and transport a viral genome. In this case, the protein capsid is the PNC and the viral DNA is the cargo. However, PNCs as a cellular delivery system are not viruses! They are simply viral-inspired as they do not contain the viral genome necessary to replicate and cause harm and, in many cases, even their protein sequences have been modified for optimized delivery.
Figure 1. Overview of various virus-like particles (image from Rohovie et al., 2016).
Applications
Drug delivery: PNCs with the capacity to specifically target the delivery of their cargo through aid of surface peptides have the potential to dramatically enhance drug delivery and effectiveness in therapeutics. An example of this would be to decrease harmful side effects of chemotherapeutics by targeting their delivery specifically to cancer cells. Additionally, controlling the concentration of small molecules that can enter the cell by encapsulation can help drug delivery and prevent corresponding toxicity (Whitledge et al., 2015).
Targeted Cell Transformations and Transfections: PNCs with the ability to deliver cargo into the cellular membrane of their target cell have the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency of transforming bacterial cells or transfecting eukaryotic cells with plasmid DNA or other agents (Pastuzyn et al., 2018).
Targeted Antibiotic delivery: The side effects of antibiotic use include harming the host’s endogenous “good” bacteria along with their targeted “bad” bacteria may be circumvented by using PNCs to specifically target the “bad” bacteria with antibiotics (Kaur et al., 2016).
Vaccine development: PNCs have vast potential for the use of vaccines. Attaching linker sequences and other surface modifications to the capsid, as well as encapsulating immunogenic sequences can simplify the applications and productions of vaccines (Lua et al., 2015).

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", we presented our work on TERRA and discussed the role it would play in the field of microfluidics. The scientists at Fraunhofer described the current state of the microfluidics field, raising concerns of the lack of documentation and standardization of microfluidic devices.
When we explored these concerns further, our team realized that if we were to build an application-agnostic system, we would have to account for the lack of standardization of microfluidic chips. In order to ensure TERRA is compatible with chips of all sizes and designs, we needed a method of standardizing the input to our system. Our team created the idea of a scalable, standardized microfluidic chip that would act as an adapter to our system: the TERRA Adapter.
Click here for more on the TERRA Adapter:
Terra Adapter
Phenomyx is a company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts which works with circulating tumor cells and building a system for the phenotypic screening of the metastatic potential of CTCs. They incorporate microfluidic devices with biology in many of their products and workflows.
On July 3rd, 2018, our team met with Salil from Phenomyx and presented information about our system TERRA and our motivations and goals of our project. We discussed the potential applications of TERRA and how our system would fit into the workflow of microbiologists and the microfluidic industry.
Salil suggested that our system should be able to operate with various designs of microfluidic devices, not only chips fabricated using the Boston University CIDAR Lab protocol. This would increase the accessibility of TERRA to the greater microfluidic and synthetic biology community. To incorporate Salil’s feedback, we developed the TERRA Adapter. This microfluidic device allows our system to be compatible with any microfluidic chip by taking the output of a chip and controlling the dispensal of the output. This allows our system to be compatible with a variety of microfluidic devices and standardizes the control element of our system.

Do-it-yourself Biology Labs
Do-it-yourself biology labs are community labs that aim to democratize biotechnology by hosting public workshops and community projects, supporting aspiring scientists in the community, and making lab equipment more accessible. A unique aspect of DIY bio labs is their push for open-source lab equipment because acquiring lab equipment, even secondhand, is difficult. Due to the DIY and open-sourced nature of TERRA, we believed that TERRA could be adopted by DIY"

Scientists
iGEM instructors
First of all, we warmly thank our amazing instructor: Gilles Truan. He was with us from the beginning to the end and even more! He is the master of cloning. He is the captain of PCR. Moreover, he knows how to grill sausages better than anyone! We kindly thank all the other instructors that helped us when we were lost with the scientific part or stressed by the lack of money. We especially thank Brice Enjalbert, Florence Bordes, Kaymeuang Cam, Magali Remaud-Siméon, Philippe Soucaille, Stéphane Guillouet, Isabelle Meynial-Salles and Alain Marty. Your advice and encouragements were very precious to us, and you deserve these thanks for all the energy you spent answering our questions (and we know that we are very energy-consuming!). To finish, a special thanks to Claude Maranges, who helped us a lot with the sponsoring aspect and all the administrative problems that we encountered. Indeed, if you have any administrative issue, he is able to solve it in less than 2 minutes (5 minutes during the holidays)! He knows how to make everything smooth in record time.
Bacillus subtilis specialists
Even if Bacillus subtilis is a gram-positive bacterium model, none of our instructors ever worked with it. It is why we asked other people's help when we had questions about B. subtilis. We would like to thank Nathalie Campo for her advice about B. subtilis culture, her encouragements and her kindness. Her friend Thierry Doan helped us too: he brilliantly answered our questions about B. subtilis. We also thank Sarah Guiziou, iGEMer of the 2013 Toulouse team, for her advice and her protocols.
Fungi specialists
We are grateful to Christophe Roux who gave us two non-pathogenic strains of fungi: Aspergillus brasiliensis, Trichoderma reesei, Aspergillus nidulans and Chaetomium globusum. We used them to test our SubtiTree system.
We deeply thank Sylvain Raffaele and"

Summary
Fluorescence is commonly used as a quantifiable marker in synthetic biology procedures. Following the completion of a protocol, for example an assay test, samples are tested in a plate reader and the results analyzed.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform a Cell-free Toehold test; however, it can be adapted to perform alternative fluorescent tests as desired. The metering primitive dispenses accurate ratio volumes of various substances. These are pushed into the central well which matches the dimensions of a 96-well plate. The chip can then be read in a plate reader with the use of an adapted skirt.
This chip has been milled and tested, but not deemed fully fluid functional as of this time. For a more complete understanding of the chip, click the download button in order to access its CNC millable SVG files, JSON file, full device documentation and PNG files of its flow and control layers.

Selection strains:
Streaked out fresh plates from the glycerol stocks of the EcNR2 selection strain with the various zinc finger binding sites. We will hopefully use these when the other libraries are assembled (and we can use the CB bottom colonies for a fresh transformation with its library).
September 11th
CB bottom ZFB strain:
Repeated the transformation with CB bottom ZF library (100ng)
recovered for 1 hr in LB
plated on LB+spec to check that the transformation worked
reinoculated 1mL of the transformation into 10mL LB+spec and let it grow for another hour
plated 10uL (brought up to 100uL in NM) on LB+spec, NM+his+spec, NM+spec, NM+spec+1mM 3-AT, NM+spec+3mM 3-AT, NM+spec+10mM 3-AT plates
let rest of LB+spec culture grow overnight to use tomorrow for glycerol stocks and more plating
September 12th
Library Construction
Overnight cultures were miniprepped (yields around 30-40ng/uL) and digested following the August 22nd protocol (but with 1ug of template plasmid)
The digested plasmid was then immediately phosphatized by adding 1uL of Antarctic phosphatase and 10uL of the phosphatase buffer and incubating for 30min at 37C followed by 5 min at 65C.
Minelute purified the product: recovered about half of the DNA
CB bottom library
Made glycerol stock of CB bottom strain + CB bottom library
LB+spec plates look great, so the transformation worked! Could be small colonies on the NM-based plates, but they are very small so we will let them grow up for longer
Also want to plate washed cells from the transformation: washed twice in NM, and then plated either the equivalent of 100uL or 10uL of cells onto LB+spec, NM+his+spec, NM+spec, NM+1mM 3AT+spec, NM+3mM 3AT+spec, NM+10mM 3AT+spec plates.

SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour54_-_-_TEXT.html," The diagram shows the flourescence measured in a.u. by FACS for the 5 constructs. The P-value derived from the data is P<0.0001, marked by ****. J23106+I13504 has the highest flourescence measured, while Top10 has the lowest.
BBa_I13504 is a composite part composed of and RBS-site, a FACS optimized GFPmut3b and two standard biobrick terminators. The GFPmut3b has amino acid substitutions in position 65 and 72, a Glycine and Alanine respectively. Reference:Brendan P. Cormack, Raphael H. Valdiviaa, Stanley Falkow - FACS-optimized mutants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). DOI:10.1016/0378-1119(95)00685-0. [ScienceDirect]
Top10 is the reference for the a.u. measurements compared to each of the other samples. Our expectations of the promoters are listed from weakest to strongest in relative expression: J23117 < J23106 < J23101, based on the original measurements done in 2006.
In figure 2 a graph comparing each construct’s a.u. to the positive control, T18-Linker-GFP is depicted. The scale is logarithmic due to the relatively large difference in the measured expression levels of the promoters.
Sequence data for the three constructs was compared to the sequence retrieved from parts registry. It was correct for J23106-I13504 and J23117-I13504 , but the data for J23101-I13504 did not show the gene encoding GFP, a BLAST search showed some alignment in the beginning of the sequence, to pFM46. Promoter J23106 showed the highest fluorescence of the constructs, with J23117 having a significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced fluorescence, at 40 times lower.
The J23106 construct showed a much higher fluorescence than the J23117 construct, with a mean value of 85932 a.u. compared to 814 a.u. see figure 2 for graph. The measurement on J23101 is inconclusive in this study, due to the wrongful sequence, possibly caused by contamination.

1.Tell users whether they need go to hospital accurately
2.Everyone can get answer easily without doctors.
 
 
 
 
a.
Stage 3:Hospital investigation
  
We need further understand more details about diagnose，so that JACOB can make a better line with the hospital.
 
 
From hospital,we know that hospital holds gold standard for diagnosis----puncture,they can complete the detection of biomarkers in two hours. However，the cancer of patients who come to hospital almost has developed into middle and late.
 
These confirm that no one is willing to take bad health, but they simply are not informed. A “stimulus” is needed to warn them potential health issues and prompt patients to visit healthcare. This again reinforce that our main market role is to warn patiets and help diagnosis, not to compete for decisive diagnosis. Therefore we came down to build up JACOB’s convenience, efficiency, and affordability instead of optimizing sensitive and specificity.
 
 
 
a.
How can JACOB get out of the lab?
By visiting Enterprises，we have great understanding of JACOB’s operation in market：
A.LinfinPort Biotechnology Corporation Ltd，whose primary business is aptamer，gave us much suggestion about the corresponding relation between aptamer and biomarkers,they bore down on the importance of biomarkers’ specificity,It provides ideas for the selection of biomarkers in future.
 
 
B.We asked BluePHA mainly on how to construct a viable procedure to industrialize JACOB. Our plan for JACOB after the iGEM jamboree is divided into developments, commercialization,  and resource transformation.
 
 
C.We asked CapitalBio Corporation mainly on how to control the cost of microfluidic chip production. From their experience we found that chips cost much more in the early development, but its cost diminishes quickly in later stages when mass production is reached, ranging from $0.1 to few dollars. However, there exist a conflict of material. In the iGEM version we picked optical cement instead of PMDS for its advantages of adequate solidification speed, feasibility, bio-inertia, and precision of altitude. However, PMDS production industries are much more matured. There is currently no companies offering mass production of optical cement microfluidic chips. Thus, we must decide the better material
