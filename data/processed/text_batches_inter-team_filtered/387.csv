CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rectify misconceptions. We tried to ask students and parents questions like - “do you think it is dangerous to work with bacteria” or “is genetic modification safe?” Initial responses were generally negative, but the questions gave us a platform to address the issues.
The concept of toehold switches had also proved extremely challenging to explain. We subsequently developed the analogy of a knot to explain them. The knot prevents a protein making factory (ribosome) from reading the instructions (mRNA) to make a protein that glows (GFP). Through diagrams, and use of animations, we were able to explain the concept of our project. We delivered an assembly where we used this analogy to explain our project and sent out a quiz. To our delight people understood most of our project and a few understood nearly everything. 109 completed the quiz and the majority scored over 75%. Find out more on our engagement page .
We thereby vastly improved our education and public engagement programmes, learning from how people to develop an approach for explaining difficult concepts in an accessible and interesting way. We improved our presentation and communication skills throughout the project. We were delighted that rest of the open days, as well our assemblies and workshops went so well and got people interested in synthetic biology.

BIT-China,2013,Team:BIT-China#humanpractice.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM competition platform and made remarkable achievements. This year is the first time we BIT - China in Beijing institute of technology take part in iGEM competition, and this meeting provided us an opportunity to communicate with them to make us more deeply understand the form of iGEM competition, content and some matters needing attention and bring us more convenience. Synthetic biology in our university also belongs to the early stage. In this exchange activity, we knew more about the development of synthetic biology and mature application of synthetic biology. How to better use the method of synthetic biology and make more people know about synthetic biology becomes our common goals.
In September we had a chance to share our idea with the Peking team. They introduced their project and we showed our presentation to them. Their teacher point out our shortcoming and gave us some advices. Because it is our first time to take part in iGEM, so they gave us many suggestions about the program of competition. In a word, we learn a lot from them and set up a friendship with peking team.
In May 2013, BIT - China came to Tsinghua university made communication activities with iGEM teams named Tsinghua led by Chen Guoqiang on synthetic biology. Tsinghua university is one of the most famous universities, the high-level personnel training and the important bases of scientific and technological research in China. We really admired the long history of Tsinghua university mixed with young vitality of new power of synthetic biology. From the first race in 2009 to today, Tsinghua has been in the high level of entries to inspire us make more progress as the models. Although iGEM's only a game, it has set up a platform to share, propaganda and explore the synthetic biology. We rejoice for the vigorous development of new technology, and are proud that we can do our best to enter the science hall.Although iGEM's only a game, it has set up a platform to share, propagate and explore the synthetic biology.
A model iGEM was hosted on 7 September by peking team, seven teams came for it. These universities include Tianjin University, Fudan University, Ocean University of China and so on. The activity was made by two parts: presentation and poster. In presentation, every team showed a different style, and their projects are creative and wonderful. We learnt from each other and found many advantages to polish our project.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#microtubule_-_-_TEXT.html,"C   \]
From the theory of molecule collisions, we can define $\pi_{AB}$ as the probability that molecule $A$ and $B$ collide and react in a unit of time. This means that in volume $V$, the probability that $X_A$ $A$ molecules and $X_B$ $B$ molecules (that are uniformly mixed) react due to collision in time $\Delta_t$ is
\[   \pi_{AB}X_AX_B\Delta_t   \]
where $\pi_{AB}$ can be seen as a microscopic rate constant of the reaction. $\pi_{AB}$ is the microscopic foundation of macroscopic deterministic rate equations, so it must be closely related to the rate constant that appears in rate equations. For the reaction described above, we have
\[   k_{AB}=\frac{\pi_{AB}V\langle X_AX_B\rangle}{\langle X_A\rangle\langle X_B\rangle}   \]
Here $\langle \cdots \rangle$ stands for the ensemble average. However, in the deterministic descriptions of macroscopic dynamics, the average of a product is the same as the product of the averages, i.e. $\langle X_AX_B\rangle\approx\langle X_A\rangle\langle X_B\rangle$. Therefore, the above equation can be simplified to
\[   k_{AB}=\pi_{AB}V   \]
Here, the volume $V$ appears because we use volume concentrations in the macroscopic form and number of molecules in the system in the microscopic form.
When the reaction occurs between the same kind of molecules, the distinguishable molecule pairs are
\[   \frac{X_A(X_A-1)}{2!}\approx1/2X_A*X_A   \]
which yields
\[ k_{AA}\approx1/2\pi_{AA}V   \]
Generalizing the above discussions, we have $k_A=\pi_A$ for first-order reactions and $k_{AB}=\pi_{AB}V, k_{AA}\approx1/2\pi_{AA}V$ for second-order reactions.
This shows that although $k$ and $\pi$ only differ by a constant, they reflect the fundamental difference between macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. It also provides the theoretical basis of comparing the results of our Monte Carlo simulation with actual experimental results.
Now that we know how to transfer between macroscopic ($k$) and microscopic ($\pi$) descriptions, we only need to analyze the microtubule dynamics in the form of $k$.

In Thermo Fisher GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit Binding Buffer the gel’s mass increased further to 235 mg. In aqueous lactic acid solution the gel started to slowly dissolve as indicated by a decrease of mass to 157 mg (Fig 1.).
Fig. 1: Dextran gel mass change over time under different conditions.
Conclusions
iGEM Eindhoven’s dextran gel is remarkably stable under varying conditions which exceed tolerance of most common bacteria. Given the information that under acidic, non-physiological conditions the dextran gel dissolves, we tested conditions at E. coli tolerance borders. At pH 3 and pH 3.6 in HCl and lactic acid, respectively, degradation was measurable after 24 h of incubation. Since iGEM Eindhoven previously tested their gel’s stability under acidic, but not under basic conditions, we tested degradation at pH 8 in agarose-dissolving buffer, and pH 9 in aqueous NaOH solution. Due to high salt concentrations in the Gel Extraction Kit Buffer, the gel’s density increased over time, rendering a possible degradation impossible to measure. However, visual inspection indicated that the gel was intact after 24 h of incubation. Under more basic conditions, the gel dissolved. While at pH 8, E. coli is able to survive, we expect E. coli to be disrupted when incubated at pH 9 for 24 h.

Marburg
We are very grateful to get in contact with iGEM team Marburg and want to thank them for organizing an amazing German iGEM meetup. Additionally, they helped us with our Golden Gate assembly by sending us an alternative protocol for our assemblies. With great care we participated in their well-organized InterLab Study using Vibrio natriegens, for developing a new model organism for prokaryotic cloning. For this we repeated the InterLab protocol they optimized for Vibrio natriegens.
Why is working with Vibrio natriegens not only good for the iGEM Team Marburg, but also for our approach and almost all synthetic cell biologists?
When you are familiar with microorganisms and talks about Vibrio genus, you may think that “it is an ordinary halophile organism”, but what you actually should think is “Well, may this little super organism can change the whole cloning workflow all around the world”!

 Context
How we got to our idea...
From the very beginning of our adventure, our project was focused on two main topics: the devastating African epidemics and the Antibiotic Resistance!           Two different problems, but one common enemy: bacteria!           And our project aimed at finding a flexible and dynamic tool that could help fight both of them!
African epidemics are a major problems of nowadays world: lack of resources and poor hygienic conditions cause humanitarian disasters! In most of cases the problem would be easy to solve, but poverty and bad organization empeach to improve           the           situation. We want to find an affordable and effective solution to fight those humanitarian crises!
On the other side we have antibiotic resistance, a so-called ""western problem""!           Antibiotics are drugs which serve to fight against the infections due to bacteria: urinary infections, blood-poisoning, sexually transmitted diseases, etc. It is one of the most important discoveries of the medicine which saved and which           still           saves millions of lives every year, but their efficiency is threatened because bacteria can adapt themselves and resist the treatment. Antibiotics kill bacteria, or block their proliferation. The resistant bacteria became insensible in           this           drug. We speak then about resistance to antibiotics.
The remarkable efficiency of antibiotics motivated their use massive and repeated in human and animal health. It created a pressure of selection on the bacterial populations, by a similar phenomenon in the ""natural selection of the           species""           described by Darwin, modifying the bacterial ecology.
The emergence of multiresistant bacteria in the middle of care is particularly worrisome as this new Australian study published in Nature Microbiology.
If the emergence of these resistances was countered at first by the development of new antibiotics, the breathlessness of the search and the decrease of the number of new available molecules threaten our armament in the face of these           bacteria           today. Before 2050, the resistant infections in drugs will kill more people than the cancer unless measures are taken to fight against the problem.

This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Construction in Prokaryotic cells
In prokaryotic cells, the system consists of three circuits. One induces flip, one flips and the other expresses. According to the properties of the promoter pBAD, we build the first circuit, using arabinose as an inducement to generate the recombinase Cre. After the content of Cre increasing, loxP sites flip, causing the expression of supD tRNA and T7ptag. T7ptag and supD tRNA act as an AND gate which can active T7 promoter by (iGEM 2009 PKU_Beijing.) Details and truth tables are as follows.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," then O/N cultures will be made.
The pAT12 construct was made today by ligating the following together:
pAT08(E+S) + pAT02(X+P) + pSB2K3(E+P).
A negative ligation control was made as well which contained only the digested plasmid (pSB2K3) and no insert.
These were then transformed along side negative and positive transformation controls, the positive control had pBR322 as the plasmid for transformation.
After 1hr incubation at 37C, these 4 transformants were plated and hopefully tomorrow we have some good results.
A PCR was also made of the SPL, the way it was designed was that it would have the Chloramphenicol cassette along side it in order to make digest+ligation alot easier as well as having a selectable marker to work with.
The template used in order to obtain the chloramphenicol cassette was pKD3, which was kindly supplied by Sebastien.
Note: I made the PCR using the Phusion enzyme, running a normal PCR program, not the one we've always been running which contains ramp TD settings; I did this PCR on the old PCR machine in the 2nd last lab down the hallway.
The PCR product needs to be run on a gel tomorrow, so lets cross our fingers it will be successful.

So today I did a lot of crying... We really need some good results soon!!
I spend the whole afternoon in the p2 lab with Sebastien playing around with Salmonella:-) Hopefully I wont get a stomach infection in the next few days. Well, Sebastien and I made some competent Salmonella cells using the 413 strain (without any phages integrated) and the 421 strain (WT). I then transformed the following plasmids into both strains:
pIGR01 (pSB4A5+G1+GFP): colony 4
pIGR02 (pSB4A5+G2+GFP): colony 6
pIGR03 (pSB4A5+GR1+GFP): colony 11+13
pIGR04 (pSB4A5+GR2+GFP): colony 16+18
All plasmids are from the 02-10-10

Filtration
Our Sporobeads can be used to purify water from heavy metal ions, toxins and plastic by expressing proteins on their surface that specifically bind such targets.
One example of such a binding protein could be CPX-Sporobeads. CPX is a peptide developed by the 2007 MIT iGEM team , which is extremely hydrophobic, and thus capable of binding microparticles of polystyrene from water. The excessive use of disposable plastic and the lack of universal recycling programs has led to the pollution of the world's oceans . In the ocean, large pieces of plastic litter are ground by sea currents and degraded by UV radiation into microscopic pieces, so called ""plastic plankton,"" which is consumed by fish, filter feeders, and other marine organisms. Such plastic uptake can lead to poisoning, sterility and death.
Theoretical Filtersystem with Sporobeads
In huge filter systems, CPX-Sporobeads, which cannot germinate ( [1] GerminationSTOP), could be put into place to filter microscopic plastic particles out of the water. Such specific filtration would be superior to blanket filtration systems, which also remove living phytoplankton important to ocean ecosystems. To prevent the beads from being released into the sea and to ensure that the plastic is removed from the water, the Sporobeads could be attached to membranes in these filter systems. In this case, the Sporobeads would need to not only display CPX but also a membrane binding or spore binding protein on their surface.

TJU,2015,Team:TJU#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"E also plays an important role in lactate increase. Engineered lactate producing strain (MG1655ΔpflB+ldhE) has a greater utilization of carbon sources and a higher yield of lactate with M9 medium under the same concentrations of glucose.
2 Flavins producing system
To prove the EC10 and EC10* work as expected, we conduct several experiments and the results are as follows.
Figure 3. The yield of riboflavin in different strains: EC10, Rf02S (Δpgi + EC10), EC10*
As shown in figure 4, E. coli BL21 with EC10 reaches a final yield of 17 mg/L in flask cultivation. E. coli BL21Δpgi + EC10 reaches 33 mg/L. E. coli BL21 + EC10* reaches 90 mg/L.

3 Co-culture MFC -- Division Of Labor
Figure 5. The electrical output of MFCs of single strain Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with different substrates.
From the diagram above, we demonstrate that：
1. Shewanella cannot use glucose as a mere carbon substrate to generate power and so the potential keeps no more than 50 mV.
2. Shewanella can produce the maximal potential up to 150mV with supplement of sodium lactate.
3. Shewanella can produce even higher potential when we take sodium lactate as the carbon source and add little riboflavin into the system.
Conclusion: According to our experiment, our system is feasible in principle. Lactate can serve as the entry point in material flow and riboflavin as the major factor in energy and information flow, which lays a foundation in the later experiment design. We can use fermentation bacteria to provide carbon sources and electron shuttles, which subsequently, will increase the power generation capability in the co-culture system.
Figure 6. The electrical output of co-culture MFCs with preliminary division of labor
Description： The results show that dividing material, energy and information flow into separated fermentation bacteria is much better than combining the two tasks into one kind of bacteria. We suppose that the production of riboflavins and lactate cannot be consistent in single strain because lactate is the primary metabolites and riboflavin is the secondary.
However, the electricity output cannot sustain for long and decrease promptly (as"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HP#School Talks_-_-_TEXT.html," in Frankfurt am Main). iGEM team Bielefeld-CeBiTec in conversion with Florian about synthetic biology, biohacking and public outreach.
Florian Helfer studies cultural anthropology and European ethnology at Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main. In his bachelor thesis, he determines several aspects of actual biohacking agitation. As iGEM team Bielefeld-CeBiTec, we decided to help Florian with his project and discuss our opinions and experiences with biohacking and iGEM. On notice of our several public and medial activities he suggested to search for barriers between iGEMers and non-scientists. Especially the language barrier is supposed to be a main Issue in the educational outreach. Technical and scientific terms as well as laboratory slang are common in the synbio-language. It is important to reduce opaque words and the complexity of used terms in presentations and publications.
To achieve a comprehensible and clear educational outreach, we conducted a series of synbio-lectures with evolutional stages of improvement. For this, we presented our project in context with synthetic biology in front of several high school classes. After our discourse, we tested the uptake and comprehension of this topic by performing a small examination. The examination contains questions about general biological terms and definitions as well as specific questions for our project. Moreover, we included a survey to collect opinions and tips for further improvements of our presentation style and the setup of the presentation. After every stage of presentation, we adjusted our performance by analyzing the test and the survey.
To ensure comparability, we consistently used multiple choice questions with four possible choices, including exactly one correct answer. For evaluation, we used a scoring model, whereby every question gets analyzed by the percentage of correct answers. In theory, 25 % of the participants will provide the correct answer by chance.
After the first course of lectures, both tested segments were scored at about 50 %. Notably, technical terms, as well as project details were leading to a lag of understanding. The statements “More Figures would be helpful.” and “Easier explanation of technical terms.” were consent of the first survey round. Based on this result, we added some basic definitions and illustrations to our presentation. We also extended the lectures to about 20 minutes. Therefore, the available time for additional explanations is increased, while pupils remain still focused .
The second run of presentations leads to better results in both tested categories. However, it seems apparently that two parts of our project require more explanations. The mutation and the selection system were not as well understood as the library design. To address this challenge, we"

As noted by the multiple experiments, there are some differences in the relative output of hydrocarbons in each experiment, however, the trend for each compound is relatively consistent for the different samples.  Some of the runs were not able to be repeated in the second assay, which is the reason for some of the lack of data in Figure 6. These results suggest our OSCAR Optimizer model can optimize OSCAR (along with other metabolic systems); however, these predicted candidates need to be tested in the wet-lab to ensure the model is accurate.
Modelling informing our Killswitch
Although we had initially rejected the idea of a killswitch based on auxotrophy due to the issue of cost, the results of our model made us think that this might be more feasible than we had initially thought.  As glycine alone in minimal media was able to give us higher alkane production than Washington’s production media, supplementing our system with glycine, achieving higher output may actually be feasible.  We saw auxotrophy as a method of creating layers in our killswitch system, where we could use it in tandem with the inducible kill systems that we have already been developing.  We obtained a glycine knockout stain of E. coli and have begun some initial characterization data .  This was a great example of how our modelling project was actually able to inform other parts of our project.  In order to validate that this system was feasible for use we performed three key experiments:
Perform a glycine requirement assay to determine the survivability of the knockout strain in our minimal media's used with OSCAR <.
Determine if the Petrobrick can be used with a similar activity as in the wild type strain
Use the auxotrophic strain in conjunction with our killswitch to show that these can act together.

Drawbacks
This application is built upon the Cobra Toolbox, and the SBML Toolbox. As a consequence, any flaws in the Cobra Toolbox and SBML Toolbox will affect this application.
In this program, pathways added to base chassis model (E. Coli iAF1260) which contains constraints that rely on the Stoichiometric Matrix (such as Stoichiometric Coefficients), lower bounds and upper bounds of reactions. These pathways lack genetic and enzymatic regulation, making the connections between reactions in the network much weaker than those in the wet-lab. These missing components may lead to inaccurate results.

Supernatant was collected and layered on top of a 30% sucrose solution (50mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6; 100mM KCl; 10mM MgCl2; 1mM DTT). After centrifugation at 50000rpm for 20 hours at 4C in the preparative ultracentrifuge using a Ti70 rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) the supernatant was decanted and the pellet resuspended in ribosome buffer (50mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6; 100mM KCl; 10mM MgCl2; 1mM DTT). The resuspended ribosomes were layered on top of a 10 to 40% (w/w) sucrose gradient, which was centrifuged in the SW32 swing rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) at 28000 rpm for 7 hours. Ribosome bands were visualized by light scattering and photographed with a Nikon D80 SLR.

The system is first regulated by a spaCBA promoter, which allows the expression of the nsrR repressor protein (of PyeaR promoter) and then the cassette regulates the expression of expression of mutated gp80 with the PyeaR promoter, after it senses nitrosative stress. Reporter fluorescent proteins iLOV and M-Cherry will help us corroborate expression of both promoter systems. iLOV will be attached to the Pbad-nsrR system and M-Cherry to the PyeaR-Mutatedgp80 system. The mutated gp80 has a His-Tag (6 histidines) attached to it for purification purposes. It is also attached to a signal peptide for excretion into the media.

Penn,2011,Team:Penn State#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," ATP as well as repressor cleavage. In order to restore RecA1 to RecA and to reduce its recombinant activity while maintaining its proteolytic activity, a series of mutations were made. One such mutation was made at amino acid 160, this adenine residue needed to be mutated to guanine to change RecA1 to RecA and restore its functions. In order to use the standard bio-bricking techniques we also had to remove naturally occurring enzymatic restriction sites. The Pst1 site CTGCAG needed to be converted to CTGCAA. Then the EcoR1 site GAATTC needed to be converted to GAATTT. We also focused on how to mutate RecA so that it would be deficient in recombinant activity.  After literature research we identified two amino acids in the RecA sequence that were known to affect RecA’s ability to perform homologous recombination.  These sites were Arginine 243 and Lysine 286.  Research suggested that changing Arginine 243 to Glutamine and Lysine 286 to Asparagine would remove recombinant activity from RecA.

Dosimeter Design
After genetically modifying Escherichia coli to perform the task of acting as a bacterial dosimeter, we started looking into designs for building the actual device. After taking a tour of our Nuclear Reactor Facilities on campus, we were introduced to a wide variety of dosimeters already in use in the building. We designed our device to focus on three main points: portability, durability, and reliability. The dosimeter was designed in an octagonal shape for aesthetics with a shear 5 cm diameter and a width of 1 cm. These parameters allow for a light, portable device. Another idea we used in designing the device with the belief that it should be reusable. For this reason, the device is designed in a camera and film pairing. The hollow case made out of a hard plastic, or in case of the analogy the “camera”, is designed to be durable and reusable, while the tray will be for one-time use.
After use the tray will be developed in catechol, etc. to show the different levels of radiation present. The dosimeter tray will have a thin layer a gellan gum, as developed by BCCS Bristol’s iGEM team in 2010, but instead of being made into balls we will use a thin sheet of gellan gum instead. Our modified Escherichia coli living in this gel will be tested by exposing it to gamma radiation at our nuclear reactor on campus. The trays"

NYMU-Taipei,2016,Team:NYMU-Taipei#pttest_-_-_TEXT.html," Oxford University Scientific Society, we organised a public talk “ Biofilm s: role in health and disease, recalcitrance and in vitro model ling” by Dr. Andrew McBain, Biofilm Research Group, Manchester Pharmacy School. This talk helped the team understand the role of biofilms in causing infection and why they are resistant to antibiotic treatment. During his talk, Dr. McBain explained the role of biofilms in infections and how they confer ABR. He talked to us about persister cells and their importance in the recalcitrance of biofilms to antibiotic treatment. Hence, in the project design, we looked at agents that specifically target these sessile, metabolically inactive persister cells and decided on Art-175 as one of our antibacterial agents.
Professor Timothy K. Lu, from the Synthetic Biology Group at MIT recommended that we use endogenous anti-biofilm agents rather than designing them bottom up. He said that our idea to use synthetic biology as a means of fighting UTIs and ABR was “interesting” but raised to us the the problem of our bacteria being subject to resistance mechanisms depending on the agents used, but that we could overcome this by exploring combinatorial therapies.
During the summer, we also gave two talks, one at the termly Corpus Christi College Biochemistry talks and another to a group of alumni from the Oxford Biochemistry department. Again, the feedback we received in terms of our project idea was positive and our idea was described as “ambitious but achievable”. Max Crispin, Oxford Glycoprotein Therapeutics Laboratory raised the issue of whether the protein s we planned on secreting would be immunogenic. We explored this, and similar issues, in a report we wrote about the urinary biome . Another question we were faced with concerned the issue of whether our solution would make fungal infections more likely. This issue is addressed in the Futher Considerations section.
Return to the public
Having investigated the feasibility of our idea, we approached the public again to seek their opinion. The idea working on paper is one thing, but having the support of the public and the patients who would be using our solution is another aspect entirely.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
We asked the public, “If you had the option of using two treatments for an infection, where one was antibiotics and one was bacteria that were designed to cure the infection, which would you choose?”
The majority (70%) of the people we surveyed said that they would take the advice of their doctor on this. This reinforced to us the importance of nurses and doctors backing our project idea. However, encouragingly"
TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html,", we have been searching for a suitable system. During this, we have stumbled upon a solution in a modern research issue – the T7-split-RNA-Polymerases.
The general concept is to split T7-RNAPs into a C-terminal and N-terminal domain. The biological activity of the split T7-RNAPs is restored when both fragments are in direct proximity to each other. The assembly of the split fragments can be made dependent on the dimerization of fusion proteins. Only when both domains are expressed the proteins can dimerize, reassembling the RNAP. If inducible dimerization systems are chosen as fusion proteins the dimerization must additionally be induced, for instance by small molecules or light.
Figure 15. The orthogonal expression of the two CDAs would result in the production of three different chitosans.
Mutants of the T7-RNAP carrying amino acid substitutions in the region that mainly determine the polymerase’s promoter specificity address altered T7 promoter (PT7) sequences. This would allow the expression of the genes of interest orthogonally, when placing several orthogonal variants of T7 promoter in front of the gene. These promoters can be placed upstream of the genes of the different CDAs. Via chemical or light induction the dimerizations of fused dimer systems mediate the reassembly of various split T7-RNAPs, that are orthogonally addressing variants of PT7. Thus, a orthogonal regulatory system is established.
We have not been able to introduce this system into our project and the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts yet, but we are planning to facilitate such a system in our next years project.

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," enjoy the interests in science and technology, know the knowledge about biology and think over ethics in life science through our activities.
We ushered the students to our conference theatre, having them participate in any activities they are interested in and giving them attracting presents. We also gave every participant our badge.
The synthetic biology exhibition was composed by some display boards including knowledge of synthetic biology, program display on iGEM, biological safety and genetic engineering. Some information and pictures were from iGEM wiki. We made this exhibition following the lecture to improve our HP effects.
Garden party game was the most important parts in order to enhance the interest. It was composed with three parts—Riddles written on lanterns，Foldit computer games and finding the differences between DNA molecules. In the first game, we find some riddles related to gene and biology and wrote them on lanterns. If the participant could find the answer then he would win a prize. Foldit, a computer game liked by the high school students since they can learn from entertainment, folds proteins and tests their stabilities with four people competing in it.  Finding the differences between DNA molecules, is to find two or three differences between two analogous DNA pictures. From this game participants could be aware of DNA structure more deeply and practice their precision. We accumulated every students' points and the final top 10 won the prize.
Our special prize is the cards——Killers of Three Kingdoms, very popular in China. There are abundant role-relationship and mutual promotion and restraint between every cards, just like Bong in America！！！Our team designed this kind of cards particularly for the HP, combining synthetic biology with the cards. Some high school students even play the cards with our plain guidance, making us think it's an interesting and enjoyable game. Participants hoped that we could  send to them more cards and give them designing pictures. From this game we had a better interaction.
Finally our team organized a special link for these high school students. We show them our culture strains so that they can get an access to germiculture.
After the garden party as well as the exhibition, these senior high school students signed on our whiteboard and had a group photo taken with us at our request. We made informal interviews with some of them and get a satisfactory feedback. They wished we could hold the activities next year and they would try their best to popularize synthetic biology and iGEM. A student, from Shaowu No.1 Middle School Of Fujian, expressed his hope that we could come to their hometown to help people in the countryside to get a correct understanding of genetic engineering.

R-GECO
R-GECO is derived from GCaMP, a genetically encoded calcium indicator. After binding with calcium ion, it can emit red fluorescence at around 600nm. [1]
We use R-GECO to quantify the intracellular calcium level in CHO-K1 cell by using live cell imaging. Due to the instant conformational alteration of R-GECO, it can only be used in short-term test and observation. R-GECO can be inserted into CHO-K1 genomes by PiggyBac transposon system (Fig. 1) [2] .
pBX087-NFAT-GFP
PNFAT is a promoter that can be activated by NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells).
After Ca2+ entering cell, it binds with calmodulin. The serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin will then be activated, which dephosphorylates the serine-rich region and Serine-proline repeats in the amino terminus of NFAT. This activates a conformational change that exposes a nuclear localization signal, results in nuclear import, and enables binding of NFAT to specific promoters (PNFAT) and cooperation with resident transcription factors to induce transgene expression (Fig. 2) [2] .
In the lab, we introduced GFP as an indicator of PNFAT downstream expression. After Ca2+ entering cell, the cascades could be activated, which could finally generate green fluorescence and demonstrate the result. Since the green fluorescent protein could express continuously once the cascade was activated, it was used for long-term test and observation.

General Today we had an elaborate meeting on many issues. All our supervisors Janine, Emrah and Domenico were present. Calin was not able to attend the meeting through skype and Orr also was not able to attend the meeting. With others we conducted a poll to choose the top 3 categories in which our project is most applicable to. The results are 1. Information Processing, 2. Foundational advance 3. Health and Medicine.
The deadline for the decision of attending the Jamboree for Emrah, Domenico and Janine was set as 10th september so that flight tickets could be booked. It was also decided that Saeed will present about our project in the Kluyver Centre meeting in Wageningen. In the meantime it is also decided to choose who will do the presentation in Jamboree, by next friday's meeting 11th september. Saeed and Tim Vos had volunteered for speaking about the sponsorship with Gementee, Delft. Also Domenico and Emrah has shown their willing to help in the lab works. Everybody appreciated the new wiki page.
We discussed on the topic of ""how much of our project must be communicated to public?"" for the microethics. Many agreed that the public must be informed fully about the project except some sensitive details that could be misinterpreted by them.
Tim Weenink The lab work is progressing well, he prepared k12 electro-competent cells and will know the results by monday. If those strains work well the selfdestructive plasmid will be finished in 2 weeks. With the help of Calin he needs to look into some knockout kits so that knockouts can be continued for conjugation module.
Sriram He has started updating the lab notebook. The final assemblies of locks and keys are getting over by monday. If the K12 strains work well then the experiments can be started by wednesday. There were some problems in sequencing results from Baseclear. To find whether is there some problems with primer, PCR must be done on monday with the primers. He got some comments for the new wiki page made by Calin. Vos said some pages miss some words due to some misalignments with new template.

SOC Medium Protocol (starter pack)
Introduction
SOC is a variant of the rich media SOB (super optimal broth) with catabolite repression. This means that glucose is supplemented in the media, allowing for optimal metabolic conditions for the bacteria. SOC increases the transformation efficiency of cells, as it provides ample nutrients to cells that have recently undergone stress as result of having been made competent. Accordingly, it will be used in bacterial transformation to stabilize the cells and to increase transformation yields. Since SOC is high in nutrients, it is more easily contaminated than LB or King’s B media.
Safety Precautions
SDS (safety data sheet): Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets.
PPE (Personal protective equipment): Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back.
Autoclave: The autoclave should only be handled by execs. Note that any autoclaved materials may still be hot and should therefore be handled with caution. Be careful not to burn yourself.

Safety isn't expensive. It's priceless! (author unknown)
Ours is an open community lab, and as such care was taken to choose a project that involved little risk.  E. coli, S. thermophilus, and B. subtillus are all bacteria in the lowest risk group; Risk Group 1.   Wild type strains of these microorganism are naturally found in humans (E. coli) yogurt (S. thermophilus) and the soil (B. subtillis).
Even though these microbes have benign reputations, standard laboratory precautions were followed.  The lab has plenty of gloves, safety glasses and lab coats, and access to running water in a shared bathroom. Media and glassware are sterilized with a pressure cooker (eBay).
Standard microbiological practices regarding eating, hand washing, and disinfecting surfaces were introduced at a lab meeting in July.   CDC guidelines were covered at the same meeting, and a self-test was administered after the presentation.  The lab scrounged a Biological Safety Cabinent via Craig’s List and spent a considerable amount of time scheming ways to elevate it’s 550lbs from the floor to its stand. Solution: material lift from Home Depot.
Our Lab
The WHO Biosafety Manual was assigned to be read by all team members. We completed the CDC Interactive Training Recognizing Biosafety  Levels training and quiz as a group. Our team presented real world case studies of the 2008 UCLA Lab fire death and subsequent felony OSHA prosecution, as well as the 2012 case of a VA lab worker in San Francisco who died after he was exposed to meningitis in the VA lab. Training covered PPE, instruction on our Biosafety cabinet and safe lab procedures with regard to carbon monoxide, explosive gases, fires, liquid nitrogen, and lasers. We discussed how to recognize and minimize risk by experimental design by using a real world example of how to determine the LEL of a explosive gas and minimize its danger by constructing a safe bioreactor. We have a fire extinguisher. The lab is on the 6th floor, and can be exited via elevator, stairs, and a fire escape.

The Problem
The current method used for hormonal detection uses monoclonal antibodies. These tests only detect the hormones and the corresponding levels of each hormone at the point in time in which the sample was taken. This limits the amount of information about the condition of the test subject gained by a researcher or diagnostician to that one point in time. The information is stagnant. These tests can be quite costly; researchers will commonly spend $500-$1100 per ELISA plate. Costs increase form this as researchers need sample preparation materials, storage equipment and lab technicians to carry out their research.
Our Solution
BEAR is a low cost, modular device that will allow scientists to detect hormones in real time. This is a simple schematic of our hormone detection device. The sample containing the hormone in question will interact with the hormone-specific detector. This will stimulate a signal which we will be able to identify.
Modular components of BEAR allow for detection of multiple hormones. The hormone-detecting apparatuses are designed to specifically detect a single hormone. These are one-time-use pieces that can be exchanged from the BEAR device in order to detect a different hormone, depending on the researcher’s needs. Eventually, BEAR will have the capacity to use multiple modular components at once, giving a researcher the ability to monitor a collection of hormones simultaneously.
BEAR is different from the monoclonal system because it provides a real-time assay. This will give neuroscientists, medical and livestock agricultural researchers and diagnosticians the ability to observe hormonal changes over a period of time and watch a subject’s internal response to a stimulus. These results are immediate, as opposed to a wait of hours or days for results from monoclonal antibodies.

The Metabolic Syndrome- Could Synthetic Biology Provide a Breakthrough Solution?
An expert's panel conducted on Innovation Day 2014 to promote the discourse about our team's project among stakeholders.
Spreading the Word of Synthetic Biology in BGU
Meetings with Ben-Gurion University top officials, to make iGEM a solid institution in the university
Innovation 2014
As we all know, the field of Synthetic Biology is developing rapidly and is considered highly innovative. In order to spread the word of Synthetic Biology, our team organized a special panel of medical experts to present our project and cutting edge biological research. The well-known speakers came from various backgrounds such as: metabolic syndrome specialists, personalized-medicine physicians, nutritionists and more. The panel took place during the largest entrepreneurial conference in Israel, Innovation 2014, which drew over two thousand high-tech personnel, entrepreneurs, CEOs and other public figures such as: TEVA, IBM, HP and more.
Our goal was to promote the discourse about our team's project amongst experts and other stakeholders. The title of the panel was: The Metabolic Syndrome - Could Synthetic Biology Provide a Breakthrough Solution? At first, we introduced the fascinating field of Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition. As a case study, we have discussed Glowing Plant, the successful Kickstarter project, advised by Genome Compiler CEO Dr. Omri Amirav Drori.
The main part of the panel was the discussions about the current solutions and treatments of the Metabolic Syndrome, and how our project could fit in and stand for a better treatment by using synthetic biology tools. It was highly important for us to expose our project and get feedbacks from experts who deal with the subject on a daily basis. We concluded the panel with discussing the new 'personalized medicine' approach, and how it can go alongside with synthetic biology -"

As a consequence, we performed yet another colony PCR to amplify natural LacI, and clone this into our construct in place of LacI:LVA. The gel picture shows colony PCR result for the transformation with pSB1C3-Pcon-lacI(N)-term-Plac-dxs (B. sub). A band appeared just above 3000 bp as expected for this construct (Fig. 5). The confirmed sequence can be found here ( BBa_K1088027 ).
As a final test of this hypothesis, the plasmid was transformed into KG22, an E. coli strain with natural abundance of LacI. This is further discussed in our characterization of LacI on the next page in the tour.
pSB1C3-Para-HRT2
Figure 6. GenStript performed the synthesis of HRT2 polyprenyltranferase with a flagtag added in the end of the sequence, an RBS and an arabinose promoter in front. Unfortunately, the stop codon of the gene was not removed, leaving the tag unfunctionable. The coding sequence of HRT2 was amplified with primers adding prefix and suffix to the sequence. The gel picture shows two bands. The band just above 2000 bp corresponds to the expected length of shipped pUC57 plasmid and the second band around 900 bp is the expected length for the coding HTR2 sequence (Fig. 6). The basic part was sequenced, and the confirmed sequenced can be found here ( BBa_K1088003 ).
Figure 7. In order to assay optimized control of the expression from the arabinose promoter and thus HTR2, we build and added an AraC device ( BBa_K1088017 ). A colony PCR was performed on MG1655 to obtain araC, which was cloned into the construct with its own promoter and terminator. The construct design was: pSB1C3-Pcon-araC-term-Para-HRT2-FT. The colony PCR for the transformation with the construct shows a band just above 2500 bp as expected (Fig. 7). The confirmed sequence can be found here ( BBa_K1088016 ).

We're still trying to get double-bond functionality within our program - it's turned out to be more difficult than we first thought it would be. Late last week, we met with one of the previous authors of zMol, for help in both understanding code which seemed confusing, and for advice in moving forward. We agreed that it would be best to eschew the idea of including a torus shape for the double bonds, as this would involve graphical design, with which neither I nor Cassie are very familiar. So, we decided to just change the color of a single bond to indicate a double bond. However, especially in our early stages of trying to develop this, this resulted in a lot of bugs. Particularly, overlapping two single bonds directly on top of each other does not work well in the Unity collision engine, and causes glitches. So, we decided to de-render one of the bonds, in order to prevent this. However, there are still bugs, and still a lot of work to be done in zMol. We haven't even started to really tackle the problem of bond geometry - without correct molecular geometry, it's hard to say zMol can really be used as a classroom tool. It looks good, but it doesn't have a lot of functionality.
June 28
We're coming up on the end of our time with zMol. Orit asked us to start thinking about a new project, zTree, which we will soon be primarily focusing upon. So, in the last few weeks, we've really had to work hard to get zMol functioning well. We were planning for about a week on entering into the UIST conference with a paper on zMol, however, we decided that we did not have enough functionality currently for our project to be submitted. Particularly, Orit was very interested in the potential for our program to utilize haptic feedback, but we have been having too much trouble integrating zSpace and Unity, and understanding how to properly split up zSpace's working source code for programs which implement haptic feedback (their code is not modular enough for this to be simple). But, we have managed to program a 3-dimensional periodic table, complete with a zoom function and search function, which does link to the original zMol program, and allows a user to select atoms which they want to use in zMol. There are now 118 elements to choose from, rather than 4. However, we still have not included ionic nor metallic bonding in zMol, so the vast majority of elements really"

Reagents
Membrane Binding Solution
1 mL per each g of gel
Membrane Wash Solution
1200 uL
NF water
15 uL
Protocol
Weigh a microcentrifuge tube for each DNA fragment to be isolated and record weight
Use a UV lamp to excise the DNA fragment of interest in a minimal volume of agarose using a clean scalpel or razor blade
Transfer the gel slice to the weighed microcentrifuge tube and record the weight
Subtract the weight of the empty tube from the total weight to obtain the weight of the gel slice
The gel slice may be stored at 4°C or at –20°C for up to one week in a tightly closed tube under nuclease-free conditions before continuing purification
Add Membrane Binding Solution to the gel slice
Vortex the mixture and incubate at 50–65°C for 10 minutes or until the gel slice is completely dissolved
Vortex the tube every few minutes to increase the rate of agarose gel melting
Centrifuge the tube briefly at room temperature to ensure the contents are at the bottom of the tube
Once the agarose gel is melted, the gel will not resolidify at room temperature
Transfer the dissolved gel mixture or prepared PCR product to the SV Minicolumn assembly
Incubate for 1 minute at room temperature before centrifugation for 1 minute and discarding supernatant
Wash with 700µL of Membrane Wash Solution, centrifuge for  1 minute, and discard supernatant
Wash with 500µL of Membrane Wash Solution, centrifuge for 5 minutes, and discard supernatant
Centrifuge 1 minute with the microcentrifuge lid open to allow evaporation of any residual ethanol
Transfer SV Minicolumn to a new microcentrifuge tube
Add Nuclease Free water directly to the center of the column
Membrane should be completely covered with nuclease-free water
Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute, centrifuge for 1 minute at 16,000 × g, and repeat
Discard the SV Minicolumn

Plant Rubbing & Making Ambers
Lab Open Day
Communication
Being Online
We held the plant rubbing & making ambers activity in our campus in April 11 to 12 as the first human practice activity , trying to interest the public, especially children and letting them know the fantasy of animals and plants in a sense. We are glad to see hundreds of people participating in our activities and manufacturing their own linen pockets with plants rubbed on them and ambers guided by our staffs.
Plant Rubbing
We originally put forward an idea to let chlorophyll or anthcyanin rubbed directly on the pockets. However, considering its possibility of degradation, consequently we decided to suggest participators applying the paint on the leaves. So we pick up some leaves from acertruncatum,metasequoia glyptostroboides,Broussonetia papyrifera and ginkgo biloba. The whole procedure goes like this: participators pick up a leaf they like and then apply some paint on the back of the leaf evenly and uniformly. After that, rub the plant on a linen pocket with hammer. Later, the leaves appears on the pocket. Some people decorate the different pigment on leaves and other draw a loving heart beside the leaves for their lovers. Well we explain to children about photosynthesis based on pigments like chlorophyll and light reaction system simultaneously. We hope they remember the knowledge of biology and enjoy the experience in Plant Rubbing.
Making Ambers
The 'making ambers' activity was held for making the public know the process of formation of natural ambers and triggering their interest in insects. We bought some insects specimen online with colophony prepared for drawing it. So we in advance melt the colophony and then direct the kids and parents to pour the colophony into a glass bottle with an insect inside. After a while, colophony solidified and an amber was completed.
Many kids said they enjoyed playing with insects in spare time, were intrigued in picking up and recognizing animals and wanted to get closer to the nature. Thus, we sincerely hope that our activity again would motivate their impetus to discover more magical things in our world.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

We predicted that the pressures at this stage of the competition could cloud our judgment and prevent us from thinking clearly about our problems, and we knew that we would not be the only team facing these problems. So, we reached out to our fellow London iGEM teams and organised a troubleshooting meet-up well in advance, so that we can all tackle each of our roadblocks as an iGEM community. As well as troubleshooting, we invited graphic design students from the University of Arts London Central St Martins (see below) to give us feedback and advice on our wiki and poster designs. Thank you UCL, KCL and Westminster for all your support and advice towards overcoming our problems, and thank you to the UAL graphic design students for helping all of us with our wiki and poster designs.
Building our PixCell construct using Printeria
This year UPV Valencia developed Printeria, a novel microfluidics-PCB based technique to precisely mix DNA parts for Golden Gate assemblies. When we heard about their idea through one of our supervisors, we instantly contacted them to begin a collaboration. In our collaboration we sent the parts for our PixCell construct to them for assembly. We had manually assembled our construct using Golden Gate, but with great difficulty, and we were interested to see whether Printeria could succeed and how the circuits would compare.
The UPV Valencia team were able to assemble the PixCell construct, but due to limited time we were not able to test and publish the results on our wiki. Regardless, we would like to thank UPV Valencia for coming up with such an innovative technique and we wish them all the best at taking Printeria to the next level
Reviewing our Communication Strategies Guide
Communication is the key theme of our project and it resonates throughout our work. As part of our human practices, we wanted to provide people, and academics in particular, with tools to improve science communication and help deliver information efficiently to any kind of audience. For this we have created our target=""_blank"" style=""color:#24305E""Communication Strategies Guide , which went through several iterations of improvement, thanks to the feedback given to us by the KUAS Korea, NCTU Formosa, MethuHS, KCL and Warwick teams. We would like to thank them for all their advice and helping us to refine our work.

Genome Scale Modeling
Modelling FVA is done in Matlab, no useful information are interpreted. Explored the differences in Y. lipolytica and S. cerevisiae. with PHPP on the different carbon sources.  Beta-carotene pathway is added to the model.
Software
Currently the library of codon usage files consists from 5 organisms with the intention for more to be added soon as .txt files. All of them are commonly used organisms. Research with regards to distribution and repository of software and compatibility regarding different OS versions. PyInstaller software will be used due to its capability of producing executables for all the known OS, so the user doesn't have to do anything else than just downloading the software.

Notes: We decided to test our primers on previously purified cromosomal DNA. Examination of the primers showed that the FlhC reverse primer had a melting temperature of only 45˚C. Therefore we decided to run the samples on a gradient PCR. Simultaneously, we prepared 2 extra samples, isolating FlhD and FlhC, respectively. We did this because we wanted to see if our problems were caused because the combined gene-sequence was to long (932bp).

Interviews with female students
Survey on gender disparities
Contact with PyLadies
    Gender representation seems to be a timely topic. For instance, Scientific American wrote about Gender Diversity and Synthetic Biology , where they report a study performed by 2013' team Paris Bettencourt . Even more interesting is to find a page dedicated to Women in Synthetic Biology in Pinterest , with links to blog posts and news. More recently, scientists around the globe have been showing real signs of disavowal to any gender discrimination present in science.
    This is an interesting topic for our team because we are mostly composed of women. So, we decided to search more about Women in Science by doing some research ourselves, such as interviweing students from the Physical Intitute of São Carlos from the University of São Paulo and doing an internet survey.
Team iGEM Brasil USP - 2015 Girl Power!
    We are very happy that more than 70% of our team are women. Additionally, our PI and the majority of our advisors are female. Rumor has it, this is the reason behind all of our project success ;)
Interviews
    Our Intitute, the São Carlos Physics Institute - University of São Paulo, has a majority of men, but we have some very talented female scients. We interviewed four female graduate students from our Institute to hear their opinion about women in science and how they see this subject in our institute and in general. All students have graduated at IFSC and are doing master or doctorate, so they have lots of experience and opinions to share with you!

Podcast: Synversations
Our Goal
On our inaugural season of Synversations we talk to grad students, religious figures, community leaders, and many more to understand how biotechnology would affect their communities and to clear up some misconceptions about it.
Ep 1: Introduction
In our first episode of Synversations host Tess, Wet Lab lead Victoria and Dry Lab lead Ali introduce us to the world of synthetic biology. They tell us the basics of the field and how iGEM Toronto is using CRISPR-Cas9 on their 2017 project. Where will synthetic biology take us? What are its limits? How will it impact our lives?
Transcript
Ep 2: Ethics
Co-president Katariina Jaenes and Policy and Practices lead Estée discuss how ethics plays a role in the advancement of synthetic biology. With a special focus on CRISPR-Cas9 we tackle questions like how can we control this technology? Will it cure Malaria? Should we use it to eradicate Mosquitoes? This and more in the ethics episode of Synversations.
Transcript
Ep 3: Bioengineering
To University of Toronto Professor Dr. David MacMillan synthetic biology is an engineering application on cells. With our host, Katariina Jaenes, the two consider the future of synthetic biology, difficulties of moving from research to reality, and address public perceptions on the discipline.
Transcript
Ep 4: Arts
On this episode of Synversations, our host, Tess King, talks with Tracy Xiang, a graphic artist, and Ananda Gabo, a designer. The two artists explore the interesting ways in which they combine their interest and experience in synthetic biology with the arts and talk about the longstanding tradition between the two disciplines. We learn about the particulars of representing synthetic biology through illustrations and the importance of open source biology to further develop this unique and long standing intersection.
Transcript
Ep 5: Business
Ontario Genomics strategic planning manager Jordan Thompson and iGEM Toronto co-president Katariina Jaenes examine the commercial applications of synthetic biology and the inherently interdisciplinary nature of funding and commercializing synthetic biology.

Figure 2.  Below 32 oC – Cyan Active
            CFP is produced with the LacI promoter, but neither GFP nor RFP are activated yet.
 
 
Figure 3.  Between 32 oC and 37 oC – Green Active
            The LacI promoter for CFP is blocked and GFP is activated by the LuxR activator, but RFP is still not activated.
 
Figure 4.  Above 37 oC – Red Active
            Both CFP and GFP are blocked by repressors and the LasR activator has started RFP production.

Figure 5. CFP Plasmid
The CFP genes on this plasmid are under control of LacI, while the LacI repressor is under control of a constitutive promoter and a hairpin loop that opens at 32 oC.   CFP is produced until the temperature reaches 32 oC, whereupon the LacI repressor is now produced and stops production of CFP.  This plasmid is the most likely to work.
 
Figure 6. GFP Plasmid
            A LuxR/lambda cI promoter regulates GFP production, while a constitutive promoter controls both the LuxR activator and the cI repressor, also regulated by a 32 oC hairpin loop and a 37 oC hairpin loop respectively.  Before reaching 32 oC, the LuxR activator is not produced and thus GFP is not produced until that temperature.  When the temperature reaches 37 oC, the cI repressor is now present and stops GFP production.
 
 
Figure 7. RFP Plasmid
            RFP production is controlled by a LasR promoter, and the LasR and LasI activators are controlled by a constitutive promoter and a 37 oC hairpin loop.  This means that RFP is only turned on after reaching 37 oC, when the activators are able to be produced.

Collaborations
During the European meeting in Munich we met 4 members of IGEM Groningen. We got along well and after discussing we invited them to come in Bordeaux. They came for             4 days in our hometown with the objective to collaborate and exchange on our respective knowledges.
They brought us their skills in chemistry under the form of a workshop during which they explained us some specific             points linked to our projects. They had read our protocols and gave us some feedbacks on the feasibility of them.             They had also prepared and documented on some other protocols of HPLC that we next have been using during our             lab work.
In exchange we led a debate about ethic in a context of synthetic biology. They had prepared some ethical questions             to discuss. We also had prepared a presentation about consciousness reflection to apply to our IGEM projects.             Beside the working hours we had time to show them Bordeaux and its surroundings. We took them on a personalized             city tour of Bordeaux. The next day we brought them to the Pyla Dune, a famous touristic attraction since it             is the biggest sand dune of Europe. At the end of the 4 days we had spent and shared a really good time with             them. We are grateful and happy of this collaboration.
We have contacted IGEM Leiden because their project was interesting to link to our subject. Igem Leiden’s project is about creating a platform to detect cell stress in E.Coli via stress response system coupled to colored proteins. In             our project the intermediate called HMF (HydroxyMethylFurfural) between cellulose and our molecule of interest,             FDCA (FuranDiCarboxylicAcid), is known to be toxic for the cells. That is why we asked Leiden Igem team to help             us in screening this toxicity by using their project, allowing them to test their platform on another chemical             to prove its effectiveness.
We met the team of IGEM Sorbonne and IGEM Saclay

Central_Calgary,2015,Team:Central Calgary#team_-_-_TEXT.html,"  has  a  strong  core  academic  program,  offering   advanced  placement  in  many  of  the  courses  offered,  as  well  as  a  wide  array  of   extracurricular clubs. This is the second year that Central Memorial has an iGEM team.   We are out to prove that artists can make great scientists too.
Meet The Team
Vladimir has been living in Calgary since day one. Growing up, he has experienced and  explored everything from the bike paths in Fish Creek to the top of the Bow. At the age of  eight, Vladimir developed a passion of photography and film­making, and carries it with him  to this day. If he is not capturing photos, or studying, you can most likely find him zipping  around from city to city on his bike. His passion for iGEM developed within the first weeks of  grade ten, and carries into many aspects of his life. From lab work to media, Vladimir does it  all.
Natalie is a grade twelve student in Central's Performing and Visual Arts program in the dramatic arts discipline. She has always had  a passion for the arts, having done private voice lessons from ages 8-16 as well as being involved in several choirs including Central Memorial's concert choir. Natalie, although always very academic, became extremely fascinated with human biology throughout high school. She worked as a research assistant in the lab of Dr. Marie Fraser at the University of Calgary during summer of 2015, work in on a biomedical research project with future application in dislipodemia and cancer treatment.  Her future aspirations are to study Life Sciences or Health Sciences and one day become a perfusionist.
Kevin Klemmer is the supervisor of the Central iGEM Team. He has taught at Central Memorial Highschool for 15 years.
Jared was once a no life, that is, until he joined IGEM -- of which then, he became a no life that does science. If he isn't in the lab, then in all likelihood, he would be attempting to learn idioms, reading papers, doing math, memorizing the quadratic formula, and devouring ice cream.
Francis Routledge is a grade twelve student who is a hard­working academic student that is  passionate about the sciences. She was initially interested in iGEM because of the amounts  of opportunity that iGEM presented. Francis is actively involved in her school community and  is a leader in many clubs and activities within her school. Outside and inside school, she"

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," in the area of breath analysis and sampling correlated to sickness, a contact was established with PExA and a study visit was scheduled. The aim of the meeting was to learn more about the technique, the market and to get feedback on the iGEM project.
At the meeting the team started with a short introduction about the project and the representative from PExA, Svante Höjer, in charge of the development at the company, held a short presentation of the company. The main part of the meeting focused on discussing the project.
PExA explained how they collect the particles with a Teflon membrane which makes it possible and easy to concentrate the particles at one place. This fact made the team rethink the original sampling idea, which comprised the use of airbags designed for containing VOCs. One of the problems with the airbags is the need for a large amount of air to obtain a high enough concentration of VOCs. This is problematic both due to the constraint put on the patient as well as the inefficiency in the transportation of large volumes of air. Also, the air can only be stored in the bags a limited amount of time, or the VOCs can condense on the walls of the bag. If possible, it would therefore be preferable to instead use a small fiber.
Designing the prototype
After the new idea had arisen, a brainstorming session was held to research the possibilities to use a fiber and to discuss which idea to further work with as well as their advantages and disadvantage.
The conclusion from this session was that the idea with the fiber was the one to be developed. SPME and similar fibers absorbing VOCs are commercially available and could be used for our system. The largest advantage with this idea is that the device would be more manageable and that the fiber would be much easier to transport from a hospital to the laboratory facilities. A potential drawback though would be the extra step needed to extract the VOCs from the fiber in order to expose the yeast to them. Though compared to the recirculation system in the sample bags idea, the extraction step is probably less cumbersome. Available SPME fibers could possibly be used as they are, but a more optimized version would be to prefer.
One idea would be to use a porous fiber as a filter, place this in the device and exhale through it. Important in such a design would be that the fiber-filter is not too compact which would make exhaling through the device difficult. The fiber could be sent to a laboratory facility where the VOCs is extracted and added to the yeast media.
For the design of the prototype, a relatively small device was considered desirable"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"

Probiotics in health
To develop food supplements by biological engineering, the host to be engineered needs very carefully to be considered. Probiotics have gained great interest as health benefit. Probiotics not only play a role as immune modulatory in treating allergy or autoimmune disease, but also modulate the gut microbiota in the treatment of metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes1.
What iGEMers have done
Probiotics are human friendly and have been used as hosts for many iGEM teams based on the properties of (1) safety, they are natural and exist in your gut and many foods, (2) benefits, they can improve health and prevent disease, and (3) acid resistance, they can pass through gastric acid and reside in your gut.
They have been applied in previous iGEM projects as food supplements ( uOttawa: 2009 for cellulose; Uppsala: 2013 for nutritional compounds; UCL: 2016 for antioxidant), as cures for metabolic intolerance ( Caltech: 2008 for lactose; UC_Davis: 2009 for gluten; Tuebingen: 2016 for fructose; UIUC Illinois: 2014 for theobromine in puppies), to fight diseases ( Stanford: 2009 for autoimmune disorders; Trieste: 2012 for antimicrobial peptide; UIUC_Illinois: 2013 for cardiovascular disease; UT-Dallas: 2014 for infectious diseases; Oxford: 2016 for Wilson’s disease), and to treat or prevent cancer ( Arizona_State: 2013 for vaccine delivery system; ATOMS-Turkiye: 2013 for cancer therapy; UPF-CRG_Barcelona: 2016 for colorectal cancer prevention).
Nevertheless, in reality, the major of the projects just worked on E. coli as a proof-of-concept demonstration and still have difficulties to engineer real probiotic strains.

Both models incorporate density but define it differently: DTU’s defines density as the concentration of individual hyphae in a given surface area, whereas SBR’s defines density as the proportion of the physical mold that is filled from the base upward.
Both models’ parameters can be fine-tuned in accordance with lab results in order to account for the use of different fungi.
The SBR model is based on the Eden Model for tumor growth; DTU’s is based on a few different approaches, including a branch-extension simulation that provides the bulk of their rationale.
Finally, taken together, the two teams’ models can form a cohesive use-case. DTU’s first model simulates fungal growth kinetics from a single spore, growing into 2 dimensions and forming the initial “plug” used to fill the mold--this is the SBR model. Finally, DTU’s second model gives the properties of the brick necessary to make the final structure. In essence, DTU's model depicts the beginning and the end of the process, and SBR's model depicts the middle.

Physical Testing
Despite our two teams being separated by almost 6000 kilometers we were able to meet up with one advisor from the DTU Team, Kyle Rothschild-Mancinelli (in the gray jacket) who stopped by the Ames Research Center to look at our progress and exchange mycelium so that we could perform testing in our respective labs. Thanks to this visit we were able to test our glue on an independently created mycelium, further validating our results. In turn our advisor also was able to visit the DTU team in Denmark and advise on any questions they had about creating a mission to outer space.

Collaboration with NYMU iGEM Team from Taiwan
On August 25th Mr. Vincent Lim from NYMU iGEM Team from Taiwan paid us a visit. We held a modeled presentation at our university Kanagawa Institute of Technology. And after the presentation, we discussed about our project and experiment method. From the discussion, we noticed an important point, HAY FEVER IS NOT AN EPIDEMIC DISEASE EXCEPT IN JAPAN.We also introduce him to our instructor and our laboratory. It is a valuable chance for us to get to know more about NYMU iGEM Team and Taiwan.
Reagent support intermediation from promega to all 8 undergraduate iGEM Team in Japan (Ordering reagents and presentation representation)
Until last year, University of Tokyo iGEM Team is responsible to be the intermediation of reagent support. However, as UT iGEM Team did not take part in iGEM 2017, KAIT_JAPAN Team become responsible for reagent support intermediation. We collect orders from each university and for those university who cannot attend to the presentation for the support of the reagent, we presented on behalf of them. And after we received the reagents from Promega, we sort it out and distribute to the correspondent iGEM Team.
May Festival
On the 20th and 21st of May, 2017, we ran a booth at school festival in the University of Tokyo, named ""May Festival"", and collaborated with four iGEM teams in Japan: Tokyo-Tech, Kyoto, Gifu and Bot-chan Lab. More than 150,000 visitors came to this festival, and we had a good opportunity to explain synthetic biology and our project to them. At the same time, each team gave some advice on the other teams' project.
Meetup at Boston University
On November 9th, our team will meet up with other Japanese team at Boston University and we are looking forward to share our ideas and opinion. Each team will present their project as rehearsal just before the event and will have the opportunity to get advice from other iGEM teams and professors.

In E. coli the rpoA gene - encoding the α-subunit of RNA polymerase in A. tumefaciens - is not present but essential for the transcription of a virB promoter-driven genes ( Lohrke SM et al., 1990 ) For this reason it was necessary to subclone a modified virG gene that is capable to be trancribed by the E. coli expression system.
Yong-Chul et al. (2004) described VirG mutants that are capable of expressing the virB promoter-driven genes in E. coli without the requirement for the RpoA from A. tumefaciens, suggesting that thevirG mutants are able to interact with the transcription system of E. coli ( Yong-Chul J et al., 2004 ). In VirG the amino acid at position 56 is likely to play a key role in the interaction with the RpoA of E. coli.  Regarding to Yong-Chul J et al. (2004) we used virG mutants, with amino acid substitutions of G56V and I77V that are capable of activating vir genes in E. coli in response to inducer acetosyringone in a VirA-dependent manner.
Read out system
Firefly Luciferase
We are using luciferase as the read out system. The luciferase was originally extracted from the firefly Photinus pyralis. It is one of the best studied and characterized read out systems. The luciferase enzyme catalyses the chemical reaction from its substrate luceferin to oxyluciferin and light ( De Wet et al. 1986 ). Figure 8 shows the reaction in detail.
We used luciferase as the read out system because it causes only slight negligible noise, hence the signal to noise ration is excellent.
Figure 8: Firefly luciferase reaction (De Wet et al.1986)
Output-signal amplification by Sensitivity Tuner implementation
Using a standard, inducible promoter with reporter system often results in weak reporter expression. So difficulties in quantification can occur. The quantification can be enhanced by an amplification of the transcription rate of the desired reporter genes. Such an amplification can be realized by using a so called sensitivity tuner device. This takes place as promoter induction upregulates a phage activator, which binds to a phage promoter upstream of a reporter gene. As result, a PoPs input (Inducer) generates a PoPs output at a higher signal. PoPs"

1. Prepare selective media (LB with 0.25% agar (2,5 g/L) in Petri dishes (85 mm dia).
2. Apply 1.5 µL of the diluted cell suspensions from mid-log-phase cultures (~2×105 cells/µL (OD=0.5)) to the center of the plates, and let dry in air for 15 min.
3. Incubate at 37 °C for 10 h.
OHHL quantification
Theory N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) are small diffusible molecules used in cell-to-cell signaling by Gram-negative bacteria. Chromobacterium violaceum is a Gram-negative bacterium that produces the violet pigment violacein as a result of sensing AHL. AHL is produced by the autoinducer synthase CviI and released in the environment. When a quorum has been reached, AHL diffuses back into the bacteria and binds the transcriptional regulator CviR. This activates the expression of specific genes which leads to the production of violacein.
In our project, the mutant C. violaceum CV026 was used to quantify the amount of N-(3-Oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OHHL), a specific type of AHL, produced by the LuxI enzyme in our E. coli strains. The CV026 strain is cviI gene deficient and therefore requires exogenous addition of AHL to produce violacein. The idea is to plot a standard curve in which CV026 is induced with different concentrations of AHL. In the standard curve, results were normalized to the OD.
To quantify the amount of AHL produced by E. coli, these were grown and pelleted after which CV026 was added. After incubating for several hours, CV026 and violacein were spun down and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide and again centrifuged to separate the violacein dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide from the cells. Absorbance of the supernatans was measured at "

Olivia Cheng | Junior | Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics (MIMG)
[Why iGEM?] iGEM allows me to explore possibilities and potentials in science while gaining experience in research.
[Favorite Coffee?] Cafe Latte - Not too strong, yet nothing fancy.
Fasih Ahsan | Junior | MIMG & Bioinformatics
[Why iGEM?] I am truly fascinated by our ever-growing ability to harness the power of biology and shape it for our own uses and designs.  Being a part of iGEM opens the door to independently exploring and discovering new paradigms of synthetic biology.  I am thrilled to begin unearthing these hidden secrets with UCLA iGEM!
[Favorite Hot Sauce?] Sriracha mixed with Cholula and a couple drops of Tapatio!
Phillip Nguyen | Junior | Biochemistry
[Why iGEM?] iGEM is interesting to me since there is much room for creativity,diversity, and autonomy. Synthetic biology is a highly interdisciplinary field that allows individuals from a multitude of backgrounds to come together and produce novel systems, or reinvent preexisting ones. Being that it is primarily undergraduate, I have the impression that everyone has a bigger voice in project directions compared to a conventional university lab.
[Favorite Molecule?] Phosphatidyl Choline
Kane Nania | Junior | Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
[Why iGEM?] The idea that we can engineer life to do practically anything, the idea that that we can abstract this engineering through iGEM and the standardization of genetic parts, is pretty awesome. The potential of synthetic biology is massive and I want to be a part of that.
[Favorite Hairstyle?] Bald with a mullet. Preferably if they have a beard which connects with the mullet. Preferably yet if the beard is of the chinstrap flavour.
Sam Michaels | Freshman | Bioengineering
[Why iGEM?] The environment of students exploring the workings of life is inspiring to witness and exposes me to a new world of possibilities.
[Favorite Aquatic Animal?]Octopus! Their tentacles are fascinating to watch roll around and suction to everything in sight.

Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," in 2011 in Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University in Russia. I was learning technical and physical courses, e.g. Electrodynamics, Optics, Quantum Physics, Math, Statistics, Computer Sciences, Electronics… At the moment, I am in the first year of the Interdisciplinary Approaches to Life Science (AIV) Master Program and I fell in love with Biology... or rather Synthetic Biology! So, with my interdisciplinary background I intend to apply my numerous skills to make humanity’s life better and save the world. I am deeply interested in fighting cancer and to participate in ecological projects. I am sure that participation in iGEM is a great possibility to meet interesting people, share my skills and to learn something new! And of course to have a fun summer while realizing useful project! As for my other interests, I love sports, dancing, music, nature and life!
Aishah Prastowo
1st year AIV master student at Paris Descartes University
Before my master I did Engineering Physics in Gadjah Mada University Indonesia. As my final project of my undergraduate, I studied microfluidics and did a project on low-cost microfluidic system for generating biomicrobubbles. Currently I am doing my internship about real-time control of gene expression in yeast. For me engineering is all about systems design and modeling, making innovation and troubleshooting, and so is synthetic biology. I hope I can learn both science and soft skills by participating in iGEM, while contributing my best for the team.
Julianne Rieders
1st year AIV master student at Paris Descartes University
I earned my B.A. at Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr Pa, where I studied biology and East Asian studies. I am primarily interested in molecular therapeutics, and believe that the application of synthetic and systems biology to this field will allow for the development of safer more efficient treatments. I am currently involved in a hardcore synthetic biology project working with both bacterial and mammalian cells. Participating in iGEM is an ideal opportunity to apply and share my skills in this field, as well as expand my skill set, in an exciting and competitive environment.
Ernest Mordret
2nd year AIV master student at Paris Diderot University and 3rd year at AgroParisTech
By the end of high school, I had quite a hard time choosing between biology studies and the classical engineering track. Thus, iGEM and synthetic biology are a way to use this engineering approach in order to serve my passion for biology. I am deeply interested in the"

As we can see, all of our transformed bacteria appears in red. Our Crispr/Cas9 system seems to have an efficiency of 100%
Biomolecular confirmation of our Crispr/Cas9 system
An enzyme digestion (PstI) was performed on the same strains to check that the recipient plasmid was correctly cut after the transformation of our killer plasmid.
Biomolecular confirmation of the effect of CRISPR/Cas9 on the reporter plasmid: miniprep on colony and linear digestion with PstI.

Made a gel for PCR products
25mL 1x TAE buffer and 0.25g agarose in flask and microwaved until dissolved
Let flask cool until it could be picked up
Added 2.5µL SYBR Safe
Poured into mold, put in comb, and let harden under ice bin to protect SYBR Safe from light
Purified PCR products (PureLink PCR Purification Kit)
Pipet 20µL PCR sample (1F/1R, 2F/3R, 4F/4R, 6F/6R) into individual 1.5mL tubes
Add 80µL Binding Buffer 2 (B2) to each sample (4x volume) - pipette to mix
B2 is used for purifying PCR fragments
Load each solution into individual spin column collection tubes
Centrifuge at 11,000g for 1 min and discard flow through
Add 650 µL wash buffer (W1) (ethanol had already been added)
Centrifuge at 11,000g for 1 min and discard flow-through
Centrifuge at max speed (16,100) for 3 min.
Add 50µL Elution Buffer (E1) to column and let sit for 1 min
