Conceptualization
Figure 3: Diagram of maximum and minimum production rates computed by flux variability analysis based on optimal growth rate.
FVA can determine the full range of numerical values for each reaction flux within the network.  Additionally, it allows for a broader analysis of growth and production rates compared to FBA. Since biomass rate reflects the growth condition, cells must have a positive biomass flux rate to survive and proliferate.  This positive value is indicative of a real cellular system since cells prefer to have increases in growth rather than increases in product output; however, our goal is to increase the production flux rate above a zero value. Therefore, among all the possible set of fluxes, the optimal flux is located where growth and production rate are at the optimum point for cell survival and compound output.
Differences between the maximum and minimum production rates are compared for each reaction in a set of fluxes. Reactions that demonstrated higher flux in the maximum production rate versus the minimum production rate represent metabolites that could be increased to increase overall product output (Figure 3). This analysis generates a list of compounds that should increase product output if increased in concentration in the growth media.
Note that not all compounds can be imported into the cell. Hence, only the metabolites that have native transporters in E. coli were considered for wet-lab verification. We used a model based on glucose minimal media; however, this could be applied to any media type.

Disclaimer: Original model built using minimum media with glucose.
1. Define relationship between growth rate and production rate.
2. Find out the optimal growth rate that can maximize the production.
3. Get the differences in percentage of flux rate for each reaction between production maximum and minimum set.
4. Collect all reactions with different percentages between two sets that exceed the user input threshold. (The input threshold determines the size of the difference in flux that the user is interested in.  We used a 100% difference in our model.).
5. Score each compound in all collected reactions, with the initial score of zero for each compound (Scoring is determined by the difference in the value of a particular compound when the flux sets of the desired compound production are maximized and minimized as determined by FVA). This process is additive if the particular compound is found in more than one reaction (i.e., ATP) and only includes the reactions identified from"

2.1  Introduction
      Given that the extra energy                                     consumption of heterologous expression is not conducive to cell growth, we do not                                     want to allow all the expression of first three enzymes to be controlled by strong                                     promoters. Instead, we want to use mathematical modelling to obtain the optimal                                     proportion of enzymes with a higher yield of NAS, and to select the appropriate                                     combination of constitutive promoters according to the modeling results.                                     In a plan of our project, there are two kinds of cells in our design. The first                                     cells can express the first three enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway of melatonin,                                     including TDC, T5H and SNAT. Thus, in this kind of cells, tryptophan is catalyzed                                     into tryptamine by TDC; next, tryptamine is converted into serotonin by T5H;                                     sequentially, N-acetylserotonin (NAS) is synthesized from serotonin by SNAT. The                                     last enzyme of this biosynthesis pathway, COMT which catalyze NAS to melatonin, is                                     expressed in the second cell. The function of each cell is shown in Fig.1.
Fig.1. This figure shows the design of our project. Cell A                                         contains 3 process of enzyme catalysis, and Cell B contains the last part of                                         synthesizing Melatonin.
      When it comes to the field of enzyme kinetic,                                     the most famous theory to describe the                                     behavior of enzyme reaction must be the Michaelis-Menten theory. In the following                                     chapters, we will start with traditional M-M theory. However, we will modify this                                     theory since it’s far from reliable when it comes to a complex reaction system. The                                     reasons and results will be shown in the following chapters.

While the concepts of antibiotics and resistance markers hardly needed explaining, the method of homologous recombination was new to most. Then we turned to the more concrete of what actually goes on, in and out of the lab. Once again some methods, PCR and gel electrophoresis, were very familiar to the class, while methods like NanoDrop, MiniPREP and MAGE warranted longer explanation. The latter of which was even new to our, otherwise seasoned, teachers. Next were the dry-lab activities such as oligo modelling for optimization of MAGE protocol.

Biosensor  - This project soon allow high school classes to create their own BioBrick bypassing strong governmental regulations. 
“Biosensor” is a product of our dedicated passion to teach synthetic biology to all high school students in Denmark. We designed an interdisciplinary laboratory and theoretical project for high school students. The goal is to teach them, how to design and make a biosensor by combining two biobricks from the parts registry.
We tested the project with three highschool students. Together, they made three biosensors that could detect the active compound in aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid. The three biosensors produced different signals which they selected themselves. We tested GFT, YFP, and a blue chromodomain protein.
The biosensor was created in three easy steps:
Digestion of the two Biobricks BBa_J61051  and BBa_K592009 with different restriction enzymes generating overhangs that are makes them non-compatible for with re-ligation without the other part. (~1 hour)
Heat-inactivation step of restriction enzymes. (20 minutes)
Ligation of two biobricks  (15 minutes)
Transformation of chemical competent E. coli K12 strain..
Selection on LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol and optional acetylsalicylic acid.
 
Challenges
There were three main challenges with designing an iGEM project for 200 highschools in Denmark:

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Mutation#Reversion_-_-_TEXT.html," trying to measure revertants in wild-type     cultures were the trait offs in respect to the number of plated cells. Plating too few cell leads to no revertants, while     plating too much cells leads to an unspecific growth of a strange bacterial lawn of not resistant cells on top of other dead     cells. However, this experiment clearly showed that the number of mutations caused by the wild type polymerase is not measureable     in this experiment.
Our next experiment was tailored to the Evobody generation process. In this proof of concept  experiment Evobody-producing E. coli are selected based on their different growth rates. Simultaneously,the Evobody coding sequence was mutagenized.     The recommended mutagenesis protocol for the EP Pol I includes periodic retransformation of the mutagenized plasmids. However,     this is not suitable to our approach. We started with a library and therefore avoided transformations to keep the diversity as     high as possible. Transformations are known bottle necks, while working with libraries. Therefore, we investigated the mutation     accumulation rate by inoculating LB culture with colonies grown at 30°C and growing them to saturation at 37°C. To calculate the     mutation accumulation according to equation 2 the reversion frequency were determined at two different points of the cultivation.
Figure 2: Reversion frequency of E. coli JS200 with EP Pol I at different time points. JS200 carrying the     EP Pol I and the stop lactamase plasmid were cultivated for 24 h in LB at 37°C (biological replicates A-C).     The reversion frequency was determined after 0 h and 24 h by plating and counting the fraction of ampicillin resistance     colonies. The reversion frequency increases over time by the factor four.
This cultivation experiment revealed two interesting results:
The mutation frequency within JS200 colonies containing the EP Pol I grown at the permissive temperature      of 30°C is still notable
The reversion frequency increases after cultivation at 37°C by the factor of four.
Both results show striking similarity to a previously determined mutation rate at the permissive temperature (Camps, personal communication).     Camps told us, that mutations still occur at 30°C, but the rate is reduced to only 25% of the mutation rate at 37°C.

Develop bioassay to screen PLA production
We needed a way to detect the PLA once we produced it using the heterologous enzymes
We decided to use the fluorescent dye Nile red, a intercellular lipid strain
Nile red does not affect the growth of bacteria, and its fluorescence is quenched in water
This is a figure from Spiekermann et al. 1996 demonstrating Nile red staining of both PHB+ E. coli and PHB negative E. coli
Positive Control
We used the 2012 Tokyo Tech Biobrick (BBa_K934001) as a positive control to attempt to detect Nile red fluorescence on our plate reader (ex. 530nm, em. 590nm)
This plasmid had three enzymes which together give E. coli that ability to synthesize P(3HB) a similar plastic PLA
Cells were grown for 24 hours in the presence of Nile red.  The cells were washed and resuspended in PBS.
Our Construct
We then proceeded to test our plasmid in the plate reader.
Cells were grown for 24 hours with both enzymes induced and in the presence of Nile red.  The cells were washed and re-suspended in PBS.  The readings were normalized for optical density.
FACS Sorting
In order to quickly screen the large diversity created using MAGE, we employed Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
FACS could  sort cells based on the Nile red fluorescence, thus indicating those cells that have produced larger quantities of PLA
Testing for PLA
Nile red has an emission maximum at 598nm when bound to p(3HB) granules according to Spiekermann et al. 1998
Thus we decided to use PE-Texas Red which has an emission maximum at 615nm in order pick the best colonies.

Expected QALYs gained was calculated using 70 as lower a bound for life expectancy. The national life expectancy at birth in the UK is 81, [22] however for those who have NSCLC, and thus are likely to have smoked, life expectancy is at least 10 years lower. [23] The quality of life score is assumed to be 1, i.e when someone is cured of NSCLC, the years of life gained are assumed to be in perfect health or any other factors that reduced their quality of life were not considered to be due to NSCLC. Thus QALYs gained = 70 - current age. If an individual is over 66, QALYs gained are taken to be 5, as the statistics used were for 5 year survival.
Cost per QALY was calculated by dividing expected cost by expected QALYs. If this is less than £30000, screening for the next 6 years is cost effective for that patient.
When building this model we tried to use reasonable estimates to ensure we do not overestimate the cost effectiveness of our test.
You can download our spreadsheet here .
The model showed that is is cost effective to screen most people who have smoked.
The American Cancer Society recommends screening for people: [24]
between 55 and 77 years old,
who currently smoke or have quit smoking in the last 15 years
who have at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking
We entered the details for someone at the lowest thresholds: someone aged 55, quit smoking 15 years ago, has a 30 pack-year history of smoking along with the average American’s build: male, white, no history of cancer or any lung diseases, college educated and a BMI of 27. [25] They would cost £6900 per QALY to be screened, making our tool extremely cost effective by the NICE £20,000 per QALY target. It would therefore be cost effective, by our analysis, to screen people with our system with even lower risks of developing NSCLC. This is mainly due to the low cost of our test and significantly improved surival rates when NSCLC is diagnosed in earlier stages.
The one significant assumption we may have over-estimated is sensitivity, as it is unlikely to be 100% in reality. However, for the same individual it would remain cost effective to screen even if sensitivity were reduced to 34% (£19,800 per QALY). This would never be ethically acceptable, given the number of cases of cancer you"

Safety
1.  Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
    1. researcher safety,
    2. public safety, or
    3. environmental safety?
With regards to safety, one potentially concerning aspect of our software project is the vast amount of information a user has direct access to. This data comes in the form of many thousands of features with associated DNA sequences. But, our database contains well-known, hand-curated features, and we do not believe that these commonly-occurring features present a direct safety concern for the design of unsafe or harmful pathogenic plasmids, for example. Our features come from the Saccharomyces Genome Database, the E. coli K-12 database supported by the University of the Wisconsin Madison, and the Registry of Standard Parts.
Though we do have a database of pathogen genes to allow the user to scan their DNA, for potential pathogenic sequences, the user does not have direct access to the details of this database. For instance, users may not view the sequence of a particular pathogen. Our software simply informs a user if their sequence is potentially pathogenic without providing any further details. Our list of features were obtained from the Virulence Factors Database maintained by the State Key Laboratory for Moleclular Virology and Genetic Engineering, Institue of Pathogen Biology, CAMS&PUMC.
One feature of AutoGene that can pose safety issues is the ability to add features into a user’s personal stand-alone database. This may present safety hazards if the user adds pathogenic features, for instance. However, through constant updates in the software, we can attempt to filter out suspicious use of our software by denying access and usability of harmful genes. In particular, one way we can develop this type of filter is by matching the user’s imported features against our pathogenic database as an initial screening. Over time, our pathogenic database will grow in size, and this will significantly help in detecting unsafe user-imported features. These unsafe features will not be permitted for use in our software.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
    1. did you document these issues in the Registry?
    2. how did you manage to handle the safety issue?

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Questionnaire_-_-_TEXT.html," also in professional research environments, as Macleod and Nersessian explain .
Regular meetings where progress and issues of every field are presented and discussed with the whole team are one option. These can take a lot of time, but ensure all team members stay informed and can voice their insights. Some teams hold meetings weekly, others daily. Brief daily meetings can be accompanied with more thorough weekly meetings
For facilitating communication, having the modelers and experimentalists working closely together is beneficial. This can be achieved by having the modelers take part in the experiments or the experimentalists work together with modelers to discuss the modeling and answer biology-related questions. To enhance interaction, simply situating the modelers in the lab can be helpful . Ideally, the experimentalists involved in modeling would spend some time to study the basics of modeling and take part in modeling meetings to complement the knowledge of the modelers. This helps modeling in taking into account all biologically relevant interactions and avoiding biologically unrealistic assumptions. In professional environments, on the other hand, modelers have been seen as more likely to be able to adapt to experimental contexts than vice-versa.
Team compositions
The division of fields in the 84 randomly chosen iGEM teams was similar to our survey, indicating that our respondents are a representative sample of iGEM participants.
Both professional synthetic biology research groups and iGEM teams have somewhat similar composition, with most of the team having biology backgrounds. However, professional groups have almost double the amount of mathematical fields (22% in professional research groups vs 11% in iGEM teams). Students and researchers from these fields usually do modeling, perhaps indicating that the role of modeling is more prominent in professional synthetic biology research groups.
Most of the mathematical majors in professional teams seemed to be traditional computer science with no biological background, whereas iGEM teams had majors that directly combined modeling and biology, such as systems biology or bioinformatics. It is of course likely that the computer scientists in synthetic biology had more or less learnt bioinformatics, systems biology, or other subspecialty through their work. The division may be caused by the fact that these fields are relatively young as separate majors. Thus, we may see more of them in the future within research as well.
Additionally, professional research groups have a lot less researchers with a biotechnology background (8%) compared to iGEM teams (26%). This could reflect the notion that technology and engineering students are less likely to work with academical research and more often work in companies. People with a biotechnology background appeared to work as mediators between biology and modeling. Bioengineers have also been"
UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html," committee on space research council) has expanded this to include potential damage to native life on foreign bodies (COSPAR, 2008). Which especially relates to the third principle regarding contamination, the biggest argument against utilising GMOs in space exploration. To avoid infringement of these three principles of The Outer Space Treaty, international space agencies such as NASA and ESA operate under the Planetary Protection Protocols, overseen by COSPAR.
Planetary Protection Protocols
NASA has made protocols for planetary protection (PPP) which categorises each Mission depending on both the type of planetary body and the mission type. The design of the PPP for Mars are based on a two way system, firstly that no terrestrial organic material will come into contact with the Martian Biosphere and secondly that no Martian organic material will come into contact with the Earth's biosphere. These categorisations are determined by the Space Studies Board and international policy guidelines. Missions are categorised I-V and the cleanliness of the spacecraft will depend upon the category the mission is given. For example a category V mission will undergo more sterilisation procedures than a category I mission.
Whilst all of Mars is considered significant in terms of planetary protection, as referenced in category IVc missions (NASA, 2018), there is a system of regions of special interest on Mars called 'Martian Special Regions'. COSPAR defines a special region as 'areas on Mars where terrestrial life may have the potential to proliferate if introduced' (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, 2015). In 2013 the special regions science analysis group (SR-SAG2) was established to update the areas of Mars defined as 'special regions' based upon the latest discoveries of both the martian surface and extremophile organisms (Rummel et al, 2014). The report was reviewed by both NASA and the ESA before being published in 2014. The main finding of the report was to add methane sources to the physical parameters indicating a special region due to the potential association between methane seepage and ancient or extant microbial metabolism (Oehler et Etiope, 2017).
Current sterilisation techniques employed by space agencies
Sterilization techniques are employed by space agencies such as NASA in order to minimise the contamination of a spacecraft. The extent of the sterilization depends on the mission category. Category V missions must detail their plans for safeguarding Earth's biosphere from extra-terrestrial contamination, the two way containment system. The current sterilisation techniques employed revolve around a series of clean rooms, sterile rooms in which all particles entering the room are strictly controlled to create"

UC_Berkeley_Tools,2008,Team:UC Berkeley Tools_-_-_TEXT.html," systems that take both quick one-liner inputs or more complex input from the Clotho Data Structure and spit out one-liner or more sophisticated outputs. The algorithm manager allows not only that both approaches can be performed but each are recognized seamlessly. Let's say you wanted to program a partial matching utility into Clotho, where two sequences are given as inputs and a streamlined one-line primer match were spit back out. Algorithm manager provides you all the basic facilities to code such a utility.
Clotho Connectors
Given all these features, there still need to be components that allow Clotho to connect to the outside world. Clotho connectors , so aptly named, perform this exact purpose. These components allow users to connect to databases through internet connections, or import and export data from existing files (think .gb, .ape, .str, etc). Connectors can also translate the results of Clotho back into any number of formats if the user so wishes.
Clotho Plug-in Environment
But last, and certainly not least, is the Clotho plug-in environment . This powerful environment allows developers both associated and not associated with the Clotho Project to create new and customized plug-ins to integrate with their versions of Clotho. Clotho was designed to be as fluid and flexible as possible! While the project is indeed open source, and users can always make new components by making new connections (see Project Technical ), developers can now program personalized tools without knowing anything about the Clotho architecture, save for the plug-in environment! Plug-ins are a bit of an intermediate between a Clotho algorithm and a Clotho connection. This allows for relative customization, but also makes the programmer's life easier. They are rooted in the Java Plugin Framework (JPF) and should provide a powerful, community driven aspect to Clotho.
We have spent long and hard working hours to develop this tool, and we sure hope you enjoy it. Play around with it and be sure to let us know what you think!
WELCOME TO CLOTHO!

Clotho Database Interaction
A new concept we want to introduce to the synthetic biology community is this idea of database binding. This computer science influenced concept provides software tools a way to understand biological part databases that can differ across content, ordering and/or architecture. Clotho understands a standard set of data and its semantic by translating from unstandardized sets of data, and it remembers where unstandardized data came from. This allows Clotho to export unstandardized data to files understood by the community, or to simply take in unstandardized data, manipulate"

Note that the audio of the videos is in the Spanish language for the moment due to time limitations. We will upload the English version of the videos as soon as possible to make sure all teams participating in the next year iGEM competition are able to use this tutorial. Meanwhile, only team members with a basic knowledge of Spanish will be able to make use of them. The English version of the videos will be available on our Youtube channel.
Recommendations
We strongly recommend you check out the work that other teams have done regarding wiki editing. The iGEM Marburg 2018 team created a series of indications on how to design an accessible wiki to people with disabilities. You can check them here . The iGEM Virginia 2018 team created a Wiki Build Tool which makes much easier to synchronize the content that we are editing locally with the iGEM server. We encourage all the iGEM team members taking this tutorial to make their wiki accessible following the Marburg team’s indications and use the Wiki Build Tool designed by the Virginia team.
iGEM wiki introduction
The first step in creating an appropriate iGEM wiki is knowing how it should be like. We are going to have a first look to the documentation regarding iGEM wiki and the iGEM wiki interface.
1.1 iGEM wiki documentation: iGEM provides detailed information on what should be the objective of the wiki and some rules that must be followed. Reviewing this documentation will help both inexperienced and experienced users to introduce the wiki and have an idea of what to do.
1.2 iGEM wiki interface: acabar d’omplir
Online editing vs. local editing
iGEM wikis can be edited directly in the MediaWiki interface or uploading the code after editing locally.
Both options have multiple advantages and disadvantages.
This tutorial is based in editing the wiki locally. We strongly recommend to take a look at the Wiki Build Tool developed by the Virginia iGEM team .
This tool has the objective to combine the advantages of editing the wiki online and locally and incredibly simplifies the wiki editing process.
Setting up a code editor (VS Code)
One of the advantages to edit the wiki locally is using a code editor like Visual Studio Code.
This text editor is available for all major OS (Linux, Windows, MacOS) and facilitates code editing.
In this video, we are going to teach how to use it from the very beginning and set up useful extensions.
Live server offers a live preview of the wiki to see changes while editing the wiki. VS Code also features multiple useful functionalities like"
Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," executed when the technology is in development, and before any product like this is ready to reach a market.
We have particularly found really interesting an article published by Science in August 2017 that shows that people want to be involved in a public discussion about these topics, that two-thirds of Americans approve of editing human DNA to treat disease and that the opinions the public has vary a lot based on their religious beliefs and how much they know about these subjects54.
This article, and the survey performed to obtain its data proves our ideas of the need to educate the public, bring different opinions to the table and dialogue.
For the discussion of the different ethical concerns our project may raise and the creation of our Policy for the regulation of Live Biotherapeutic Products inside the human body (see our integrated human practices) we counted with the support from Erik Forsse. Erik has worked for more than 20 years with administration in higher education and research and within research policy. He has been the secretary of the European Forum of National Ethics Councils and also has experience as an expert by the Commission for ethics review of research proposals.
In this picture, we can see Amanda and Sonia discussing ethics and education with Erik.
For the development of the ethics strategy, we also counted with the support of Marko Ahteensuu, a Docent in Practical Philosophy, Doctor of Social Sciences from the Technical Research Centre of Finland, a Collegium Researcher at the Turku Institute for Advanced Studies (TIAS) and a Research Integrity Adviser at University of Turku.

Reimbursement and Health Economics
What is it?
A reimbursement and health economics analysis is used to determine whether or not the existing healthcare payment infrastructure will accommodate a new solution to the clinical need it solves.
Summary
The solution we have developed targets the alleviation of diseases with excessive mucus production and has a better outcome than the existing solutions. Currently, there is not a cure that fully targets this need, and therefore, there is a great necessity for a treatment to help the patients in having a normal life with the disease, which makes the possibility for a product like this to reimbursed high.
In order to estimate if the product would get reimbursed by public authorities, we would need to have determined its risk-benefit ratio and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) measure. If the benefits of using this technology are heavier than the potential risks it may raise, and the QALY measure is big enough, the product may be adopted for public healthcare reimbursement.

Reagents
In order to provide a user-friendly product, the reagents required for use of Darwin Toolbox must be supplied in a ready-to-use format, and be easily accessible to the non-institutional user. On top of these desirable attributes, costs must be kept to a minimum in order to allow the widest possible market to be reached. Therefore, arranging for users to order their reagents as pre-made mastermixes or pre-set kits directly from the Darwin Toolbox website may be the optimal solution to this problem.
An example market for Darwin Toolbox would be iGEM teams, and so quantities and costs have been calculated for such a team. iGEM projects run for approximately 6 months, and a large part of that time is devoted to Biobrick-based cloning. A project kit can be envisaged that encompasses all the enzymes and reagents required (Table 1) and the various clean-up kits required (Table 2).
Table 1. Cloning reagent costs
In addition to this, plasmid miniprep, PCR clean-up, and gel-extraction kits would be required, these are costed in Table 2.
Table 2. DNA Clean-up kit costs
The total cost of one project kit, buying at retail value would be $1150. However, as many of these items are purchased from the same supplier, and would be ordered in bulk for redistribution to Darwin Toolbox users, the total cost of one project kit could be reduced by as much as 40%. Additionally, users that carry out less intensive cloning and DNA manipulation may be able to extend their kit to last over multiple iGEM projects.
Other markets, such as educational institutes and hobbyists would likely use very similar kits, but most probably require fewer reagents as their usage may not be as frequent as an iGEM team. Therefore, these kits should constantly be reviewed and discussed with the customer community in order to provide the most useful product.
More experienced users, such as field researchers, mould growth investigators, and medical professionals may have very different demands for the Darwin Toolbox. However, these users are less price-sensitive than hobbyists and potential iGEM teams, and so bespoke kit design may be a possibility. For instance, providing pre-coated"

BostonU,2017,Team:BostonU HW#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"The efficiency of the mixing itself can be measured using the following equation[2]:
\[\gamma = 1-2\left [ \frac{\int RGB-RGB_{avg}dL}{\int dL} \right ]\]
Once this value is obtained the channel primitive can be measured to see if it is suitable to perform the needed function.
Valve Actuation
Even though it can be easily observed that a fluid is not traveling over a valve, it is not easy to determine whether the PDMS is being properly actuated by the primitive. In order to evaluate each valve’s functionality a valve actuation test can be performed.
This quantitative test involves modeling the deflection of the PDMS as a beam using Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, and modeling the valves as a simply supported beam at both ends with a uniformly distributed load.  This is an acceptable approximation since the valve geometry is axisymmetric. The maximum deflection of the beam would be equivalent to the PDMS deflecting into the circle valve. In this equation E is equal to the value of the modulus of elasticity for PDMS, and I is equal to the moment of inertia.
\[\Delta Z = \left ( \frac{5}{358} \frac{Fl^{3}}{EI}\right )\]
We would substitute the value of length in the max deflection equation with the diameter value of the valve. We can than calculate the force needed in order to fully actuate the PDMS into the circle valve.
\[F = \left (\frac{358\Delta Z E I }{5D^{2}}\right )\]
The next step is to convert that value of force into a value of pressure. Can use the formula:
\[P = F \times A\]
Lastly, since we know the volume within the chip and tubing the syringe is connected to we can use Boyle's law to calculate for the amount of volume we would need to pull the syringe back to actuate the valve.
\[P_{1}V_{1} = P_{2}V_{2}\]
Metering Accuracy
The metering primitive was developed to dispense relatively accurate volumes of liquid. However, for biological experiments a certain level of accuracy is required when it comes to volumes used. In order to ensure this primitive is dispensing relatively accurate volumes of liquid, a metering accuracy test must be performed. This quantitative test is broken down into a two part process:

Background
The majority of people may have learned that smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer, but you may not know that almost 50% of the bladder cancers are also related to smoking. As we all know, bladder is a vital organ in our urinary system. However, bladder cancer is listed as the most commonly encountered urinary carcinoma in China and it ranks No.2 in America. According to management goals and prognosis, the bladder cancers are classified as non-muscle-invasive, muscle-invasive, and metastatic.[1] Although methods for early diagnosis of bladder cancer have been improved, the 5-year survival rate of metastatic bladder cancer has not been changed significantly[2] According to the National Cancer Institute of the United Nation, almost 74,000 people in America will be diagnosed with bladder cancer this year and this number has been increasing for 30 years, which means more and more people will have to face bladder cancer in the future. Therefore, it’s very important for us to come out with an efficient way to cure bladder cancer.
There are many types of treatment for bladder cancer nowadays. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy, for instance, are two major types of treatments.[3] However, chemotherapy can not only kill cancer cells, but also healthy cells that grow and divide very quickly, thus creating a considerable side effects such as mouth sore and hair loss. There is also another type of treatment called targeted therapy, which can specifically target at cancer cells with no affect on healthy cells. So this year, we’re trying to construct a gene circuit based on AND GATE and Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA) Orthogonal System to selectively express therapeutic gene in bladder cancer cells to kill them specifically.

About The Lab
We work in the Sandy R. Puckett Memorial Research Lab, which was completely renovated in 2013 to provide a research laboratory for on-campus student research in synthetic biology and nanotechnology. It is fully equipped with lab tools for research for the iGEM competition. The students have the opportunity to be creative and exploratory in many areas of scientific research at TAS.
Synthetic Biology
The fusion between biological research and engineering has culminated in the creation of synthetic biology. This interdisciplinary area was facilitated by the recent advances in technology, allowing humans to actually design and construct biological devices as if they were machinery. However, the advent of synthetic biology has raised concerns with biosafety and biosecurity, which is why iGEM places such importance on ""safety""."

Favorite Composite Part
Split-HRP enzyme based PPI Detection device
(BBa_K1997011)
Since protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been reported to play important roles in signal transduction and gene expression, methods for monitoring PPIs in cells have been developed rapidly for years. In our registered and submitted parts, we provide two split-GFP fluorescence reporter systems, split-HRP enzymatic-based reporter systems and split Luciferase chemiluminescence-based reporter system.
Our favorite composite part BBa_K1997011 is an important member of the collection PPI tool kit, which is constructed with the basic coding part (BBa_K1997005), lac promoter+RBS (BBa_K1789012), and double terminator (BBa_B0015) (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the expressed proteins.
Actually, this composite part is a protein-protein interaction prototype of the “HRP-N-Zif269-HRP-C” part (BBa_K1997012). BBa_K1997012 contains a novel SUBSTITUTION SYSTEM for the construction of a protein-protein interaction reporter for any pair of proteins, so does this composite part. For instance, the replaceable FRB-RBS-FKBP segment in this composite part or the Zif268 segment in BBa_K1997012 can be replaced by other Protein1-RBS-Protein2 fragment following the procedures of Bsa I enzyme digestion and Golden-Gate Assembly (Figure 2). Thus, whether the protein1 and 2 are interaction proteins could be determined by output signal of HRP catalysis.
Figure 2. Schematic representation of the part design and the substitution system.
TO PROOF THE FUNTION of this composite part, we used Rapamycin to induce the interaction between FRB and FKBP. IPTG induced E.coli cells were then collected and lysed by high-pressure homogenizer. Once lysed and ultra-filtrated (to remove"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#DataPage_-_-_TEXT.html," xylE gene in the registry ( BBa_J33204 ) was constructed with a constitutive promoter instead of the glucose-repressible part available within the registry.  This allows for increased output in media containing glucose, making it more suitable for a variety of applications such as our own.  We validated the functionality of this part which can be found on our Decatecholization page.  In addition, we documented a novel application for this part, by using it in conjunction with Washington's PetroBrick ( BBa_K590025 ) to degrade catechol into a further break-down product.
An E. coli catalase gene from the registry ( BBa_K137068 ) was also tested in conjunction with a lacI inducible promoter as a new composite part ( BBa_K902060 ) .  This part was characterized in TOP10 E. coli for its ability to allow cells to survive in higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.  This data can be found on our Desulfurization page.

Additional Work and Characterization
Developed and tested both hardware and software for a biosensor using an electrochemical sensor.  The software is available on our wiki as are the results fom the hardware.  These are on our Device Prototype page
Characterized one of our constitutively expressed transposon clones to test the lacZ gene electrochemically.  In addition, one of our two 'toxin-sensing' transposon hits was characterized electrochemically, demonstrating its ability to respond to and report on NAs at levels detectable by our electrochemical reporting system.  This data can be found on our Electroreporting and Synergy pages respectively.
Performed an actual test of our biosensor using tailings pond water, showing that we can detect toxins found in tailings.  In addition, performed an actual ""field test"" of our prototype to demonstrate its feasibility and ease of use outside a laboratory setting.  This data can be found on our Synergy page.
Submitted novel parts involved in decarboxylation and validated the functionality of an additional enzyme (oleT), capable of converting fatty acids into alkenes by itself.  This was done in its host organism. This data can be found in our Decarboxylation section, however this gene has not yet been submitted due to problems cloning it.
Designed and prototyped a physical bioreactor for which we obtained both qualitative and quantitative data for its functionality.  This is outlined on our Bioreactor page.  In addition, we performed an actual validation assay of our bioreactor,"

I’m definitely learning a lot, and it’s a lot of fun tyring to fit my piece of work with that of my other lab group’s work. It’s all coming together and I’m really excited for it!!
man. Im getting really comfortable with computer hardware/ moving monitors around! I love working with big monitors!!
June 22: Today is the day when you don't get work done
well. nah. I did get some done. I learned more javascript, html, and css. and i realized that im really excited to learn new lanuages. I got the hang of microsoft visual studio express, got some hw over the weekend and am ready to get some work done!
I’m really excited to be working on the datasheet for my project. I’ve been in contact with many subgroups in wellesley and boston and am really excited to be able to work at such an interdisciplinary project!
June 25: Oyster
“The world is your oyster.”
lab mate: but there might not be a pearl inside, so it’s better if “your world has many oysters (/ possibilities)” And then after lunch, we ended up watching ultimate frisbee highlights. They were so impressed with it and they all want to watch me play! I love my lab.
Work: my task today was to research a format the datasheets. It’s getting there. I promise I do my work.
June 26: A clearer focus
Our whole research focus is starting to come together. Finally. I had a clearer idea of what kind of projects that we’re going to do and I’m super excited when it’s all done. Currently, I’m almost at the end of designing the datasheet. Then, i’m going to combine my work with another group (who is doing the backend of the datasheet), and finalize the datasheet. It’s going to be sweet!
My version can be implemented in both the surface and in an html, so, it can be used on a microsoft surface and on the web as well. I can’t wait to show my mom what I did!
Another group is making the front end of the MoClo planner and it’s looking really good.
I can’t believe we were able to come up with this idea. but to be honest, we didn’t really implement any of the ideas (or try to implement the ideas) that we came up with while brainstorming.
Rather these projects arise from specific problems/ inconveniences that bioengineers have"

Results:
Plasmid verification:
L, pR1, pR2, pC1 and pC2 are the DNA-fragments from ladder solution, the two samples of pgRNA and pdCas9, respectively. From Figure 1 the two fragments with 1.5 kb and 1.0 kb were found from the fragments of pgRNA after digestion by BspHI. The fragment with 100 bp from the digested pgRNA is not visible on the gel, probably due to masking of the dye colour at the bottom of the gel. Two bands from the digested pdCas9 with 2.7 kb and 4 kb were also detected. By comparing the results og gel elecrophoresis obtained from today's experiment with the results from day 3 (22. June. 2018), one can clearly see that the bands with the expected length from successful transformed competent cells, are much clearer. Hence, this also indicate the samples from the successful transformed DH5α cells are purer, which is also true by comparing the results from Nanodrop (see day 6 - 27. June. 2018, and day 3 - 22. June. 2018).

The experiments with our glucose-sensitive construction were carried out by three different ways: (1) containing only glucose as a carbon source, (2) containing galactose as an extra carbon source and (3) containing sodium acetate as an extra carbon source, since we checked in previous tests that low concentrations of glucose compromised cell growth.  All tubes had, in addition to the glucose gradation, also IPTG (see information on the molecular mechanism ). For fluorescence intensity (FI) measures cell growth, i.e. OD600, was taken into account. We worked with a 0D600 close to 0.1 in order to be able to use high sensitivity in the fluorimeter.
As you can see in the graphs below, the less glucose you have, the more fluorescence you get. And this results replicate well when galactose (Figure 2) or sodium acetate (Figure 3) were added to the medium as supplementary carbon sources. The threshold for a boost in the fluorescence intensity seems to be 0.1 g/L of glucose, since from this concentration the values get really high. Normal values are 10 g/L, and we got the best results when we added 10-4 glucose concentration of that of the canonical values.
Figure 1. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density of the
culture (OD) for differents amounts of glucose present in the medium.
Figure 2. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density of the
culture (OD) for differents amounts of glucose in a medium supplemented with
3 g/L galactose.
Figure 3. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density of the
culture (OD) for differents amounts of glucose in a medium supplemented with

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html,"imer and tetramer versus time are plotted in Figure 4. Since dissociation constant (Kd) of LacI-LacI monomer interaction (77nM) is mush larger than that of LacI dimer-dimer interaction (0.1pM), steady-state concentrations of LacI mRNA and protein are in different scales with that of LacI dimer and tetramer. Due to very large Kd of LacI dimer-dimer interaction, LacI protein would finally exist in form of tetramer in the system (concentration of LacI dimer is several orders of magnitude lower than the scale of the left Y axis and thus be ignored).
Figure 5 shows dynamic behaviors of plasmids in our model. Since only one copy of plasmid DNA0 was transformed, its quantity increases at the very beginning and decrease soon because all DNA0 will bind with LacI tetramer and no free plasmid exists. The process will end in one hour and quantities of both DNA0 and DNA1 enter into a stable level. It is worth mentioning that the stable concentration of DNA1 is about 380 nM, a little lower than its maximum concentration 475 nM. It is owing to reproduction of E.coli cells. After quantities of E.coli cell go into its stable stage, its concentration will continue to increase until the maximum setup value.
This basic example proves great success for iGAME to automatically model genetic regulatory systems. It shows real biological process in a qualitative manner and give suggestions for users to adjust their experiment plans.

Waste liquid from chemical treatment
And some factories directly choosed to only deal with one kind of the   heavy metals that had a larger amount, then abandoned another kind of heavy metal   without treatment. Based on the current situation that the treatment for a variety   of heavy metals are not well developed, the issue of how to deal with a variety   of heavy metals contained in polluted water has been considered as the primary   problem, we hope to use yeats to collect two metals separately in different   periods.
In order to deal with this problem, we put forward a method named mating   switcher, using the natural function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We hope to use   the gender transition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to realize the transition  of   function so we can settle different kinds of heavy metal step by step.
Seek advice by communication with other teams
After those surveys, we had a meeting with Professor Zhang Haoqian and the   leader Zhang Yihao from Peking team of Peking University. They expressed a keen   interest on our team's mating switcher, and pointed out the defects of our   experiment: 1. How could we improve the specificity of yeast to absorb heavy metals?   2. How to separate these two metals?

With some problems to solve, we went to the domestic sewage treatment plant of   Wugang City, Henan Province. The processing plant was representative, but we found   that as a demonstration unit of the sewage treatment plant, they did not detect   heavy metal ions usually. Only when the heavy metal content exceeded standard   emissions, the information could be transferred to the Environmental Protection   Agency. Thus, there existed two problems. 1.Domestic sewage treatment plant did not   have its own set of a detection system. 2. Once the heavy metal content exceeded,   there was no corresponding solution.
At the same time we were told that mixed yeasts were mainly used in the process   of the treatment of domestic sewage. Our goal is to realize a heavy metal treatment system as well as an automatic detection system in our yeast. We hope that we can have the chance to put our yeast into treating sewage one day, so the second thing we need to"

In accordance with the aforementioned design criteria , the PCB design possesses some special features that are especially interesting. One example is the LED footprint: We dimensioned the solder pads to allow for the usage of several different types of SMD (surface mounted device) LEDs. This way, the PCB can be used with different LEDs for different applications without having to manufacture an individual PCB for each of them.
Of course, different LEDs might have different specifications in terms of forward voltage (Vf) and power consumption. We circumvented this this problem by making use of a special property of the PWM controllers, which are ""constant-current"" controllers. This means that they control the current that flows through each connected LED, which is defined by a reference resistor on one of its connection pins. We decided to connect a series of a 1 kΩ constant resistor, a 5 kΩ trimm resistor and a 0 Ω resistor to this reference pin. The 1 kΩ resistor serves to protect the circuit from maloperation, as it limits the current flow through each LED to a maximum of 50 mA in case that the trimm resistor is accidentally set to 0 Ω. The exact current flow can be set by adjusting the trimm resistor. For this purpose, the 0 Ω resistor should not be soldered to the PCB, as the total resistance over the two resistors can be measured more exactly when they are taken out of circuit.
The current flow through the LEDs is easily set by adjusting the reference resistance.
The whole circuit is considered to be powered by a standardized 2.5 mm DC jack, as it is commonly used for electronic devices. With a supply voltage of 5V, many common mains adapters can be used as a power supply of the LED panel. The outer dimensions of the PCB where designed to perfectly match those of microtiter plates, which gives the possibility of using the LED panel in most applications where microtiter plates are applied. For the same reason, the power connector was moved on the same side as the rotary encoder. To actively increase the dissipation of heat created by the LEDs and the PWM controllers, connection pins for miniature vents were incorporated into the PCB design. Optionally, the PWM controllers may be additionally fitted with heat sinks.
Safety Features
For our applications, we intended to mount UV-LEDs onto the PCB. Because UV-light is harmful to human eyes and skin, we integrated multiple safety features into our PCB design to prevent unintended exposure caused by maloperation"

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project Original_-_-_TEXT.html," be affected by Vitiligo, with varying levels of severity. The disorder is characterized by patches occurring on the skin in various parts of the body, hair growing on the patches may also turn white1.
Population surveys have shown that Vitiligo patients first outbreak is seen before the age of 20 in 50 % of the cases, and 70-80 before the age of 30. So it is relatively uncommon with Vitiligo outbreaks in mid-age. Both sexes in adults and children are affected in equal weights; however studies have showed that females contact doctors in a larger number due to greater psychological and social impact2.
At first, vitiligo can be thought of as a minor disorder, however the effect on patient’s self-esteem and social interactions can be devastating, especially in patients with darker pigmented skin where the white patches can be more visible. There are two distinguished large sub-sets of vitiligo, called focal/segmental vitiligo and non-segmental vitiligo. The former is characterized by few numbers of small lesions while the second form by an asymmetric distribution of the skin surface. Non-segmental vitiligo is correlated to all generalized, symmetrical forms. The course of the outbreak of the disease is unpredictable with phases of stabilized depigmentation. White vitiligo patches that are in an enlarging manner or the development of new lesions are classified as in an active form of disease3.
Currently three major hypotheses of vitiligo have been proposed. The neural hypothesis implicates an accumulation of a neurochemical substance in the form of a toxin from nerve endings. This damages melanocytes and thus decreases melanin production. The biochemical hypothesis suggests an accumulation of toxic molecules from the synthesis of melanin in melanocytes, the breakdown of antioxidant molecules, and the build-up of large amounts of reactive molecules in pigment cells. Additionally, an autoimmune response in vitiligo patients has been proposed. Studies have demonstrated that vitiligo patients have developed antibodies and an activated immune system destructive against the body’s own pigment cells. Other possible causes of vitiligo have been suggested, including impaired melanocyte migration and/or development3.
It might be that the mentioned factors act independently or together to result in the same effect, which is the disappearance of melanocytes from the skin3.
Our research is divided up into two areas, which are long and short time effect on the skin. The long term research is focusing on both the biochemical and autoimmune hypothesis, which is to result in a repigmentation of white skin patches after a longer time period of treatment. The complementary short term research is based on rep"

Cell disruption
To extract our protein we centrifuged our cell cultures and discarded the supernatant. The pellet of 1 l suspension was resuspended in 20 ml 0,5 mg/ml lysozyme solution and rolled for 3 hours at 4°C. For cell disruption we used a sonifier keeping the solution at under 12°C at all times.
Streptavidin-Affinity chromatography (SAC)
The isolation of recombinant proteins from crude cell extracts were performed by using streptavidin-affinity chromatography (SAC). In this method, recombinant proteins that are fused to a strep tag can be purified with a streptavidin sepharose column. The crude cell extract was centrifuged at 47000 g at 4° C for 1 hour. Afterwards, the supernatant was dialysed two times against 5 l  1 x SA-buffer for about 3 hours each to remove bacterial biotin.
Concentrating proteins using a centrifugal filter unit
Proteins were concentrated  by centrifugation in filter units by Millipore with varying cutoffs. After each round of centrifugation (3 min, 3000g, 4°C) the protein solution was pipeted up and down to avoid plugging of the filter and resulting aggregation of the protein.
SDS Polyacrylamide Gelelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
Firstly, glass plates were wiped with 70% ethanol and then assembled onto a setting rig. No rubber spacers were added as they were already fixed to the glass plates.  A 15% resolving gel was made as follows:
5 ml protogel
2.5 ml 4 x Lower Tris (pH 8.8)
2,5 ml H2O
50 μl ammonium persulphate (APS) (10%)
2,5 μl N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED)
The tube was mixed thoroughly and added to the setting rig between the glass plates, covered with water and left to set for about 30 minutes. Then the water was poured off and a stacking gel was prepared as follows:

The half clot time of different treatments on the blood was tested and calculated. Specifically, the clotting time of our blood was tested with 70mg of heparin as well as 71mg of heparin in different trials, in addition to either 1mL or 2mL of PNRA or 1mL or 2mL of our construct in order to determine the effects of our construct on the blood clotting pathway. A positive control was also set by having blood with heparin with no cells, to ensure the blood did not spontaneously clot on its own. In general, we were able to show that our construct caused the blood to clot. Although these are preliminary tests, we plan to optimize our construct further in the future in order to determine the resulting flow rates after our construct is applied to ensure that it does not impact the rate of blood flow throughout the rest of the patient’s body."

At last, we talked about the project of SCU_China and the audience were really interested in it. A lot of students exchanged their ideas with us after the teach-in and showed their interests.
The teach-in is a firm success, we not only introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to the freshmen, but also made a solid foundation for the future of SCU_China since many students showed their eagerness of joining us.
Survey
Interview in SCU Campus
To know the students’ knowledge of human microbiome, we surveyed in SCU campus. From the survey we found that most of them knew little about it. Questions regarding tinea pedis and related issues were also included.
The question first asked “How many microorganisms does a healthy adult have, assuming that he or she weighs sixty kilograms? “got various answers. The answer they gave varied from 1 kg to 30 kg, which were far off the correct answer. Such an interesting result showed that though the human microbiome was a hot spot, students still knew little about it. We then asked them that if they or the ones around them were troubled by tinea pedis. Unsurprisingly, many of them admitted that their daily life had been influenced by tinea pedis. They got a very feeling when they were exposed in the foot odor.
When we asked their acceptance to a biological product that can cure tinea pedis by killing bacteria and fungi to make them get rid of the foot odor, a great number of students said that they dared to use it even though it was bacteria-included, only if it really worked and had no side effects.
The Interview at Longquan Mountain
Tinea pedia, as well as the other diseases related to feet is a health problem that really arouses public attention in Sichuan. In order to increase the awareness of the importance of microorganism on our body, especially on the feet, and know more about people’s attitude to our project to improve it, our team went to Longquan Mountain to interview the local farmers and residents.
First, we had a preliminary understanding of the microorganism cognitive situation of local farmers and residents. We found that most people knew that microorganism had a great effect on our health and some of them or their friends were influenced by tinea pedis. Then we asked some questions about our project and it was surprising that most of them didn’t resist to using the insole with the bacteria in it. ""I don"

UAlberta,2017,Team:UAlberta#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," to have gone extinct, but Dr. Noyce believes that re-engineering it could work towards developing a safer vaccine for the deadly smallpox disease, a close relative of horsepox. His work on recreating horsepox received lots of attention and sparked much controversy in the media, both traditional and social. Inspired by his work and curious about his thoughts on the public’s response to his work, we sat down with Dr. Noyce to gain an understanding of how both mainstream and social media’s perception of his work influenced the information actually communicated to the public.
As Dr. Noyce’s research was first becoming accessible to the public, many news stations such as the CBC wrote articles outlining the details of his work, which he believes were accurate. However, like any game of telephone, things began to change when people started sharing and spreading these articles via various social media platforms, such as Twitter. While Dr. Noyce’s research never involved studying smallpox virus, there was one report that aired on a morning radio show suggesting that their group was “one lab mistake away from releasing smallpox and decimating all of Edmonton.” This distortion of the facts highlights the issue that sometimes messages “get lost in translation”, as Dr. Noyce likes to put it. However, just because information may not always get across the way it was intended to, does not mean that science should stop focusing its efforts in ensuring it does. In fact, Dr. Noyce is of the opinion that “it is a scientist’s duty to communicate their knowledge to the public in a way that they can understand.”
Building off of the experiences Dr. Noyce has shared with us, we have made it one of our goals to focus on scientific literacy in our human practices component. His experience has revealed to us the importance of the accurate relaying of information, and emphasized that the onus for ensuring the public understands our work is on us. Without the proper transmission of information between sources, the information begins to deteriorate, until ultimately a skewed version of the truth is released to the public. In order to address this issue, we have designed our human practices to target multiple demographics, from high school students to their parents, and the general public.
Samantha Yammine @science.sam
Since the direction of our outreach began to evolve into addressing science literacy, we thought of individuals that might be able to share their insight with us. An important part of being able to stress the importance of scientific literacy is being able to communicate science to the public. Though there are many different platforms for sharing information, we focused"

Engineering a Biodetoxification Pathway
for Lignocellulosic Feedstock
Codon Optimization
Abstract
Biofuels can be produced from fermenting biomass by bacteria. However, biomass is tough to break down and requires costly pretreatment processes before it can be converted to fuel. Pretreatment produces toxic byproducts, including furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), which will kill microbes. To solve this problem, we intend to engineer bacteria with a recently discovered metabolic pathway that consumes furfural and HMF. Koopman et. al. identified the six enzyme pathway from Cupriavidus basilensis and showed that it functions in Pseudomonas putida. In C. basilensis or P. putida, HMF can be used as the sole carbon source instead of costly sugar. However, this pathway does not function in Esherichia coli. Based on our recent experiments, the pathway also does not function in Pseudomonas fluorescens, a microbial relative of P. putida. We want to determine the genomic differences that allow the pathway to function in one organism versus another. We intend to do this using a novel approach, combinatorial dCas9 gene knockdown. The final objective of this research is to engineer the HMF pathway in E. coli and bring us one step closer to sustainable biofuels produced by bacteria.
Abstract
Codon level optimization of genes allows for fine tuning of expression due to differences in translational efficiency between degenerate codons. It is theorized that through this technique expression ceilings due to translation becoming the rate limiting step in protein synthesis can be lifted.  Traditional methods in E. coli rely on the preference for certain codons across the entire genome, yet this is not"

We modelled this result for further explanation.(For more information, please see MODEL)
After using fluorescent proteins, we used the plasmid pJFR5 (BBa_K2598052), which contained enzyme genes lacZ (BBa_K2598025), bFMO (BBa_K2598029) and gusA (BBa_K2598032), to created more colors using enzymes. The enzymes could generate pigments on the plates and the results of mixing color was easier to observe, which could provide a new material for artists to create artworks. From the figure 13, we could see the different colors generated by enzymes and our system also worked well. The colors were a little dark, and we thought that the phenomenon might resulted from the high concentrations of the substances and long illumination period, which could be adjusted in the future.
Figure 14. The results of mixing color using enzyme.
By controlling the wavelength and intensity of the input light and the time of exposure, we could predict and control all kinds of colors our bacteria would produce. We did not have to edit the proteins to get a new color, and all we needed to do was to change the input light. Our concept of mixing color on the bacteria cells were proved to be reasonable and provided a convenient way for scientists and artists to create new colors and artworks. Furthermore, we submitted all the parts we used (our collection kit) to the registry, and provided iGEMers a strong tool not only to achieve light-controlled multiple gene expression, but to make more creative artworks, to explore the charming junction of art and science.

TEAM SPIRIT!
Our team consist of thirteen bright undergrads, working eagerly for nine months, transforming our project design into reality. With the kind help from our advisors and instructors, we managed to make the most out of our time. We learned, grew and bonded over the (most of the times) stressful hours of digestion, gel electrophoresis, PCR and ligation. These are the people whom we celebrated with when we found out the digestion release bands with right length. These are also the people who patted us in the back when we saw no GFP expression under the fluorescence microscope. We wanted YOU to know them and us better. Don't be afraid to say HI if you see us in the Regional Jamboree. Who knew, maybe we could end up doing research together in the future!

Edinburgh,2015,Team:Edinburgh#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", can be used to induce protein expression3. Having a repressible promoter is key in situations where the proteins can be toxic to the cells in high concentrations4.
Immobilising the Enzymes
After considering the large amount of diffusion of the crude cell lysate through the paper, we thought about methods to immobilise the enzymes so they remain in the intended bioactive zones. This led us to fusing our enzymes to Cellulose Binding Domains (CBDs) to ensure the enzymes would stick to the paper.
CBDs are proteins that recognise and bind specifically to polysaccharides, such as cellulose5. Their advantages include: the fact that they are independent folding units, having inexpensive and abundant attachment matrices and, most importantly, having controllable binding affinities6. This means that we can make sure enzymes that work at different speeds are fused to the CBD with an appropriate binding affinity in order to give the optimal concentration of enzyme on paper. This also allows an inexpensive purification method by washing the paper with PBS after being incubated with the crude lysate as only the CBD fusions will remain on the paper.
RFC10 vs RFC25
One of the goals of our biosensor is to make it a proof of concept for future biosensors with interchangeable parts. This requires us to think about how every enzyme and CBD can be exchanged for a different enzyme or CBD. This standardisation was started with the BioBrick assembly method, such that every part has complementary terminals. The original BioBrick assembly method (RFC10), however, does not allow for the construction of protein fusions, as there is an 8-nucleotide scar between the two genes leaving a frameshift mutation7.
This led us to use the Freiburg format of RFC25 since everything we did relied on protein fusions. RFC25 is compatible with all existing parts in RFC10 and only leaves a 6-nucleotide scar, which allows the genes to stay in frame. The RFC25 prefix and suffix required certain restriction sites to not be in the gene to allow for fusions8. It also meant that our protein-coding genes could be in frame in a single plasmid so they will produce fused, functional proteins when transcribed.
Freeze drying
The final step in creating our biosensor is ensuring its mobility. This is done by freeze-drying all of the enzymes on paper. This process increases stability and shelf-life of enzymes so that freshness, and therefore reliability, of the biosensors is not compromised. It further involves freezing the sample, as well as two subsequent stages of drying9. Freeze-d"

2. Genomic amplification of genes that may optimise the hyaluronic acid production
The hyaluronan synthase catalyses the synthesis of hyaluronic acid by consumption of the endogenous synthesised precursor molecules UDP-D-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetly-D-glucosamine. The biochemical pathways for their production were already identified in streptococci of group A and C. Hence it was possible to identify genes that could have a beneficial effect on the concentration of these precursor molecules for high yield hyaluronic acid production in B. megaterium.
Pathway engineering
Eventually eight relevant pathway genes, including UDP-glcDH, glk, pgmB, gtaB, pgi, glmS, glmM and gcaD, were chosen for the approach of pathway engineering. The sequences of these genes originate from MegaBac v9 database and were used for primer design and amplification of genomic DNA of B. megaterium. Restriction sites not only at the 5` end but also at the 3` end were added for subsequent cloning into the pSB1C3 plasmid (table 1).

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#Recomination_-_-_TEXT.html," reverse reaction is ignored for reference.
Fig. 2 Simulation of Cre Recombinase kinetics without reverse reaction
In this simulation, it can be seen that the knockout eﬃciency of Cre is around 95% after around 5000 seconds (around         83 minutes). Without the reverse reaction, this would eventually approach 100% over time. However, it should be noted         that our model deliberately ignores the reverse reaction with may occur in reality even with lox66 and lox71.
5 Model Simpliﬁcation
In this simulation, due to the high values of reaction constants, we needed to use a very small time step in the simulation         which led to a long simulation time. In order to make it feasible to simulate further models, we will attempt to         ﬁt the progress of the module with a simple system of diﬀerential equations.
Particularly, because the rate of the forward reaction is only dependent on the amount of unrecombined plasmid in the         system, and the reverse reaction is only dependent on the amount of recombined plasmid, we will simplify the system         to have only S and P where S is now the proportion of unrecombined plasmid and P is the recombined fraction. We thus         attempted to ﬁt it into a diﬀerential equation of the form
which would correspond to having the reaction system
We ﬁtted the values of r+ and r− using MATLAB, which resulted in the following graph for S and P.
Fig. 3 Comparison of fitted and simulated kinetics
As can be seen, the ﬁtted values of r+ and r− result in a curve that follows the results from the simulation of the         actual kinetic system quite closely.

Baltimore_BioCrew,2016,Team:Baltimore BioCrew#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," “model”, the team deemed that it was advantageous in the sense that it was stable, inexpensive, quick to procreate.
Since we are currently running test trials on our E. coli, we are confident that if it behaves as we hypothesize it to, the many potential uses for our G.M.O. would be systematic. We could install vacuums onto sailboats that collect plastics to further degrade them in some sort of hypothetical compartment; we could form a new type of disposal bin, much like recycling, to collect the plastic and leave it in the E.coli solution to disassemble itself; we could even have large industrial plastic collection tanks that accumulate plastics from junk yards and dissolve them there.
With this being said, in addition to the incorporation of the hydrolytic enzymes within our bacteria, the bacteria could be able to use the very PET plastics as a carbon source, allowing it to procreate with very minimal measures.
Rather than perpetuating the painting of a picture where E. coli derives a detrimental connotation associated with it, further ideas involve giving it the ability to convert the carbon it consumes into energy that could power technology ranging from light bulbs to hydroelectric wheels.
Our ideas may seem ambitious, but E. coli's ability to reproduce quickly could make our genetically engineered bacteria much more than a large energy supply- it could be the global solution to a problem we’ve been facing for decades."

This Parisian team counts several iGEM participations now. This is after the publication of a press article concerning their previous work in 2016 that we started to get in touch. As iGEM Grenoble-Alpes team is back on tracks after many years of absence in Boston, iGEM IONIS helped us through the human practices area. Via internet meetings, the sensitive subject of the genetically modified organisms (GMO) was talked through. Questions on how it’s spreading could be avoided were considered.
Collaboration with iGEM INSA-UPS team
Aware that cholera’s outbreak can cause many issues in countries where health inequalities strike, we noticed that another French team decided to work on cholera! That is why we decided to team up. The idea was to think about how to better manage health crisis by the means of our devices, how our projects can better assess the care quality during health crisis such as the one in Yemen.
iGEM INSA-UPS chose to focus on the detection and removal of Vibrio Cholerae on water, thanks to an ingenious bacterial communication system, on which you can have further informations here .
On the other hand, iGEM Grenoble-Alpes decided to detect Vibrio Cholerae for human diagnosis in particular.
Both projects are obviously complementary, which makes the collaboration even more interesting. In fact, our two projects propose two different but complementary solutions to better manage a Cholera epidemic. These two solutions could be brought to Non Governmental Organisations to help improve both diagnosis and decontamination of Cholera.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Alphabrick_-_-_TEXT.html," the initial funding obtained for the platform and founder resources are set to run out. Due to this, the team will be raising pre-seed funding in November to continue and prepare for the launch of the alpha version of the platform by January 2017.  The marketing strategy for the launch of the final product will build on the traction gained via users of the alpha and beta versions. Alphabrick has already achieved a formidable network within the biotech community and industry for its early stages, it will harness this to gain the breadth of selected users it needs to complete an initial alpha testing phase. The feedback from this phase will shape the beta version which will be released to a yet bigger number of users to ensure that the platform is ready for product launch in June 2017. The model for the revenue stream for Alphabrick will be from subscription fees paid by users to unlock premium features on the software platform.
4. Business Environment
Alphabrick’s resources, as a startup, are geared towards the realisation of a rolling series of short-term goals that are necessary for the survival of a cash-strapped venture. However, a consideration of the long-term, external and internal, issues that may arise and hinder or help Alphabrick’s progression to a fully-fledged synthetic biology software company is undertaken here to evaluate Alphabrick’s longer-term business environment.  A STEEPLE framework which in its augmented form encompasses a PEST (political, economic, social and environmental) and SWOT (strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, threats) analysis, is used her evaluate external and internal points of possible concern for Alphabrick.
5. Team
Our multidisciplinary team consists of developers, biologists and entrepreneurs and can be broadly stratified into product development and business development. The current team was formed at the Cambridge University Technology and Enterprise Club’s 2016 Bio hackathon. Our 4 co-founding members are working to establish AlphaBrick as an incorporated software company.
Our product development team consists of Kelvin Zhang, Evgeny Saveliev and Shannon Doyle. With 8 years of coding experience, Kelvin is a freelance software developer. Kelvin works to build AlphaBrick’s back end code. Having studied natural sciences and as a seasoned programmer, Evgeny is currently works in software development for AiC. Evgeny works on front-end development, building the user-interface for AlphaBrick. As a recent UCL Pharmacology graduate, Shannon has been using her knowledge of laboratory protocols to help shape AlphaBrick’s interface with cloud laboratories.   Together, Kelvin and Evgen"

1.University of Science and Technology of China : USTC
We went to the School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China(USTC) to meet up with USTC             and USTC-Software.
In their laboratory, the team members of USTC showed us the using methods of some biology experimental devices,             like centrifuge, shaker, PCR machine, electrophoresis bath, etc. We also learned how to use a pipette. Since             there is no wet lab in our schoole, this introduction gave us a clear recognition of how synthetic biology researchers             work, which make us more interested in synthetic biology.
To make our software more user-friendly, we asked how they would search for information once they had determined             the topic of their project. We introduced our project to them and asked for the most needed function or content             that they are expecting in our project. They have provided much information to us, which is really helpful.
The team leader of USTC interpreted the composition of gene chains for us and the process of assembling a gene             chain. Furthermore, they gave us some advice about the information we provided and thought it could bring a lot             convenience for them.
2.University of Science and Technology of China : USTC-Software
Since we both are software teams, we kept communicating with USTC-Software all along. We made a deal to test             and give feedback each other’s system after finishing it. They pointed out some defects existing in our system             in a professional view and we also made some changes according to it. In return, we tested their system and also             gave some suggestions.

B0014 + J23100 + B0030 : BBa_K292001 [2]
This part contains a double terminator, a constitutive prokaryotic promoter and a strong RBS (BBa_B0014 + BBa_J23100 + BBa_B0030). It is a simple promoter in the goal to begin gene transcription. This part is used when adding to a recombinant lambda phage and to begin the transcription of synthetic genes inside the Lambda phage genome.
R0010 + B0030 : BBa_K292002 [3]
This part contains the pLac promoter and a ribosome binding site (BBa_R0010 + BBa_B0030). The Lac promoter is constitutively activated, but it can be repressed by the Lac I repressor from E.coli. This promoter is really useful to control a gene expression by inactivating it with LacI repressor. When LacI is absent the gene should be expressed, and in the presence of LacI, pLac is inhibited. So this part is really suitable for gene expression control by inactivation of pLac with LacI.
We can use this part to control a failed feedback mechanism which induces the Lambda phage lytic cycle (Link plasmide Wiki).  In E.coli, pLac is a part of the lactose operon. LacI is constantly expressed and represses the pLac. In the presence of Lactose, LacI is inhibited and pLac is active and allows the transcription of beta-galactosidase. Lactose can be substituted by IPTG (Isopropyl β"

We ran the reaction for 4.75 hours at 37*, and then heat inactivated the enzyme at 65* for 20 minutes.
We then performed a PCR clean-up on the product, with the following yields:
Library: 9.8 ng/ul (total 294 ng)
CB bottom: 11 ng/ul (total 330 ng)
Planning for ligation of library and backbone
We were unable to perform the ligation today. If we want to use 200 ng per ligation reaction we need 1000 ng of DNA, which is the amount we started with. We can cut some more backbone, or phosphatase the backbone I had cut earlier (conc: 69 ng/ul). We can also use 100 ng of backbone instead.
Based on the yields of the PCR clean up, as assuming 100 ng of backbone, we'll need the following amounts of insert for our ligations:
Insert:backbone   Amount of insert (ul)  2:1               1  3:1               1.5  5:1               2.5  8:1               4
This is because our insert is 137 bp and our backbone is 2788 bp. For equal molar ratios, we'll need 4.9 ng (or 0.5 ul) of insert for a 1:1 insert:backbone.
We also plan on running cut backbone (no phosphotase), and phosphotased backbone as controls.

Plate reader
Yesterday's plate reader experiment looked great! There is definitely a difference between 10^-6 dilution of Zif268 and the negative controls!
All conditions in NM (2nd duplicate) 8/18/11
Comparison of 10^-6 dilution of Zif268 with negative library control 8/18/11
We will duplicate this experiment in a slightly different way to validate it.  Using the same media conditions, we will dilute the amount of Zif268 spec plasmid post-transformation rather than pre-transformation. (Instead of adding different amounts of plasmid to the cells being transformed, we will add different ratios of saturated EcNR2 selection strain+Zif268 spec and saturated EcNR"

The HCHL gene was amplified with a  Xba1 restriction site at the beginning and a SpeI and the end. The NOS terminator with and SpeI restriction site at the beginning  and BamH1 at the end.  The pcambia p1201 and p1281z  vectors were double digested with EcorI and BamHi, 35s promoter, HCHL enzyme and NOS terminator were digested and ligated together. Finally, the construct was ligated to the vector and then transformed into bacteria.
Further Study
Additional research is required in order to troubleshoot why transformation failed.  The next steps will include stabilizing the construct in the pcambia vectors and transformed agrobacterium. Later the transformed agrobacterium, with the desired plasmid, will be used to transforms plants.  The plant tissue then should be analyzed to determine  if the desired products are present.

Week 1
Sporulation salts were made and used to make sporulation plates. Gridded microscopy plates were prepared using a wax pencil. Dead Varroa mites were gathered from the Unifarm location at Grebbedijk, Wageningen. These beehives were not treated against mites and contained a high number of them. The mites were not completely fresh.
Week 2
It was not known how many colonies could be isolated from one mite; therefore, microcentrifuge tubes were prepared with 1, 2, or 3 mites, 2 replicates each. The protocol for Bacillus isolation was followed, except the sterilization step was with 1% halamid solution and lasted 10 seconds.
Initial plates showed no colonies; the experiment was repeated with a ~2"
CU-Boulder,2013,Team:CU-Boulder#Project#Kit#RestrictionEnzymes_-_-_TEXT.html," a tyrosine residue is replaced by an arginine residue and a mutation of the transporter pfcrt where lysine is replaced by threonine [2]. The same mutation in pfmdr-1 may also be involved in lumefantrine resistance and serves as a marker for mefloquine vulnerability [3].
In order to treat malaria, the infecting bacteria must be tested for the presence of these mutations. One possible method of testing for and monitoring the spread of malaria strains is by digestion with the enzyme ApoI [4]. In wild-type strains, digestion with ApoI results in two bands during gel electrophoresis; however, chloroquine resistant strains have a mutation that destroys this cut site so only one band is produced [5].
If we applied the same procedure that we did for EcoRI we could produce a plasmid containing the ApoI gene. We could then express it by growing cultures and later harvest the enzyme for uses in restriction digests. If this restriction enzyme could be readily available, in cheap and resource limited conditions, it would make restriction enzyme assay viable for testing for antimicrobial resistance in malaria.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

Population modelling
A simple view of our bacteria's possible states. Note how when the sequestering spore state is reached, the cell cannot germinate back to being a vegetative cell.
One of the models which we have produced is one concerning the population numbers of our bacteria. It looks at how our additions to the DNA may affect the growth of the bacterial population.
This model has been implemented in the Java programming language, and connects to other models which we have written in CellML, using the JSim application. Due to the design of the program, the team has enlisted the help of some very powerful computers, and final iteration of the program has been to use distributed computing and the ""Amazon Cloud"" to extend the size of the bacterial population.
Distributed Computing
Distributed Computing (also known as Cloud or Grid computing) is the use of multiple computing processors, which can be distributed around the world, to accomplish a single given task. The processes on the machines may also communicate with each other, instead of simply acting independently.
Due to early versions of our bacterial population simulation program using a lot of CPU time and RAM, we attempted to think of ways to be able to speed up the processing times and expand the simulation. Although these early simulations were fairly small scale, each bacterial cell runs as an independent thread, so every system that we ran it on began to slow down dramatically.

ACHIEVEMENT DESIGN RESULTS PARTS ATTRIBUTION PRACTICE
Circular RNAs (circRNAs), formed by non-sequential back-splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts, are a wide- spread form of non-coding RNA in animal cells. Various function of natural existed circRNA revealed recently shows that circRNA can be used as powerful tools in future research and health care. However, there is no toolbox to generate circRNA up to date, which restrict the research and application of circRNA. Our project focus on the devices to cyclize specific part of RNA, aiming to start a circRNA revolution.
We designed three types of devices to cyclize the RNA based on the back-splicing mechanism:the ""Ouroboros""(cyclizing device based on the inverted repeat sequence in the exon-flanking region), the ""Cyclizer""(proteins that accelerate RNA cyclization)and the acRNA(ssRNA that accelerate RNA cyclization).
We experimentally validate that our device can accelerate the formation of cirRNA. We also measured the half-life time of the circRNA, which proved its stability. To solidity our experiment procedure, we designed a device to report the level of mir-21 concentration and modeled the steady state of proteins to confirm our design.
Apart from our lab work, we also took active part in the educational outreach activities which has had huge influences on and off campus. As sociable participants in iGEM, we have collaboration with NYU_Shanghai, ZJU-China and NCTU Formosa, and mentored a high school team WLSA_Fudan-Shanghai. See more...
Regulating oncomiRs is essential to fight cancer! However, the ordinary RNA sponge can be easily degraded. So we give the sponge a shield: we cyclize it! See more...
iGEM competition is based on standard parts, and we have modified most of our sequence to meet  the RFC.
All of our parts to build the “Ouroboros” are all proved to be working as expected, as the testing experiment. Our mir-21 reporter also work as expected, which prove our design of mir-21 binding sites.
We also improved several parts, we develop several linker based on former linker. Apart from that, we use beta-globin intron to provide SA and SD sequence in our circular RNA device, which is inspired by the beta-globin intron"

In conclusion, we must address the issue of environmental impact, regulation, toxicity level of product, route of application, and nevertheless its relation to human health if we would like to address the biosafety of our product and its application.
Product Application Criteria
To create a biosurfactant is really challenging, but of course, the product should be able to be applied to bring benefits. To assess the quality of our product, we brought our product to R & D Center for Oil and Gas Technology to measure its interfacial tension (IFT). While having our product being measured, the human practice team had a dialogue with two of the researchers there.

We had the opportunity to interview and had a discussion with the Head of EOR Research Divison, Ir. Letty Brioletty, M.Sc. This is her opinion about EOR and a good surfactant criteria,
“There are several requirements that you must meet or consider to create a surfactant. The first one, the surfactant should be compatible with the solution. In this case, is the formation water and crude oil. Next, the surfactant is capable of forming the needed phase behavior which is resistant to high temperature. Absorption and core flooding. As long as you could create a surfactant that meets all of the criterias, the surfactant could be applied. Right now, most of the people apply the surfactant based on petroleum-sulphonate. The surfactant is compatible with the crude oil, since the production of the surfactant based on something that resembles the properties of the crude oil. If you would like to create a surfactant which based on something that does not have the properties of the crude oil or the reservoir environment, the challenges are how you would like to modify and create your surfactant. If you could create a surfactant based on organisms, that would be really awesome! It would be really spectacular! It would be very great for Indonesia. Hopefully, the created surfactant would be relatively economic and could be applied in the future.”

With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to solve our differential equations. We tried them by hand but were not able to solve them analytically. We had to solve numerically and chose the Euler method. This involves iterating with short time intervals (here we used dt ≈ 1s) between each calculation using a loop to keep a record of how the substances changed over time. We then graphed these values as follows:
k1
k-1
k2

We’ve recreated this model so it’s actually running in the browser - try dragging the sliders above the graph to modify the rate constants.
Mass action kinetics model with transcription and translation
The first simple model neglected transcription and translation completely, which meant it was an excessive simplification and consequently was not that useful. To address these shortcomings, we created a second model, derived from parts of Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD, with many more species. [5]
This model was very slow to run (so slow we’re not going to try run it in the browser), as there were many species and thus more calculations needed to be done per loop. However, it primarily was slow as we needed a small dt value to keep the model accurate so there were more loops in total.
We had to use a very small dt value or errors could easily add up with so many species. It ended up taking about a minute to run each simulation which wasn’t acceptable for us, as we wanted to be able to quickly change parameters and ideally test a range of parameters. Speeding up the model would make it more useful to the wetlab team. They then could vary each of our parameters and see how they affected GFP output, for example seeing the effects of different switch designs and experimental setups.
Having lots of species also made it harder to find accurate rate constants for all the steps in the reaction. Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD was very useful for this, although many of his values weren’t that applicable to us as we used a different cell-free system leading to inaccuracies -  which were amplified when dt was increased.
It was also difficult to get useful data from the model as there were so many parameters that changing just one was unlikely to have a significant effect on the final result. This made it harder to draw conclusions from the model. For similar reasons it would also have made it hard to adjust the parameters to fit to our lab data when we had it. More parameters also increased the total uncertainty, decreasing the precision of our model.

We made them bigger in the GUI so that the user would have an easier time selecting them, but ultimately we were advised that our efforts were best spent elsewhere so we moved on to trying to make the atoms have double bonding capabilities.
Memorial Day weekend gave us plenty of time go to clear our minds, enjoy the nice weather, and catch up on reading. I started learning a little bit of Blender to see if understanding the tools will help with making things in Unity. I haven’t gotten very far but I’ll keep working at it. In addition to work, I spent some time in Boston running errands and spending time with friends.
Tuesday and Wednesday Daniel and I worked on double bonding and finally got our bonds to change colors. As simple as it sounds, it was a victory for us since we just really working on this code. We also had a lot of meetings since all of the other HCI students were joining us for the first time and we had to help orient them to the lab.
Thursday we went to MIT to learn more about synthetic biology. Having no biology background and very little sleep, I was frustrated by the amount of times someone said, “Remember this from when you took biology?” The answer is no, I don’t, that was 6 or 7 years ago and I had a poorly taught bio class. Anyway, I learned as much as I could from that. I felt like there were very clear directions, but the directions really didn’t teach me anything as there was no explanation on why we did what we did. Even after taking CS240, the instructions on building the simulator with the breadboard were pretty annoying. They weren’t very clear or technological. It was okay though, I learned a bit about working in a wet lab and what the environment was nice and I temporarily got to play with fire so that was cool. Afterwards, we got smoothies and then ran to the bus which proceeded to be an hour late.
Friday was commencement so I had to be there working at it. The ceremony was interesting and Orit won the Pinanski Award! I came back to the lab at about 1:30 and found out what Dan had been working on. He’d figured out how to adjust the angles of the bonds after double bonding, so we worked together on deleting the old bonds. We discovered that there was an array that kept track of bonds, so if we iterated through the array and deleted the other bonds, then we could have the correct bonds remaining"

We selected two restriction sites, BamHI and SalI, for constructing gene T1R2; SpeI and NotI for T1R3. And to confirm the expression and location of the protein, tag Myc and tag His were linked to T1R2 and T1R3 respectively.
The digested DNA fragments were cloned into plasmid pESC-Leu. Then we transformed the recombinant plasmid into the E.coli BMTop10 and screened positive clones by colony-PCR.
The recombinant plasmid in E.coli was extracted and transformed by LiAc transformation method into CEN.PK2-1C which contains the Pfus-mRFP-CYC1t(G418 resistance vector) gene circuit, a detection device.
With the help of auxotrophic selection marker Leu in pESC-Leu, the colony was chosen by the Leucine-defect SD medium containing 0.3% G418.
In this way, we got the recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae with sweet taste receptor and detection device successfully.
T1R2-T1R3 with His tag and Myc tag was designed to confirm the expression and location of T1R2-T1R3 in the CEN.PK2-1C, which was tested through the immunofluorescence technology.
Then we used the minimal induction medium to induce the Gal1/Gal10 promoter. After protein expressed, we incubated the primary antibody for His tag and Myc tag, then added second antibody for displaying the expression and location of receptors in yeast cells.

SAFETY
Lab work and project safety is a serious issue for our team. In each one of our Bachelor studies, we             received lab safety trainings. Apart from this, our instructors gave us safety protocols and occupational             hazards protocols, and finally we were introduced to all of the safety equipment of the laboratory space we             were provided.
Final Safety Form iGEM 2018
General laboratory safety
When we designed our experimental lines, we decided to work on an open bench           with a non-pathogenic strain. We have been working in the safety level of Biosafety level 1.
In the Biosafety level 1 protocol there is included:
Personal protective equipment such lab coats, eye             protection and gloves
Mechanical pipetting
No food or drinks in the laboratory
No phones or computers in the work bench.
Maintenance of the work zone clean. We cleaned             before and after using with 70% EtOH.
Autoclaving the material used.
In addition, the whole team had previously worked in laboratories of the same           biosafety level or higher.
General laboratory safety protocols and precautions
Specific safety equipment such as emergency showers             and eyewashes, as well as the fire extinguisher or the fire blanket.
Waste disposal: Chemicals, biologicals and solids             waste disposals.
Personal protective equipment. In the lab is needed             to wear: lab coats, long pants and enclosed shoes. Do not wear contact lenses.
Appropriate storage for both flammable and             potentially hazardous chemicals.
Appropriate use of potentially hazardous chemicals.             We had access to fume hoods.
Figure 1. The different residues bins that are used in our Research Park. The blue one is for cytotoxic           residues, for example the SYBR Safe gels. The yellow ones, the small and the big one, are for biological           residues. Everything that has been in contact with a biological part needs to go there. For example the           pippette tips after touching LB medium with E. coli
Application safety issues
Our projects aim to be a proof of concept for a possible probiotic. In this way,           we have to consider safety and biocontainment in order to guarantee a harmless product. First of all, a           non-pathogenic strain was used: Escherichia Coli. The strain being used is a GRAS (Generally Recognize As           Safe). We used antibiotic resistance just to select the bacteria who had incorporated the desired genes.           However, this approach"

At last,                 they prescribe the most effective antibiotic or a combination of several antibiotics to cure the illness.                 After this, due to the killing effects on the enteric microbial flora, post-treatment recovery is to let                 the patients ingest pills which are full of dry bacteria such as Bifidobacteria. In                 sum, the whole therapy costs more than one week. Hence, safer and effective biological therapy manifests                 to be in strong demand.
Finally, Ms. Shi also offered suggestions for us to protect the engineered bacteria in order to make the bacteria specifically                 release only in the proper intestinal environment. Acrylic resin should be used as the enteric coating. Based                 on different of pH, diverse materials can be chosen. In addition, although many researchers support the view                 that probiotics can shorten the duration of acute diarrhea illness, more experiments are needed to provide                 a definitive answer to the question on whether the engineered Lactococcus lactis can                 really regulate the micro-ecological balance in the intestine.
Activity: The Conference of China iGEMer Committee(CCiC)
From 26th to 28th August, organized by the iGEM team FAFU-CHINA, The Conference of China iGEMer Committee(CCiC)                 was held in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. Eighty three iGEM teams across the country with professors                 from School of Life sciences and doctors working on synthetic biology, 300 people totally, participated in                 this conference. The CCiC has been held for three consecutive times, and this year, the fourth was the largest                 communication platform for all iGEM teams in China. The conference lasted for 3 days, and simulated the agenda                 of the Giant Jamboree in Boston. The CCiC consisted of the presentation section and poster section. In addition,                 this year the CCiC conference had several special seminars in the evening of each meeting days. These seminars                 were delivered by from some of the current iGEMers. The presenters introduced the knowledge and concpts related                 to their projects and want to inspire other teams in the future. For example, in the seminar of the first                 night, the topics included microRNA and optogenetics. The concepts from these presenters introduced us to                 a totally new field how cell can be controlled by light.
