XMU-EXHIBITION
Exhibition
Overview
   
From Aug.23 to 27, we held a theme exhibition on synthetic biology, entitled Genesis of Synthetic Biology, at Ziqin Building, Xiamen, China. Thousands of visitors were attracted by the exhibition, and among them were both adults and kids. As far as we know, it is the first theme exhibition focusing on synthetic biology in China, even in Asia.
The exhibition was basically composed of two forms. On one hand, 22 exhibition panels acted as the most important knowledge carriers illustrating issues such as what is synthetic biology? What is iGEM? How synthetic biology benefits our life? What if synthetic biology is misused by terrorists? What did we do in 2011 iGEM project and what shall we do this year? On the other hand, we also created a small but cozy cinema. Showed on the screen were various resources linked with synthetic biology as well as iGEM competition. For instance, we selected several documentaries about the central dogma, human genome project, cell and life, and through this window we also presented our 2011 iGEM project, in which we synthesized intelligent control-cell- density bacteria (iccdB) and awarded by gold medal. For better publicizing effect, the panels were written in Chinese instead of English. Moreover, we also offered guidance to visitors explaining some of recondite concepts.
A message board was under our consideration too. Many visitors, after visiting the exhibition, initiatively left their messages and stick the post-in-note. It is quite exciting and gratified to notice that the majority messages are encouraging words wishing us a good result in 2012 iGEM competition. Besides, some visitors wrote down their opinions-both positive and negative-t"

Neptune: Accessible microfluidics for all
In our Silver Medal Human Practices page, we outlined our public outreach and industry visits. These experiences drew our team to focus on accessibility in synthetic biology as a theme moving forward with our human practice contributions. For Silver HP, we contributed a set of informational blog posts on the history of intellectual property, and IP in software and in synthetic biology today. We welcome you to read these at our WordPress site.
WORDPRESS BLOG
Moving forward with the development of Neptune, we decided that we would extend our silver medal HP theme of accessibility in synthetic biology. Indeed, we were developing a complete, end-to-end microfluidic development workflow. Having seen how inaccessible and prohibitively costly microfluidics are for researchers, and also having studied the virtues of open source tools for synthetic biology, we decided to integrate accessibility into our implementation of Neptune.
In this page, we cover 3 ways in which we expand on and integrate the theme of accessibility to our final product, Neptune.
we made it a project criteria that Neptune must interface with low cost, open and readily available tools and hardware to create microfluidics
we partnered with the NONA Research Foundation, an organization dedicated to increasing access, collaboration, and building a community around synthetic biology software tools
we offer our team as a point of contact to other iGEM teams that have created software solutions and would like to have these tools protected and stored on NONA
Neptune: Low cost, easy to use, accessible
As we developed Neptune, we were faced with design choices that would have a large impact on how our workflow integrates with the synthetic biology community. In light of our Silver HP discoveries, we decided the most important design choice would be to make our workflow accessible to all: we want a workflow so easy to use that researchers in synthetic biology will be excited to make microfluidic chips. We want a workflow that interfaces with fabrication protocols that are low"

Small regulatory RNA (sRNA) is responsible for coordination of gene expression network in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Some critical genetic regulation circuits in prokaryotes are mostly controlled by the binding of sRNA and the related target mRNA. In this section, we analyze the phase space of the synthetic regulatory circuit in Escherichia Coli by utilizing molecular dynamic simulations to calculate their related binding constants K. The computed results illustrate a chemostat that allows us to probe various aspects of the sRNA with their related targets. The analysis of the parameter phase regulated by the synthetic circuit also sheds light on possible functional roles of sRNA to indicate the regulatory feedback motifs controlling a large number of bio-synthetic operons in bacteria.

PROTEIN PURIFICATION
One of the major aspects of our system utilizes metal binding proteins, so it was imperative that we purify the protein in order to move forward and complete our Copper Binding Assay. Our team successfully purified the Cut A protein through Nickel Affinity Chromatography (click here ) and Size Exclusion Chromatography (click here ).
Figure 1 - 15% SDS-PAGE of Nickel Affinity batch purification of CutA.In the first lane we used the molecular weight marker RMR002 from GMbiolab. Lanes 2-5 show the elutions that contain our CutA protein. CutA protein runs at around 12kDA; however, in our SDS-PAGE gel it is seen at around 14kDa, this is likely because of the histidine tag. The remaining lanes are as follows: 6- Nickel Regeneration; 7- Cell Lysate Before Binding; 8- Cell Lysate After Binding; 9- Wash Sample; 10- Cell Pellet.
The CutA protein was expressed in BL21 E.coli cells, and those cells were lysed then centrifuged to separate the supernatant and cell pellet. The lysate was then introduced to a Nickel Sepharose affinity column to isolate the CutA protein as it was bound to the Nickel Sepharose by its histidine tag. Then after washing to remove the unwanted proteins and cell debris, the CutA protein was eluted from the Nickel Sepharose.
Figure 2 - 15% SDS-PAGE of Size Exclusion Chromatography elution samples.The first column contains the molecular weight marker RMR002 from GMbiolab, and lanes 2-16 contain our elutions.
To further purify CutA, we ran the partially purified protein solution through a column, that contained beads. The beads have small crevices and this causes proteins of different sizes to pass through during different times.

GFP Fluorescence in High OD600 Under Different Light Intensities
In this experiment, we measured how our cells with light response mechanism will react to different intensities of blue light when grown in same conditions and very high cell density. In such conditions, the cells are not able to proliferate in a way that would affect to the measurements in short time period. This was the first experiment using different intensities of LED lights at 470 nm wavelength. The light response element was fused with GFP reporter gene. Our purpose was to find out, how cells would respond to light in steady and high cell density and how the preceding conditions affect to the fluorescence during a long time period. In addition, we were to observe the relative change between the highest and the lowest level of fluorescence. We had two kinds of samples: bacteria grown  in the darkness and in lit environment (usual lab lightning in addition to desk lamp directed to our sample). We also had a negative and a positive control for the fluorescence measurements.
We constructed a testing device in order to estimate the concentration and the dynamics of the CI protein. In the desting device, we replaced CI encoding sequence with GFP encoding sequence. The GFP was fused with LVA degradation tag. We excluded the lambda repressor and gene C parts. As a result, our testing device consisted of a blue light sensing element (constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23115 ), RBS-YF1-RBS-FixJ ( BBa_K592016 ) and a double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) ) and the testing element (FixK2 promoter ( BBa_K592006 ), RBS ( BBa_B0034 ), GFP-LVA ( BBa_K082003 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) ).
At first, all the samples were diluted to OD600 2,4. They were inserted in different wells of microtiter plates. Control samples both were incubated in dark at two different wells each, and dark and light samples were incubated in 9 different intensities of blue 470 nm light (8 intensities in addition to darkness, ).

Two Skype calls with NTHU_Taiwan：
NTHU_Taiwan’s goal is to deal with EDCs (Endocrine isrupting Chemicals) in farmland. For detection ,they modified E .coli to express estrogen receptor ,ERα on the surface of E .coli. In our project, we choose a yeast-based biosensor. We manipulate the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to express estrogen receptor. During this process, we learned a lot about their projects and helped each other out with experiments and ideas. Every team has its own unique way of designing circuits and perceptions to deal with current situations.

Fitting of the figure S4 from Bonnet's paper with the model 1. The assumption is the fact that the degradation of the dimer of Bxb1 is neglected with respect to the dimerization reaction rate.
By considering reasonable order of magnitude for other parameters present in the lumped parameters, we find that the value of the dissociation constants are both of the order of 10-4. This order of magnitude is not surprising at all, as we know that the binding of integrases to DNA is very specific (which is underlined by the low value of the dissociation constant of this reaction) and that integrases are more stable as dimer than as monomer.

Diffusion Experiments
Monday, 25th August
Now that we tested the different constructs for leakiness, dose response and cross talk, we are investigating in the diffusion rate of AHL. Therefore we designed a chip with chambers connected by channels of different length (see figure). In one chamber we added a strain containing a regulator and a sensor plasmid, to the second chamber we added AHL or an AHL producer strain. As soon as AHL is diffused to the former chamber it induces sfGFP production on the sensor plasmid. The time it takes until we can measure the sfGFP signal and the length of the channel gives us information about the velocity of AHL diffusion.
PDMS millifluidic chip used for diffusion experiments
Three main experiment designs were tested and modified: the agar-design, the liquid-design and the beads-design.
For the agar-design we filled the chamber and channels with LB-agar or in a second attempt with agarose only. Subsequently, we punched a cylindric hole in each chamber. The capacities were filled with regulator/sensor strain culture or AHL/AHL producer strain culture, respectively. After 3 to 4 h at 37 °C we could observe an increase in the sfGFP signal. Since we used comparably high concentration of AHL in our first attempts, we could not detect a delayed sfGFP signal for chambers connected by a longer channel. The experiment will be repeated using lower concentrations. However, conducting the experiment using the agar-design, we encountered a"

pRB9 is negative. All screens are positive in the svp(pMM65) and entD section. In entD this could be due to genomic
DNA in the miniprep. svp(pMM65) is also positive in all plasmids, which is strange. Maybe the PCR conditions have
been too tolerant. Nevertheless the bands of the plasmids which should carry the respective PPTase appear to be
stronger. We will sequence the plasmids anyways.
Sequencing of pRB3-10
plasmid minipreps have been sequenced by GATC [reference] using the sequencing primers VF2 and VR. The sequencing
results show that all the inserts are correct except for pRB9, which isn't a pity because we have previously shown
with pKH1-2 that the combination of bpsA(pMM64) and svp(pMM65) successful produces indigoidine.

Figure 10. Construct for the glyoxylate shunt
The glyoxylate shunt was amplified from extracted genomic DNA from with the primers in Table 10. Both the product and the vector pBs4S were cut with XbaI and SpeI before ligation and transformation into E. coli. This was not optimal as there is a risk of vector-only clones due to overlaps of XbaI and SpeI sticky ends, but had to be done anyway because the shunt contained both EcoRI and PstI sites. They could have been removed through mutagenic PCR, but this was not done due to time limitations.

The second modification to B. subtilis was to make it overproduce arginine needed by the cyanobacteria in the co-culture. This was done by deleting the gene ahrC, which codes for a repressor of arginine biosynthesis [14]. Furthermore, the reporter gene GFP was inserted to be able to quantify the abundance of B. subtilis relative the cyanobacteria in the co-culture. The final construct can be seen in Figure 11.

Results
We tested the LovTap construct with RFP as an output. Light activated LovTap is supposed to act as a repressor at the Trp operator and therefore we would expect a reduction of the RFP signal. Measurements with the plate reader lead to confusing results, therefore we switch to single cell analysis with FACS. The results show a decrease of RFP the first 5 hours, which might be due to the inoculation and RFP maturation.
If we compare the signal strength of the negative control: reporter only, in the two different conditions, light and no light, we are not expecting a decrease of RFP. The decrease of RFP shown in Fig is a result of bleaching the RFP. Also for the LovTap construct we see a different output between the two conditions, but this is most probably also due to bleaching.
Plans
Since we are not able to get reliable results due to bleaching, we are switching our read-out system so that we will have a Galactosidase as an output. As a next step we will measure the LovTap construct in the same conditions using a Miller assay.  Also an important change we would like to make is to invert the signal output, which means that we are not re"

Doctors’ View on Current Situation
Lung Cancer
● Early diagnosis is vital for lung cancer patients as only detection and surgery in the early stage can hold the possibility of cure. However, 2/3 of the patients are diagnosed too late and have already lost the chance of being cured. These un-surgery cases can be called as advanced lung cancer.
● Now numerous people blame the cause of lung cancer on environmental problems, but even in a good environment condition, the incidence of lung cancer is equally high. To some extent, it can be said that the leading cause of lung cancer is smoking.
● According to statistics of 2012, incidence of lung cancer has now made top of all cancer incidence in China, especially for male. Obvious correlation can be observed between smoking and lung cancer. And terribly, lung cancer maintains high mortality rate. The five-year survival rate of clinical lung cancer (i.e., the probability of the patients who still alive five years after diagnosis.) is approximately zero.
● Lung cancer patients stand for unbearable and excruciating pressure both physically and psychologically. There are also some severe complications along with lung cancer, resulting in plummeted life quality after the illness. For example, advanced patients may experience struggle when breathing, chest tightness, persistent cough, and that lung cancer can also be transferred to all other parts of the body, such as brain, bones, causing severe pain, intracranial hypertension, weakness and other symptoms.
Current Treating Situation
● There are 3 main treatments for advanced lung cancer: chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy.
● Before targeted drug therapy, advanced lung cancer patients have an average survival period that is no more than one year, and that with other means of therapy (e.g. Radiotherapy), the period can be extended for only 2 to 3 months. Chemotherapy certainly lead to a plummet of life quality of patients. Finally, most patients lose confidence and Survival consciousness during their cure.
Figure 5. Interview with doctor
Doctors’ view on the 4 treatments
● In the past few decades, molecular targeting drugs visibly elongated the patient's survival periods and improve the disease control. Recently, the so-called ""four carriages"" of cancer treatment are surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and molecular targeting drugs.
● Among the treatments of lung cancer, surgery is generally practiced on early patients. The early diagnosis rate of lung cancer, however, is relatively limited because all tumors had no specific symptoms at early stage. Therefore, rate of patients who are able to be performed surgery also take a minor part. To make matters worse, cancer generally"

UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," this success put us in a good mood.
We also made the mutagenesis PCR to replace T7promoter with Ptac in the vector… We made it with different conditions: with both 10 and 1ng of template and using a three steps program with two different annealing temperatures, 62°C and 67°C.
We often found that this was the better solution, but not this time: we got multiple band product (and the major wasn’t the right one). Thus we made another PCR, two steps: this time the gel was much better  and we transformedÖ and sent for sequencing.
We also made two terminator’s insertions: T7teminator in the T7promoter plasmid  and B0010, extracted by PCR from Bba_E0840 (PCR gel photo), into the same vector .      The more shocking thing of this week, anyway, is that we and all the team tided and cleaned up all the lab!
Week 11 (07/30 – 08/05)
After a couple of qualitative tries of the ninhydrin assay, it’s time to go quantitative: after the reaction has finished I jump to the spectrophotometer and read the spectrum of the samples. Cysteine has a characteristic peak at 560nm. The results correspond to the intensity of the pink.
However, repetitions of the test on different days are not so consistent, as      the peaks of the same sample type are at different heights. The ratio and      “order” is maintained, though.
This is also true while building a standard curve for Cysteine, made by      providing a known quantity of it in the samples: peaks have doubled heights the second time, confirming this test is not so reliable. It still lets me know that the protein is doing its work, luckily. Even if it’s not exactly what we expected.      One time I “steal” 1mL from Andrea’s overnight culture. She’s in charge of      CysDes, the second protein of our pathway. She’s also in the process of      characterizing it, so she always has cultures ready too. I use her version of      the protein in a vector providing Chloramphenicol resistance, in order to be able to inoculate cells along with mine, as all my construct are in Chloramphenicol too. I induce the mix at the proper OD with both arabinose and IPTG (she has the LacI promoter).

Will It Work?
So, will our project be realistically applicable? With this in mind, we met with two well-known individuals in Hong Kong society. Professor Albert Yu and Professor Juliana Chan helped us to understand our project at a whole new level. As a scientist and an entrepreneur, Prof. Yu identified the issues that we need to consider if we want to see our project used as a biotechnology product. Prof. Chan, a medical doctor and an expert in diabetes, provided us with deeper insights on diabetes and the possible application of our project to fight diabetes and obesity.
Interview with Professor Albert Yu
Professor Albert Yu is the chairman of the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization (HKBIO), and is also a professor of the Department of Neurobiology in Peking University, China. As an entrepreneur and a scientist, Prof. Yu gave us realistic insights to our project. Meeting Prof. Yu helped us to evaluate our project beyond the laboratory environment and to think about its application as a biotechnology product. Towards the end of the interview, we also talked about the bioethics and biosafety issues regarding synthetic biology.
Interview with Professor Juliana Chan
Professor Juliana Chan is a professor of medicine and therapeutics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). She is also director of the Hong Kong Institute of Diabetes and Obesity, CUHK, co-director of CUHK-Prince of Wales Hospital International Diabetes Federation Centre of Education (IDFCE), and chief executive officer of the Asia Diabetes Foundation. With extensive knowledge on diabetes, obesity and clinical practice, Prof. Chan brought to our attention practical aspects of developing treatments for medical purposes. Meeting Prof. Chan helped us to understand more about the biochemistry of diabetes. Also, by giving us information on current treatments for obesity and diabetes, she allowed us to consider our work in context. Towards the end of the interview, we also talked about the regulations for the development of new treatments in medical fields.

An Electrophoresis System with Chamber and Power Pack
We also produced a working electrophoresis system (without a creative name this time) and were able to run gels in it! We have to admit that we used a commercial power pack, but all the rest was home made. And you have already seen the results, as the gel in image 3 was produced and run with it.
Image 4 - Chamber, gel tray and combs of our electrophoresis system
We had two major situations with the system. The first one was with the Power Pack. The system overheated and, even though we are working on troubleshooting it, putting our prototypes here could put adventurous iGEMers in danger. The second one was due to the voltages applied in the chamber and the contact of the electrolytes with the metals in non-isolated nuts and bolts and a copper wire used for the anode, resulting in a quite colorful mix of Cu2+ and other ions. This was solved by isolating the bolts and using platinum wires (more expensive, unfortunately) in both poles

This year, alongside our main wet lab project, we developed a set of Open Hardware, low cost equipment, which were used and enhanced in our daily lab tasks. Furthermore, we spread our ideas and designs through many different presentations and even an open hackathon!
Our kit, the “Open Lab Hardware Kit” was planned provide basic equipment for any independent molecular biology lab, which included:
The  ""Seletora""  MiniCentrifuge
Our jewel is this small centrifuge for bench work, with a Harry Potter inspired name and code. It saved our lives in the lab, and you can appreciate its functionality in the video below. In the manual, in the next section, you can check the full design and read more about it (including the 3D printed rotor that is missing in the video).

Regarding genes naturally present in the genome, we chose to place them under the control of their natural promoter. Thus, the cell is never forced to anything, and no pressure is exerted on its metabolism. The genes are produced only when required. This precaution ensures some Security concerning the toxicity, which may be related to the internalization of the plasmid into a healthy cell.

To summarize…
The DVS has a therapeutic plasmid with the following characteristics:
- A sequence ensuring its encapsidation within the cell vector ,
- A sequence ensuring its delivery to the nucleus,
- One or moretherapeutic genes,
- A resistance cassette used for selection of transformed bacteria.

Second Life Lab Completion & Intuitive Exploration
Most of the lab was completed today. The DNA extraction process has been fine tuned 'movement-wise' in the second lab. Nearly all components of the first lab were duplicated and modified for the second lab today, indicating that we have completed most of that part of our project. I've also completed most of the texturing for the lab, making equipment look more realistic.
I built pathways and tubes, as well as began putting together a teleportation map that allows users to more easily and intuitively explore through the three different segments of the island. I will be continuing this as well as write-ups for instructions and background info this week.

Tour of ConocoPhillips and Discovery Centre
Today we did a perimeter tour of Conocophillips to see how and where their bitumen is processed, how much energy is wasted, how much is reinvested and much more. I had the opportunity to speak to Pat (the Communications Lead) about pipelines and some of the problems that they might want future iGEM teams to address.
Although many companies share similar refining, extracting and processing techniques, the use of energy in the process varies from company to company. The cracking of the bitumen into synthetic oil requires tremendous amounts of energy. Although the steam that is used in the process is mostly recycled, about 10% is still expelled into the environment. ConocoPhillips hopes to, someday, be able to use this energy to fuel other processes.
Conoco, at Surmont, use Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) to reduce the viscosity of the bitumen travelling through the pipelines. There are 2 horizontal pipelines under the ground (each 14 m apart). While one pipeline allows the steam to flow through to melt the bitumen, the other collects the less viscous bitumen and helps to transport it from place to place.
We also discussed how ConocoPhillips needs to buy diluents from Suncor to dilute the heavy bitumen in order for it to flow through the pipelines. The machines used to make diluents are expensive and since ConocoPhillips is a younger company, they have not installed those machines. We were thinking that iGEM teams could probably use synthetic biology to reduce the viscosity of the bitumen in the near future.  Finally, we toured the Discovery Centre where we saw an informative video about the history of oil sands"

Example 3. Bistable Toggle Switch
Introduction
A good example of engineering in Synthetic Biology include the pioneering work of Tim Gardner and James Collins on an engineered genetic toggle switch . Here, we want to show how to tune parameters to guarantee bistability.
Mathematical Formulation
<math>\begin{align} \dot{u}(t) &=\frac{\alpha _{1}}{1+v^{\theta }(t)}-\beta _{1}u(t), (.....................................equation1) \\ \dot{v}(t) &=\frac{\alpha _{2}X^{\eta }}{X^{\eta }+1+u^{\gamma }(t)}-\beta _{2}v(t),(..............................................equation2) \\ \end{align}\,\!</math>
where <math>X</math> is input, <math>u</math> is the concentration of repressor 1, <math>v</math> is the concentration of repressor 2, <math>\alpha _{1}</math> is the effective rate of synthesis of repressor 1, <math>\alpha _{2}</math> is the effective rate of synthesis of repressor 2, <math>\theta </math> is the cooperativity of repression of promoter 2 and <math>\gamma </math> is the cooperativity of repression of promoter 1. The above model is derived from a biochemical rate equation formulation of gene expression. The final form of the toggle equations preserves the two most fundamental aspects of the network: cooperative repression of constitutively transcribed promoters (the first term in each equation), and degradation/dilution of the repressors (the second term in each equation).
The parameters <math>\alpha _{1}</math> and <math>\alpha _{2}</math> are lumped parameters that describe the net effect of RNA polymerase binding, open-complex formation, transcript elongation, transcript termination, repressor binding, ribosome binding and polypeptide elongation. The cooperativity described by <math>\theta </math> and <math>\gamma </math> can arise from the multimerization of the repressor proteins and the cooperative binding of repressor multimers to multiple operator sites in the promoter. An additional modification to equation (1) is needed to describe induction of the repressors.

Food Evolution Screening
October 2017
Tired of all the misconceptions and bad reputation of GM crops, which are mostly under the perception of being unhealthy for the human being and the environment, we joined the international Food Evolution campaign by organizing a screening of the movie in our university in collaboration with the Mexican Synthetic Biology Network. The movie is narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson and intends to promote science based decisions regarding the use of GMO crops. We organized an activity at the end of the screening to promote the public’s reflection

Imitating the DACA Spinline
Folded an aluminum tray to hold the coag bath for the 2 godets
Used a ringstand to hold a hook above the coagulation bath
Extruded dope into a 1L beaker of 90% v/v isopropanol
It didn't work!
The hook had too much friction, so the fiber wasn't able to slide over it. I wasn't even able to get the fiber to the first godet.
I also found that with the isopropanol bath, if you disturb the dope even slightly as it comes out, it starts bunching up. It's very sensitive.
Switching back to yesterday's spin method
Clearly the imitation DACA wasn't working. So I just set up a godet to reel the silk above the coag bath again.
However, immediately after spinning, I submerged the godet in the coag. solvent and removed the silk from the godet. I then used tweezers to try to stretch the ring of fiber that formed
My attempts at stretching probably broke fibers instead of stretching them."

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," into the wilds and to cross with other species. It is the idea that “the less natural will be our production, the less they will be risky”. How to perceive that proposal? The internal logic of that idea, that more synthesis will lead to more security isn't a refuge in denial of risks? Regarding unknown evaluation of risks about the reaction of a mutated organism in a natural environment, can we trust our intuition about the security of a parallel system? How can we be ensured of the non-reaction of the organism, even the “less” natural? What if the mutation, despite all, happens, what will be our means of action? The prevention and “upstream” alerts of ethical perspectives don't seem to be satisfied by the same adjectives. Thus, uncertainty about risks coming with a preventive approach is reassuring but, that reassurance isn't coming with the uncertainty of answers.
Synbiosafe mentions the proposal of a parallel biological system which won't interact or exchange with other organisms. The European initiative refers to a “unconventional” biosafety system, through the idea of “high external control” in which the conditions and possibilities of existence of the organism will be controlled and determined by man.
A recent article of Philippe Marlière precises a new framework for biosafety for synthetic genomes (Marliere 2009) based on :
Physical containment
Trophical containment
Evolutional containment
Semantic containment
At the opposite of Genetically Modified Organisms GMO, the author wants to design Genetically Secured or Safed Organisms or GSO.
1-Physical containment
The most basic containment for GMO is “physical containment”.  Even if the GMO strains are in a secure laboratory, it is imaginable that these strains could escape, as it was the case with Foot and Mouth Virus Released from Government laboratory in august 2007.  New kinds of barrier have to be set-up.
2-Trophical containment
Trophic containment would prevent metabolic cross-feed. The GSO needs rare or naturally unknown substances to survive (artificial vitamins).
3-Evolutional containment
In Wikipedia : “it is about creating modified organisms, recombinant (for example, “reprogrammed” bacteria conceived to be unadapted to autonomous survival in nature. In order to reduce production costs, it is already easy to produce massively new recombinant and reprogrammed organisms with no natural equivalent. If they are very different and highly altered, they have little viability in a natural environment. Using that type of organism, said loser (for example “weaker” bacteria so few are competitive against “"

Design and Background
Biocontainment
Why do we need a biocontainment system?
One of the most important issues of creating genetically modified organisms is their behaviour outside of the controlled space. Unintended cellular proliferation and dissemination of transgenic material are long-standing concerns for scientists and society. In many cases, it is hard or even impossible to predict how a synthetic organism will respond to stimuli from the environment. Proper risk assessments of the GMO should always precede its release into the market to evaluate its impact and the worst-case scenarios. Nowadays, several efforts have been made to reduce those risks, yet they are far from being perfect at foreseeing every possible event (Mandell et al., 2015).
PROlung holds a lot of promise for a great number of people affected by several respiratory diseases. However, considering that it is a GMO intended to be introduced into the human body, it poses a risk to an individual, as well as an environmental level. Even though the general concept of probiotics and their beneficial effects has been around for decades, complications have still been linked to the use of bacteria (Sanders et al., 2010). Subsequently, one has to consider the inherent risks of the transgenic material of a GMO, as well as its pathogenicity.
Our team has received inputs from our advisors regarding the technicalities of such a system, as well as the ethical aspects of releasing genetic material outside of the lab. Therefore, we aim to develop a multilayered strategy for a well-regulated biocontainment system, attempting to minimize the negative impact on the environment and the human health.
How will our biocontainment system work?
There is a broad range of biocontainment systems designed with the sole purpose of ensuring that the spreading of GMOs is as limited as possible (Mandell et al., 2015). The use of a toxin-antitoxin regulation mechanism is a prime example of such a system (Li and"

Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance Establishing Conference & Meet-up
Many iGEMers are thinking about a question, also are many iGEMers are experiencing one dilemma. When new blood flows in an iGEM team and old ones leave for the broader world, except from experience on experiment and knowledge about this field, what can we do for the followers? How to unite more teams to expand our influence on the whole society? How to prevent a meaningful Human Practice activity from vanishing as soon as its initiator leave the iGEM teams?
To better pass on the conventions and spirits of iGEM, also to promote the communication and collaboration between iGEM teams from Beijing and Tianjin, we UCAS-China team brought up the idea of establishing the Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance. Gladly, our idea was responded positively. TUST_China cooperated with us to contacted other 4 teams, including BNU-China , NKU_CHINA , Tianjin ,  and Tsinghua who was invited to join our meet-up as guest team. On Sep 16th, we UCAS-China team invited other 5 iGEM teams to Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) and held a meet-up, also to discuss the current and future collaboration between member teams of this brand new Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance.

3. Results
Click on any of the images to view full size.
In the stochastic results, we observe a much greater variation in expression at 95 \(\mu mol\) compared to 948 \(\mu mol\). Contrast this to the deterministic model in which the low/high concentration plots are identical with respect to a scaling factor. Gillespie causes step-behavior in the concentration. Although the plot of  948 \(\mu mol\) appears to be much smoother, we would see the same “cliffs” that we observe at 95 \(\mu mol\) by stretching the y-axis enough. The impact of a fixed gain or loss in concentration is much more “felt” in a small system than it would be in a large system (here size is relative to the initial concentration of Yf1). If we only cared about modeling a large, stable concentration however, the deterministic model clearly suffices to capture the general behavior and is less computationally expensive.

Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"Cas9 via TorA Signaling Sequence (TorA-saCas9)
TorA is a signaling sequence that utilizes the post-translational twin arginine translocation pathway to direct a fused protein to the periplasm of the cell. In this construct, the TorA sequence is fused to the N-terminus of saCas9 in an attempt to direct saCas9 to the periplasm of Escherichia coli. The saCas9 gene is from part BBa_K02019003; thus it has a histidine tag on the N-terminus of the protein.
BBa_K2019004 :
Periplasm Directed saCas9 via DsbA Signaling Sequence (DsbA-saCas9)
DsbA is a 57 bp signaling sequence that operates in the SRP, a cotranslational pathway that utilizes certain aspects of the sec pathway to send fused proteins to the periplasm of the cell. Similar to K2019003, DsbA is also fused onto the N-terminus of saCas9 (from part BBa_K02019003). Furthermore, expression of DsbA-saCas9 can be detected utilizing this his tag on the N-terminus of saCas9.
BBa_K2019005 :
Periplasm Directed saCas9 via Ycdo Signaling Sequence (Ycdo-saCas9)
The signaling sequence Ycdo utilizes the cotranslational sec pathway to direct proteins to the periplasm of the cell.  In this construct, Ycdo is fused to the N-terminus of saCas9. This Ycdo-saCas9 can be detected using a Western blot with his6 antibodies.

reaction rates of the system (a1, a2, a3) at a given configuration.
a random number generator.
For each time step two things are calculated, using the random number generator: The time before next reaction and which reaction occurs.  The time before next step is given by
Hello Emil
Where S is the sum of the reaction rates and r1 is a random number between 0 and 1. This gives the time as if the system was one reaction with reaction rate S, using the random number to give a statistic distribution.  The reaction is chosen proportionally to each individual reaction rate, using another random number. This way, reaction with high rates compared to other reactions will happen the most.
The reaction is carried out, the time is moved the calculated amount, and new reaction rates can now be calculated, to repeat the whole process. This continues until the time reaches the wanted limit or a specific number of reactions have occurred. It is necessary to have a limit on the number of reactions as it is possible for the time steps to grow smaller and smaller, in which case the calculation time quickly become either immense or impossible.

Toxin/Antitoxin System
Approach
We are modelling the RelE RelB toxin-antitoxin system. RelE is a toxin restricting growth, by inducing a dormant state. This is inhibited by RelB, which forms complexes with RelE. Two different complexes are made: RelB2RelE and RelB2RelE2, containing 1 and 2 RelE molecules respectively Guang-Yao Li, Yonglong Zhang, Masayori Inouye, Mitsuhiko Ikura, Structural Mechanism of Transcriptional Autorepression of the Escherichia coli RelB/RelE Antitoxin/Toxin Module, In Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 380, Issue 1, 2008, Pages 107-119, ISSN 0022-2836 .
Both RelE and RelB are expressed from the same promoter, RelBE. When only small amounts of RelE is present, RelB and RelB2RelE represses transcription of RelBE, by binding to the operator.
At higher concentrations of RelE, the toxin mitigates this repression, by reacting with bound complexes Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery."

This year, we have collaborated with Virginia, EPFL, UC_Davies and Imperial_College iGEM teams!
For collaborations this year, we completed the biocontainment survey created by the Virginia iGEM 2016 team. They collected information about the awareness of biocontainment within iGEM teams. We responded by stating that our biological system would be contained within the confines of a bio-refinery with no exposure to the external environment.
Second, we participated in the iGEM.today project, designed by the EPFL iGEM 2016 as a part of their human practices. This platform presents iGEM teams and their projects through news articles, it makes a great platform to learn more about iGEM projects in interactive and interesting ways. We were interviewed about our team, “Crescentium,” our project, and our overall experience with participating in iGEM this year.
We also participated in the iGemMatch.org project, created by the UC Davies Team. This project is designed to easily find collaborators from the iGEM community relevant to your project or areas of expertise.
Lastly, we have collaborated with Imperial_College iGEM team. For their project, they chose to develop a framework to engineer microbial communities, what is extremely relevant to our project. We collected some growth data over a range of pHs for Caulobacter and E.coli, which they can use to validate their developed A.L.I.C.E software for co-cultures.
All in all, this was a great year for hearing the experiences the international iGEM community. We heard a lot of interesting stories and a lot of great experiences are"

European iGEM Meetup organised by TU Delft
Two of our teammates participated in a European iGEM meeting in the Netherlands in Delft as the only high school iGEM team and also the only one from Eastern Europe. It was held on the 7th and 8th of July and we had the chance to meet several iGEM teams and scientific researchers there. Participants had the opportunity to attend lectures held by university professors about synthetic biology and responsability while working on a synthetic biology experiment. It was a great pleasure for us to talk to others with similar interests about our scientific research work. Every team brought a poster to this excellent meeting as a result of which we could have a deeper insight into other iGEM teams' project. In our experience, the TU Delft team provided a great chance to make friends from the iGEM world and collaborate with other participant teams. We extremely appreciated all of the precious, practical and helpful collaborations given by others. In the name of the Methungeny team, I would like to thank you the possibility to show our project to others, TU Delft! (https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUDelft )"

Fudan_China,2017,Team:Fudan China#TSS_-_-_TEXT.html," has been inverted by the integrase. One of the five integrases is also expressed using PBAD controlled by L-arabinose. We tested each sites by PCR after inducing or not inducing with 0.27%(w/v) L-arabinose for 16 hours.
Figure 4 | Overview of the orthogonality experiment system. a, plasmid pUC19 with transcriptional factors; b, plasmid p15A with test devices for orthogonality. There are 5 of this kind of plasmid with 5 integrases. All primer pairs used in following experiments are shown as arrows; c, primer pairs A & B designed.
Results
Figure 5 | Gel electrophoresis results of PCR with 25 cycles using specific primer pairs to validate the orthogonality. Every attB/P sites on testing plasmid(see Fig.4) of each integrases were tested. Original attB/P site with specific primer pairs A and B is shown in Fig.4 c. Pair A used to detect original site, while pair B used to detect recombinated site. Experiments were set up in E. coli TOP10 strain with transcriptional factors cultured at 37℃.
As shown in Fig.5, bands on lane A and B indicate the existence of original and recombined attB/P sites template respectively. The result implies good orthogonalilty between most integrases in that only the band of corresponding recombined attB/P site appears after induction. However, we find that integrase phiRv1 can invert the sequence between attB and attP sites of integrase phiC31. By the way, the leakage of integrase Bxb1 and TG1 is obvious. We have discuss this leakage in diffusion model part.
The efficiency of the integrases
Overview
If we want to build meaningful sequential memory modules, integrases we use in our system should have high efficiency, which means low leakage and high percentage of recombinant after induced. So, we designed experiment to investigate original sites versus recombinants.
Methods
Another type of testing plasmids was constructed(Fig.6). Sites of phiBT1, Bxb1, phiC31, phiRv1 and TG1 were tested using qPCR, quantitively measuring the percentage of recombinants.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," employees of TU Delft are generally property of TU Delft. The intellectual property generated by students can be, depending on the circumstances, owned by the students, the TU Delft or a combination of both. For example, when students are coached by TU Delft employees who contribute to the invention, they can be co-inventors and TU Delft can have a (partial) claim on the IP.
To determine the contribution to the invention of the individual students and TU Delft employees, we have to determine what the individual share is of every stakeholder in the developing process. The Valorisation Centre can help in this process.
As the worth of a patent can be diminished by having multiple owners a  common solution is that the co-inventors that are not TU Delft employees transfer their rights resulting from their co-inventorship to TU Delft, who will become the sole owner of the patent. In return the startup company can agree on the conditions for an (exclusive) license and future transfer of the patent to the company. In these conditions the co-inventorship of the student team will be taken into account.
Marketing
Market definition
The biological microlens can be employed for a large number of applications. For example, single microlenses are often used to couple light to optical fibers, while microlens arrays can for example be used for CCD arrays and for digital projectors, where they focus light to specific areas of the LCD. With microlenses it is possible to make lightweight compact imaging devices. Therefore, they could also be used in for example mobile phones. Furthermore, microlenses can also be used as encapsulation layer for solar panels in order to increase the efficiency of these panels. We will firstly focus upon this last possible application. The business strategy is to introduce the biological MLAs in the solar energy market first.
The final customers will be the end users of the solar panels. This can be both individuals and companies. In the Netherlands, 70% of the total solar panels are in possession of households, while 30% of the solar panels are used for commercial purposes. This results in almost 260.000 households that have solar panels. Together, all these solar panels have produced 1485 MW in 2015. This is less than 1% of the total power supply. The government aspires to increase this number to at least 5% in 2020. This means that the number of solar panels has to be increased enormously or the efficiency of the solar panels has to be improved (Wezel, 201"

Delivery
The next step was to evaluate whether E. coli is able to  survive in environments such as the rumen. Therefore, we tested growth of E. coli on rumen fluid, which was kindly provided by one of our cooperation partners. That way we were able to conclude whether rumen fluid is a sufficient medium for growth of E. coli or if it would inhibit its growth in any way.  The results (Figure 1 A-F) show that the microorganisms of the cow’s natural microbiota  were able to grow on every plate and that the degree to which the growth occurred increased with the rumen fluid content in the agar plate."

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Biosensors_-_-_TEXT.html,"One major reason microbial biosensors are currently limitedly used is not mentioned by Su et al., namely the fact that most current microbial biosensors require a microscopy set-up to be read out, due to the optical nature of their output. “For light and fluorescence assays you need lots of equipment and devious procedures,” Mr. Van Der Berg of BDS has explained to us . The equipment mentioned is very expensive: For instance, even the Zephyr DIY fluorescence microscope developed by iGEM team TU Delft 2013 costs around $1500, and this is already extremely cheap compared to commercially available machines. [6]
The need for bulky microscopy equipment and complicated procedures currently limits the use of whole cell biosensors to advanced laboratories with highly trained personnel. This greatly reduces the possibility for commercially viable applications. Whole cell biosensor-based consumer products are under the current circumstances impossible, but also business-to-business products would only be available for the small subset of companies which has (or can afford to pay for) a lab and technicians.
To higher the chances for commercial applications of microbial biosensors, outputs other than light-based outputs are needed. Several other output mechanisms are available. Bousse [2] mentions multiple methods to measure the energy metabolism of cells (including pH measurement and measurement of oxygen consumption). All these measurement require that the analyte has a distinct influence on the metabolism of the cell, for example due to toxicity or increased cell growth. This greatly limits the range of analytes which can be tested and also makes the construction of new sensors with synthetic biology techniques very difficult. Several other methods based on changing pH or redox potential have been described [7]. However, these methods are not widely used and much less popular than light-based outputs.
From these observations, it can be concluded that, in order to make a commercial application of a microbial biosensor possible, a novel output mechanism has to be developed. The novel output has to meet several requirements. Firstly, its output signal should be measurable with the use of equipment which is inexpensive, portable, and easy to handle by non-specialists. Secondly, the signal should be easily quantifiable: the relation between analyte concentration and output signal should be not too complicated. Thirdly, the output system should be modular. This means that different sensing elements (for example promoters) should be easy to connect to the output mechanism. Stated in a different way, the biosensor should have plug-and-play functionality.

Environmental Safety
No biological system is leaked into the environment and measures are taken to limit the spread of potentially harmful genes.
E. coli DH10B and SURE were used exclusively when building our constructs. The SURE Competent cells are classified to be a non-hazardous substance. All DH10B cells are classified F- and thus do not possess the Fertility factor. The risk of these cells acting as a donor in horizontal gene transfer via conjugation is greatly reduced.
The E. coli DH10B bacterial cell strain possesses an amino acid leucine metabolism deficiency that reduces its competitiveness in the wild. Such phenotypes reduce its survival opportunities beyond the lab.
Prior to disposal, harmful waste (toxic and/or biohazardous) was clearly separated and sterilized, either by application of bleach, or autoclaving.
University Safety
Hong Kong Laws & Guidelines
The Cartegena Protocol on Biosafety under the Convention on Biological Diversity (the Protocol) was extended to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in May 2011. Under the Chapter 607, the Genetically Modified Organisms (Control of Release) Ordinance (the Ordinance), release of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) knowingly without approval from the Deputy Director or an Assistant Director of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department is considered an offence. The full text of Cap. 607 can be downloaded by following this link.
No part of the project is directed for release into the environment. HKUST iGEM 2013 team experiments are concerned strictly with molecular cloning and testing of recombinant technology biomolecules. Application for approval to perform such a procedure under the Ordinance is therefore not required.
Laboratories in Hong Kong follow Guidelines on Biosafety in the Clinical Laboratory, a publication of the Centre of Health Protection under the Department of Health. The full text of the Guidelines can be accessed here . As our laboratory is operated by the university’s Division of Life Science, the activities performed within the lab adhere to the above Guidelines.
HKUST’s HSEO
The enforcement of safety regulations is handled by the university’s Health, Safety & Environment Office (HSEO). The HSEO also provide safety training for staff and students for safe laboratory.

Main discussion points were:
To find a solution for our problem with the expression of some laccases
To try to find mechanisms like kill-switches and intracellular regulations to improve the safety of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) and thus to promote the possibility of the use of GMOs in an open system (like in humans)
To look for similarities in modeling
To try to help each other with the wiki-design
Of course, we also used the evenings to get to know each other and to have some fun. The top-priority when getting in touch with german culture is tasting a small sip of beer and listening to David Hasselhoff .

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html,"ker – Risk assessor at Bureau GGO of the RIVM
Goal: Learn more about regulation involved in the application of GMOs in the environment.
Approach: We spoke to Eric van den Akker from Bureau GGO and who  is involved in the assessment of GMO usage. Thereby we asked him what procedures are applied in the judgment of GMO risks. Also we asked him about the possible problems we could encounter with our device and we asked for advice to overcome these problems.
Result: Dr. Van den Akker could tell us about the procedure of getting a license for GMO usage outside the laboratory. Therefore one needs to apply for a permit to introduce bacteria into the environment. COGEM will than evaluate the application and give permission or not. Important hereby is that we use E. coli K12, which is considered relatively safe.   Other instances involved are the CCMO and the EMA. The CCMO tests ethical aspects of medical innovations and EMA is involved in regulation involved in genetic modification.  Dr. Van den Akker advised us to give early notice of what our plans are to these committees. They can give further advise and can make it easier for the device to be accepted.   Further he could tell us that thanks to our project he met with Claudette de Vries, an expert about safety around medicinal products and medical devices of the RIVM, for the first time. They could easily see a collaboration grow from this meeting.
We visited Bureau GGO to talk through the GMO regulations
Drs. V. (Virgil) Rerimassie - Legal expert working for the Rathenau Institute and involved in research towards the ethical, social and juridical aspects of novel technologies
Goal: Give some direction to the policy and practices part of our project.
Approach: We met with Drs. Rerimassie who works at the Rathenau Institute. We presented him our ideas and he helped us explore the application options for our device and helped us in making a plan of approach to present our device to the public.
Results: Drs. Rerimassie motivated us to take a step backward from our project and look at our device as a source of opportunities. Thereby we should consider what societal problems we can solve using our device and what needs there are in society. He encouraged us to listen to the requests of society. Thereby he made the comment that we should also consider other solutions to these problems and we should consider if our product is really the best option.  Hereby he helped us to broaden our perspective, which helped us"

Presentation of various ideas
Deciding on the project topic sets the basis for the team’s motivation and success and enables planning for the next months. Knowing about the importance of this decision it was indispensable to discuss the goals, concepts and realizability with experts, first of all with our principal investigator, Prof. Matias Zurbriggen, head of the institute for synthetic biology in Duesseldorf. Additionally we invited more Professors interested in iGEM to get as many expert opinions and feedback as possible from different points of view. We were more than happy to have Prof. Andreas Weber, head of the Institute for plant biochemistry in Duesseldorf, Jun-Prof. Ilka Maria Axmann, head of the Institute for Synthetic Microbiology and Prof. Michael Feldbrügge, head of the Institute for Microbiology providing us with their opinion. Also Danny Ducat, Assistant Professor at the Department of Microbiology and Biochemistry at the Michigan State University joined.
Before meeting with the professors we focused on three final projects and prepared presentations containing the lab design and possible subprojects as well as the motivation and story behind each topic. After providing an overview we had lively discussions with the professors. They did not only give valuable feedback but also asked critical questions, thereby helping us to look at aspects we did not think of before. Furthermore, Nicolas Krink (Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg) helped us to reflect the topics from the point of view as a judge, as he was one at the iGEM-competition in 2016.
We were very thankful to get the opportunity to present the projects. The expertise of all the people who were present helped us to revise the concepts and finally decide on the this year’s project a short time after.
Teambuilding and Project Selection
Shortly after our cooperation team came together for the first time in February, the idea of an external working weekend was born. We wanted to intensively work on our topic selection and our Cologne-Duesseldorf collaboration mission. Another important aspect was to get to know the people we were going to work together with for nearly one year. After a few weeks of paper"

Wiki
We've put a lot of work into our wiki this year. The most important part of course is the content. We used Google Docs to write and work as a team - resolving a total over 600 comments. Adam, our student leader who did the bulk of wiki editing made over 1300 edits - and as a result has gone slightly insane.
Several wikis we looked at were inaccessibly written - often lacking good explanations and having little page structure. This is likely down to the last minute rush before the deadline. We started early and spent a long time perfecting our text, so hopefully you find it all makes sense.
Another problem is that previous wikis are slow to load. They often have large swathes of redudant code and uncompressed images are commonly uploaded at much higher resolutions than needed. We saw some homepages well over 10MB! Our homepage is just 0.7MB, and all our other pages are similarly optimized. We've done this by analysing our site with Google's Pagespeed and Lighthouse auditing tools to find where we could improve. We correctly sized and compressed images, reused files so they can be cached and used SVGs where possible for diagrams.
As SVGs can be embedded more easily into the page, page load times are improved as the browser doesn't have to fetch the images seperately. SVGs also allow for infinite scalability allowing our wiki to take advantage of high resolution screens like Apple's 'Retina Displays'. They're also powerful as they allow text to actually be text rather than pixels - allowing screenreaders to read diagrams, improving the accessibility of our wiki. The worst cases we’ve seen are are wikis that are just huge PNGs - they take forever to load, don’t allow you to select text, are inaccessible to the visually-impaired and lack links and citations embedded in the text.

IIT_Delhi,2016,Team:IIT Delhi#Oscillator_-_-_TEXT.html," known to show oscillatory  behavior [8]:
Goodwin Oscillator
Repressilator
Amplified negative feedback oscillator
Fussenegger Oscillator
We’ll give a very brief overview of the Goodwin and the Amplified negative feed- back oscillators . The Danino Oscillator is essentially a quorum sensing version of the Amplified negative feedback oscillator.
Goodwin Oscillator - This was the first synthetic genetic oscillator to be  studied. It consists of a single gene with negative autoregulation. Models  suggest that oscillations occur in the goodwin oscillator if repression is mod- elled by a nonlinear Hill function with a high cooperativity coefficient [3].  Further, this oscillator has been shown to have a robust time period.
Amplified negative feedback oscillator Leaving aside the biological im- plementation, this abstract topology is the one used in the Danino Oscillator.Under this architecture, the activator gene A activates it’s own repressor gene  B. In the Daanino oscillator there is a latent phase when both the activator  and repressor accumulate, thus allowing large amplitudes to be achived for  this configuration.The qualitative behavior of this oscillator is discussed in  the modelling section using the mathematical model suggested in [4]. One  crucial benefit that the Danino oscillator has over this topology is the prop- erty of quorum sensing; the AHL molecule can diffuse across the cell mem- brane and be exchange with neighbouring cells. This offers a mechanism to  synchronize the oscillators.
Project
The main focus of team iGem IIT Delhi has been ’reconfigurability’. Keeping this  in mind, we have divided the project into two modules; each centred around the  idea of reconfigurability. Module I is a tunable oscillator where we can change the  frequency of oscillation. Our proposed design focuses on using an optogentic mod- ule to achieve control over frequency. While Module I would switch the frequency  of oscillation between two non-zero values, Module II implements a toggle switch  over an oscillator. Thus, the idea is to be able to kill the oscillations in a manner  that the concentration of one of the components stays at a low value, while that  for another component stably stays high.
Module I - HOTFM
We call this module ’Highly Optimized tunable Frequency Modulator (HOTFM)’.  The idea is to modify the Danino Oscillator so that we can tune the frequency of os- cillations. Further, we wish to use optogen"

ITESM-Guadalajara,2014,Team:ITESM-Guadalajara#Market_-_-_TEXT.html,"itosan. The smallest order was posted by a Mexican student and the biggest one was posted by the general director of a water treatment plant. This proportion is similar to the US medium-low and high purity market, which is 75% and 17% respectively (Quiminet.com, 2014).
Taking into account that Mexico’s Chitosan consumption is near 106 tons per year, the medium low category consumption is 27.56 tons (27,560 kg) per year, and the high purity market is 6.36 tons (6,360 kg) per year (Quiminet.com, 2014).
http://www.quiminet.com/centro-negocios/se-requiere/8030847700117.htm
Medium and low purity Chitosan (75-85% deacetylated/Medium molecular weight)
Our process is designed to produce 50 kg per month, making a total of 600 kg per year of medium purity Chitosan during the first phase. That means we would be entering the market with 2.17% of market share, serving as supplier of medium purity Chitosan for the water treatment industry, dietary supplements industry, cosmetics industry, the agrochemicals industry, pulp and paper industry, textile industry and photography products. Our process will consume the waste of the shrimp industry and the dairy industry (Zhao, Park, & Muzzarelli, 2010).
Market structure in Mexico and rivalry among competitors is defined by the following forces (see figure 21):
High threat of new entrants: medium and low purity Chitosan has several suppliers in Mexico and Latin America. The characteristics of this Chitosan are not hard to attain (unlike high purity chitosan) through chemical processes. Moreover, it is being used right now with commercial purposes and not only for research purposes, which means the market is much more mature than high purity Chitosan.
Low bargaining power of buyers: although it is much more available than high purity Chitosan, distribution channels are blurry. Non-corporate customers looking for Chitosan have to rely on suppliers on the Internet and have their shipments customized from other countries. Moreover, Chitosan is much more commercialized as dietary supplements and it’s generally mixed with other substances when sold. Corporate customers have less troubles restocking Chitosan but generally require big amounts of the product, from 500 to 1000 kg.
Medium threat of substitute products or services: some Chitosan applications can be substituted with other medical excipients, other pesticides, chemical flocculants"
Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Public relations_-_-_TEXT.html," biology, its researches are always raising public concerns respectivly are always in the focus of a public opinion. Therefore we got in contact with a local high school, in order to get an impression of the public awareness concerning synthetic biology. Hence we discussed with pupils about pros and cons of Synthetic Biology, iGEM and our projects as examples for applications. About 80 seniors from different biology and chemistry A-level courses came to the school's assembly hall and listened to our presentation, followed by questions. Afterwards the students were split into smaller groups of ten to twenty people and got accompanied by members of the Bielefeld iGEM team to discuss about iGEM and SB.
Jonas talking
In Germany the topic of SB has generally not reached the education in high schools yet. Lab courses with genetically modified organisms (GMO) are not possible due to the lack of accredited laboratories and equipment. Federal laws do not allow to work with GMOs outside a security level 1 laboratory. For those reasons, the subject matter of SB is an interesting and new field for most pupils. Our goals were to awake the public opinion, prevent fear, start public discussions and participate in the outreach about iGEM. We think that theses aspects are important topics when talking to pupils, because this is the next unbiased generation having to face prejudices and misunterstandings about SB. Further this is the generation Bill Gates ment when telling Wired that if he were a teenager today, he would be hacking biology ( WIRED ).
Robert talking
We began with presenting the general principles of SB by talking about combining engineering and biology, standardized parts and the construction of new systems with novel functionalities. Further we talked about iGEM in general, the Partsregistry, our team and some example projects to show what is possible when working with BioBricks. We aimed at simplyfying the whole topic to an understandable level, by comparing our bacteria with smartphones, BioBricks with apps and the Partsregistry with an appstore. To show the students what is special about iGEM apart from the scientific point of view, we presented what needs to be done during an iGEM project from beginning to end, how interdisciplinary and fun it is. We wanted to raise the attention to the fields of SB and iGEM. In the end we gave some short information about our university and the subjects we are studying.
To give the opportunity to ask questions or discuss ethical concerns with us we splitted the audience into smaller groups. Apart from questions about our study courses, how we manage our studies together with iGEM and the job opportunities after graduating, questions concerning SB"

Additional Characterisation of E.chromi Biobricks
E.chromi Orange
Our Lacto-Report construct design included an E.chromi Biobrick, as designed by Cambridge's 2009 iGEM team. The Biobrick that we initially selected was Orange E.chromi (BBa_k274200).
However, after a number of attempts to assemble this part into our machine using the Standard Assembly method with no success, we decided to determine if all the correct Biobrick restriction sites were present. We also suspected that perhaps one of the sites had been methylated, so we transformed the initial Biobrick plasmid received from the DNA distribution into a methylase negative strain of E.coli (Sure cells). We then prepared plasmid from one of the colonies and performed a series of digests on the plasmid.
Figure 1. E.chromi Orange digested with various restriction enzymes to confirm the presence of the Biobrick restriction sites.
In Figure 1, the plasmid sample digested with Spe1 (Fermentas) resembles the undigested control. The plasmid sample double-digested with EcoR1 and Spe1 (Fermentas) is linearised by cutting with EcoR1 but there are no distinct insert and plasmid bands, which is the banding pattern we expect to see after digesting with these two enzymes. The expected pattern is clearly visible in the mCherry control which was also digested with EcoR1 and Spe1 (Fermentas).
Thus, we concluded that the Spe1 restriction site was absent in the Orange E.chromi Biobrick.
E.chromi Dark Green
We then decided to try and use the Dark Green E.chromi biobrick (BBa_K274003). Once again, although the part was excised using EcoR1 and Spe1 (Fermentas), when we attempted to clone anything in front of this part, by digestion with EcoR1 and Xba1 (Fermentas), we could"

At last, for the upper level, the potential topologies are selected also with genetic algorithm. And the fitness functions are the similarity between the dynamic behaviors and the target, which are measured by the standard error.
Optimization Processes of GA
Step1: Randomly generate a population of topologies.
Step2: For each topology, generate a population of networks with a serial of random interaction forms.
Step3: For each network, obtain the fitness score by optimize the parameters.
Step4: Obtain the fitness score of a topology by searching the most favorable network.
Step5: Evolutes the topologies with each fitness score.
Parameter For GA
Population: the number of members in one generation
Mutation ratio: the ratio of each gene alter its status in a generation
Recombine ratio: the ratio that whether a gene change with its allel in mating
Max_cycle: the maximum number of generations considered for the evolution
Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO)
Introduction to PSO
What's PSO
Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) is an optimization algorithm based on swarm intelligence theory. Motivated by the evolution of nature, a series of evolutionary computation techniques, such as evolutionary programming, genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, are proposed, in which a best solution is evolved through the generations. In contrast to evolutionary computation techniques, Eberhart and Kennedy developed a different algorithm through simulating social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. In a particle swarm optimizer, instead of using genetic operators, individual swarms are evolved through cooperation and competition. Each particle adjusts its flying according to its own flying experience and its companions' flying experience. The position of each particle represents a potential solution to a problem.
The following is excerpt from"" http://www.swarmintelligence.org/ "", it shows clearly how PSO works: ""Each particle keeps track of its coordinates in the problem space which are associated with the best solution (fitness) it has achieved so far. (The fitness value is also stored.) This value is called pbest. Another ""best"" value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best value, obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle. This location is called lbest. when a particle takes all the population as its topological neighbors, the best value is a global best and is called gbest.
The particle swarm optimization concept consists of, at each time step, changing the velocity of (accelerating) each particle toward its pbest and lbest locations (local version of PSO). Acceleration"

Gene Deletion
We first attempted the no-SCAR (Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering) method to remove ldhA (lactate dehydrogenase-A)  from the E. coli Nissle  genome.   No-SCAR is different from the traditional CRISPR system used in eukaryotes because it uses CRISPR to counterselect against the wild type DNA, theoretically leaving only mutant colonies on the plate. Cells are transformed with two plasmids carrying Cas9 and the guide RNA. Cells are then transformed again with DNA oligonucleotides that confer a mutation to the target site of the guide-RNA. Colonies are incubated on antibiotic plates and mutant bacteria survive while wild-type are killed off by the CRISPR-Cas9 complex. E. coli naturally lack an efficient double-strand-break-repair system and CRISPR-Cas9 engineering can kill off wild-type cells after genetic targeting by the specific guide-RNA. This method takes advantage of the lack of repair and targets colonies that have failed to mutate (i.e. no gene deletion) and induces cell death.
no-SCAR
Diagram adapted from Reish 2015
However no-SCAR proved very difficult to manage in our specific E. coli Nissle chassis. Over one hundred bacterial colonies were screened for the deletion before we moved on to a different approach. This approach was not sustainable to rid one gene let alone the five carbon-draining genes in the short time we had left so we moved on.
Three groups: Control (C) Deletion (D) Mutation (M)The Control group was transformed with an oligonucleotide homologous to a region of the genome outside of the guide RNA’s recognition (rpoB). The Deletion group was transformed with an oligo that caused a deletion of the entire ldhA gene.  The Mutation group was transformed with an oligo that caused a stop mutation in the ldhA gene.  Cas9 was induced via addition of anhydrous t"

SUIS_Shanghai,2018,Team:SUIS Shanghai#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"uldell we began to develop our survey. The first draft of the survey was completed and tested on 10 members of our own school faculty. Very useful feedback was provided, which allowed us to add some questions, and switch from a 4 answer likert scale to a 5 point scale which included a “neutral” view. We also updated our “part 1” of the survey, which profiles the respondent, by adding questions relating to their number of years of teaching experience, and their highest academic award in both biological sciences and education fields. We felt we can see if there may be some relationships between these factors and approach to biodesign & engineering in addition to the type of curriculum taught. Other studies have found that differences in perceptions of, and familiarity with, teaching design, engineering and technology “based on gender, grade level taught, and years of teaching experience” do exist for teachers (Yasar et al., 2006). Part 2 of the survey focused mostly on elucidating these attitudes and feelings among the respondents with respects to the use of engineering and design and its place in biology classrooms. Part 3 of the survey was used to probe for the aforementioned possible barriers affecting teachers implementation of engineering concepts. These questions were designed with inspiration from a previous study into use of inquiry based learning in science classes. Here it was found that “class size, accountability, curricular demands, and administrative support are perceived as constraints that impede the use of inquiry” (DiBaise & McDonald, 2015).
Our survey was finally completed in early May and was shared with life science educators from around the world, through the help of our school community, via both social media groups and official online communities for Advanced Placement (AP), Next generation science standards (NGSS), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Education (CIE) schools. Responses were collected until mid September.
Main findings & Data summary
We received 115 respondents with a completion rate of 80%. Overall the survey took on average 7 minutes to complete. All complete raw data can be downloaded in attachment 1.
One of the most striking findings from the survey is the high frequency of respondents (n = 114) that indicated that they are either “wholly unfamiliar with the topic of synthetic biology” (27%) or who “lack understanding of the topic” (47%) indicating a potential avenue for iGEM to focus on for the advancement of synthetic biology education.
Taking our sample as representative of the whole teaching community (regardless of curriculum, years of experience or academic background), it is clear that engineering and"
Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#Cellulose_-_-_TEXT.html," component of the plant cell walls and has been used in various textile applications such as paper production [2]. Cellulose is also produced by a Gram-negative bacterium, Gluconacetobacter hansenii, which secretes highly-crystalline cellulose [3]. Because of the few requirements needed to produce bacterial cellulose, G. hansenii is seen as a model organism for the study of cellulose synthesis in plants [3]. We grew a large culture of G. hansenii in growth medium to produce large batch of bacterial cellulose. After retrieving the cellulose from the medium, we used a paper-making protocol to turn them into cellulose sheets (see protocol below). The cellulose would be an important substrate for our biOrigami when combined with the spores to make bioHYDRAS link here . We can use CBDs to attach the spores to the cellulose sheet. This can be accomplished by using a DNA linker connecting the CBD sequence to a protein expressed on the spore coat, Cotz. Since Cotz localizes to the spore coat, the hybrid Cotz-CBD will allow the spores to attach to the sheet. Furthermore, we can expand on the unique properties of this CBD to allow attachment of any protein onto a cellulose surface. We call our CBD system uCBD to note its universal protein attachment abilities.
The system is inspired by the 2014 Stanford-Brown-Spelman iGEM team ; however, it has several improvements. We used the cellulosomal-scaffolding protein A (cipA) of Clostridium thermocellum as our CBD. We chose cipA because of its high cellulose binding affinity (tested by the Imperial 2014 IGEM team); furthermore, we improved on the Imperial cipA by removing the illegal EcoRI site within the gene. CipA is attached to a monomeric streptavidin instead of the wild-type tetramer streptavidin to prevent the chance of protein aggregation, which can inhibit protein function [4]. We thus, sacrifice a small decrease in binding affinity from the monomeric streptavidin for an increase in functional activity of the overall hybrid protein. Together, the monomeric streptavidin and cipa (mSA-cipA) gene made up the cellulose attachment part of our uCBD sytem (Part I). The second part of the system involves molecular cloning any protein of interest onto the bifunctional ligase/repressor (birA) protein attached to an acceptor peptide. BirA is found in E"

The configuration of the chromoproteins we tested against heat today. CP and PP are DNA 2.0 chromoproteins and the rest are iGEM chromoproteins
●
We took a video over time of the chromoproteins reacting to heat and this time our set up included a thermometer that is in the heat bath to monitor the temperature throughout to make sure the heat bath was the same as the thermometer gun was telling us
●
The chromoproteins are being put directly into a constant heat (74-75 °C) instead of being heated over time to see their reaction. This test is being performed so we can see how fast the chromoproteins react and change color at a constant temperature. At the 4.5 minute mark the temperature peaked at 76 °C and held steady after that. The color also held steady at the constant temperature and dried out over time. The time lapse video and full length video are in the google drive
●
We then rehydrated these chromoproteins and retested them while heating over time to see if there was noticeable color change. The initial temperature of the water bath was 55 °C

This test showed a change/ loss of color over time but also it revealed that we need to find a better way to plate the chromoproteins on the glass so they are evenly spread and have an even thickness so the color loss is consistent
●
The chromoproteins are still in liquid form at time 0 so they may not react to the change in temperature right away

Interviews
Dr. Athanasios Zovoilis, University of Lethbridge
Test Arc-Gag in cell culture on primary mouse neural cell lines
We spoke with Dr. Athanasios Zovoilis, a faculty member at the University of Lethbridge’s department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Dr. Zovoilis has vast experience in cell transfection. He explained to us some of the challenges associated with cell transfections in eukaryotic cell lines as well as how cell transfections vary significantly between cell lines. Some of the cell transfection techniques that he mentioned were lipofection: using lipid membranes with an epitope tag for delivery, electroporation: electrically inducing pores in the cell membranes of cells for ready uptake, the use of transfecting agents (which vary in composition), and even some encapsulating proteins such as Qiagen’s dendrimer based SuperFect Transfection Reagent. The typical challenges associated with these techniques are that they can cause stress for the cells, leading to cell death, or unintended gene expression. Primary neural cell lines from mice however, face difficulty in their transfection affinity as well as consistency in their transfection rates. Using a protein nanocompartment such as Arc-Gag could be a good step in making such improvements since it has a natural tropism for mouse neural cells. Testing a fluorescence transfection of a primary mouse neural cell line would help to show if Arc-Gag could be used as a transfecting agent in mouse cell culture.
Dr. Justin Pahara, Amino Bio Labs
Increase specificity and accessibility of nanocompartments
We spoke with Dr. Justin Pahara, the CSO for Amino Labs to discuss the utility of our project for researchers and industrial applications. He said that protein nanocompartments would be a useful delivery system that can be tuned to deliver a variety of cargos with increased specificity depending on their chemical structure and functionalization. One possible application could be in increasing transformation efficiency during transfections of various cell types. Further, compartmentalization at the molecular scale using phages is often difficult and intimidating from a biosafety perspective.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#21 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,"ick in pSB1A2 plasmid with restriction enzymes EcoRI + PstI added.
The samples of BBa_J33206 BioBrick in pSB1A2 plasmid with no enzymes added show consistency as do the samples of BBa_J33206 BioBrick in pSB1A2 plasmid with restriction enzymes EcoRI + PstI added. However the band sizes for the digested BioBrick samples don't appear to match the expected bands; the BioBrick insert, according to the parts registry entry , should be 956 bp and exist as one band whereas the gel suggests it could be between 125bp and 2027bp and could be any of the two bands present. No matter which band you look at, the insert on the gel doesn't match the expected BioBrick size.
Nevertheless, due to the consistency of the bands it is likely that there is no contamination in the samples. These samples can therefore be used for midi-preps and then analysed using better restriction enzymes.
The probable reason for the bands looking incorrect is the restriction enzymes used. In a previous experiment we had aliquoted some EcoRI and PstI enzymes into separate Eppendorf tubes; for this experiment we used these aliquoted enzymes rather than enzymes taken from the original container. The aliquoting and subsequent exposure to room temperature may have lead to the degradation of enzyme efficiency.
