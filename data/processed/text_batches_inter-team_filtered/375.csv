Analysis of triclosan bound to NADH in the active site revealed that the phenyl ring of triclosan lined up face to face with the ring of NADH forming a pi-stacking interaction. We hypothesized that if we could increase the pi-stacking interaction by mutating residues around the triclosan-NADH site to be aromatic residues, we might be able to increase the enzyme’s activity on trans-2-pentenal.
Each mutant was generated using kunkel mutagenesis through the transcriptic cloud laboratory . The sequence verified mutant genes were cloned into our expression strain of E. coli and protein produced and purified as described in our Notebook [LINK]. From this initial round of 28 mutants, 23 expressed as soluble protein. Of the solubly expressed designs 4 of the designs had no effect on function, and 19 decreased activity.   However, one of the enzymes resulted in 1.5x increase in activity against the non-natural trans-2-pentenal substrate.
We are currently exploring new mutants based on the data generated from this first round of screens. While the enzyme activity needs to be improved ~100-fold in order to achieve levels of activity observed on the native substrate, this is well within reach of enzyme engineering efforts based on previous successes [30][31][32] Sources:

In the lab we used an EPOCH spectrophotometer to run our assays. At a price tag of ~$10,000 this device is definitely out of the budget range of a high school teacher, so we looked for a more appropriately priced alternative.
We found a colorimeter device from IO Rodeo, a company that develops open source hardware and software for educational purposes. They sold a spectrophotometer which we hypothesized would work for our assay for $80. One reason for the price difference is the EPOCH is a monochronometer covers a spectrum from 200 nm - 999 nm, selectable in 1 nm increments.  The IO Rodeo is based on an 365nm LED and requires hardware changes to adjust the wavelength of emission and detection.  Our enzyme assay is based on oxidation of the enzyme cofactor NADH into NAD.  The standard wavelength for detection of this reaction is 340nm, however the NADH has a broad spectrum (see figure below).  Based on the differences in NAD and NADH spectral signals we hypothesized that the 365nm"

Prokaryotic cells
In prokaryotic cells, the system consists of three circuits. One induces flip, one flips and the other expresses. According to the properties of the promoter pBAD, we build the first circuit, using arabinose as an inducement to generate the recombinase Cre. readmore
Eukaryotic cells
Life process in eukaryotic cells is much more complicate, especially when it is related to signal transportation. We choose microRNA to transport cues and Bxb1 to realize the flipping process. Using microRNA can not only simplify the design of the system, making sure the transportation is precise and efficient, but also ensure the independency with other life processes due to the orthogonality of the microRNA and other signals. readmore
Optimization
The efficiency of cre-loxp system is extremely vital to our design; it may fluctuate a lot in that the DNA are reversible.
Based on our model, we designed some experiments to test the inversion efficiency. We used the flow cytometer to analyz our results. readmore

Last but not least, we thank all members from the Stülke lab for their support and endorsement during the time we used the lab and blocked technical devices with our experiments.
Miscellaneous
Biozym is acknowledged for providing us with > 100 ball pens, 50 writing pads, 50 carrying bags (that are quite useful to transport used coffee cups from the lab to the Nordmensa (students restaurant selling delicious food)) and 100 gummy bear bags (old!).
Work from team roster
We did all of the lab work by ourselfs as described in the notebook section. The experiments were developed in teamwork with our supervisors. The over all design was drafted by ourselves. Moreover, the wiki site and website were constructed on our own.
Supervisors
The whole project was stimulated by the ideas from PD Dr."
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help"

This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

In assistap4nce of these social interactions, lots of progresses and breakthroughs occurred, including the ultimate application of biofilm, a self-assemble, high-resistant, adhesive bio-material, which realize the relative high conductivity as well as the regenerative ability of the system.
Then, soon after we finished the first version of the project, “Solar Hunter I”, we proposed and conducted a public questionnaire, where we further learnt about the public attitude towards the energy issue as well as our project. A serious of general and detailed topics was investigated. From the analysis of the questionnaire, we learnt the biggest two public concerns of the wide application of hydrogen, that was safety and expense. Also, further communications with the industrial community, the academic experts, and the responsible authority were suggested as well.
In response to the subsequent need for further field investigation from various angles, our team then carried out a series of interviews with people working with the energy issue but from different points of view. Not only did we continue to be connected with more and more field experts academically, but also we spared plenty of time and efforts to be in touch with people in the industrial community as well as the government. Through the talks and discussions, we further developed the understanding on the mainstream opinions with regards of the safety concern for hydrogen application both academically and industrially. As those field experts replied, benefiting from some of the characteristics hydrogen possessed, including low density nontoxicity, and zero pollutant emission, hydrogen demonstrated terrific potential as an ideal energy source. Also, with those mature techniques in hydrogen transport and storage, the safety concern is not necessary. However, in terms of the industrial application, most of them laid strong emphasis on the applicability, efficiency, expense and the sustainability about our platform. Reminded by these conversations, our team further considered our system in the context of real industrial use. After a series of brainstorming, we planned to try another co-culture approach where the anaerobic condition was not necessary, instead of the original strategy that extracted the target protein directly. With this improvement, our platform was able to operate under normal aerobic environment, where the manufacture would be much easier and also obviously cost less. Moreover, attracted by our passion as well as the feasible idea, future collaboration with these industrial companies and the local authority would be very likely to be put into real actions later on.
Later on, when we demonstrated the project to some of these field experts again, they were pretty impressed by our soon improvements. As they commented, our new system demonstrated huge potential in massive industrial application. For the"

Introduction
It was important to us that our design was as simple and elegant as possible. To effectively diagnose Chagas disease, we needed a system that could be performed in a field setting. This eventually pushed us in the direction of a cell-free system, inspired partly by the work of Keith Pardee in diagnosing the Zika virus cell-free.
Synthetic biology presents many possible paths, and we chose to investigate two of them: one DNA-based, one protein-based. The DNA-based system uses the TetR repressor; the protein-based system uses OmpA and SpyTag/SpyCatcher to tether proteins to the outer membrane.
Background
There are many issues associated with developing a diagnostic for a neglected tropical disease. The method has to be (1) effective, (2) affordable, and (3) viable to perform and store within existing infrastructure. Additionally it needs to be accepted by the local community as a reliable and safe method for them to use. Currently, diagnostics for congenital Chagas disease do not sufficiently meet these requirements. For more information visit our Chagas disease page .
Synthetic biology is a currently underutilised as an option for diagnostics. Many tests use enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISAs), which are expensive and difficult to conduct in the field. They also rely on having common molecular epitopes, which may not be present for some diseases. Synthetic biology allows us to detect the function of biomolecules, rather than the structure which is detected by antibodies, making it more consistent and harder to evolve against. It can also give scope for smaller, faster, and cheaper detection. We conducted a survey of the general public and found that a majority were in favour of the development of a diagnostic using synthetic biology.

InterLab
The most direct aim of the entire InterLab is to standardize the fluorescence measurements. And the topic of standardization varies every year to be more specific and comprehensive.
Standardization
Standardization plays an extremely important role in science experiments. There are multiple kinds of methods which will keep the lab results accurate.
1. Every protocol is read and followed carefully by group members and checked by each member.
2. Any indices should be the same unit and same figure.
3. Any experiment is better to hold two control groups (one is 100% source, the other is 100% solution).
4. An ideal standardization experiment needs more than 3 repeating experiments.
Standardization is the process of developing and implementing technical standards. It can help to maximize compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability, or quality as well.
Goals
As a whole, the InterLab is trying to minimize variability across labs. Trying to further contribute amenity to the synthetic biological study, instead of measuring one fluorescent molecule, this year the IGEM teams are standardizing the optical measurement of the entire population of GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) cells. Because ordinarily means to measure populated cells in optical devices have complicated process and uncertain results, this year, we are using massive data to verify if there is a method that can simplify the process and increase comparability.
The method that is been proving by teams is the one that if we can reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD.

Dry Lab
Some wiki layout ideas were drawn up by Winonah.
Our promotional sponsorship brochure was drafted and so was a powerpoint presentation, which was far less professional and more suited to a personal viewing.
A logo competition was started (set up by Ari) to choose which logo would best represent our team.
The designs are still being created to be voted on at a later date.
Wiki team profiles were drafted and needed to become more succinct as they seemed bulky on the wiki.
Project title ideas were considered.
Our abstract needed changing to include some dry lab activities.
GoGreen collaboration was introduced as a possible collaboration.
Wet Lab
Sequencing results came back and unfortunately our Fer/Hyd plasmid was lacking hyd 1.
This was unexpected.
We miniprep extracted Fer/Hyd plasmid from the three new colonies which grew from Rob’s cells, as well as the one colony we achieved from previous cells spun down.

However, one can learn a few lessons. The control voltage is too high, I have too much noise from the LEDs, which reduces the sensitivity. Also, I have nothing linear, it is much more like a logarithmic function, whereas the voltage is given by:
V=kRDRλP0C with:   k a coefficient to be experimentally determined in L/(mol.cm)
RD the trans-impedance stage resistance in Ω
Rλ the responsivity at λ=610 nm in A/W
P0 the optical power from the LEDs received by the sample in W
C the concentration of bacteria in the sample in mol/L
Besides the 1st experiment, I always have the same order of magnitude (105), and this result is quite near to the one obtained by Munich 2017.
To get back to the LEDs, I need to change them. Their emission spectrum overflow too much on the fluorescence spectrum. With yellowish-green LEDs, I hope to have a lower voltage control, and therefore a better sensitivity.
Something to be mentioned: the voltage measured with the Arduino is varying a lot, but the mean value is quite good (difference of 5mV with the voltmeter on 10000+ values) and the standard deviation is very low.
In case it doesn’t work, I’ll have to change the photodiode for a CMOS sensor, as the fluorescence can be easily seen.
Pipetting module & global structure (Jean)
June
06/18/2018
Today I worked on the pipette module, more precisely on the control of the pipette with the Arduino controller.
First I soldered with Thomas all the buttons (Select, Up, Down…) and made the electronic circuit to control them.
Then I started to write a program to test how to aspire different volumes and different speeds. I realized that the pipette doesn’t really reset so when one restart it, the values of the volume and the speed in/out are still the same as before. That’s a problem because without input from the user, it seems impossible to fix the pipette at a defined volume since we don’t know the value we start from. Moreover, we can’t even try to go at the maximum or minimum value to have a known start point because the pipette does a loop : When it reaches 10μL, if we increase again the next value is 0.20 μL.

As you can see, the bands in most of the colony lanes match the positive control of Pqrr4+B0034, which means that the cells contain those pieces, not the one of interest. It seems that only the colony 9 is between 1000bp and 1500bp, which is what was expected. However, even this band is suspicious. The size of the circuit is about 1043bp, and with about 125bp addition due to Biobrick CP reverse primer annealing outside of the circuit; however, the band on colony 9 lane is at about 1250bp. Another problem can be noticed in the negative control lane, which is another contamination. It is very disappointing to see a whole day of work gone to waste :(! Yet, it is too early to give up hope. I can try to isolate the plasmid of the Colony 9 and perform a Restriction digest on it to see if I still do not see the expected band, which is at this point unlikely.

I spent most of today being very productive with the Biobricker portion of the Biobrick Simulator. This is a little user interface upgrade that will permit you to build any biobrick device you please, from a small library of parts implemented in Second Life. In SL terms, the UI is an object owned by the user's avatar, that can be attached to your display. The simulator's UI will have quite a few features to make your digital bioengineering easier, of which the Biobricker is an important one.
I finished working on all of the controls for the biobricker, including some scroll buttons for the parts in the device under construction, and the ability to add parts from the UI's inventory, and delete them too.

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," final verdict by Wednesday regarding which ones are good or bad.
Glycerol stockmaking
We got the sequencing results back from last Friday, and took the following colonies to make into glycerol stock solutions: 77.1, 79.2, 80.1, 81.1 (x2 for both FH bottom and Myc 198), 82.1, 83.4, 84.1, Zif268.  These colonies are a subset of the ""good"" colonies from our sequencing results from Sunday.  We mixed 120 ul of bacteria in mid-log with 300 ul of 80% glycerol to make the final solution, which was stored at -80 degrees C.
Restriction enzyme test
We tested both XbaI and BsaI on the junction PCR product using colony 79.4 as a template (which was used because it was a ""bad"" sequence overall but had intact BsaI and XbaI cut sites).  The junction PCR product is 1326 bp, and we expected to see bands of 593 and 739 bp with XbaI, and 717 and 578 bp with BsaI.  Our restriction digest recipe consisted of the following per reaction:
1 ul 10X buffer (NE biolabs buffer 4)
7.9 ul H2O
1 ul DNA (~100 ng)
1 ul enzyme (~2 units)
1 ul BSA (100x)
The two gels we ran for this digest showed that XbaI did NOT work, which may be due to XbaI being too old.  However, we did get double bands both times for BsaI.  Our egel was strange because of uneven loading, and so we were unable to determine the true size of both bands, but the agarose gel we ran later showed the two bands in the right positions.  The two gels can be seen below:
E-gel of our first digestion. The gel looks unusual (notice the bubble-like formation), so we performed a second digestion.
1% agarose gel of our second digestion. Although the bands are faint, we can see the appropriately sized bands for Bsa1.

Introduction
New Strategy
First Steps
Introducton
The synthetic biology community in Lithuania is just starting to grow and we are concerned about society’s attitude towards it. Therefore, we seek to foster scientific culture and enlighten society about the benefits that new technologies can bring. We are passionate about establishing a dialogue between scientific community and general public, which in our belief is one of the factors for scientific progress.
In 2016 Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team have set up an association “Synthetic Biology Organization” (“Sintetinės biologijos organizacija”) - SinBio - to spread knowledge about synthetic biology and educate society about its benefits. SinBio is a non-profit organization having its own governmental bodies - the board and the president (currently our team leader Laurynas Karpus) - and uniting students that are eager to contribute to the development of synthetic biology in Lithuania. For some time, the SinBio activity was slowing down but this year we have decided to revamp it in order to accelerate the growth of the synthetic biology community here in Lithuania.
Below is the new synthetic biology logo we have created this year as a symbol of the revamped organization strategy:
We believe that a public without general knowledge in synthetic biology will not be able to make informed decisions or effectively contribute to political and ethical debates in areas such as GMO or other synthetic biology topics. That said, we believe that SinBio can be one of the factors helping to drive the knowledge and engage people. However, up until now SinBio hasn’t had a clear vision on how to fulfill this task, so this year we developed a 5 year strategy with which we have set ourselves long and short term goals.
The new strategy of Synthetic Biology Organisation
After discussing our ambitions and what we would like to achieve as an organisation, we clarified SinBio vision:
A society that is enthusiastic about synthetic biology, is confident"

Pretreatments
Current pretreatments in biodigestion range from thermal to chemical to mechanical (Montgomery et al, 2014). Mechanical pretreatment involves the physical cutting up of plant matter to increase surface area and is often coupled with thermal treatment. Thermal treatment, which takes the form of either thermal hydrolysis, extrusion, or steam explosion, uses a combination of heat and pressure to wash the plant matter with water nearing 200°C. This causes the lignin, a hydrophobic molecule, to globuralize into spheres, a means of decreasing its surface area to volume ratio. Chemical pretreatment, which is not used at industrial scales, uses a mix of acid and base at different temperatures to make the lignin layer more susceptible to the biodigesting microorganisms. A biological alternative for pretreatment that would eliminate the large energy input required for thermal pretreatment would greatly benefit the efficiency of biodigestion. However, no effective, scalable solution has been developed to date.
When the lignin polymer is broken down by various natural enzymes, the byproducts include phenolic compounds such as phenol, guaiacol, and syringol (Kleinert and Barth, 2008). It has been shown that these lignin-derived phenols inhibit the activity of cellulases and glucosidases (Ximenes et al, 2010). The extent to which these phenols non-productively bind to the lignin has been further studied and found to be directly proportional to the quantity of residual lignin present after pretreatment (Gao et al, 2014). A different study showed the lignin’s role in blocking the surface of cellulose was the major factor in inhibiting enzymatic activity (Li et al, 2013). Although which plays a larger role is still in debate, the two ways lignin inhibits cellulase activity, surface blocking and nonspecific binding, represent the challenges that must be circumvented to have efficient pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials.
Multiple strategies have been investigated to deal with"
ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#fetataglance_-_-_TEXT.html," diseases are among people, especially in the iGEM community. The name of this module is “Identification”; with the intention of “identifying” the parameters of the problem, in order to solve the source of the matter efficiently.
Afterwards, we aim to carry out some tasks to raise awareness and warn people who are at high risk of ischemic diseases such as heart attack. We plan to present our “identification” data obtained from public in an influential way like daily calorie you take from casual meals we have during normal a day. This comprises our second column, “clarification”.
ThirdLY, we need to be accurate and significant in whether we want to help all the stakeholders and public health. To do this, we chose the “specialization” step to get in contact with experts, doctors, specialists and related stakeholders of sectors and describe what has been done so far and what could be carried out.
Lastly, we have to convey all of these experiments, data and advice into a product. However, we must clear out the possible consequences, side effects of this product or public reaction to it. Therefore we have researched and performed a brain-storming session to describe what how it will be posed in the future, as the “application” step.
Collaboration
As a part of collaboration between iGEM teams, we invited Paris Bettencourt iGEM team to International Turgut Ozal University Medicine Congress of our university. We have organized a workshop about synthetic biology together.
We invited METU Turkey iGEM team to our university for dinner. We presented our projects respectively and discussed on some ideas and projects.  We debated on how we can help each other and what we can do for collaboration or P&P.

Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#outlook_-_-_TEXT.html," fusion turned out to have been hydrolyzed and the GFP signal was just freely diffusing enzymes.
outlook - confirmation of channeling:
For both projects, we would need to make an isotope dilution experiment to confirm metabolic channeling in vivo.
The isotope dilution method uses the accessibility of the channeling complex to freely diffusing intermediate to determine the effectiveness of the channel. [1] The principle of this method can be explained with this Scheme:
Figure 1: Scheme to explain the isotope dilution method. Adapted after Spivey [1]
The precursor of the reaction S* (for us L-Tryptophan) is added and, after some time, a large amount of unlabeled intermediate I (Indolacetamide) is added, too. If the substrates reach the active centers  of the proteins solely by free diffusion, we would expect the addition of I to “dilute” the radioactive signal of the product P* relative to S*. If the dilution is relatively low or non-existent (in an ideal situation), channeling may be concluded. The idea behind this method is this: A perfect channel has the intermediates directly transferred between the enzymes of the pathway, thus no intermediate from the bulk phase is used and no unlabeled product occurs, so the ratio of P*/S* is 1.

Results on Petri Dishes were unsatifying: we obtained an agglomerate of colonies. And this in all Petri Dishes. Does the issue come from too old Petri Dishes? Or LB pre culture?
So, we tried a 2nd-spreding on Petri Dishes and the result was the same.

Models
Stochastic program is implemented for the toggle switch and works fine. We adapted the program for the whole system so we can implement the quorum sensing stochastic model very quickly when we have the parameters (about 1/2 day of work)
Parameters
We have coherent sets of parameters, but we still can't compare our models to the real system and are waiting for the results of characterization experiments.

In this part, we used a site-specific Cre/loxP recombination to delete the selective marker. To delete the selective resistance gene in transgenic rice, a marker-free element was used to assemble into four-gene multigene vector. This marker-free element was placed between two loxP sites, and consists of a HPT (hygromycin) resistance gene expression cassette and a Cre gene expression cassette controlled by anther-specific promoter (Figure 1). When Cre gene was expressed in transgenic rice anther, the Cre enzyme deleted the marker-free element between two loxP sites. You can read more details, please click here!

The World Health Organization
 
In 2002, the World Health Organization claimed in""20 questions about genetically modified food"". All of the genetically modified products as so far in the international market have passed the risk assessment by the national authorities. These different assessments in general follow the same basic principles, including the environment and human health risk assessment. These assessments are transparent, they did not show any risk for human health.
 
The United Nations
 
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2003-2004, in ""the food and agriculture condition report”clearly pointed out that the current existed modified crops and food is safe, the method used to test its safety is appropriate. So far, there is no safety accident caused by eating genetically modified crops. Millions of people eat the food derived from genetically modified crops, mainly maize, soybean and rape seed, but did not find any adverse effect.
 
The European
 
In 2009, the transgenic group of European food safety authority set out an authoritative scientific opinion about herbicide resistant and insect-resistantcrops that in terms of impact on the environment of human and animal health, gm is the same safe as non-gm, without any harm to health and the environment.
 
The United States
 
In 2010, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States claimed in “the influence on American agricultural sustainability ”. In general, compared to traditional agricultural technology for American farmers, genetically modified has created a huge environmental benefits and economic benefits.

The vector backbones we use in this project is the two kind of vectors we usually use in our lab——pDp124 and pDh124
2. The vectors construction steps are as the followings:
1) Construct GAL4 BD-CIB1 sequence. We used PCR to add two restriction sites PmaC I and Pst I on both sides of GAL4-BD and then connected it in the intermediate carrier for cloning. The 3' terminal sequence intrinsic included the restriction sites Nde I and Pst I. Then we used PCR to add restriction site Nde I and Pst I on both sides of CIB 1's CDS sequence. Thus we can use the two same restriction sites to inserted CIB1 into the 3' terminal of GAL4-BD.
2) Construct VP16-CRY2-UAS sequence. We used the method of total gene synthesis to synthesis VP16-UAS sequence, and designed the Nde I and Cla I restriction sites between VP16 sequence and UAS sequence. Considered that the sequence intrinsic included PmacC and Nhe I restriction sites, we added PmaC I's isocaudarner and Nhe I's isocaudarner restriction sites on both sides of VP16-UAS's sequence. Then the synthesized sequence was inserted into the intermediate carrier for cloning. Through PCR, we added two restriction sites Nde I and Cla I on both sides of CRY2's CDS sequence. Through the enzyme digestion of the two restriction sites and the connection of CRY2 sequence between VP16 sequence and UAS sequence, eventually developed the fusion protein with VP16 sequence.
3) Construct pDb124-BD-CIB1 vector. Cleavage the PmaC I and Nhe I so that the constructed GAL4 BD-CIB1 sequence was cut from the intermediate carrier and inserted it into pDh124 carrier which is linearized PmaC and Nhe I restriction site, then we obtained pDh124-VP16-CRY2-UAS carrier.

At the same time, we will carefully analyze the problems in the experiments and the modeling that are currently encountered in our project, so that we can better understand our project and excavate the parts that we may need to cooperate. In the course of the discussion, we talked about our understanding of synthetic biology, including its great potential for human benefit and the recent astonishing breakthroughs scientists have made. Then we showed and explained our project in depth, and they gave us some good suggestions, such as the improvements in cell secretion pathways that are practical, valuable and meaningful. We are really looking forward to our late-stage cooperation and exchanges with the United States to participate in the event of grand camping meetings.

    6. Callobration with NEU-China
On August, 2018, our team established a connection with iGEM group of NEU-China-A and thus a couple of video conferences have been made so far. The two teams introduced each other's projects in detail; the project of NEU-China was to design a biological system against IBD and preventing CRC by using engineered probiotics. Since the concentration of NO in the intestines of IBD patients was about 100 times higher than that of normal people; therefore, NO molecules were chosen as inflammatory signals, and probiotics (Nissle 1917) were selected as chassis organisms. The project consisted of two sets of devices, one of which was an anti-inflammatory equipment, including a sensor for detecting inflammatory signals, an effective enhancer and an effector secreting interleukin 10 (il-10). Another one was an anti-cancer device,which is able to express a kind of myrosinase from cruciferous vegetables by virtue of engineering probiotics. Meanwhile, it can transfer glucosinolate, a natural ingredient in cruciferous vegetables into sulforaphane. Such a kind of product was a type of organic molecule with cancer-fighting ability and at the same time it could inhibit oxidative stress. Similarly, it could work against intestinal inflammation. In addition, we used cold shock kill switches (cold shock expression Lysis and maz-ef) to prevent our engineer bacteria from escaping into the environment and causing DNA contamination.

Result – 1. Construction of BBa_J04450 + constitutive promoter/crr or cyaA
We planned to construct BBa_J04450 as circuit #1 (original circuit) followed downstream by our original circuit #2. Circuit #2 is composed by BBa_J2319 (constitutive promoter) / BBa_B0034 (RBS) / crr (IIA(Glc) or cyaA (Adenylate cyclase) / BBa_B0015 (double terminator).
So the first step was to clone either cyaA or crr from E. coli to Biobrick construct. PCR fragments with correct size were able to be obtained. After direct restriction with EcoRI and SpeI, the fragments were cloned into pSB1C3 backbone.
Next step was to construct, BBa_J2319 (chloramphenicol) / BBa_B0034 (ampicillin) and crr or cyaA (chloramphenicol) / BBa_B0015 (chloramphenicol). For BBa_J2319 / BBa_B0034 construction, prefix insertion was used. Thus ligation product was screened on ampicillin LB agar plate. While for crr or cyaA / BBa_B0015 construction, suffix insertion was used because the large size of crr or cyaA could be isolated by agarose gel excision. After BBa_J2319 / BBa_0034 (ampicillin) and crr or cyaA / BBa_0015 ("

Project
Many different ideas were discussed during the startup of our iGEM project. We finally decided to focus on the skin disorder Vitiligo. We have discussed our project idea with two leading Vitiligo researchers in Sweden (Mats J. Olsson & Håkan Hedstrand, Uppsala University), both who have shown interest and encouraged us to go ahead with the project. We have also been given a grant from the Swedish Vitiligo Association .
Vitiligo - in short
Vitiligo is a skin disorder causing affected parts of the skin to turn white. This is due to abnormal melanocyte function, resulting from the immune system mistakenly targeting the pigment cells, making Vitiligo an autoimmune disease. Vitiligo usually begins before the age of 20 and is estimated to affect 0.5-2 % of the world population. It is a very complex disorder and there is a lack of good treatments.
Spot on Treatment
iGEM Stockholm on the Vitiligo project This article is an effort from us in the iGEM Stockholm team to explain our Vitiligo-treatment scientific project in words that anyone can understand, consequently we will keep the scientific explanations on a basic level.
Our primary goal is to merge current scientific knowledge with an innovative new investigative approach known as Synthetic Biology, in order to hopefully help Vitiligo patients achieve faster and more efficient repigmentation of affected skin in the future.
Background
Vitiligo (leukoderma) is a skin disorder in which pigment cells known as melanocytes are destroyed,   resulting in white patches of the skin1. Melanocytes are the cells responsible for creating skin color, so when these are destroyed, the normal shade of the skin turns white. Vitiligo is in itself not dangerous and does not lead to any severe health problems, but patients’ life quality may be seriously altered by the cosmetic appearance that is a result of the white spots from Vitiligo. Between 1-2 percent of the world population are estimated to be affected by Vitiligo, with varying levels of severity. The disorder is characterized by patches occurring on the skin in various parts of the body, hair growing on the patches may also turn white1.

Note
1.For M9 medium using oleic acid as sole carbon source, various amount of oleic acid was first emulsified 1:1 with 10% Triton X-100. M9 medium was then slowly added with constant vortex. M9 medium with high concentration of oleic acid was diluted by M9 medium with triton to form various concentrations；
2. For M9 medium using glucose as sole carbon source, M9 medium with high concentration of glucose was diluted by M9 medium to form various concentrations.
Step
1. Seed liquor which was activated over night was inoculated into M9 medium which contains different concentration of oleic acid. And it was then incubated at 37℃ for 24 hours;
2. After 24h of incubation in 24 well plates in 37℃, bacteria culture was centrifuged at 3000rmp for 5min, washed and resuspended in PBS;
3. We detected the OD600 and fluorescence of using SpectraMax M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices) .Excitation at 584 nm and emission at 607 nm were used. All fluorescence was normalized with cell density by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm.

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," were very curious: our investigations led us to conclude that microfluidics were not widely known about by the public, and in industry and research these devices seemed specialized and costly, also sparsely used. We knew already that synthetic biology research labs at Boston University only use microfluidics to a very limited extent. Overall, we concluded that microfluidics are not widely used. But why?
To explore this question, we visited Lab Central, a hub for young and emerging biotechnology companies that need a lab space. Here, there were dozens of small synthetic biology startups. At Lab Central we presented our work on Neptune, highlighting the workflow as accessible for researchers new to microfluidics.
While at Lab Central, we met with representatives from Sembler, a Draper affiliated microfluidic fabrication company. We learned about what Sembler offers: for several hundred dollars, you could order custom designed batches of microfluidic chips. These are single use, single purpose chips. Sembler provides once monthly fabrication and delivery.
Intellectual Property Blog
In our outreach events, we found that the public, and even high school students interested in synthetic biology and engineering, have never heard of microfluidics. Further, we noticed in out industry visits that most microfluidics used are prohibitively costly and very specialized to a single task. Accessibility is a huge issues with microfluidics.
We then decided to center our human practices contributions around accessibility by creating a blog called ""Who Owns What"". In this blog we discuss intellectual property rights in synthetic biology, and how these important ideas shape the environment of synthetic biology we know today. This blog is an educational reference to anyone in the community who wants to learn more about IP in synthetic biology.
Definitions | Post One
Our post, “A General Overview of Intellectual Property in Synthetic Biology: Part 1” began our blog series by going over the basics of intellectual property. In essence, the post provided needed background and definitions such as patent, copyright and trademark, as well as a roadmap to future posts.
Software IP | Post Two
Our post, “A General Overview of Intellectual Property in Synthetic Biology: Part 2” continued the flurry of necessary definitions from Part 1, but went farther and began drawing comparisons between intellectual property in synthetic biology and the closest cousin in regards to policy and property laws: software.
IP in Synthetic Biology: Part 1 | Post Three
Our post, “IP in Synthetic Biology: Part 1” offers a brief history of intellectual property from the beginning of such laws in Venice in the late 1400s to the beginning of the copyright and patent"
Tsinghua-A,2014,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," can convert the binding ability of TALE protein to its target DNA sequence to a easier available parameter, the florescent intensity of RFP. When the TALE protein is expressed, the TALE may binds to its target, which may interrupt the transcription of LacI. The lack of repressors may lead to the expression of RFP. So the stronger florescent intensity means the better binding ability of TALE protein.
Validation
We change the normal RBS sequence in the LacI coding sequence into an RBS containing three tandem TALE binding site sequences. So we have to validate that the LacI protein can express normally and can normally inhibit the expression of RFP.
We transformed this plasmid in to E.coli DH5α with electroporation and chemical transformation. We spread the plate and culture it in 37 degrees Centigrade for more than 15 hours until small colonies can be seen in the plate. At this moment, the colonies might look red for the sake of the delay of expression of LacI. We picked colonies into the 10mL tubes and added 5mL LB broth with Chl antibiotics.
After six hours’ shaking at 37 degrees Centigrade and 220 rpm, we got the tubes out and double, four times, eight times diluted. (40μL of 0.1M IPTG was added as the positive control group) After another shaking for 12h, florescence of the bacteria was evaluated with an enzyme-labeled instrument and OD600 was tested with spectrometry.

Careful planning puts you ahead in the long run; hurry and scurry puts you further behind
-- King Solomon
What does creating task specific lab strains, building a novel golden-gate based toolbox and envisioning a synthetic metabolic pathway have in common?
All these approaches require intense theoretical groundwork. Many hours have to be spent with screening literature, summarizing the current state of knowledge and finally, developing own ideas. Constructs have to be designed and experiments have to be planned.
All this preliminary work has to be completed before the lab work can be truly started. In addition to our initial theoretical work, we routinely iterated the steps: designing, building, testing and learning throughout the whole project.
On this page, we want to provide you the theoretical groundwork that we did to design our projects. We want to demonstrate that we followed Synbio design principles and conceived our project based on the current state of knowledge.
The vision of ""Cloning in one Day""
We realized that the fast growth of V. natriegens is well suited to accelerate the most time consuming and least rewarding period of lab work. We approached to push the limits of growth speed to the absolute minimum by optimizing culture conditions.
ONE DAY CLONING
Figure 1:  Workflow for cloning in one day
Cloning is the foundation of most Synbio projects and consumes most of the time. However, cloning is at the same time the least rewarding phase of a project. In a publication, usually the assembly of constructs, the work that the scientists spent most time on, becomes a small paragraph in the material and methods section.
It is our belief, that in future projects, the time spent on cloning should be reduced to a minimum. This will enable scientists to focus on designing constructs and performing experiments, rather than the laborious cloning steps.
When we conceived our project, we immediately realized that V. natriegens could become a powerful cloning chassis. Its incredible growth rate should excessively reduce the time wasted by waiting for cultures to grow. We were caught by"

Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We"

At the same time, we told them that we had some problems in Tet A gene expression recently. Fortunately, they suggested that we should communicate with team XJTU-China because our projects were very similar. Through their suggestions, we successfully communicated with team XJTU-China and improved our experiments. What a wonderful experience!
CCiC
The 5th CCiC Conference was held in Shanghai University of Science and Technology from August 27 to 31. More than 60 teams from China participated in the Conference. The conference is divided into two parts: presentation and posters. Teammates of NKU_CHINA listened carefully to each team's statement and learned their advantages and our wonderful show was so Brilliant that many teams communicated with us. In the evening, all the teams are showing their unique design posters. However, our poster attracted a large group of people to seek cooperation. Thanks to our excellent presentation and poster display, we won the best Poster Award, which was a great encouragement for us. After the meeting, we exchanged views and ended our travel to CCiC meeting with a group photo.
TEAM OUC-China
When attending the CCiC conference, we met OUC-China fortunately and cooperated with them in public education and science popularization.
OUC-China team provided a science brochure about synthetic biology we used when we promoted synthetic biology in Tianjin’s Middle Schools. The popularization of science was as important as the innovation of science and technology. It was the wings of innovation and development. We took synthetic biology as the foothold of science popularization and participated in the popularization of science together, which greatly improved the depth and breadth of science popularization and strengthened the inheritance of synthetic biology. This is an innovative cooperation.
Science Popularization Lotus Festival
For further collaboration in this and next year , our six universities in Beijing and Tianjin (BNU NKU THU TJU TUST UCAS) had this meet-up together in  China institute of biophysics on September 16, In this conference we talked about our experiental plans and HP cooperations in the future. At last we all agree that there should be more relationship among us , we can find more oppotunities in spreading synthetic biology knowledge to senior and junior high schools and use others experimental facilities in next year's experimental part.

In conclusion, after some optimization, valuable data has been obtained regarding the ability of EB to disperse biofilm.  Whereas the data was not always consistent, the final experiments indicates that EB possesses a strong ability to disperse biofilm, especially considering that crude cell lysates were used to perform the tests.
For the future, the testing of both activated and purified EB would be an obvious goal, as well as further improving the set-up of the assay in order to obtain more reliable data.

S. pneumoniae σx promoters module
Figure 1. σx-Com-Box promoter mechanism
The reporter system contains a constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 , which continuously expresses σx required for Com-Box promoter induction. σx will then bind to Com-Box promoter and express green fluorescence protein. The whole construct was built in E. coli DH10B strain.
In order to achieve the functionality of pneumosensor, we must have a highly specific reporting system which will only give fluorescent signal under the presence of S. pneumoniae. In search for the suitable gene circuit, the discovery by Prof. Morrison on the competence for genetic transformation in S. pneumoniae which depends on quorum-sensing system to control many competence-specific genes acting in DNA uptake, processing, and integration has provided the ideal framework for this module. (Lee and Morrison, 1999) There is a link between this quorum-sensing system and the competence-specific genes, which is an alternative σx (ComX protein) that serves as a competence-specific global transcription modulator. (Luo and Morrison, 2003) In S. pneumoniae, competence (a state capable of being genetic transformed) happens transiently during the log phase growth, and is regulated by a quorum sensing system utilizing the Competence Signal Peptide (CSP). Upon stimulation by CSP, σx will be expressed and associated with RNA polymerase apoenzyme. The resulting holoenzyme will then be guided by σx to initiate transcription of a set of “late” genes enabling genetic transformation and other unknown functions. Characterized genes regulated by σx were found to contain an 8 base pairs consensus sequence TACGAATA known as the Cin-Box or the Com-Box. (Piotrowski, Luo, & Morrison, 2009). Taking advantage of this competence-specific mechanism, it is now"
UT-Tokyo,2015,Team:UT-Tokyo#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," we varied parameters according to parameter range, and constructed some parameter sets.
Third, for each parameter set, we saw if it satisfies the condition of Turing pattern, mentioned here ( mathematics ). If it is  satisfied, it is registered as a ""passed parameter set"". Each parameter set is also characterized by its largest eigenvalue of stability matrix, with and without diffusion term, sensitivity, and the wavelength that takes the maximum eigenvalue.
Then, after seeking parameters, we saw some trend of parameters. We also ranked parameter sets, acording to their stability matrixes' eigenvalue. Since E. coli increases in the order of hour, it is considered to take a lot of time for pattern formation. However, if it takes much time for pattern formation, there may arise some difficulty on the experiment that the nutrients for E. coli would be run out until the pattern is formed.
There are 10 parameters in the last formulas. However, there were some parameters that do not seem to have been found. There were also some parameters that can be changed by experiment; strength of the constitutive promoter, a copy number of the promoter, etc... For those parameters, we defined a parameter range so that each parameter can affect forming a pattern. See parameter page for detail.
Result
two cases on the same parameter range, it turned out that more patterns were formed in Case 1 than Case 2. And the biggest eigenvalue of Case 1 was smaller than that of Case 2.
The trend of parameters
Case 1
・Set same parameter range, Case 1 is less likely to make pattern than Case 2.
・alpha/beta > 1 should be satisfied. In case 2, however, alhpa should not be very large compared to beta.
・K should not be so large, nor so small.
・delta should be larger than 1, so that it can kill u or v. This means that
・kappa should be large, especially if you want to make pattern fast (from the relationship between the eigenvalue).
・there seems small sensitivity in gamma.
・mu should be large, so that the order is near alpha and beta. mu should not be so large(larger than 0.7).
・du, dc da have no trend as long as its range is narrow enough
・i think there would be a relationship between K and delta. I will check it.
・ delta should be large and K should be small.
・ K and delta is related. If K is large, delta must not be so small.

Control over the polymerization
The only difference with a standard GoldenBrick protocol is the capacity for the RBS-protein cassette to polymerize. This polymerization capacity makes the power of the technique because it enables to make polycistronic mRNAs no matter what gene is inserted. However, a control mechanism is required in order to create polycistrons or when we want a single gene to be inserted in the cassette.
In order to achieve such a control, several parameters in the protocol can be ajusted to move the equilibrium from monocistrons to polycistrons. The first and the most obvious one is the stochiometry of the different elements. If the promoters and terminators are in large excess compared to the RBSs and the gene, the balance will be in favour of monocistrons. On the contrary, if the amount or RBSs and coding sequence in dominant, the cassette will tend to contain two or more genes inserted inside.
On the other hand, the number of cycle and the ligation time will also influence the polymerization. Polycistrons are not likely to appear when the number of cycle is small and the ligation time short, but they will become more and more important as we increase these parameters.
Most of the work carried on by our team is now focused on optimizing the protocol. We will release soon a set of standard protocols for mono and polycistrons optimized to reduce the heterogeneity of the polymerization length.
Fig 8: a. The vector, promoter, and terminator are in excess: the assembly produces mostly monocistrons. b. The protein sequences and RBS are in excess: the assembly produces mostly polycistrons.
Assembly procedure
Fig 9: Summary of the GoldenBrick procedure
Assembling parts using the GoldenBrick method is a lot easier than for BioBricks and also five to ten times faster. We are now going to explain the procedure from the theoretical point of view. For the complete protocol, you should refer to the material and methods section.

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!

Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.

Policy & Practices
Overview
From plain biology to cellular biology and to molecular biology: as technology advanced, our scientific focuses have shifted to ever smaller entities. Biology is not just about animals and plants. It is about invisible objects that can only be handled with microscopes, electrophoresis and PCR. On the other hand, one day hardly passes without hearing the words such as genetically engineered food and iPS cells in mass media. But how many of us really have accurate understanding of what they are? Due to unfamiliarity, general impression about synthetic biology are not positive to say the least. To wipe out this negativity surrounding synthetic biology, our team decided to bring fun to science by means of BioArt. If invisible synthetic biology is turned visible through an encounter between art and science, people will feel less intimidated about them. Art is fun, so can be science.
In this line of thought, Policy & Practices is an essential part of iGEM activities, because it is about opening synthetic biology to those not following it every day. Our various activities of Policy & Practices had one goal: to connect synthetic biology to society, economy, philosophy, politics, law, ethics, culture and the environment.

All the safety measures was taken, including personal protection and exhaust ventilation in the chemical hood. We also used AgO, THF and Zinc dust. AgO is irritating to the eyes and respiratory system, THF is hazardous when it comes in contact with skin and has carcinogenic effects, Zinc dust is an irritant when it comes in contact with skin. Therefore, the use of all these substances was under the guidance of our mentors and every step was evaluated by experienced chemists (We consulted Ruth Goldschmidt from Professor Livney's lab and also Emma Gerts, who is in charge of organic chemistry labs in the Technion) who advised us on all the necessary safety measures needed to be taken. The whole process was always done according to all safety precautions, in a chemical hood and the disposal was according to MSDS of the reagents.
Other chemical materials we used in the production of Azobenzene were not hazardous.
The Azobenzene as a product is not hazardous and is biologically safe. The product is not volatile and is not hazardous when it comes in contact with skin (according to Woolley Group, Department of Chemistry in the University of Toronto, Canada).
Our project combines both synthetic biology and chemistry. We think it's important to have a safety program in the iGEM competition for chemistry, not only for biology, which will allow the iGEM HQ to supervise chemical lab work as well.
Our System's Safety
Now that we discussed the general safety, the safety of our project needs to be assessed.
In our project we used E. coli strains as model organisms for our systems.
We chose this bacteria since it is common in laboratory use and the strains we used (BL21, Top 10-DH10β, DH5αz1, JW3367-3, BW25113) are non-pathogenic and safe to work with.
In the future, when we finish testing the whole system, adding a kill switch into the system  would be a MUST to ensure a safe use of the bacteria as a detector.

Therefore, we made smaller constructs to characterize each individual component in terms of promoter strengths, cross-talk between repressors and non-target promoters, and performance under full workload. The protocols used for characterization can be found here .
Characterisation of Component Performance
Relative Strengths of Promoters
To compare the relative strengths of the three promoters, phlFp, tetp, and lacp, we ligated each promoter to a GFP generator, BBa_E0240 , and measured the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) produced by each construct. The following constructs were built:
Figure 1. Comparison on the strength of phlFp, tetp and lacp. Negative control represents BBa_E0240. This result was obtained by combining 3 characterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bar present SD from 3 biological replicates.
The activities of phlFp, tetp, and lacp were measured and compared in RFU and normalised with OD600. The activities of phlFp, tetp, and lacp were found to be 4.840e+007 RFU/OD600, 2.275e+007 RFU/OD600, and 4.870e+006 RFU/OD600 respectively, which are all higher than that of the negative control, with phlFp exhibiting the strongest promoter strength, followed by tetp, and lacp.
Crosstalk between Repressors and Non-Target Promoters
The fidelity of our design relies on the specificity between the repressors and their target promoters. Since all three repressors in our design belong to the same TetR family, it is likely that crosstalks exists; and that should be investigated on. We ligated the constitutive promoter, BBa_J23101 to transcription units of each repressor to achieve a constitutive expression of the repressor protein. We then inserted the resulting composite unit upstream to a non-target promoter, in order to drive the expression of the GFP generator, BBa_E0240 . The following constructs were built:
To investigate crosstalk between phlFp and LacI:
To investigate crosstalk between phlFp and TetR:
Ideally, there should be no crosstalk between the repressors and non-target promoters, that is the presence of the repressor transcription unit should be independent of the GFP production cellularly. In that scenario, the GFP production of the two constructs above would be similar to that of a GFP generator driven by phlFp. Therefore, we compared the"

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Details_-_-_TEXT.html," able to regulate transcription through binding with a luxR binding site located in promoter regions. In our system, the LuxR-AHL complex will perform a dual task.
While it activates the pLux-CI promoter ( BBa_R0065 ), resulting in the transcriptional activation of OmpA-AFP ( BBa_K584020] )and MelA ( BBa_K193602 ) (2), it acts as a negative regulator of the pLac-Lux promoter ( BBa_K091100 ), the transcriptional regulator of stimulus 2, thereby acting as an additional safety mechanism to ensure that no INP can be produced during stimulus 1.  If we add lactose or IPTG to the medium (stimulus 2), it will activate transcription from  the pLac-Lux promoter , resulting in INP ( BBa_K584024 ), CI repressor and CrtEBI ( BBa_K274100 ) transcripts that are translated into their specific proteins. The CI repressor will repress the pLux-CI promoter and, thereby specifically inhibiting the production of AFP, while INP is being expressed.
2.a  Expression of AFP and Melanin formation
If you read how the dual inhibition works, it already will be rather clear how AFP and melanin are produced: when E.D. Frosti takes up the arabinose, it will interact with pBAD and eventually triggers the transcription of OmpA-AFP and MelA. MelA will induce melanin formation, which gives a black color to our cells. In this way we know that our pLux-CI promoter is activated and that both OmpA-AFP and MelA are being transcribed and translated. The MelA is an existing BioBrick that the Cambridge_2009 team added to the registry: BBa_K274001 . For more information about MelA you can click here .
AFP normally is expressed intracellularly  to prevent freezing of the cytoplasm, but in our system, it was essential that  AFP was extracellularly anchored at the cell membrane, thereby preventing ice formation outside the cell. Therefore, we merged the AFP gene to OmpA via a flexible linker, thereby ensuring the desired extracellular localization of AFP.  If you like to know more about AFP in nature and how it functions, you can click here .
2.b Expression of INP and Lycopene formation

Tec-Monterrey,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey#hpractice_-_-_TEXT.html," gave them some thoughts regarding the proteins they were using, because undesired expression of such proteins could prematurely begin cell lysis.
Around August, we began communications with some other teams from Mexico. An official gathering with teams Ciencias UNAM, UNAM_Genomics_Mexico, UANLe_Mexico and CINVESTAV-IPN-UNAM_MX took place at Irapuato, where we discussed some problems concerning working at iGEM projects in Mexico, for example:
- DNA synthesis
- DNA Kits – wells containing bad or no DNA at all
- Sharing synthetic Biology
- Communication between Mexican teams
- Video Games and synthetic biology
Some of these areas of opportunity later became the main Human Practice evaluation for some Mexican teams. Nevertheless, even though some ideas did not proceeded beyond planning, the teams took the opportunity to meet and greet each other in order to ease further collaborations and encourage a friendlier and more cooperative environment between present and future Mexican iGEM teams.
Human Practices
Synthetic Biology might be considered an unknown term for a significant part of the population even for young adults or college students enrolled in non-biological sciences courses. Our human practices focused on sharing and explaining the definition and applications of synthetic biology, making it a simple concept for the individuals involved to analyze and formulate their own ideas. An important experience of our human practices motivated a portion of society to examine and question themselves how synthetic biology takes part of their daily lives in products, scientific investigations they watch on TV, etc. It also revolved around making it easy to understand by simple explanations of our projects development and reaching out to the majority of people we could. To do all of this, our human practices included workshops for high school students, educational videogames of our projects and finally, an introductory presentation and discussion of synthetic biology for adults such as parents.
Synthetic Biology Presentation for Parents
Sharing the interest of Synthetic Biology with young students is very important but also interacting with society. In that manner, we decided to give explanatory presentations about iGem, our project and Synthetic Biology to parents who were visiting the University. The presentation included a very clear explanation of DNA, genes, Synthetic Biology and it’s applications as well as an introductory description to iGem Competition. We managed to give 3 presentations, two of them for parents only and the last one for prospect students of Engineering in Biotechnology and their parents. We were very happy to know they were impressed about the applications, the development of our project and motivated their sons and daughters to participate in iGem in their college years.

Wash_U,2009,Team:Wash U#German#Biological Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," values were included that exaggerate true concentrations and time scales.  OmpR was given an initial concentration normalized to one, and all other components were assumed insignificant initially to this value. An ideal light pulse was introduced at an instant and removed thirty simulation seconds later. From this rudimentary simulation it can be drawn that the nonlinearities of the phosphorylation and transcription factor binding kinetics effectively smooth the sharp light input.  By design, the light switch ON yields phosphorylation of OmpR and repression of the pucB/A genes which would give rise to LH2.  Conversely, when left OFF, the concentration of pucB/A recovers and increases until the steady state determined by its translation and degradation rates.

Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," of EsaR, EsaI and CepR gets induced further by the binding of EsaR, whereas the expression of CFP and CepI gets repressed.
Our model consists of two compartments: the cell (genetic set-up) and the surrounding environment. The homoserine lactones are transported through the cell membrane into the environment due to diffusion. The diffusion into the environment and back are influenced by the size of the cell [5].
Cell growth and division
For simplification some parameters had to be estimated. The cell population was described as a single-cell organism surrounded by the environment, so the output of the model is based on one cell in the whole system. Since the amount of all species in the model increase during the simulation a division time had to be assumed (τ=45 min). From the division time we get the rate the amount of DNA increases, which is μ = ln2/τ, the growth rate [6].
This is also valid for the DNA currently bound to some other species during the simulation.
The number of cells in the model (N) had also to be defined as increasing with the fixed parameter μ, the growth rate. The number of cells defines further the total volume of cells in the model (Fig. 3). The starting number of cells (No), the volume of a single cell (Vcell), and the total volume of the system (Vtot) are determined in the beginning of the simulation.
Figure 3 Schematic representation of the cell growth and included parameters. The total volume is constant. The cell population grows over time and affects the volume of the environment.
Without cell division we would see continuous accumulation of molecules in the model. To avoid this, cell division is simulated by decreasing all species by the growth rate (dilution). Additionally, all species are constantly decreasing with a specific rate (=degradation rate) to simulate natural degradation of mRNA, proteins etc.
Diffusion through the cell wall was modeled as well, as some species can diffuse through the cell membrane into the environment. To describe the rate of diffusion ,a new parameter “D” had to be introduced. D is the diffusion rate by which the species get through the cell membrane. D was estimated from the literature to be 10 min-1 [6]. The diffusion back into the cells is more complicated to model. It depends on the total cell density, which changes over time. So a new parameter “r” which depends on the relation of a single cell volume to environment volume has to be defined. The total volume which is the sum of cell volume (Vctot)"

Redesign
As experiments of constructing these three plasmids were carried forward, we meet a problem that can’t avoid: the ordinary expression efficiency of GFP promoted by Pvgb would take up to 8-10 hours, when it is enough for people to see the fluorescence without using a fluorescence microscope. Fortunately, with great help from Dr. Zhu, we improved our circuit using T7 RNA polymerase gene and PT7 strong promoter to enhance the expression of GFP. The artificial gene cluster now contains a Pvgb promoter, a T7 RNA polymerase gene, a PT7 strong promoter and a GFP coding gene. The Pvgb promoter will not directly control the expression of GFP, but the T7 RNA polymerase instead. The latter fits with PT7 promoter and has a much higher expression efficiency that other combinations cannot match. We expected that the GFP, which is indirectly regulated by Pvgb promoter, will have a much higher expression efficiency.
To be differentiated from the others, we call this improved circuit ‘Oxygen 2.0’, and the previous circuit is called ‘Oxygen 1.0’(figure5).
figure5. “oxy2.0”
While the test results for Oxygen 1.0 and Oxygen 2.0 did not satisfy us, we designed the circuit ‘Oxygen 3.0’. The first half part is totally the same as the ‘Oxygen 2.0’, while we add another half part, including a tetR coding gene, a Ptet promoter and an amilCP coding gene. tetR protein is specific to Ptet promoter and will combine on it, preventing the polymerase from transcribing the downstream gene. And the amilCP is a dark-blue protein which is rather easy to observe. We hope that, when in a mionectic environment, the expression of BFP and tetR will be strong which will cause the inhibition of Ptet promoter activity and weaken the expression of amilCP, and when in a hyperoxia environment, the expression of BFP and tetR will be weak and the one of amilCP will be strong. Different levels of dissolved oxygen is expected to be reflected in the color and fluorescence intensity(figure6).

Oct 02, 2018 Skype call with medical doctor Dr. Edgar Peters (VUmc Amsterdam)
We asked Dr. Peters about his opinion on the feasibility of our project. He believed our project sounded very promising, but he was concerned about regulations which will make its market launch difficult. It would thus be important to demonstrate that E. coli cannot escape the patch. If we achieve this, it would be great to regulate the production and secretion of various bacteriocins through a sensing system. Peters expects that upon the extermination of one bacterial strain, other (malignant or benign) ones may take over. A huge advantage of our GMO-based system would thus be its flexibility to adapt to a changing wound flora. As most current antiseptic bandages are ineffective, this new treatment would be useful.
Insights
S. aureus is the most important infection-causing bacteria on diabetic wounds. Streptococcus comes second, although he has encountered them less frequency lately. Pseudonomas is more important on burn wounds than on diabetic wounds.
Most existing antiseptic bandages are not effective.
It will be important to demonstrate that E. coli cannot escape the bandage in order to conform to regulations.
It is not likely that our plaster will cause inflammation, as it is no part of the body. It may be smart to change the patch on a regularly base, however. Currently, bandages are changed every one or two days. The plaster will probably be required until the wound closes, which may take months.
It is to be expected that once the bandage will have eradicated one type of bacteria growing on the wound, others will take over. Therefore, an integrated sensing system regulating the production and secretion of a range of bacteriocins would be the ultimate solution.
Patients affected by diabetic wounds are usually 60-70 years old, they suffer from peripheral neuropathy, vascular disease and diabetes. From all diabetic patients, 65% will develop neuropathy. 20-25% of those patients will develop wounds on their feet, of which half gets infected.
Follow-up
We will next equip our patch with a bacteriocin against Streptococcus.
We researched options to contain the medium in the patch.

Duke,2010,Team:Duke#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"otes as growth regulators and protooncogenes is the subject of much discussion (4,11,12,13,15). Their functioning as heterodimerizing regulator proteins (4) has lead to the development of competitive inhibitors to their functioning by the generation of dominant negatives (12).
Heterodimerized Fos and Jun proteins interact with a DNA recognition sequence commonly referred to as the AP-1 site (4,11,15), which is not found in prokaryotes, meaning that this pathway would be unlikely to interfere with in vivo cellular functions in recombinant E coli. We intend to produce promoters for these dimerized proteins by replacing the binding sites of the cI promoter with AP-1 sites, as has been an effective method for custom promoter design (10,11,16,17).
The proposed regulatory pathway has previously been modeled in a series of papers by Francois & Hakim (7,8), as well as Buchler (2), and similar pathways have been found to be functional in yeast using mammalian bZIP CEBPα and its dominant negative 3HF (1). In these studies, similar dimerization pathways were shown to remove basal noise in regulatory protein expression by using protein sequestration.
Leucine zippers form heterodimers based on the specificity of their coiled-coil structure, and it has been repeatedly observed that altering the structure of these helices, either by single point mutations or helicle exchange, can lead to a change in dimerization specificity (12,13,15). A library of synthetic proteins based on leucine zipper design would yield a very broad spectrum of regulatory properties based on their heterodimerization and DNA binding rates (14,18), and the tunability of such a system would make it ideal for metabolic engineering (8,14,18).
DNA binding sites on leucine zippers also contribute to their regulatory properties (3,11,12,13,15), and it has been stipulated that by altering the DNA binding sequence it would be possible to generate a broad variety of specificities, that along with promoters generated with specific binding sites for the synthetic dimers would allow for the production of highly complex and tunable regulatory pathways.
There is great potential for modularity in the production of synthetic leucine zippers in that the DNA binding and dimerizing motifs that are present in bZIPs have been intensively studied and found to be distinct and recurring structural motifs in isolation of spacing sequences, meaning that synthetic zippers would be produced with essentially interchangeable parts to provide them with unique specificity ("

BioMORTAR Project Abstract
In order to facilitate the design process for novel bacterial metabolism, our team has created a tool suite known as BioMortar which will automate plasmid design for metabolic processes as well as model cell growth. BioMortar begins with a much improved version of IMPtools, which uses an algorithm over a network generated by the KEGG database, to determine the optimal metabolic pathway according to specified conditions. At this point, it accesses the DNA sequences for each recommended enzyme for each reaction and searches the BioBrick database for related gene sequences. Then, BioMORTAR designs and displays the advised, usable plasmid(s) in BioBrick format for the user.  Finally, the program models the growth of the organism, with the addition of the new metabolic pathway(s). By automating the design process, BioMORTAR streamlines the process of designing bacteria with new metabolic processes.
Project Description
The 2010 Illinois iGEM Tools Team is in the phase of constructing a program to design a plasmid in-silico for the user-specified host bacteria as well as model the growth of the designed cell.
The web-based program will begin by implementing the desired metabolic pathway computed by a greatly improved version of last year's project, IMPtools, then by determining the recommended enzymes for each reaction, and accessing the DNA sequence for it. In the meantime, the program will model the growth of the user specified bacteria"
Tokyo_Metropolitan,2010,Team:Tokyo Metropolitan#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html,"biotechnology” is associated with closer to their lives, for example, medicine and cosmetic. In others (not students), they don’t know academic language well, but they know it is associated with their lives.
Q3,If there is no difference in effect, what do you think about using the drugs manufactured by [ genetic engineering / biotechnology ]?
[ Not mind I use / Hardly mind I use / If possible, I don't want to use / I must not use / I don't know ]
Q1 and Q3 show the same tendency. Adults think to avoid using it.
Q4,What do you think of the artificial genetic mutation?
[ Bad / Little bad / Little good / Good ]
There is not much difference between answers on genetic engineering and biotechnology. And students today don’t have a bad impression of genetic engineering. From as far back as they can remember, these technologies have used.
Q5,Which trend of information about [ genetic engineering / biotechnology ] is major, negative or positive?
[ Negative / About the same degree / Positive / No idea ]
The answers on genetic engineering are more negative than biotechnology. We think that there is an effect of mass media.  They have established a public image of genetic engineering is not good.
Q6,Do you think Japan actively tackles [ genetic engineering / biotechnology ]?
[ Yes / Partly yes / Not so much / No ]
There is not much difference between students and others.  We must do actively to popularize genetic engineering and biotechnology because of the answers are half “Yes” and half “No”
Q7,Do you think the research on [ genetic engineering / biotechnology ] should continue?
[ Yes / No ]
Many respondents answered they think the research on genetic engineering or biotechnology should continue!! The image of genetic engineering is not good ( Q1, 3 ), but more than 80% of all respondents recommend the research. We think, this means it is depending on what research.
<the research should continue> Students in science think it is interesting as academic. Managerial Position anticipate a new business , literally. Overall, they anticipate “be useful for food crisis”, “be applied to medicine”, “potential”.
<the research should not continue> There is not much difference between answers on genetic engineering and biotechnology. Most of them are concerned about effect of genetic engineering or biotechnology on environment and humans. Students in arts feel somehow uneasy. We think it can improve by awareness activities.
Q8,Have you ever heard the word, ""Synthetic biology""?
[ YES / NO ]
There is not"

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#InternalCellular_-_-_TEXT.html," was extremely difficult. In the absence of existing research on the Etn promoter, an alternative, but more intuitive method for transcription rate determination must be used.
To determine transcription rate, we determine the speed of the RNA Polymerase across the DNA transcript. An approximate value of 42 nucleotides per second, found by Proshkin et al. 2010, will be used for our model in the absence of promoter activity information. This represents a transcription rate of 0.06278 amilCP mRNA transcripts per second, per molecule of DNA construct. This is again multipled by the mean copy number of the plasmid (200) to give the final rate.
So why was this method not used for Etr 1 and Etr 2? It was found that calculating the Etr1/2 transcription rate using 42 ntd/sec produced a rate that was faster than that calculated by the promoter strength method. The promoter strength would be the rate limiting step for Etr1 and 2 but not for AmilCP.
Another factor to consider is the basal expression level of AmilCP. Many promoters have a slight level of expression even with no signalling molecules bound, which would modify our equation to:
where B is the basal expression rate. However, we can assume that B is so low that it can be ignored in our model.

Translation
After the AmilCP mRNA transcript has been formed, it must be translated into a functional chromoprotein. Translation involves 3 main stages: initiation, elongation of the polypeptide, and termination. The key molecular machinery driving this process are ribosomes, who's binding and movements determine the overall rate of transcription.
Translation rate can be affected by 3 major processes: a) the binding of the ribosome to the RBS, b) formation of initiation complexes, or c) speed of the ribosome across the mRNA transcript (Proshkin et al. 2010).
In this model, we will assume that the movement of the ribosome (in amino acids formed per second) is the rate determining step in the translation of the proteins.
Thus, our key assumptions for translation are:
  1. The major factor affecting translation rate is by the speed of the ribosome across the mRNA, which"

Edinburgh_OG,2017,Team:Edinburgh OG#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM competition through an introduction to iGEM history and principles, and an explanation of our projects.To achieve this, we explained how iGEM has helped us to develop practical and problem-solving skills, to come up with solutions to world problems and finally helped us to integrate our project and ideas into the real world. The audience, 30 people from both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, seemed to be very motivated to join the 2018 team, asking many questions about how they can apply.
Another goal of our presentation was to raise awareness of the emerging threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria, by explaining our project and why it is necessary. We aimed to help the students develop a better understanding of the problem and an interest in coming up with new ways to tackle it.
""Before hearing about PhagED, I had no idea there were possible ways of getting around antibiotic resistance other than limiting antibiotic use or discovering new antibiotics."" - Magnus, 2nd year biological sciences student
