At each single conjugation event, with the expression relaxase, the corresponding tandem oriT pair is lost with the rolling-circle replication. Sequential conjugation and deletion of the different oriT pairs can be achieved by fine control of relaxase expression. To report the ending of tandem conjugation process, a reporter gene is attached after the last oriT pair, and hence expresses after all conjugation events happened.The resulting tandem signaling conjugation process will allow them to develop networks of bacteria capable of sequentially assembling tasks.
The riboregulator system was incorporated in Into their circuit to provide  an interface for interaction between their conjugation system and general genetic devices  to realize the goal of assembly line. According to the data that they measured, they concluded that  the open ratios of Key1 -Lock1 and Key 2-Lock1, the open ratio of key1-Lock1 was 3.3 times higher than  Key2-Lock1.

Sugarfilm
As a naturally formed immobilizing structure of bacteria, biofilm outstands in many ways such as the ability to withstand considerable degree of environmental fluctuation, the possibility for more efficient cell-cell communication as well as cooperation, and the stratified structure which may function greatly in phase-related synthetic processing. With this understanding and beyond, 2011 ZJU-China iGEM team tried to explore more about the potential of biofilm in applications.
Cellulose utilization for renewable bio-material production (especially bio-fuel production) has been a heated research interest for quite a long time. Due to the structural complexity and poor permeability of cellulose, a big obstacle for enzymatic break-down process, progress in promoting the utilization efficiency is slow.
Considering this problem with the advantage of biofilm as a reactor system, we believe the employment of biofilm and its stratified feature would help to surmount such obstacle.
Firstly, Sugarfilm, a three-layer biofilm-based expression system, is designed to directly attach to the surface of substrate (for instance, a sheet of cellulose debris). In this way, the distance between our ""degradation engine"" (E.coli cells) and the targeted substrate would be reduced greatly, laying the foundation of a more efficient system.
Two main cellulases involved in the first step of degradation, Cex (Cellulomonas fimi exoglucanase, BBa_K118022 , iGEM08_Edinburgh) together with CenA (Cellulomonas fimi endoglucanase A, BBa_K118023 , iGEM08_Edinburgh) will be expressed in the bottom layer of biofilm (as described in the ""Design"" part below in detail). Therefore, the secreted enzymes would get in touch with the substrate instantly.
In the next step, the preliminary products cellubiose from the first layer would diffuse to the middle layer of Sugarfilm due to concentration gradient. Beta-glucosidase Bgl"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Detectives_-_-_TEXT.html," strategies; mRNA cis-repression and homologous recombination. We read more about the detailed mechanisms involved in homologous recombination. We learned that there is overlap between the RecA mechanism of natural transformation and the RecBCD mechanism during homologous recombination (Dillingham & Kowalczykowsk, 2008) . Another endogenous homologous recombination system that could be used is via the RecF mechanism. If all else fails we could resort to the Lambda Red strategy. The advantage of using RecBCD would be in using ssDNA which is produced by the RecA system during transformation, thus RecA + RecBCD would be the preferred mechanism for homologous recombination.
Reading about cis-repression we learned that our main objective will be to design a suitable cis-repressor (crRNA) sequence. The crRNA must be complementary to both the RBS and the target DNA, with a greater affinity to the target DNA to promote reliable de-repression. The crRNA sequence does not have to necessarily cover the entire RBS sequence - only enough to inhibit the binding of the ribosome. According to literature (Isaacs et al., 2004) the crRNA must bind to only a few of the nucleotides in the RBS sequence in addition to binding the 5’ UTR. Overall the crRNA sequence must be 19-22 nucleotides. The secondary structure is also important to consider - some bulges (i.e. mismatches) must be present in addition to an adequately sized loop to allow for reliable binding of the trans-activation sequence (the amplified target pathogen DNA sequence), otherwise the mRNA will be strongly repressed. Programs such as Mfold may be necessary to predict the secondary structure and thermodynamics of the system (Isaacs et al., 2004) .
We cloned several more parts; PlepA, Pveg, amilCP, LacI (+LVA), tetR (+LVA). The promoters that we cloned were PlepA and Pveg which are endogenous to B. subtilis, as well as a constitutive promoter. AmilCP is a blue chromoprotein that does not fluoresce and was cloned so that it could potentially be used in our reporter system. The repressors we cloned contain a rapid degradation tag (LVA) that will increase the proteins turnover rate and provide us with a faster response.

Concordia,2013,Team:Concordia#Interface_-_-_TEXT.html," by the structure of the particular receptor protein being bound. In some cases, such as the LuxI/R AHL signaling pathway, these target sequences can be found in the promoter of the AHL synthase gene itself, creating a positive feedback loop (Boyer 2009).
More often the not, receptors act as a transcriptional activator of their target DNA sequence(s). The classic example of this is seen in the LuxI/R bioluminescent pathway; where the AHL-bound receptor targets the activation of the luxICDABE operon producing bioluminescence (Waters 2005). However, exceptions do exist where the receptor can act as a repressor by binding DNA, and blocking transcription, in the absence of its specific AHL (Boyer 2009).
Diffusion
Activation of the AHL signaling pathway amongst neighboring cells, relies heavily on one crucial step; the diffusion of the AHL molecules through the cell membrane and into the cell cytoplasm. AHL signals are said to be able to diffuse freely across the membrane since they are amphipathic molecules which theoretically should easily overcome the obstacles of crossing a phospholipid bilayer. Another important key factor is they ability of AHLs to diffuse locally in media. This allows cell-cell communication to occur even between cells that are not immediately adjacent to one another.
Comput-E.coli; AHLs
When choosing which AHL’s to use for Comput-E. coli we had to keep in mind all the limitations touched upon previously. In essence, we had to ensure that the AHL’s used:
Were not found endogenously in E.coli
Were not similar enough to induce potential cross talk
Did not diffuse slowly or not diffuse at all (they could not be long)
Had similar potential diffusion speeds based on structure
And were part of differing AHL signaling pathways which produced different AHL signals.
The three AHL signals chosen were done so because they respected all of the stipulations stated above. Three AHL’s were required in order to establish the directionality within the system (Left, Center, Right). As you can see; the AHL’s are of relatively similar lengths so they should diffuse at similar speeds, they differ slightly from each other based on oxidation and carbon chain length so there should be little to no cross talk, and they all use different synthase/receptor genes from different organisms which are not E.coli.

Instead, some smaller companies who never gave up researching this field are now future market leaders.

In their article Noneffective Antibiotics published in June, the German business news magazine Wirtschaftswoche explains it as follows: Antibiotics are the natural weapon of molds or soil microbes against competing bacterial growth. These bacteria under siege in turn counterattack with resistances: attack and defense – the natural course of evolution. Thus it was only natural, too, that since the first human use of penicillin and co., pathogens have developed strategies in order to escape the antibiotics’ effect albeit these drugs are quite insidious weapons.

At least two criteria must be met:
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Integration of our human practices investigation was achieved by introducing changes to the [Concept Design] . One of these changes included making the design smaller so that it could be portable and used to power machines such as cars or farm equipment and vehicles.
Several safety mechanisms were integrated into the design to avoid environmental contamination if the cells were to escape containment. These include; removing hemH so that the cells can’t create it themselves, and because the cells need a rich carbon source such as glucose to survive they will die outside of the containment chamber. An addition feature involves using CRISPR to insert the chlorophyll synthesis sequences – this will ensure the DNA is incorporated into the genome rather than existing in a plasmid inside the cell. This added layer of protection decreases the possibility of the genetic information being transferred.

We have assembled all genes required to convert PPIX to Magnesium PPIX (precursor of chlorophyll) in the Mg-Chelatase Plasmid.  There was proof of concept in that the E.coli was expressing proteins in this operon. There was no detectable Mg-PP in the DH5a strain with this plasmid. We made a hemeH mutant using CR"

Modelling sRNA | sRNAs validated to downregulate AAC(6') | sRNAs matching SYFP2
Modelling of small RNA interacting with the AAC(6)’5-UTR
Back to top
The modelling of our synthetic sRNA is a vital part for evaluating hypotheses of how sRNA molecules interact with their target mRNA. One canonical approach for sRNA stability is to evaluate secondary structures by minimum free energy (MFE) approaches. This gives a pointer for approximating the probability of different kind of interactions.
Stabile structures prevents translation A thermodynamic scheme of RNA interactions at different stages were made to show how an interaction between mRNA and sRNA could possibly work. So called toeholds are belived to play an important role in the interaction between sRNA and mRNA. [1] Understanding the interaction between RNA with different structures is a key to learn how to design a sRNA. Often the hybridization reaction between the sRNA and the mRNA starts with the unpaired nucleotides, the so called toeholds. To start a basepairing reaction, the sRNA needs a few basepairs to start hybridize to. The sRNA and the mRNA can then create a more stable secondary complex, hindering translation.
Reaction diagram sRNA
The sRNA 17 and mRNA for the AAC(6)-UTR were first calculated in CLC main workbench separately, after that we calculated the interaction structure between them .
This is a model of how a secondary complex can be created between the sRNA and mRNA.
Using a native scaffold to stabilize the interactions
The wildtype small RNA of E.coli K-12 MG1655 that we used as a template for constructing our own smallRNA is named Spot42 and has been shown to be interacting with the Hfq protein.
The sRNA Spot42 has like many other sRNA two distinctive functional parts,"

Figure 5. Meeting
NEU_China_B: How do you ensure that the integrative vector in transformation will not lose?
SCAU-China: The integrative vector we used is pFQ20 provided by the Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The homology arms in integrative vector for homologous recombination allows the target genes to be stably transferred into the genome of Microcoleus vaginatus. It has been verified through our experiment results.
SCAU-China: How to match the concentration of AI-2 expressed by the first plasmid pCFDuet-1 with the GFP concentration expressed by pet28a(+).
NEU_China_B: Our experiment was to release the AI-2 signal molecule after the pCFDuet-1 expression plasmid induction of lactic acid concentration, and AI-2 signal molecule can inhibit the lldr sequence on the second plasmid pet28a(+).
The lldr sequence is capable of producing GFP-deterring proteins. In the experiment, we verified that two plasmid copies were more similar, and that the O1O2 sequence could be started normally when the lactic acid concentration was lower (less than 1 mM), and then the GFP gene could be produced fluorescent signal.
Therefore, the expression of two plasmids is more matched, and the experimental results are not affected in this project.
Besides, as SCAU is famous for their tasty yogurt (Figure 6a), we detected, using our device, whether lactate is remained in their yogurt provided by them. We used their yogurt as inducer of our engineered E.coli, and green florescence could be observed under fluorescence microscope (Figure 6b).

Meeting Of Young Minds Debate
Meeting Of Young Minds
At the beginning of June, the Rathenau Instituut (a Dutch body which promotes the formation of political and public opinion on science and technology) put out a call for proposals for a debate, the Meeting of Young Minds, to be held on the Friday evening preceding the African-European jamboree.
The first Meeting of Young Minds debate, which took place in 2011 , pitted iGEM teams against representatives from Dutch youth political parties in a meeting of ‘future scientists and future politicians’ to discuss the ‘promises and perils of synthetic biology’. For Meeting of Young Minds 2012, iGEM teams were invivted to submit their own themes for debate.  Our proposal ‘A synthetic biology future, a synthetic biology crisis’ was one of two themes selected.
Our proposal
We decided that we wanted our proposal to have some link to our project, hoping that we might gain some new perspectives from the debate.  At this point in the summer, we knew what our project was going to be, but not how it was going to work, so we came up with the idea of a debate broadly based around geoengineering – deliberate large-scale scientific projects to address or remedy the environmental impact of human activities.
Early ideas included discussion on the ethics of syn-bio geoengineering and the rights and responsibilities relating to such large scale projects.  However, our research quickly revealed that these topics had been already been well-public"

Not very easy to understand as an independent reader I think. Drylab Autoinduction: Not sure about the tabs as they are. Not really very obvious that you need to click through them to get the whole story of the drylab. Perhaps some links to them.
Nothing on the conclusions tab, can that be sorted.
The model page is quite empty. Can u put up a title, and a bit more detail about each model. The user should really know a bit of detail about each one before they click on it.
Simulations: a bit overwhelming with all the graphs. Can you possibly write a bit before about what you have done for each model in very laymans terms? Ie this is a graph showing a simulated model for blah blah blah.
I didn’t read through the models, this needs going over thoroughly by a member of the wetlab who hasn’t seen it before, to see if it is understandable!!
This code is quite good for ‘next page’ tabs

Module 1: Genetic circuit
Drylab Protein Production: Same thing as before, looks quite good. Need perhaps a bit more information on the front page. Can either have a next page tab, or try seeing how it all looks on one page.
• Model page looks a bit better. Perhaps some nice illustrative graphs (not matlab, just qualitative powerpoint graphs) would be good to brighten up the page.
• ALSO NEEDS READING OVER BY SOMEONE ELSE
• Conclusions page is empty, please fill it!
Drylab Drug Kinetics: Same thing as before, looks quite good. Need perhaps a bit more information on the front page. Can either have a next page tab, or try seeing how it all looks on one page.
overview looks alright, maybe a bit more writing.
Model page has good detail, but needs EXPLANATION!!!
SIMULATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS EMPTY – can this be updated ASAP!!
Encapsulation: If there is not modelling to be done on this section, I don't think it is a good idea to draw attention to the fact by having a nearly empty section dedicated to it!
Genome deletion: Same as for above modules really, write a conclusion, more explanation needed.
Ethics section: Obviously dependant on the video. But I still think we need some writing to accompany it.
Resources: Can we have a photo album put here Charles? I tried, but it didn't work properly.

Visit to Biobest
It is always necessary to get feedback from important players in the field, in order to get relevant feedback on your project. With that thought in mind we contacted Biobest .
Biobest is a Belgian company which exports bumblebees to over 50 countries worldwide. This makes them the leading authority in biological pollination. The presence of the bumblebees makes it necessary to avoid the use of chemical insecticides. For this reason, Biobest produces and commercializes more than 30 kinds of beneficial insects and mites, which are used for biological crop protection. This made them the ideal company to contact for advise and expertise.
After signing in at the reception we presented our project to prof. Felix Wäckers, their head of R&D. Not only did he give some excellent advise, but with his help it will be possible to perform experiments with both ladybugs, aphids and perhaps even other insects.
But our visit didn’t end there! Besides an interesting discussion we also got a guided tour of the facilities. Needless to say we are very excited to get to work there!

We had a visit
Members of this and previous years' Calgary iGEM team came to visit Leuven, and after a few Belgian bears, they were willing to give us lots of tips & tricks to get through iGEM this summer. We noticed that the Belgian beers were a bit harder than they could handle ;-)
24/07
Going on a visit
Collaboration with other teams is important, so we went to Ghent to visit our colleagues of the University of Ghent . First, we went to the Faculty of Bioscience engineering, but everything was closed cause of the Gentse Feesten. We met four friendly students of the team and took some time to know each other. We talked about our projects and exchanged some ideas. Our view on the project is totally different, and so we learned from each other. They already had a nice overview of the literature, while we already did a lot of work for sponsoring, modelling and human practices. We made a common press article, and hopefully we'll get synthetic biology and our projects in the picture here in Belgium. We’ll see each other soon again at Marktrock in Leuven.

Figure 2 : Analyze of the GFP fluorescence on non recombined Lambda phages (Lambda), recombined Lambda phages with the fragment 286-393 of the penton base (LambdaPb286-393), recombined Lambda phages with the complete penton base (1-571), GFP tagged adenovirus (Ad10 and Ad100)
Firstly, we observe that the recombined phage shows a tag difference independently of the fragment of the penton base used compared to the non transformed bacteriophage. Secondly, the recombined phage with the RGD fragment alone (286-393) has a higher fluorescence than the phage with a complete fragment and closer to the adenovirus one (figure 2).
Back to top
Discussion
Even if the tissue vector has not been finished, scientific literature shows that a recombinant phage creation with a protein coding the adenovirus penton base is possible. It demonstrates as well that fragment coding for RGD sequence alone has a higher capacity to infect eukaryotic cells compared to the penton base complete fragment (figure 2). In the case of our application it is possible to use a recombined Lambda phage to insert our therapeutic gene.
Back to top
Conclusion
To conclude the RGD fragment of the penton base alone has a higher efficiency of interaction with integrines of eukaryotic cells. However for our project, it was more judicious to use the complete sequence of the penton base (fragment 1-571) because the use of the cell vector and the induction system by doxycycline give a very fast and target injection of bacteriophages. The use of a highly efficient transfection system is not advised because phages do not have the time to disperse properly and will infect several times the same cell. The use of the complete fragment of the penton base is sufficient for the phage to infect properly eukaryotic cells and let it time to have a bigger dispersion.

Antitumoral Plasmid
Context
In non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, like in all other cancers, the loss of apoptotic capacity of tumor cells is due to the functional loss of various tumor suppressors incoming in the apoptotic pathway.
The DVS application in the anticancer fight is based on the reactivation of this apoptotic pathway by bringing into tumor cells the wild type genes coding for functional tumor suppressors.

Future analysis, such as RT-PCR is suggested to check if the mRNA is transcribed properly. A good alternative would be to add a His tag, purify the chromoprotein and thereby determine translation.

iGEM Australia Meet Up
iGEM USYD hosted the other Australian teams from the University of New South Wales, Macquarie University and the University of Melbourne to share and discuss the hard work done by each team. All of the teams exchanged ideas about progress and the content of the wiki, poster and presentations. We also explored avenues through which we could collaboratively help each other such as through research, modelling and outreach. Each team brought something new to the table, and we rounded up proceedings with pizza and social drinks. Thank you to all the other teams for coming and having such a great time!
Hamburg, Germany: Phone App and Modelling Collaboration
The mechanisms of our biosensor were remarkably similar to that of the Hamburg iGEM2016 project. Although their biosensor detected a completely unrelated molecule using different proteins, a two component signalling cascade, followed by transcription and translation was involved. It was therefore possible to model their signalling pathway within the confines of our model.
Their team aimed to diagnose Chlamydia via the fluorescence of GFP, for this they required an app capable of measuring fluorescence which is very similar to our own which measures how blue our system turns. In return for their help 3D printing a prototype for the industrial use case of our stickers, we wrote them an app capable of performing diagnosis on fluorescence levels by comparing the negative, positive and patient micro-fluidic wells visible to the smartphone camera. It will require further testing to set the exact threshold and scaling values, but is currently an excellent prototype.

Introduction
Bacterial cellulose is one of the most abundant biopolymers produced by different species of gram-negative bacteria, especially by Acetobactors. Glucoacetobacter xylinus is a bacterial species, which produces cellulose in large quantities of high quality Lin, SP., Loira Calvar, I., Catchmark, J.M. et al. Cellulose (2013) 20: 2191. . Cellulose is produced from the resource glucose-6-phosphate. This phosphorylated glucose is a key intermediate in the core carbon metabolism of bacteria given its importance in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathway Joanne Willey LS, Christopher J. Woolverton. Prescott’s Microbiology. 9th edition 2014. . Even though the pathway, where glucose and glucose-6-phosphate is converted into cellulose, only includes few steps, it requires a great amount of energy. Not only does the cell spend energy on forming UDP-glucose for cellulose biosynthesis, it also uses glucose, which otherwise would have contributed to generation of ATP Florea M, Hagemann H, Santosa G, Abbott J, Micklem CN, Spencer-Milnes X, et al. Engineering control of bacterial cellulose production using a genetic toolkit and a new cellulose-producing strain. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2016;113(24):E3431-40. .
The ability for G. xylinus to produce cellulose nanofibers from UDP-glucose, crystallize, and secrete it, is controlled by genes in the Acetobacter cellulose synthase (acs) operon acsABCD. This operon encodes four different proteins: AcsA, AcsB, AcsC and AcsD. A dimer, known as AcsAB, is formed by a catalytic domain, AcsA, and a regulatory domain, AcsB. This dimer is responsible for synthesising the cellulose nanofibers from UDP-glucose, whereas AcsC and AcsD secretes cellulose and forms an interconnected cellulose pellicle around the cells Mehta K, et al. Characterization of an acsD disruption mutant provides additional evidence for the hierarchical cell-directed self-assembly of cellulose in Gluconacetobacter xylinus. Cellulose. 2014;22:119–137. , as illustrated in Figure 6.

Since the initial burst is also determined by drug concentration, once we find the diffusion coefficient, this will not be enough to successfully predict another concentration’s behavior but rather provide an approximation. Further experimentation is required.
This model for PLGA diffusion has been shown to lose prediction accuracy beginning on the 10th day. This limitation is insignificant to the scope of our project; since nurse bee metabolism takes only a few days (24 hours, according to a researcher known by our friends at UAlberta) and larvae are also most susceptible 12-36 hours after hatching. Not only this, but the brood need only 9-11 days to have their cells capped and start becoming pupae, which rarely die from Foulbrood (since it can no longer infect them).13
The viscosity of jelly might result in a reduced diffusion capacity, which must be taken into account for the amount of remaining peptide.
Bees have other pH values in their guts, head, and glands. However, these all fall in between the pH values chosen for hemolymph and royal jelly.14
We underwent experimentation only in apidaecin. We’d need to repeat this process for the remaining AMPs or their combination.
Results & Discussion
With the modelling tools provided and given experimental release profiles, we can simulate an average release within the path nanocapsules are meant to follow. Here, we can see a simulated profile with examples of radii and diffusion rates taken from other polymer-encapsulated drugs. 4
What’s important is that we have to be able to see two characteristics in our graph: (1) concentration at Td is at least enough to inhibit bacterial growth in the larval cell and (2) that the minimum inhibitory concentration gets released over the next 4 to 5 days, before larvae are encapsulated within their cell.
Minimum inhibitory concentrations for honeybee peptides and their combinations have been reported on extensively.15 In this example, we suppose 30% of an abaecin load gets initially released. By delivery, the nanocapsule has 57.6% and releases 24.8% during the next 3 days. Taking into account our limitations, we can know that if 24.8% is what gets released during these days, and if abaecin’s MIC for P. larvae is 200 ug/mL, the initial load must be 4.0322 times that, that is to say somewhere above 806 ug/mL.

We designed a novel toolbox for complete control over all major functions of the peroxisome. The toolbox is our solution for improving the engineering workflow and predictability of synthetic constructs. Interested? Find out how.
Scientific background
The root problem
Synthetic biology is an engineering discipline. And while we are able to plan our constructs with tools like biobricks, a major difference to e.g. electrical engineering is that they are not nicely isolated on a chip, but surrounded by all types of interfering agents. One of the major issues regarding protein expression in a novel chassis is unwanted and unexpected crosstalk between engineered pathways and the native cellular processes of the production host. The other one is toxicity of the products or intermediates of the pathway. Both can strongly affect our system’s behavior, which may in some cases lead to us having to trial-and-error find a solution, making our previously modeled optimization useless.
Our approach
The natural approach of organisms to deal with metabolic interference and toxic byproducts is subcellular compartmentation. This has proven to be a functional solution in naturally occurring pathways in eukaryotes as well as new synthetic pathways for biotechnological application. Thus, the creation of a synthetic organelle presents a suitable strategy to increase the efficiency and yield of non-native pathways. A common approach is to build up artificial compartments from scratch. Many breakthroughs have been achieved in the last decade, however the creation of a fully synthetic compartment is yet a milestone to reach for. We on the contrary want to start by engineering artificial compartments through orthogonalization.
The peroxisome is the ideal starting candidate as it has many advantages over other compartments, including it being able to import fully folded proteins and not being essential in yeast under optimal growth conditions. Our project’s aim is to create"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,". Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the"

First, here in English (for all people who don’t speak Dutch, Spanish, Russian or Chinese 😉):
iGEM Hamburg - Resistent Germs And How To Fight Them - English
Estimates from the World Health Organization predict a resurgence of bacteria to their long-lost top spot among the most devastating human diseases. How did it get this far? Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, that led to a drastic decrease of infection related deaths during the 20th century, scientists have developed a vast range of antibiotics to effectively treat bacterial infections. For a long time, we were able to fight most bacterial threats, which lead to a notion of false comfort that everything is under control. However, we do have to face a new post antibiotic era as resistances are on the rise with a speed unmatched by current research efforts to keep up with suitable antibiotics. We are now reaching the tipping point at which new strategies are required to overcome multiresistance and prevent a second era of deadly infections. In 2016 one of the first infections with a pan-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae variant was diagnosed in the USA; all 26 licensed antibiotics were applied but could not prevent the lethal outcome. A clear indication that alternative strategies are urgently needed to fight multiresistant species! During our first literature search we realized the problem was even bigger than we initially thought, which encouraged our decision to pursue research on this topic. We propose a mechanism that targets the bacterial iron acquisition which is needed for proliferation by substituting it with gallium. Iron replacement through gallium not only restricts the essential iron uptake to lower the proliferation rate but is also known for its cytotoxic effects on the infectious bacteria. The proposed strategy is reminiscent of the ancient Trojan-Horse story as bacteria are unable to distinguish between the gallium and iron uptake. We are convinced"

Wednesday
Today genomic DNA from DH5alpha and MG1655 was purified and we restreaked DH5alpha cells from yesterdays sample. The purified PCR from yesterday was also put on a gel and extracted. Some of our team members also began working on the modeling of the cutinase enzyme using computer software to see how we could optimize degredation. More research was done in regards to making sure we had all the materials and that the assays to be conducted were also looked into and finalized. A gel was also ran of the purified MG1655 and DH5alpha genome.
Thursday
The day started off with us receiving the MG1655 strain we ordered from Yale University. Even though we already began to use samples from one of our mentors' labs, it was a good idea for us to make liquid cultures and plates of the cells in case something went wrong. The two enzymes required in the pathway for breaking down ethylene glycol also underwent PCR along with genomic data from the MG1655 and DH5alpha cells. Luria Broth (LB) was made for kanamycin plates as well. We preformed ligation and transformations of the genomic data into the DH5alpha cells, and successfully cultured competent cells. At the end of the day, we rehydrated primers for the mutated cutinase as well, with a hope that the mutations will improve the cutinase functioning.

KIT-Kyoto,2010,Team:KIT-Kyoto#Project#Abstract_-_-_TEXT.html,"P) can be used for Blue. The color fluorescence is emitted when ultraviolet rays is irradiated. These fluorescent proteins are widely used in the field of the genetic engineering as the reporter gene. Therefore once we obtain the red, green, and blue fluorescent proteins in our hands, we can create an innumerable color by simply mixing these three fluorescent proteins with various ratios. At first we tried to produce the red, green, and blue fluorescent proteins in E. coli.
To achieve this, the multi-gene cassette shown in below was newly designed.
In this multi-gene cassette, the genes encoding RFP (Red), GFP (Green) and CFP (Blue) are placed in a tandem array. Each gene can be controlled by different promoter that has different activity. In order to create different color, fluorescent proteins have to be produced in different ratios. This can be achieved by utilizing promoters having different activities.TM is a terminator.
1-2 Selection of an appropriate promoter
Then, what kind of promoter is actually appropriate for this purpose? The promoter activity has to be controlled by some regulating substances. The easily available substance that had not been used before in iGEM would be suitable for the purpose. If the substance is related to some human diseases or aging, the promoter responding to the substance may be used for diagnosis of the disease or aging in future, since the fluorescent proteins under the control of the promoter can be used as markers. From these standpoints we decided to use promoters responding to hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is one of the reactive oxygen species that oxidize nucleic acid, lipid and protein to result in aging of human cells and various diseases. Although effective use of oxygen is acquired during evolution, the defense system to the active oxygen generated by consumption of oxygen also has been acquired in the aerobe. There are a set of genes that are involved in this defense system. These genes can be induced by hydrogen peroxide. We have utilized the promoters of these genes to induce the fluorescent proteins.
1-3 Mechanism of hydrogen peroxide response
E. coli has two defense mechanisms against the active oxygen . One is OxyR response, and another is SoxRS response.
In the OxyR response, OxyR works as a transcription factor. OxyR regulates activation or repression of the gene expression. Without active oxygen, OxyR is in an inactivated form. And with active oxygen, OxyR is activated and the activated OxyR can bind to the specific DNA sequence. OxyR binding sites are found in promoters of a set of genes that respond to the active oxygen"

Our project would not exist in this form without the support of the University of Tuebingen as an institute that not only taught us the basics we needed and showed us how much fun science is but also gave us the financial support for our own scientific adventure.
Especially Dr. Apel and the team of Prof. Jansen helped us out throughout the whole process with ideas, a lab, material, expertise, supervising and believe in us. Prof. Nordheim and Prof. Kohlbacher were important contact partners for a wide range of obstacles in organization and administration that we would not have been able to overcome without them.
We also want to thank the Reinhold-and-Maria-Teufel-Stiftung and Prof. Oecking for helping to finance our trip to the Jamboree in Amsterdam.

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Emilie#enjoy_-_-_TEXT.html,", apart from their association with controversies and scandals” notes Aurélie Coulon, journalist for the Swiss daily newspaper Le Temps.  Indeed, several people spontaneously mentioned the scandals associated with the agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto. One of them even accused the United States of being “the greatest terrorists on the planet” concerning their use of GMOs. For Prof. Duboule, the problem stems from the often confusing debate in which GMOs are all tarred with the same brush “We have to distinguish political, ethical and scientific problems. […] If you ask me about GMOs from a scientific point of view, I can assure you: they are not dangerous. […] However, I am totally opposed to the policy of corporations that sell sterile seeds”, he adds as an illustration.
Dreams and red flags
Our goal was also to gauge the public’s reaction to the use of genetically modified organisms in various fields. We therefore asked passersby to give their point of view on a few examples of GMOs designed to be used in medicine, environment or agriculture ( see our survey ). We purposefully introduced polemical uses of GMOs, such as the modification of human embryonic cells in order to cure genetic diseases. Surprisingly, the sole statement that collected a majority of negative reactions was related to agriculture, i.e the engineering of a wheat strain capable of adapting to climatic conditions. Agriculture seems to be the scapegoat of all synthetic biology’s excesses. Prof. Duboule suggests the following analysis: “Via association mechanisms, wheat and GMOs bring people back to sensitive issues such as nutrition, the challenge of third world development, overpopulation. […] Unlike the idea of conquering Mars, life sciences are not so evocative of dreams”.
Managing transparency
Unquestionably, it will be difficult if not impossible to free the word OGM from all the prejudices that now define it. This is an example of how the the scientific world was unable to successfully communicate with and inform the general public. In the light of this failure, how should the scientific community efficiently communicate with the outside world? What should be done to prevent an expression like “GMO” from drifting away from its original meaning? Transparency may be an answer. “We should make the system so transparent that people don’t even need to look into details. Trust is important!” claims Oliver Peter, head of the high-throughput screening group at Actelion Pharmaceuticals.
However, transparency also has downsides as it may nurture a form of scaremongering: communication must be managed with care.  We can take the very heated and publicized debate"

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," to regulate genomic genes using blue, red and green light and CRISPR and dCas9 protein. Their fundamental idea was to regulate production of sgRNA with different wavelengths. This would enable regulation of three different genomic genes within the chromosome, presumably independently of each other. Switching the regulatory targets would be done by changing the sgRNAs. The Shanghai team also built a box with computer controlled LEDs of all three different colors. In addition, they shared the software as well as the instructions how to build such a light regulation box. This was very interesting project as we built a light regulation system for three genes using LEDs and a microcontroller. STJU BioX Shanghai gave some inspiration to our LED control system.
Interestingly, also Freiburg 2013 team made a universal regulatory system using CRISPR and dCas9 protein but they targeted mammalian cells. In their concept, dCas9 is guided to the site and the function can be chosen remotely using different wavelengths of light. The effector either activates or represses the target gene or methylates a histone tail affecting the histone code at the site. The three effectors: repressor (KRAB), activator (VP16) and methyltransferase (G9a), can be controlled with red, blue and UV light. Such system would be able to regulate the target genes remotely in diverse ways.
""We program living cells to sense, compute, and respond to information in their environments. Our programmable cells have applications in basic science, industry, and medicine.""
Tabor Lab
Maybe the most interesting research group in this field is Jeffey Tabor's group. On their website they write: ""We program living cells to sense, compute, and respond to information in their environments. Our programmable cells have applications in basic science, industry, and medicine."" (http://www.taborlab.rice.edu/home, 20.5.2014). They have been involved in developing new light sensors, including CcaS/CcaR and Cph8. They also constructed a multichromatic gene regulation system combining both these receptors. In a very recent paper (Schmidl et al., 2014) they re-engineered Cph8 and CcaS/CcaR sensors to reduce cross-talk and leakiness and to increase the dynamic range.

What Makes iGEM Projects GREAT?
The first eight aspects are the key iGEM values that apply to all teams, irrespective of track. The final two aspects are distinct for standard(parts-based) tracks and special (non-parts-based) tracks.
How impressive is this project?
How creative is the team’s project?
Did the project work?
How much did the team accomplish?
Is the project likely to have an impact?
How well are engineering principles used?
How thoughtful and thorough was the team’s consideration of human practices?
How much of the work did the team do themselves and how much was done by others?
Did the team design a project based on synthetic biology and standard parts?
Are the functions and behaviors of the parts well-documented in the Registry?
What is PNP?
While the Lab and Math Teams are in charge of conducting experiments in the development of the project, the role of PNP is to support them by assessing the non-technical aspects that are just as important as purely getting results. In addition, we are responsible for connecting with the public to generate more interest and awareness in the field of synthetic biology.
Why is PNP important?
PNP is responsible for bridging the world of science to the rest of the global community. Science does not exist in isolation, rather it is a player within the larger local, national, and global communities. Within the science community, we are responsible for informing stakeholders (those who are directly affected by our project) about the work being done and evaluate the logistical executions of how to implement the project commercially. Together, this is what it means to go “beyond the bench” (this phrase has been used to describe PNP in the past, however without a further explanation it can be an unhelpful and confusing description).
PNP and the Lab Team work hand-in-hand. In every step of the project, teams should be considering the policy and practice side of things. This includes:
Before beginning an experiment to evaluate any potential work
Every time you go to work on your project throughout the year, especially as the project develops throughout the build season
Following the completion of the project as you release it into the world
When you come back and refine your project to evaluate the reaction and reception from the public
PNP Medal Criteria
Each subteam has their own aspect of the medal criteria that they focus on throughout the year. PNP focuses on (but is not strictly limited to) the following criteria:

Invitation to the debate
The following description was posted on the facebook event page of the debate, on the CRI forum, and sent to all other french iGEM teams:
Imagine a world where you can create bacteria and plants that purify water from heavy metal, that fertilize arid land, that detect cancer.
Synthetic biology has made all of that possible.
Now imagine a world where these genetically modified organisms can be created, but also actually used (to be used they need to come out from their confinement in the lab, and into the environment).
To some people, this world is a dream come true, to others, its hell!
On Sunday the 16th of September, we are giving a voice to all citizens.
Students from all possible backgrounds (but no expert in synthetic biology) will have a passionate, enlightening, entertaining debate on the following motion: ""This house would allow environmental release of genetically modified bacteria for applications in the following fields: medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, energy, bioremediation""
Afterwards, the debate will be opened to the floor. We hope to have a very large audience, where all citizen, if they wish to, can express his/her opinion on the subject and on the debate they just saw.
This was followed by something called ""more on synthetic biology"

In this case, nanopore must accurately distinguish mutant sequences that contain different point mutations and accurately detect Product and Reference Cytidines.
After the sequencing we have successfully retrieved information about both the different mutant sequences and also their activities. After that, it was extremely important to compare the sequences and activities retrieved by CAT-Seq and the precise, low-throughput esterase mutant measurements we have performed earlier using standard methods. The proof of concept was a huge success, as activities determined by CAT-Seq closely followed the beforehand low-throughput measurements by standard methods.

Gifu,2017,Team:Gifu#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," change the amount of expressed protein. It is mentioned that Terminator region activities relative to that of the PGK1 standard terminator ranged from 0.036 to 2.52, with a mean of 0.87. As the terminators effect on the amount of mRNA, selection of appropriate terminators is indispensable for all iGEM teams that would like to use yeast in their project. It is feasible to regulate the final amount of protein utilizing inducible or constitutive promoters. We chose RPL15A, PGK1 and Glc1 to assay this phenomenon on ADH1 promoter.
Plasmid construction
Here are ideal plasmids of this project and brief explanations below. As shuttle vector of the plasmid, we used pESC-LEU. For submission to HQ, we used pSB1C3 backbone.
plasmid 1
ADH1 promoter is one of the standard promoters for yeast and has function constitutively. HXT3 promoter is anticipated to be regulated by [GAR+] prion and repressed strongly according to this article . When the concentration of lactic acid is relatively low, the prion makes its conformation [gar-]. Then naturally coding regions of SF-GFP and antisense-GFP are transcribed. As a result, mRNA of GFP is expected to be combined with mRNA of antisense-GFP. When the concentration of lactic acid is relatively high, the prion makes its conformation [GAR+]. Under this condition HXT3 promoter is inhibited and the final amount of mRNA of antisense-GFP is decreased. Thus, mRNA of GFP is not combined with mRNA of anti- GFP. Utilizing this system, lactic acid is apparently anticipated to control the expression of GFP and be a trigger of starting translation of GFP protein.
plasmid 2
This plasmid is for assaying the strength of HXT3 promoter. Our team planned to quantify mRNA of antisense-SFGFP by Real-time PCR. To normalize the data, we also decided to measure the amount of PDA1. In addition, to confirm the repression of HXT3 promoter by lactic acid, we decided to prepare suspension of yeast of YPD medium and suspension of YPD medium adding 0.625% lactic acid. Comparing with the control, the function of HXT3 promoter in yeast with lactic acid is expected to be decreased. As a terminator of this part, we used RPL15A terminator. RPL15A terminator is one of the strongest terminators.

Transcriptional Cascade
Transcriptional cascades can be seen as temporal programs of successive gene expression [ 4 ]. These gene configurations (or circuits) have the capability to integrate signals and trigger events after a delay from the initial detection event. As described before, such characteristic is needed in our project; therefore we considered two approaches based on transcriptional cascades. After some preliminary analysis, we chose to develop the approach termed negative synthetic transcriptional cascade.
Preliminary approaches
Negative transcriptional cascade
Based on the work of Hooshangi S et al 2005 [ 4 ] and the project requirements, the scheme was proposed.
Protein 1 starts the circuit, activating (or repressing the repressor of) the promoter of gene 2, for proof of concept gene 1 can be changed to a signal molecule. The concentration of protein 2 will increase and achieve the threshold concentration to repress gene 3. At this point... more .
Positive transcriptional cascade
Based on the book of Uri Alone [ 5 ] and the project requirements, the scheme was proposed.
Protein 1 starts the circuit activating the promoter of gene 2, for proof of concept gene 1 can be changed for a signal molecule. The concentration of protein 2 will increase and achieve the threshold concentration to induce gene 3. As the concentration of protein 3 increases,.... more .
Synthetic Transcriptional Cascade: The plan
Comparing advantages and disadvantages of both approaches (mainly the leakage problems), the negative synthetic transcriptional cascade was selected. After addition of IPTG, the repressor LacI will change its configuration; this will allow the transcription of TetR in plasmid 2. This molecule will act as repressor of the promoter Ptet in plasmid 2, this stops the production of the repressor cI and red fluorescent protein (RFP). After these events,.... more .

After the meeting with our member in Finland, Aalto team send us patents and patents applications so we could double check the analysis that previously the Aalto team did. We investigated about the regulation of the European Union patents, the duration, and their effects. After that, we send them our conclusions so they could apply their knowledge and ours on their wiki.
Tec-Guadalajara
Unfortunately, the iGEM Tec-Guadalajara team got their kit late because of border control issues, plus it also it seemed to be damaged. This problem did not allow them to perform the necessary transformation required to meet the bronze criteria. But this didn't stop them from doing their project; the collaboration between our teams, involved us to do two of the transformations that they needed, the first was BBa_I744204 -plate 3, well 20F-, in E. Coli BL21B3. The second part, BBa_K137055 -plate 4, well 13I-, was also transformed in E. Coli BL21B3. There was no inconvenience in the transformation protocol, and the procedure was successful, with the expression of the corresponding proteins that Tec-Guadalajara needed for their transformation. On October 24th, both transformed bacteria were shipped through DHL from Chihuahua City to Guadalajara.
Tec-CEM
In order to promote and reinforce the relationship with our brother team Tec-CEM, we asked for their help to characterize one of our BioBricks, (T7 promoter + RBS) + (epsE) + (T1 terminator), which can be found here as a whole [BBa_K2471002] , the individual parts being (BBa_K525998) + (BBa_K143032) + (BBa_B0010). This BioBrick is an essential part of our project, as its expression confers the capacity of inhibit the virulence factor of motility in the bacteria.  The collaboration developed as follows: On October 15th, we shipped the BioBrick to Tec-CEM, which they characterized by SDS-PAGE. Once the results were obtained, they shared them with us, completing a successful collaboration. You can review the results on our bronze results section.

Tec-Chihuahua,2017,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"ajara and Tec-CEM, working together in the development of an experiment manual validated by SEP (Secretaria de Educación Pública) containing 30 scientific experiments. Our main objective was to motivate and involve elementary schools’ children in scientific subjects. The experiments were divided into three blocks by complexity: easy level experiments were planned for to 6-8-year-old children, intermediate level for 9-11 years and finally the expert level for 12-13 year-olds.
The three teams planned to present one experiment of each section in three different elementary schools. The team attempted to explain the theoretical framework of the experiment widely and performed step by step each experiment together with the children to ensure the correct realization of each experiment. At the end of the experiments, a survey and some general questions about the experiments were asked to the children to know the quality of the information given by the team and the satisfaction level of the children while they carried the experiments out.
Meetup
The ""Mexican Teams Meetup"" had several activities. Amongst them was a collaboration in Human Practices, which laid the foundations for the Laboratory Handbook. This handbook is a guide that aims to introduce children from elementary school to science, and a presentation of the progress that we had until that point regarding our project. It also helped us see our areas of opportunity, which consequently allowed us to improve and be able to be more competitive in the Giant Jamboree. Although these were the technical aspects of the meeting, it was thanks to this meetup that we were able to establish relationships with the members of the various teams that participated. This experience has not only helped us with areas concerning the project but has also made the iGEM community of Mexico closer and stronger than ever.
IONIS PARIS
The IONIS Paris team contacted us for a team collaboration. We worked together for several months, mainly focusing in Human Practices and Modeling. The IONIS modeling team helped us to visualize one of our enzymes: “yhjH,” based on bibliography and the optimal enzyme conditions, they managed to simulate it in silico, helping us to establish and assume model parameters and enzyme behavior, among other things. Our teams also managed to collaborate in Human Practices. Based on the IONIS human practices project, some of our team members contacted winegrowers and oenologists to interview them about how climate change has affected their vineyards. The information gathered was used for a comparative framework between French and Mexican wine production actual adversities. During the meetings with the experts, we also discussed the IONIS team proposal, so they could let them know their points of view"

We prepared three X-Gal plates (of LB + Amp).
We transformed the two ligations (1 ul) in TOP10 E. coli.
We plated A6 transformed bacteria + SOC in a non-X-Gal plate.
We plated A5 transformed bacteria + SOC in two X-Gal plates: we plated 100 ul in the first plate (called A5) and 200 ul in the second plate (called A5bis) in order to check for blue colonies the following day.
We also plated 20 ul of E0240 glycerol stock in the third prepared X-Gal plate, in order to have a negative control to check if TOP10 E. coli actually don't express beta-galactosidase.
Expected results:
Plates A5 and A5bis should show blue colonies;
Plate E0240 should remain colorless.

June, 18th
Plate results:
A5 showed blue colonies;
A5bis showed blue colonies;
E0240 did not show any blue colony.
So, we can say that TOP10 E. coli don't express any beta-galactosidase and our lacZ gene works!

Blue colonies for A5bis X-Gal overnight plate
Normal-coloured colonies for E0240 X-Gal overnight plate - negative control
We picked a blue colony from A5bis plate and infected 5 ml of LB + Amp. We incubated the inoculum overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm.
We decided to perform the X-Gal test on A3, which is the promoterless RBS-lacZ-TT in pSB1AK3:

Meanwhile, we did more education and public engagement work with our application.( click here to see detail )
Yueliangwan Primary School Education:
Background
Our PI recommended our applet to some teachers and friends. A teacher from Yueliangwan Primary School         subscribed our project and called us that because synthetic biology belongs to a new concept with great potential, he wanted to invite us to their primary school to give a popularization about cockroaches and synthetic biology, so that the students can contact with the new concept as soon as possible.
Procedure
At 4:15 pm on the same day, the students of the Yueliangwan primary school started the club activities. At this time, we started our science in the multi-purpose conference hall to the students interested in biology.
First of all, we gave students a better way to learn about cockroaches’ habits and how to eliminate them in their daily lives. After that, we invited several students to the podium to have a try to build the design of the model we designed.
At the same time as they experienced, we distributed the SPACESHIP E.coli brochure for synthetic biology designed by OUC-China, so that the students from Yueliangwan Primary School read it first, guided by our team members.
Then we will carry out the science of synthetic biology for the contents of the brochure. Finally, we designed a prize-winning Q&A session to give students a deeper memory of this science.
Feedback:
1. When they tried making our parts of Green Ground together, they did not know how to finish it, which showed that the box we designed was not reasonable enough and did need improvement.
2. When we were giving a popularization about synthetic biology, the primary school students didn’t have a clear understanding, even though we used a comic book. We had a conclusion that we need to not only give a popularization more logically, but also use some examples that close to them to help them associate synthetic biology with their daily lives.
After this education, we found two problems including our project itself and ways of science popularization. Receiving their feedbacks, we redesigned our model to make it easier to build. In addition, we are considering using a more logical and comprehensive way to give a talk with the examples of our daily lives.

Y.lipolytica is a non-traditional yeast with great industrial application potential. It is currently used in the production of single-cell proteins, single-cell lipids and organic acids, and has great potential in the production and application of terpenoids. Compared with other common industrial microorganisms, Yarrowia.lipolytica has several advantages: 1) the genome-wide sequence of many strains; 2) high biomass, satisfying GRAS; 3) extensive carbon source spectrum, capable of The use of hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbon sources, no significant inhibition of glucose metabolism; 4) strong protein expression, low glycosylation level, can carry out intracellular and extracellular expression and surface display; 5) rapid metabolic rate, acetyl-CoA Strong synthetic ability; 5) It has been proven to be useful in the production of a variety of fine chemicals, especially functional fatty acids or acetyl-CoA derivatives, which has great application prospects. Acetyl-CoA is the synthetic precursor of terpenoids. Currently, two products, DHA and EPA, produced by Yarrowia.lipolytica engineering bacteria have been commercialized. And more products are moving towards industrial production scale, such as the production of acetyl-CoA-derived carotene is currently the highest level in the eukaryotic system. Y.lipolytica is also used in the expression of modified enzymes in the synthesis of perfumes for whole cell catalysis, such as for better conversion and selectivity in the hydroxylation of the outer cyclomethyl; and for the catalysis of limonene Perillate. Furthermore, Yarrowia.lipolytica has fat granules which can regulate the distribution of fat-soluble steroidal compounds in cells, thereby reducing the toxicity of products to cells and increasing yield. Therefore, Yarrowia.lipolytica exhibits strong industrial biotechnology application potential and potential as a scorpion spice chassis cell.
In addition, in eukaryotes, intracellular cells control the interaction of metabolic reactions and metabolites through compartmentalized membrane organelles, which can isolate toxic metabolites, direct the enzymatic reaction, and ensure a suitable microenvironment for enzymatic reactions. Such as Ph, redox state. Studies have shown that by targeting the hospital pathway to peroxisomes or mitochondria, the yield of the target product can be significantly increased, and the accumulation of intermediates or by-products can be reduced.

The whole expression is based on the usage in E. coli, so the sequence of the subtilisin E gene from a wild type Bacillus subtilis was optimized for E. coli codon usage. The sequence was partly ordered from IDT ( BBa_K2020001 + BBa_B0010 ) and then cloned into BBa_J04500 , a protein expression backbone, which already carries the LacI promoter BBa_R0010 and the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 . Afterwards, a mutation in the active site of the enzyme was introduced by performing site-directed mutagenesis (SDM). The codon AGC of serine221 was substituted with TAC, which codes for tyrosine, so serine was exchanged against tyrosine in the catalytic triade of the enzyme. We were not able to exactly detect the expression of the modified proteases via SDS gel, so we proceeded by executing a skim milk assay on agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotics. Therefore, we streaked out the cells containing the modified expression systems on these plates and incubated at 30°C for three days.
Figure 6: Skim milk plates assay. Cells producing the native protease (picture A-C, left) in comparison to either cells containing the empty backbone (picture A, right) or cells carrying the SDM 3-modified (picture B, right) and the SDM 1-modified expression system (picture C, right) after incubation for 3 days at 30°C.
Neither the empty backbone nor the SDM 1 modified expression system did seem to cause a proteolytic activity. A clearance and therefore a proteolytic activity could only be observed for the native protease (as demonstrated in the section of BioBrick K2020002 ). By demonstrating that this modification doesn’t result in a clearance of the skim milk plates, we were now able to prove that serine is essential for the proteolytic activity of the protease and that exchanging it would inactivate the enzyme. Hence, we demonstrated that exchanging serine against a photo-labile, non-canonical amino acid will inactivate subtilisin E and therefore proved the principle of our project. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

In China, for example, about 75 percent of the population (or 1.1 billion people) are without access to unpolluted drinking water, according to standards from China[6]. And our university, Lanzhou University, located on northwestern China, where lacking water especially. What's worse, water pollution is also serious including heavy metal contaminants.
Heavy metal detecting
1. Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, AAS
  Once other particles or photons with appropriate energy are running into an atom, the electron of the atom will perform the absorption transition, and the photons will be taken up. Different atoms have their specific corresponding photons, which mean they all have their own absorption spectrum. According to this phenomenon, people have created AAS to detect specific atom.
  To perform AAS to detect heavy metal ions quantitatively, an atomic absorption spectrometer is required, which is usually 50,000 to 90,000 dollars.
Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, AAS
2. Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry, AFS
  After the atom absorbed the photons, if the energy together with the photons is being released out, then we can detect its own AFS. The fluorescence intensity varies directly as the number of the atom.
  Similar to AAS, we need an AFSer to analyze AFS to detect heavy metal ions quantitatively. AFS is more accurate and sensitive than ASS, which means it’s more expensive than ASS. An AFSer may be up to 300,000 dollars.
Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry, AFS
3. Oscilloscopic polarography
  Also called as single sweep polarography. It is a method that can obtain the polarogram quickly and accurately. In order to accomplish it, a serrated pulse voltage should be added at the electrodes promptly during the late of the growth of the mercury drop on electrode. Thus, we are able to obtain a polarogram in several seconds.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the DTU iGEM 2015 has given me insight into the field of synthetic biology from both a theoretical and practical point of view. I had a good introduction to the lab work and the methods used such as PCR, gel electrophoresis, DNA purification... After a week of practice, I followed some protocols and did experiments by myself and independently, from which I experienced the way of thinking while in the lab. In dry lab I have practised reading scientific articles and learned how to design optimized oligos for the MAGE-protocol.
Besides the biological part of iGEM I have also been introduced to fund-raising and wiki-design, which were also instructive.
Although it was tough some days, meeting early in the morning and going to the lab, I think we had a good team-working ethic and were also able to do other things and enjoy each other’s company though we are all not the same age.” Nicolai 
“For me, working with the DTU iGEM team has been a great opportunity to experience the inner workings of a research project. It has been incredibly inspiring to be able to follow the entire journey, from the original idea, through hours of work, and ending up at the finished project. Through working in the lab I've discovered new methods and gained a feeling of independence in applying them. The team have all been immensely warm, welcoming and willing to answer my many, many questions.” Thea
 
They shared also their reflections about the project after summer holidays and experience while giving a lecture to their friends and other school mates at their high school. 
""When we came back to school after the summer holidays, some of our stories fit the ones of our classmates. We, too, had spent time on beaches and with friends. But one part of our vacation stood out; the time we’d used in the lab, feverishly pipetting. We decided to do a presentation and defend our decision to spend a few weeks away from the sun.
Instead of trying to explain the larger strokes of the project to a classroom of tired high-school students, we chose to focus on a couple of smaller steps that we have been involved in. Firstly, the knockout of the mutS gene. Even though it had proved to be horribly difficult in the lab, merely explaining it was no problem. Especially since our audience were no usual high school students. They had been working closely with biotechnology since they, way back in the seventh grade, chose that as their focus. While the concepts of antibiotics and resistance markers hardly needed explaining, the method of homologous recombination was new to most. Then"
Tuebingen,2016,Team:Tuebingen#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," regarding the absence of security concerns. In the case of success with the Lactobacillus, we would have tested our system with fructose-intolerant yeast, which has the same safety properties as E. coli and L. johnsonii. We do not plan to experiment with any other organisms. Our project is intended to be used in the laboratory. We are working at an S1 laboratory, which means there are several methods and guidelines to ensure the safety of researchers and the environment, but it limits research to well known and nonhazardous species.
What is the goal of the project? What will the engineered organisms do?
The goal is to make the first step to fighting fructose intolerance. The engineered Lactobacillus will be able to uptake great amount of fructose, thereby reducing the fructose level of the surrounding. To accomplish that, we will overexpress the phosphofructokinase to allow a faster degradation of fructose. Glucose as a prime energy source of the cell will be sealed off by knocking out the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, thus leaving the Lactobacillus dependent on fructose. Transporters for sucrose and fructose will be overexpressed to ensure the energy supply of the cells and to drain the surrounding from all fructose.
What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks? Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
All organisms we are using in our project are very well characterized and not known to pose any risk or danger to humans or the environment. This also applies to the BioBricks used in our system. According to the German Gene Technology Law,  the bacteria, yeast, and recombinant DNA components are classified as S1 according to the German Gene Technology Law (GenTG). Our experiments are conducted under S1 conditions, which implies a lot of safety features. These conditions include the usual safety features of wearing rubber gloves and laboratory coats, sterilizing waste, regularly disinfecting the workspace, etc. The BioBricks designed by our team are not found toxic or dangerous by any means. None of the parts we use are known to have any negative or harmful effect on humans or other organisms.
How would your project be used in the real world?
Our project could be used for probiotics: A patient with fructose intolerance could take up the lactobacillus via a probiotic product (e.g. a yogurt) together with a"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!"

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," introduction to the theory and advice on what to do and what to avoid. After this preliminary evaluation, all data were accumulated and discussed in the weekly team meeting, at which our two instructors Andreas and Volker (both PhD students at the lab of Prof. Skerra) were present to reflect on our project. Here we enumerate the specific tasks as well as the student(s) who performed them in order to allow the judges to directly contact the student responsible for a topic of interest.
Protein Production and Purification
As we produced, purified, conjugated, and analyzed many different protein samples, several team members were involved, including Niklas, Jan and Julian. Shaker flask productions were conducted independently of other lab members; for fermentation (which turned out to be a somewhat more difficult than explained in lectures), one of our instuctors had an eye on the whole production. Purification with normal columns was performed independently; for those involving the Äkta purifier, a lab member supervised our handling for the first 3 to 5 chromatographies.
Molecular Cloning
In the first week, we received an introduction to molecular cloning. Afterwards, we worked independently of our instructors and only asked them from time to time whenever a problem occurred. The gene design for all BioBricks was conceptualized by a student member (often Clemens or Christoph) and then reviewed by our instructor Volker.
Western Blot
All Western Blots were done by Luisa, and she received an introduction to blotting and staining from Fabian Rodewald and Christian Deuschle.
Mass spectrometric measurements
The correctness of recombinant proteins before and after conjugation was analyzed by ESI-TOF mass spectrometry. Samples were prepared by student members of the team, the actual measurement was performed by a technical assistant (which is also true for PhD students).
Determination of mRNA levels with RT-q-PCR
To further characterize the expression of the different receptor constructs our team wanted to take a closer look at the respective mRNA levels. In order to do so we asked Professor Dr. Pfaffl for help, since he is one of the leading experts for quantitative PCR. Together with him we were able to find the right approach to solving our problem. We want to thank Professor Dr. Pfaffl for his advice and for supplying the lab space for conducting our experiments. We also want to thank one of his PhD students, Dominik Buschmann, for helping us with the experiments and the analysis of the gathered data.

On Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, we sorted      out the male mosquitos (cannot suck blood) in both pupal      and adult stage. The pupae are sexed by size (females are      larger) and adults are sexed by antenna (males have fuzzy      antennae while females do not)[insert picture] We spend      countless hours in the cold room sorting adult and pupal      mosquitoes because the cold prevents mosquitoes from      escaping.
Keratinocyte Experiments
This week we conducted an experiment using smaller      bacterial MOIs to determine if the high MOI was the reason      that gentamicin was ineffectual. All four bacterial      strains were plated at MOIs that do not exceed 10. The      following day there was no evidence of bacterial growth!      Thus, when the new keratinocytes are received this      concentration of gentamicin can be utilized in the      experimental procedure.
Community Outreach
We arranged an event scheduled for October 1st with the      organization ThinkSTEAM that promotes science and math      education in girls. The program will consist of a      presentation introducing systems biology, research      overview, and laboratory demonstrations.
8/21-8/27
Keratinocyte Experiments
This week we obtained the flask from the Prince Lab      because they resolved the microplasma problem. I fed the      flasks and split them. However, when I came back to the      lab after the weekend there were fungi growing in the      flasks. I checked the incubators and there is a warning      that filters need to be replaced, which may explain the      contamination. I notified the laboratory of the      contamination issue. I contacted other laboratories in the      building to see if we can use incubators while waiting for      the incubators to be replaced and one laboratory agreed.

I was able to plate cells this week and conduct an      experiment to determine if E.Coli causes cell death.

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Notebook#Week4_-_-_TEXT.html," pBAd has a lower sensitivity to arabinose concentration and produces a linear response, while I746391 has a higher sensitivity to arabinose sensitivity and produces a digital response.  We could replace fluorescence with a biobricked pigment (once we've built one) as the output. We hope to characterize each of Cambridge 2007's amplifier constructs to determine their arabinose sensitivities, and we also hope to characterize output in terms of RPUs.  J69591, the standard promoter, is on pSB3k3, a low copy plasmid.  We would compare the activator constructs on high copy plasmids to J69591 on pSB3k3, and then move the constructs to pSB3k3 and compare again.
The Big Idea
We've decided that we are building an arabinose sensor; different concentrations of arabinose trigger different pigment output.  However, it would be brilliant if we could use an existing biosensor and use pigment as an output to show the compatibility of our output system.  Thus we are looking into the arsenic biosensor project (Edinburgh 2006).

Vio operon synthesis
As DNA2.0 very generously agreed to synthesise the whole violacein operon for us, we used the GeneDesigner program (also provided by DNA2.0) to design the operon that we wanted to synthesise (pictorial version of the sequence is shown below).
This could then by ligated into a registry vector to produce another coloured output BioBrick. The genes could also later be seperated, in particular the vioC which could then be put under a different promoter to create the logic gate system, while the remaining three genes would create yet another colour for our input system.

Running Bio-man
In April 23, 2017, in order to extend the publicity of Synthetic Biology and our iGEM project as well as to appeal to more population to pay a closer attention to the development of Synthetic Biology and biological method to desertification contro, Lanzhou iGem team in cooperation with the student union of Lanzhou University, the School of Life Science held a biological contest “Running Bio-man”.
Participants were expectedly waiting for the final contest to begin.
The award ceremony was held at the end of “Running Bio-man”.
We have drawn up both Written Test for preliminary contest and well-designed special games for the final. To make this contest be fairer for all participants, we have divided participants into two groups. One was for those who were major in Biology and another was for those who were not. Questions relating to Synthetic Biology were included in test papers for preliminary contest. During the fierce competition, participants’ interests in Synthetic Biology have been aroused. Students both major in Biology and other subjects have broadened their horizons and experienced the charm of this novel subject – Synthetic Biology.
Participants major in Biology
Participants major in other subjects
Written Test
Questions included in Written Test was extract from two sources, one of which is The Introduction To The Synthetic Biology, while another is those ingenious concepts found in those previous iGEM projects. Not only were those projects genuinely thought-provoking, but also participants’ ideas provided us with numerous inspirations.
Final
The final was held outdoors including games that combine sports with knowledge such as “Embrace Biology”, “Biological Memory Match” and “Biological Jumping Puzzles” etc. These games enable more undergraduates to feel the enjoyment from attending this contest. Additionally, even some students major in liberal arts were truly amazed by the fantastic Biological world.
The judge was announcing rules.
In the end, we awarded undergraduates prizes and certificates for their tremendous performance to appreciate all participants’ enthusiastic attendance, thus this contest was ended successfully.

I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and was fascinated by the iGEM program, which provides a platform for students to tackle important problems concerning the environment, health care, and new technology. This was why I decided to put together a multidisciplinary team of undergraduate students at Queen’s to participate in this year’s iGEM competition. I had tons of fun this summer planning and carrying out experiments for the project and working with students from other discipline. In my spare time, I like to play sports, guitar, and read.

Fig.4. Itai-Itai disease
Although it’s outbreak was in around 1912, we are still plagued by the same incidents constantly. Many paddy rice-growing areas in our country have been reported containing high levels of Cd heavy metal. As much as 10 percent of China's rice may be tainted by poisonous Cd. Local farmers are aware that eating the tainted rice they grow can make them sick, but they can't afford the cleaner rice sold in markets. Many other farm families have been kept in the dark about the heavy metal hazards due to a lack of information about pollution risks, so they continue eating toxic rice. To date, none of China's hospitals have officially recognized the weak leg condition common in some regions. But agriculture scientists have reluctantly called the phenomenon an early symptom of Itai-Itai disease.
As you can see above, Cd is widely used, hard to decay, thus little has been recycled. A considerable amount of Cd has become an uninvited guest in the chain of food, then leave us the chaos of human Cd diseases. So we decided to do something about it.

Design
The  enginerring bacteria designated as Nanocrystal E. coli Flocculation  Units seems feasible for our  purposes. Each of our units consists of three functional modules. The first one  is a detecting system that displays the presence of cadmium ions. The second  one is a recycling system that is able to synthesize the cadmium sulfide  nanocrystals to recycle ions. The last one is a flocculating system to increase  the flocculent activity of the bacteria containing cadmium sulfide nanocrystals  to easily collect the nanocrystals formed by the bacteria, as well as to avoid  secondary pollution. In addition to detecting and depleting cadmium from water,  we intended to make a fundamental change to convert this toxic contaminant to a  popular semiconductor-nanocrystal, which can be applied to devices for  photoelectronics and fluorescent probes in biological system.
Principles
As we know, some metal ions are toxic to bacterial  cells at all concentrations, therefore detoxification and resistance systems  that employ a variety of mechanisms to rid the cell of these potentially lethal  toxins have evolved employ. In most cases, the expression of such resistance  systems"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," MoDeL, we have already got a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in the next version of MoDeL. They are:
Enhance MoDeL to support description of intra-molecular reactions.
If it is applied, our software will become a useful tool to study the competition mechanism between intra-molecular and inter-molecular reactions.
More powerful substituents.
Only six kinds of substituents are far from meeting the demands of more accurate modeling and complex reaction mechanism. At present, substituent parts are limited to match only parts on one chain, and they are not allowed to represent a structure with more than one chains and trees. This needs the extension of definition of substituent parts by designing a unified format that can provide enough information.
Enable description of transcription and translation reactions.
Currently, transcription and translation are handled differently with other reactions. It is necessary to modify MoDeL to incorporate description of the two reactions.
Eliminate the inconsistencies.
In the current version of MoDeL, a bunch of inconsistencies exist. For example, the identifiers of compartments follow different restrictions from other global identifiers, and some components’ attributes are required to be a certain value. These problems make MoDeL not so elegant when looking at details. Work must be done to improve its consistency.
Be more independent.
Currently, some of MoDeL syntaxes are defined for specific algorithms of iGaME. Being a language for automatic modeling, cooperation with algorithm is reasonable. However, we believe there are too many compromises, thus causing a number of inconsistencies. In the next version, we are looking forward to a more independent MoDeL.
New functions of iGaME
iGaME grows together with MoDeL. In the one-year process of software development, we have achieved many of our goals, and found even more to be achieved. Looking ahead, we have the following wishes for iGaME.
User-friendly output for both professionals and amateurs.
It is far from enough to provide only dynamic curves as output because users may want more information about the biological system. Professionals may want to know the whole picture of reaction network, how do the species react with each other, and what influence do they have on the network. Amateurs may not be interested in curves, and they want to have a more straightforward concept of the network.
We are planning to give a graphic display of the reaction network by showing the change of species quantities dynamically. Users could understand the underlying reasons why a curve reaches its peak from the network. We also plan to show the topological structure of reactions in network. By connecting species with reactions, users can get a clear"

      Among the 77 respondents, about two thirds                                         of them would go on night shifts for                                         no less than 5 times every month on average (for age and job distribution, see                                         Supplementary Materials). What’s more, according to our interview, most of them                                         are not always work at night, which means they also have to always adjust their                                         sleeping time; this would easily lead to disordered circadian rhythm as well as                                         endocrine dyscrasia, where melatonin could be of great help on easing the                                         symptoms. As for the sleeping time after being on night shift, only about 30%                                         percent of people sleep more than 8 hours while 42% people sleep less than 5                                         hours, which shows the great impact on being on night shifts on sleep; moreover,                                         on a subjective evaluation of how being on night shifts affects their sleep, only 26% people think that night shifts affect their sleep a little or not at                                         all, which corresponds to the objective statistics.

Other methods might finally falling into the range of sheer                                         self-comfort. However, among the mostly used methods, approaches like “Watch TV”                                         and “Play on the phone” may disrupt sleep even more due to the shortwave light                                         the screens emit. Among the sleeping pill using individuals, only about one                                         third uses melatonin (age and job distribution could be find in the                                         Supplementary Material) while the others use traditional medicines.

Introduction
About 150 species of prokaryotes (well studied examples are cyanobacteria and halophilic archaea) in aquatic habitats have been shown to contain gas vesicles. These gas vesicles provide cells with bouyancy, there function is either to positioning the bacterium (in water) in order to get the right amount of oxygen or the right amount of light. Gas vesicles are made exclusively of proteins and contain gas. When gas vesicles are present in a cell, the overall density of that cell is lowered and the cell becomes bouyant.
We want to utilize this bouyancy for an application like for example separation of specific molecules or specific cells.
Gas vesicles are hollow proteinous organelles made of gvpA and gvpC (in cyanobacteria) and are permeable to gases and fills by diffusion. It is impermeable to water because of its hydrophobic inside. GvpA is a small 70AA long protein which forms a linear crystalline array of ribs to form the cylindrical shell and conical ends. GvpC is"

Approach
In order to engineer E. coli in the outer chamber to turn atmospheric CO2 into cellulose, the carbon first needs to be fixated by the bacteria. This requires the heterologous expression of the genes encoding the three enzymes RuBisCo, SBPase, and PRK. Furthermore, the implementation of the carboxysome from the cso operon can increase the levels of carbon fixation. The 2014 Bielefeld iGEM team had worked with a similar approach in their project. In an endeavour to optimise the carbon fixation process, our project build upon their experiences. The assembly of the individual parts into a composite part, BBa_K2449030 , was achieved, however, the cloning of these parts with a promoter proved problematic. Consequently, it was decided to prioritise other aspects of the project and therefore keep this part theoretical henceforth. For further information about our approach, read here.

Last but not least, we characterized the diadenylate cyclase (DAC) fromListeria monocytogenes. We successfully expressed tagged truncated DAC (catalytic domain) in E.coli and purified it.We analyzed its enzymatic kinetics and crystallized it. In the end, we are able to determine the structure (accomplished by DAC Team )
Reporter systems
For the Reporter Team, our final goal is to build a screening system, which allows quick identification and characterization of substances which are able to disturb c-di-AMP homeostasis in pathogenic bacteria. We believe the accomplished  screening system will be a great help for pharmaceutical industry worldwide in finding new and more effective antibiotics against Gram-positive pathogens, for which c-di-AMP homeostasis is crucial. To accomplish that goal, we first need a reporter system that can visualize different levels of c-di-AMP.
We used a few existing BioBricks and also created new ones to build up our system. At first, we attempted to construct a reporter system which is controlled by DarR, a transcriptional inhibitor identified in Mycobacterium smegmatis. This reporter system consists of three parts, namely a constitutively active promoter, the operator sequence DarR binds and a reporter gene cassette. c-di-AMP is able to stimulate the binding of DarR and its operator, acting as a co-inhibitor. Therefore the level of c-di-AMP can be visualized by the fluorescence of GFP: the higher the c-di-AMP level is, the lower the GFP fluorescence becomes. The reporter system is transformed into E.coli, which produces no endogens c-di-AMP. Therefore, we are able to test the system by providing the E.coli with c-di-AMP.
The second reporter system is based on the result of our Array Team. They found the gene ydaO, whose expression level is affected by the level of c-di-AMP. When the c-di-AMP level is low, the ydaO expression is up-regulated. We are able to identify a Riboswitch upstream of the ydaO open reading frame and used it in our second reporter system. The ydaO Riboswitch has two states: ""ON"" and ""OFF"". The switch between the two states depends on the presence of c"

Some unexpected amplification is seen for this PCR set. No contamination is observed in the NTCs (no template controls). The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
Week 10: July 1 - July 5
Our team reviewed primer design for our Golden Gate Assembly with emphasis on ensuring proper ligation of our products. This involved matching melting temperatures, ensuring there were no palindromic sequences, and considering the other requirements. Primer design is integral to our overall project since we must successfully use Golden Gate Assembly to synthesize our parts. Much of our time has been spent towards this goal.
Week 11: July 8 - July 12
Both light and heavy ferritin chain gene sequences have arrived ( BBa_K1189019 , BBa_K1189020 ). We have transformed and miniprepped them and they are now ready as a template for the Golden Gate primers.
Also received this week were the redesigned primers for extracting β-lactamase from the pSB1A3 plasmid. These primers were used in three combinations to produce the β-lactamase gene by itself, the β-lactamase gene with a His-tag at the end and a β-lactamase gene with a flexible glycine linker ( BBa_K157013 ) fused to the N-terminus of the protein. The gels of these PCRs indicated that the experiment was successful (Figures 3 and 4).  These products were PCR purified in order to be used for future constructions.

Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the nickel affinty chromatography of the Tn5 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Nickel Affinity Chromatography. 8% SDS PAGE of Tn5 (expected size 53.3kDa). Lane 1 high range molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 post induction, lane 3 whole lysate, lane 4 cell debris, lane 5 clarified lysate, lane 6 flow through, lane 7 wash, lane 8 elution 1, lane 9 elution 2, lane 10 elution 3, lane 11 elution 4, lane 12 elution 5, lane 13 elution 6.
The nickel chromatography was not completely successful, but there is some purification of Tn5. The Tn5 did not completely bind to the nickel resin and was observed in the flowthrough (lane 6). It is recommended to further optimize the nickel chromatography to further reduce losses, and reduce contaminating proteins due to non-specific binding to the nickel resin (lane 8). However for our purposes, the losses were tolerated.

The plasmid was then digested with Eco RI and XbaI and ligated with the BBa_K081005 fragment.  This was transformed into E. coli Top10 and successful colonies were streaked and used for colony PCR to see if the ligation was successful.
PCR amplified PrsaA , a constitutive promoter in Caulobacter and Pxyl , an inducible promoter in Caulobacter.  We purified our PCR product ( protocol ), but we lost our DNA in the process ( Figure ).  We re-PCRed the two promoters ( Figure 4 ) and performed an ethanol precipitation DNA clean-up ( protocol ) instead and received a low concentration of DNA yield.  This product was digested with Eco RI and Pst HF and ligated into pSB1C3 that had been previously digested with Eco RI and Pst HF.  The ligations were transformed into E. coli Top10.
After realizing that the combination of esp and rsaA created a stop codon between the two parts of the gene, we decided to start from scratch on the plasmids containing those genes and the plasmid containing them together.  We ordered new primers that solved this issue.
We performed PCR from chromosomal DNA again using the new primers and ran them on a gel, showing that our fragments had been amplified ( Figure 5 ).
Week 4 June 19-25
We started the process of recreating esp and rsaA C-terminal from template DNA and new primers that would not create an in-frame stop codon.  Template DNA from colonies was used for PCR successfully. PCR products were then digested for insertion into pSB1C3 individually and together as a three part ligation.  Colony PCR of the transformation products showed successful individual insertions, but unsuccessful three-part ligation.  Overnights and plates of successfully transformed strains were made.  Digestions of previously made PCR products and minipreps of esp and rsaA were made and used in ligations with each other and blank plasmids, pSB1C3 and pMR10, that had previously been digested.  Insertions of esp PCR product into rsaA C-terminal containing pSB1C3 were the most successful.
The transformation of promoters PrsaA and Pxyl were successful.  We picked 2 colonies from each transformed promotor, inoculated overnight cultures, and Miniprepped them.  We then performed a test digest but concluded"
