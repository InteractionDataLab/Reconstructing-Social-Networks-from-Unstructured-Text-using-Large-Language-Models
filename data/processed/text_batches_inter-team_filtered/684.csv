NAU-CHINA,2016,Team:NAU-CHINA#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," have recruited new members to the 2017 NAU_CHINA iGEM team and bring new blood to the team.
2016 iGEM Meet-up
Time：August 8~14, 2016
Location：Tainan National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan
August 8 to August 14, 2016, four members of our team went to Taiwan to take part in Asia-Pacific Conference, held by Tainan National Cheng Kung University (NCKU_Tainan).
Altogether 20 teams from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan attended the 2016 iGEM Meet-Up, including Tsinghua, Fudan-YuFeng, Taiwan Jiaotong University(NCTU iGEM) and Mingdao iGEM 2016 .It is of great significance for the members of different teams communicate, understand and learn from each other and share their experiences of their own project and ideas.
In the morning and afternoon, team members of each team listened to others’ presentation, raised questions and held discussions. Noon time was assigned to watch poster exhibition and listen to poster presentations.
On one hand, we have learned more different ideas about similar projects; on the other hand, we had known in advance the contents of the topics that are not displayed, and focus on some projects what we were interested in.
“Experience workshop” was an interesting activity, during which experimental and modeling members of each team held “round table” meetings together, inviting experts, scholars and related biotechnology companies to discuss biotechnology and synthetic biology.

Individual graphs can be accessed here .     Because the critical point in kill-switch is “Holin-Antiholin” molecules, we ran simulation in different IPTG concentrations and to understand result easier we select the outputs as Holin and Antiholin. Since translation rate of endolysin is more than Holin and Antiholin we can assume that there will be enough endolysin to make cell lysis occur. Also from the graph above we can understand that endolysin will be in sufficient amount.
By the help of our model, we can conclude that when there is no IPTG molecule, cell lysis occur in 275 s.  However when there is 100000 IPTG molecules, cell needs 2290 s to lyse. As can be seen from graphs until a very high IPTG concentration like in the Run14, the increase in Holin can eventually cause lysis. As a result of our model we concluded that after an IPTG concentration of 700000 molecule cell lysis will not occur. We are not considering the generation time of cell in this model since it can later be used for different organisms. If we consider e.coli with a generation time of 20 min, even in the medium with IPTG of 100000 molecules, it will divide before it can lyse.
When IPTG concentration is 700000;

Sensivity Analysis
Since the challenging part of modelling is choice of parameters, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to see how much result of our model depends on parameters. By the help of those, the critical values to be measured through experiments can be understood easily.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#toolbox#analysing_-_-_TEXT.html," PrK is present, the expression of Sup35 seems to be increasedr. The affinity of PrK-aaRS to PrK seems to be stronger than to the endogenous amino acids, so the test protein is expressed with the non-canonical amino acid as planned.
Labeling of the Sup35 Test Protein
The labeling of the test protein was performed in a two-step reaction. The first step was the click chemistry reaction to label the PrK with Cyanin3-azide and the second step was the maleimide labeling of the cysteine with Cy5 maleimide. The click chemistry reaction of 50 nmol test protein in 100 µL reaction volume was performed in 1x PBS buffer containing 200 µM copper sulfate and 200µM TCEP to prevent aggregation of Sup35. To start the reaction 100 nmol of Cy3-azide and 200 µM freshly prepared sodium ascorbate were added and after that, the reaction was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After the incubation, the Cy3-labeled test protein was washed with maleimide labeling buffer (2x PBS and 8 M guanidine hydrochlorid) and concentrated down to 50 µL by centrifugal filters . To start the maleimide labeling reaction, 100 nmol of Cy5-aleimide were added to the test protein and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After this step the excess dye should be washed away by centrifugal filters or dialyses and the labeling was confirmed by a fluorescence scan of a SDS-PAGE containing the labeled sample and a negative control. The SDS-PAGE of our test protein before and after the labeling reaction is shown in Figure 5.
Furthermore, we wanted to detect the labeling efficiency through UV-VIS spectralphotometer, but the results indicate that a high excess of free Cy5 remains in the sample and the background was too high to perform FRET-measurements. To investigate the labeling efficiency and to get a fluorescence signal the labeling reaction and especially the last washing step needs to be improved to generate suitable test protein for the prion detection assay.

Overview
The plants root exudates contain TCA intermediates that can attract bacteria having the ability of chemotaxis.  Click here to learn more about root exudates. E.coli has five kinds of chemoreceptors, which interact with factors of the flagella that leads to chemotaxis . But E.coli doesn’t have specific chemotaxis towards some TCA intermediates while Pseudomonas putida has some McpS, like McfQ and McfR. We made a part BBa- containing the sequence of McfR, which detects succinate, malate and fumarate. Then we detected its chemotaxis towards malate and succinate, you can download our protocol which is based on the work 2011_Imperial_College_London had done before.click here to see the results. At last, we designed a model to mimic the movement pattern and predict the efficiency of the Prometheus E.coli.
Root exudates
Plants secrete both high- and low-molecular weight compounds from their roots, and these root exudates play an important role not only as nutrients for soil microbes but also as signal molecules in plant–microbe interactions (Sugiyama & Yazaki) . In the wild, legume plants establish symbiotic interactions with rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to obtain several nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate. The root exudates of legume plants contain organic acids, including some TCA intermediates, such as malate, succinate, citrate and fumarate. Especially, in response to phosphorus starvation, malonie, succinic, fumaric, malic, citric, and t-aconitic acids were detected in the root exudates (Ohwaki & Hirata, 1992) . Here, we design the Prometheus E.coli that responses to malate and succ"
NPU-China,2018,Team:NPU-China#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," all, we             did a science activity with the children in Mawu Primary School to introduce them to some basic biological             knowledge. To our surprise, the pupils have learned a lot about biological knowledge beforehand
Then we familiarized them with the idea of DNA Time Capsule. The children were full of curiosity about such             novel             technology, showing great interest and prodigious enthusiasm, irrespective of the fact that they didn't             completely             understand the principles of binary, quaternary and other coded message expertise as well as the details of             materials science involving micro-nano scales. The kids were remarkably willing to share their dreams and             write them             down on the sheets later adhered to the blackboard. We promised to the children to record their dreams with             DNA and             reserve for them. When they grow up, they shall come back to us and see their dreams at that time by             sequencing and             decoding.
Encoding the “dreams” into DNA
We converted Chinese characters into binary codes through ASCII and encoded them into DNA sequences. (link:             DNA             coding software). The sequence was synthesized and then constructed in pSB1C3 backbone and transformed into             E.coli.             Then we cultured the strain, extracted the plasmid and freeze-dried it into powder that is convenient for             long-term             preservation, which was then sealed in a vacuum glass vial and placed in the laboratory. Store the             information in a             freezer to achieve long-term stable storage
Being of a small molecule scale, DNA is difficult to display. In order to achieve a better effect and let             children             virtually see their ""DNA time capsule"", we used the website to simulate the secondary structure of these             single-stranded RNAs carrying the DNA sequences of those ""dreams"". (link:             http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html)             And then we printed them on the paper which were put into the photo frames. We brought these frames along             with the             souvenirs to these little “dreamers”
It was a sheer elation for the children to receive the presents. Taking one of the children's dream DNA             secondary             structure diagram as an example, we familiarized the kids with the whole process of transcoding their             dreams into             DNA and employing software to simulate. We introduced them, in more detail, to DNA storage technology and             gene             synthesis technology. Although they could not particularly understand the secondary structure of DNA, we do             believe             that they have gripped our aspiration for them to stick to their dreams. Together we pledged to open their             childhood            "

Our Activities
Activity 1: Textbook for high school students and undergraduate students with NGSS standards
People: One of the primary segments that we wanted to interact with was high school students , who would be the synthetic biologists of the future. We interviewed high school students across three school districts and realized that one of the reasons for a lack of interest in iGEM and research competitions was the way that the Campbell Biology book is structured. Thus, we set out to compile a textbook that was organized in a logical manner and covered interesting, relevant topics.
Design and Dialogue: We consulted teachers and students for their input on our book . Our team took the condensed primer from the 2017 UC San Diego team and dissected what had gone wrong. We noticed that one of the biggest problems was that the conversation was still very one-sided . We had not done adequate needs-finding the last time, and it reflected in that the textbook did not look professional, easy to read, or conveyed information in a useful manner to students.
After consulting Ms. Cora DaCosta Benoun, a biology teacher in Pleasanton Unified School District,  she emphasized that it would be a great idea if we could implement correctly. She commented that the reading checkpoints needed to accurately reflect the ideas being discussed; she also suggested that we design our book so that it could address a number of standards for NGSS ; as a result, we implemented thorough reading checkpoints and included a new section for all of our topics: a brief summary section that requires students to recall the"

We were fortunate to get valuable ideas concerning using our pumps in microfluidics. As a consequence, we adjusted the design of our devices and customized the control program software to support this field of application.
Some weeks later, we could return the favor:  Team Bielefeld was searching for different sources of water to test their genetically engineered machine. Therefore, we took two samples, one from a pont in a parc of our city and an additional sample from the famous warm sulfurous terrestrial spring, which was already the favourite place of Charlemagne the founder of Aachen.

The sunfire company was one of the reasons to go for our project. We first met them at the research center in Jülich, where they convinced us of their efficient technical conversion of CO2 and water to methanol and other fuels. With such an efficient area independent way to get a sustainable, high energy chemical, it was a natural decision to find a way to integrate it into the bioeconomy.

Cargill
Early in the project we visited a production plant of Cargill. They process around 2.000 tonnes of maize each day. Their main products are starch, sugar and a prestep of vitamin C. We got an excellent impression of the current starch industry in europe and globally, including resources, prices, products and customers. Though they were interested in our project, they did not want to sponsor us because of the difficult reputation of genetic engineering especially in the food industry. However, they helped us with all our questions regarding the starch industry throughout the project.

Education & Public Engagement
Synthetic biology is a new but fast developing field of biology. It is therefore unlikely that the public will have         thorough understanding of it. Even more, we chose to focus more on the younger generations when we tried to explore         the possible public engagement events for human practices as we believe that children show more interest in new ideas         while having great imagination and thoughts on synthetic biology can achieve. However, our biggest challenge here         is to explain synthetic biology in a much simpler concept to the children as we tend to use complex scientific terms         in which will be difficult to understand for people without biology background. To conquer this challenge, our first         step will be to teach them the concept of DNA.
1. Hong Kong Summer Science Party (Every Sunday from 23/07 to 20/08)
In the “Summer Science Party 2017” organized by the Hong Kong Science Park, we had arranged workshops introducing DNA         models and DNA extraction from strawberries. This activity aims to educate children about biology while acting as         a platform to converse with parents regarding to their opinions towards synthetic biology.
The target audience of this event is children from the age of 4 to 12. We hold the believe that we can ignite the interest         for biology to children at an early age through fun games. We therefore uses candies as a material to make 3D DNA         model which the children can bring it back home afterwards. Unlike the minipreps that we do in our lab, the DNA extraction         workshop only uses easy and accessible household objects such as meat tenderizer and ethanol so children can try         out the same experiment with different fruits to compare their DNA amount, imprinting them with first impression         and a growing interest for biology at the developmental age.
In parallel, we had also chatted with parents there about synthetic biology and the goal of our project. We were able         to receive instant feedbacks from them regarding to their understanding of synthetic biology and genetically modified         organisms. With more than "

Connecting
This year we do care the connection between other iGEM teams, especially with iGEM teams  in other country. We don't know about each other, and we have very less opportunity to talk so we are willing to know each other.
We helped iGEM Paris-Saclay, iGEM York, Virginia iGEM  with their international survey. We talked a lot on twitter. Skyping with iGEM york talked about the human practice and something about the project. We even get the badge from Virginia iGEM.

Help each other: pCusC, PpcoA sequencing and promoter test
Author：Tian Liu
1. Experimental Background：
iGEM encourages the communication between teams and help others. So, when we heard HUST-China has something wrong about their promoter, we decided to give a hand. The one problem they had is they tried many times but failed to sequence those promoters in pET28a, and the other is they put mRFP under the promoter to do a promoter test but didn’t get result. So we got pCusC & PpcoA promoters with mRFP from them.
2. Proposes:
2.1 pCusC & PpcoA promoters sequencing
2.2 pCusC & PpcoA promoters test
3. Materials and equipment:

Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," biosensor for detecting contaminants, such as hormones and medicines in surface water, a less specific concentration might be sufficient.
A method using quantitative measurement is preferred. This technique does not require the emitted light to be visible for the eye.
Our method seems to be preferable above other methods, because in the future we might also be able to locate the source of the contamination.
Applied
Change in social relevance to surface water contamination
End product must quantitatively measure light
Designing an end product able to safely detect contamination source has high potential

31/07/18 About Onno Epema
Onno Epema is Head of Laboratory of Inorganic analysis at Rijkswaterstaat. One of the tasks of Rijkswaterstaat is the control of surface water quality. Its multiple measuring stations use both chemical, as well as biological systems to examine water quality.
Insights
The presence of pharmaceutical waste products in water is a relevant issue.
Toxicity of compounds in water is currently measured using bioassays. These assays include daphnia, fish or bacteria.
Additional chemical analysis to bioassay analysis is required to specifically identify, and quantify the presence of the toxic compound.
Direct identification of compound class (e.g. functional groups, medicinal group, hormones etc.) would be a leap forward in identification efficiency in chemical analysis. Information obtained during chemical analysis is often complex, as there are tens of thousands of potential toxic compounds in the water.
Applied
DeTaXion could potentially replace the microtox assay, providing a method which can both detect the presence, and concentration of toxic pharmaceutical waste products.
Confirmation of the importance of our biosensors to detect multiple concentrations.
The end product should be able to detect compounds classes instead of one specific compound. This is possible with the expression of multiple modified Tar receptors, each with a specific ligand, such as hormones.

Introduction
The Anderson Promoters are a family of constitutive promoters with a range of different strengths. The J61002 backbone is especially useful as it provides RFP for colour screening.  However, we wanted more diversity, more choice. Therefore we built inducible Anderson Promoters by introducing a LacI binding site.
In this way, we wanted to provide a useful biobrick collection for our project and future teams. The library enables numerous biobrick combinations and allows flexible promoter choices. As the balance of transcription rates is essential for the metabolization of methanol and the accumulation of glycogen, the library ideally facilitates up- and down regulations. Furthermore, IPTG-induced gene expression makes sense when growing bacteria on a difficult substrate such as methanol.
Achievements
We measured successfully the strength variation of 14 different Anderson Promoters.
We showed that our promoters K15851xx show nearly no activity in absence of IPTG.
We discovered that the lacI binding site of part R0010 does not work behind a promoter of the Anderson library because they are not IPTG inducible.
We demonstrated a profound molecular strategy to establish a promoter library, which would be applicable with any other operator.
Molecular Design
The first step
was to transform each promoter from the kitplate and extract the promoters by PCR from purified plasmids. Therefore, we designed primers (A9W9 and XE3D) to extract and amplify the promoters, resulting in a 1143 bp long fragment that contains prefix, RBS, promoter, rfp and suffix. We had to apply a different reverse primer for J23115 due to a mutation. These fragments can then be digested with EcoRI and SpeI.

Unfortunately, when we plated these out, no serial dilutions were made, giving us lawns of bacteria. We thus had to isolate single colonies by restreaking, but also began to screen for successes using colony PCR to check the size of the genes (knockouts being smaller). We also ran more pkD-sgRNA-TolA minipreps on gels and submitted them for sequencing at the Ramaciotti Centre
Overexpression Team
Beginning Monday, we started screening last week's transformants from  for the presence of the alMGS or g3p inserts we wanted; this involved colony PCRs and submitting for sequencing. On Tuesday, we received 12 more GBLOCKs from IDT (for inducible or membrane-localised parts), which we PCR amplified, digested, and ligated into the BioBrick plasmids. We then transformed these, and pick'n'patched for single colonies which we could begin to screen.
Characterisation Team
On Friday, we tested out our FN-464 membrane dye under the confocol microscope. The images turned out beautifully! Unfortunately, we only imaged strains lacking any hypervesiculation modifications, as we only had 30 minutes of microscope time and merely wanted to check if the dye worked
Week 15: September 5 - September 11
CRISPR Team
This week was devoted to sorting out whether our Cas9 system actually was operation, and to do so we devised a series of tests. We induced the system and looked on an SDS-PAGE for extra bands; we compared the growth rate of the cells with or without added aTC (which would reactivate the system and cut the genome); the rate of growth would be proportional to the percentage of cells that had already been cut, as they would be immune to recutting). Results were inconclusive...
Overexpression Team
To start the week, we received sequencing results telling us that our alMGS insertions were, well, junk, as they came back with a sequence matching to nothing. We began to screen more and more colonies for their sizes using colony PCR and gels, but the bands came back in a range on inconsistent sizes - despite testing white colonies that should show no self-ligation. We concluded that the new backbone preparation we used was not working well, and, given how little time remained, we decided to step back to transforming using the iGEM-supplied linearised backbone. We then retransformed the most critical parts (ind"

Gas vessel
The vessel is a 1 liter flask with a rubber stopper. This is where the methane will be introduced to the system. The methane is injected with a syringe through the rubber stopper.
Figure 6: Reservoir and CO2 capturing flask.
Pump
Next part of the system is the pump. When deciding on what specific pump to use it was important to consider possible safety hazards. A membrane pump was chosen, because the area that is in contact with the gas does not consists of electrical parts. Electrical components can serve as a potential area for sparks and is therefore important to avoid. Another factor is that membrane pumps are cheap and are easily accessible. We modified pump's air input as shown on the picture below.
Figure 7: Original and modified input.
Valve
The last components are a valve that allows oxygen to enter the system and a flask containing calcium hydroxide. The valve is added because the bacteria requires oxygen to grow and to break down methane. Due to bacteria consumption of methane and oxygen the pressure is lowered in the system. In order to increase the difference in pressure, a carbon dioxide capture flask was introduced. What this does is lowering the pressure in the system compared to the atmospheric pressure. The air flows into the system, carrying the required oxygen for the reaction.

Team Stanford-Brown-RISD was based in the NASA Ames Research Center for the summer of 2018, and worked on developing habitats for Mars and the Moon through the use of fungal mycelium.
Transportation of material through space is a basic yet fundamental component of many of NASA’s goals and objectives. Whether this material is equipment needed to test for life on Mars or structures that allow for prolonged habitation, it must travel from earth to its planetary of lunar destination, thus incurring great economic and energetic costs. But what if it didn’t have to be transported from earth? What if it could be grown on planet? The Stanford-Brown-RISD iGEM team proposed to explore the use of fungal mycelium, the vegetative structure of fungi, as a light-weight, durable material that could be grown on planet using spores to create habitats and other necessary items. The team focused on developing a design for a habitat from mycelium as a proof of concept, and using synthetic biology to enhance the filtration and adhesion capabilities of the mycelium. The team further explored the implications and uses of these biodegradable, self-growing structures made of fungi on Earth.
Our overall project can be broken down into four sub-projects. These are characterized as the following: Mycelium Material & Habitat Development, Mycelium Glue Project, Mycelium Filter Project, and finally the Mission Architecture that ties everything together. Major accomplishments included selecting and growing fungi on promising substrates, designing prototype habitats and growing actual structures such as a human-rated stool, the production of functional biological glues, a filter the effectively removed copper from solution, and an overall proposed mission architecture informed by our model, lab results and integrated human practices."

For this purpose the same cells were stained with app. 10 µM A3C5-Fab that was coupled to the fluorescent dye Dy634-NHS and 100 µM of the chemical compound biotin-atto488. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 4°C, washed twice with PBS and analyzed using a FACSAria II flow cytometer (BD bioscience, voltages for fluorescence channels were all at 750 V).
For the channels FITC (biotin-atto488) and Dy634 (A3C5-Fab-Dy634, detected using a HeNe laser (633 nm) and a 660/20 band pass ﬁlter) the fluorescence signal was measured and mean values are given. The cells showed a homogeneious population in the FSC/SSC plot. The A3C5-Fab staining detected high signals up til a mean of over 4000 for the eMA-autotransporter dependent on the inducer concentration. For the same bacterial cells the binding of biotin-Atto488 could be confirmed as well. The single chain Avidin (scAvidin) cells showed absolutely no A3C5 signal but a low Biotin-Atto488 background signal that could be caused by biotin-importers that transport biotin into the cells or the slow diffusion into the periplasm of E. coli. In contrast the BAP-Receptor also shows a high surface presentation as seen in the A3C5 signal of nearly 4000 for the ""high"" induced sample. The elevated biotin-Atto488 is unexpected but could be explained by the weakened and partly permeable out membrane that does not stop the small-molecule dye from entering the periplasm.
Discussion: The autotransporter is working and can present small protein cargo on the bacterial surface
The performed experiment confirm the functionality of the device including the tetracyclin repressed promoter, the secretion into the bacterial periplasm as well as the presentation of the protein cargon on the bacterial outer membrane. In agreement with the expectation the 62 kDa big scAvidin with its extremely strong fold is too big in size for the autotransporter and can not be presented on the bacterial surface. In contrast the smaller BAP-NanoLuc (19 kDa for the NanoLuc) or the eMA (15 kDa) both can be efficiently presented on the surface. The enzymatic biotinylation of the Biotin Acceptor Peptide (BAP)"

Designing the space mission is an extremely important, yet complicated part of a NASA proposal. The term ""Mission Architecture"" refers to the overall structure of the mission - beginning with on-Earth preparations, and concluding after setup of our habitats at the destination planet. In this section, we'll go over these considerations chronologically, and emphasize how the different subprojects (glues, filters, etc.) fit into the overall mission plan.
I. Habitat Design
Beginning on Earth, the first task involves manufacturing the plastic shell for our habitats. Our habitat is designed as a three-layered plastic dome.
/>The outer layer is designed to hold H2O, which can provide some measure of temperature insulation (high specific heat) and radiation protection (due to the high hydrogen-composition, which interacts with harmful primary radiation, while producing less secondary radiation than compounds composed of heavier elements)1,2,3. The supply for the H2O layer will be drawn via melted subsurface ice water at the landing site.
The middle layer is designed to hold cyanobacteria, which can fix compressed carbon dioxide and molecular nitrogen to produce oxygen for our main biomass (the mycelia), as well as for our astronauts to breathe. In addition, these diazotrophic cyanobacteria can produce organic carbon and fixed (biologically usable) nitrogen. In some of our experiments, we show that additional nutrients for cyanobacteria growth can be provided by Martian regolith and small quantities of fertilizer brought from Earth. The light for photosynthesis passes through the topmost layer to reach the cyanobacterial layer.
The final layer is designed to hold the mycelia, which provide the structural integrity and additional radiation protection for the habitat. This mycelia can also be functionalized for several other purposes, which you will see in other sections: primarily MycoGlue (to assemble smaller objects), and Filtration (to provide clean water for astronauts).
Note that, between each layer are one-way valves allowing water to flow into the cyanobacteria layer, and cyanobacteria to flow into the mycelial layer"

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:
2014 MIT
2014 Heidelberg
2014 Tokyo Tech
Part Table
Please include a table of all the parts your team has made during your project on this page. Remember part characterization and measurement data must go on your team part pages on the Registry"

BBa_K1361000
Based on the concept that change of cell  motility by control of CheZ chemotaxis regulator could disturb pre-expressed  curli fiber structure, we assume that if the inducer occurs, in this case  acacia, CsgB protein will secrete into extracellular and act as nucleator to  recruit soluble CsgA monomer into amyloid fibres, and the transcription of CheZ  will be downgrade via cI-Plamda NOT gate. If induction condition disappears at  a certain point, suppression of CheZ will be discharged. As a result, cells  will be more moveable thus disturb or inhibit the establishment of curli  structure. And in our final device, the dynamic detection could achieve by  monitoring current change between two electrodes in the culture.
BBa_K1361001
This part contains the major subunit of  curli fiber CsgA and its nucleator CsgB, in which CsgA is constitutive  expression(a relatively weak promoter compared to BBa_K1361003) whereas CsgB is  under the control of T7 promotor. This part cannot functioning alone without  expression of CsgEFG genes in the same cell, for they coding the outer membrane  channel secrete system for CsgA and CsgB.
BBa_K1361002
This part contains the major subunit of  curli fiber CsgA and its nucleator CsgBtrunc, in which CsgA is constitutive  expression whereas CsgBtrunc is under the control of Pbad promotor. CsgBtrunc  is different from native CsgB for the deletion of C-terminal amino acid from  133 to 155 so that it cannot attach cell outer membrane. And CsgBtrunc itself  is highly aggregative in the culture. This part is designed for immediate  generation of large amount of curli fiber after adding the inducer. This part  cannot function alone without the expression of CsgEFG genes in the same cell,  for they coding the outer membrane channel"

First plasmid: High copy plasmid with encoded generator to express I-SceI meganucllease, BBa_K175041 :
Backbone: pSB1C3
Resistance: Chloramphenicol
Origin of Replication: modified pMB1 derived from pUC19
Second plasmid: High copy plasmid with encoded I-SceI restriction site, K175027 :
Backbone: pSB1AK3
Resistance: Ampicillin and Kanamycin
Origin of Replication: modified pMB1 derived from pUC19
Step 1
To mesure the efficiency of I-SceI from TUDelft parts, we proceeded in the same way as for the characterization of our own designs: we transformed two plasmids with different antibiotic resistances into NEB Turbo E.Coli strain.
The transformation was successful.
Step 2
We followed the following protocol:
Pick a colony and start a liquid culture with both antibiotic resistances (Amp and Cm).
Incubate at 37°C  until optical density (OD) reaches 0.5
Pellet and wash cells to remove Amp and Cm.
Re-dilute them in the same volume of LB.
From each of those two tubes, start two liquid cultures:
The first culture with Cm and w/o IPTG.
The second culture with Cm and IPTG.
Incubate overnight at 37°C
Step 3
Plate colonies from each tube on two different plates:
Selection with Cm and Amp.
Selection with Cm.
Results
To analyze data, we counted and compared the number of colonies on four plates corresponding to 4 conditions.
First, we compared the number of CFU formed by non-induced cells, plated with a single antibiotic and with both antibiotics. We expected that the plate with only Cm selection would have the biggest number of colonies. A smaller number would be on the plate with two antibiotics (Amp and Cm). It could be explained by the loss of the plasmid carrying Amp resistance.
Next, we compared the number of CFUs formed by the cells where we induced the I-SceI expression, plated with a single antibiotic and with both antibiotics. We expect that there would be much less colonies on the double antibiotic plate, because the Ampicillin carrying plasmid would be lost not only due to the absence of selection during growth (as for the first two cells), but also due to the digestion by the restriction enzyme.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

    Click here for a cleaner heat map:
heat map PDF
    We conduct a heat map analysis of the gene expression of mutant strain L.lactis WH101 and parent strain L.lactis NZ9000 in four cases. The heat map shows the degree of up-down-regulation of each gene, and 266 deferentially expressed genes are selected in the four cases according to the P value we set. Further analysis shows that there are 61 common deferential genes (Figure 3). We preliminarily concluded that the anti-acid mechanism of mutant L.lactis WH101 is related to these 61 common differential genes.
2. PCA analysis (Principle Component Analysis)
    We then perform PCA on the data of the 61 common deferential genes.
    Statistically, PCA is one of the most widely used data compression algorithms. In PCA, data is converted from the original coordinate system to the new coordinate system, which is determined by the data itself. When converting the coordinate system, the direction with the largest variance is taken as the direction of the coordinate axis, because the maximum variance of the data gives the most important information of the data. The first new axis selects the method with the largest variance in the original data, and the second new axis selects the direction orthogonal to the first new coordinate axis and the second largest variance. This process is repeated and the number of repetitions is the feature dimension of the original data.
    The specific code that converts the data into feature spaces that retain only the first N principal components is as follows:
from numpy import *
def loadDataSet(filename,delim='\t')
        fr=open(filename)
        stringArr=[line,strip().split(delim) for line in fr.readlines()]

There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.       An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question ""What is the meaning of my life?""      The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness,      or even a feeling of sacredness.
This will be a title
The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as """

During June, no regular team meetings were held. Most of our team took part in a practical course of our master program. However, we kept informed about the progress in the lab.
July
Week 1: AB, ME
MutB construct:
Restriction, purification, ligation and gel electrophoresis had to be repeated, but the results were again negative.
GlmS and BtuF constructs:
The synthesized constructs were cloned into the pBAD202 D-TOPO vector.  In contrast to the suggested protocol, we used only half of the amount of the vector. The transformation was performed according to protocol into TOP10 E. coli. The resulting colonies were transferred into liquid culture and incubated over night. From the grown cultures, plates for storage were prepared and plasmid preparations were done.
Week 2: AB, ME
MutB construct:
Due to the difficulties of ligating the two fragments of MutB, we tried a different approach and prepared fragments with overhangs by PCR using newly ordered primers. After gel electrophoresis and purification, the fragments were directly ligated.
BtuF construct:
To check if BtuF was correctly inserted into pBAD202 it was digested with SmaI. The gel after electrophoresis did not show any bands.
Week 3: ME, TS, TK, MS
MutB construct:
To find out if the ligation was successful, a PCR to recover the fragments was done with the respective primers.

Fionn explained our cellulose-degrading phage system, and the creation of biorefineries. He mentioned the possibility of producing food-related products, and asked Glenn and Murdo what reaction they had.
Murdo mentioned that we often have a simplistic view of biology, which meant that the engineering approach didn't always work. However, he suggested that having enzymes in close proximity, as opposed to a soup where things just bump into each other randomly, made a certain amount of logical sense. He suggested it might simply not work.
In principle, he said there were potential benefits, but also potential pitfalls.
Glenn said degrading cellulose sounds good if the cellulose is simply a waste product. However, he wondered what new waste products would be produced in the process, and whether it would involve new problems. This would have to be examined in a risk assessment.
Murdo noted that alien species often have an unexpected impact on the environment, and we have a bad track record of introducing problem organisms into new places. Avoiding this is an important issue for synthetic biology.
Yassen asked what questions the Church would have if biorefineries were actually implemented on a large scale.
Murdo mentioned the need for risk assessments. He drew upon his own experience as a scientist and said that scientists, while knee-deep in the actual work, often don't consider the broader implications of what they're doing, since they're concentrating on getting things working. They need to take a step back to consider whether the project is worthwhile, and what the risks and benefits are.
Glenn said he would want to know about the business plan and what the economic impacts would be.
Yassen asked if there would be immediate concerns.
Murdo was most worried about accidental or deliberate release of the organisms. He noted that ""killer genes"" designed to stop an organism surviving outside the lab don't always work. He noted the possibility for genetic exchange between the lab organisms and wild organisms.
Glenn suggested any such project would require a major public relations exercise. He noted people are also sensitised to words like ""E. coli"" and ""virus"".
Fionn asked about regulations.
Murdo was doubtful of self-regulation. He saw legislation at a Scottish level or even UK level as unlikely; rather, he saw legislation driven by the European Union as more plausible. But because the technology moves so quickly, legislation often is outdated.
Glenn said scientists don't like being regulated, that they have a natural aversion to it. But it is necessary.

Our team consists of 12 extraordinary teenagers and an instructor from Jinan Foreign Language School, also a knowledgeable professor from Shandong University. We’ve spent a whole summer together, and we‘ve all made a great contribution. This summer is really special to every iGEMer in JNFLS.
Han Chang
“I am an 11th-grade student at Jinan Foreign Language School, currently taking AP Chemistry and Biology courses. I am very eager to explore the mechanism of everything and using the knowledge to change the world. ‘Biology is the language of gods’, I often say so, ‘if we can utilize this language, the power of gods, our world can be unimaginably amazing.’ Holding this belief, I entered the gate of synthetic biology, and participated iGEM.”
He is the core of our team. As a leader, he needs to organize everything. He did the presentation about the result part, which is the trickiest one. He also did a lot of experiments. Meanwhile, he made the wiki of the experiments and results. He also took part in the human practice activities in the summer holiday.
Wang Sayuan
“I’m a cat person, I like everything about cats, of course, I have a cat too. Ed Sheeran is my favorite singer. I am also a huge fan of different cartoons. My interests in biology started at a hospital, I saw people get better after the treatments, also saw some hopeless patients used almost all kinds of drugs but could never get any better. At that moment, I finally understand the special meaning of biology — maybe I can use it to help others. Now I am trying, learning and hoping. I wish I can do something for medicine in the near future.”
She took responsibilities in the presentation of the background part, she also wrote the attribution and the information of team member（basically is the one you are reading right now）part on the wiki. And she also did lots of experiments during the holiday.

Collaborations
SoCal Meetup 2018
We organized a meet up in July that Team UC San Diego, Team Tec-Monterrey, and Team UC Davis attended. At the meet up, each team presented their project progress and received feedback from the other teams. Through this meet up, we were able to provide opportunities to troubleshoot, exchange contact information for future potential collaborations, and discuss with the North America iGEM Ambassador, Amy Chen.
Team UC San Diego
Team UC San Diego presented their project on an easily accessible cancer detection test. The main input they wanted related to their team logo. Through this meet up, UCSD was able to share information with UCD due to the shared project focus on biosensors.
Team Tec-Monterrey
Team Team-Monterrey presented their project on a proposed bacteria database. Because the team representatives were more focused on the collaborative aspect of  their project, the other teams were able to help them further understand the lab and research components. Team Tec-Monterrey was able to share their extensive lists of collaborations and the importance of their integrated practices. Team Tec-Monterrey collected water samples from various water sources in their region to test for chemicals, and educated people to spread awareness. After hearing about their integrated practices, we provided them with water samples from San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant. In turn, we based our Collaboration Post on this interaction to collect data on where our toxicant is prevalent globally. We were also inspired by their integrated practices to participate in a beach cleanup day where we shared our research with fellow volunteers.
Team UC Davis
Team UC Davis presented their project via Skype on physiological effects of toxins on Mammalian cells. Through this meet up, UCD was able to share information with UCSD  due to the shared biosensor topic between their projects.
Team Stockholm
Team Stockholm reached out to our team due to our shared project goal to degrade toxicants in water. We arranged a Skype meeting to discuss protocols, findings, and to exchange data. Team Stockholm shared information regarding micro"
Tokyo_Tech,2014,Team:Tokyo Tech#Policy and Practices test_-_-_TEXT.html," this, we thought of using E. coli in immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a recently developed treatment that can completely cure the allergy. You introduce allergen into the body in very small amounts, and by gradually increasing it, you can suppress the body′s hyper-allergic reaction. However, there are several defects in this treatment. You have to go to the hospital for treatment many times, and it takes three to five years for a complete recovery. By using E. coli, we tried to invent a faster and easier immunotherapy.
 
• Lie Detector
Fig. 6-1-2-3 Lie Detector Poster
In this project, we tried to make a lie detector by using E. coli. By putting Na+ channel in the flagellum motor, E. coli responds to the sodium ion contained in a liar′s sweat and starts running. If the E. coli moves, it comes in contact with lysozyme and the outer membrane dissolves. Then, ATP inside the E. coli is released to react with luciferase, producing a glow.
 
• Bank E.coli
Fig. 6-1-2-4 Bank E. coli Poster
We thought of making E. coli act as a bank by taking things in and out. We had two scenarios for this theme:
• Exchanging things between Bank E. coli and Consumer E. coli
• Making deposits and withdraws by a group of Bank E. coli
Other than these stories, recreating the bursting of the bubble economy with E. coli was also in the plan.
 
• Fertilizer
Fig. 6-1-2-5 Fertilizer Poster
Micronutrient fertilizer is very important to the growth of crops. However, more than 70% of the fertilizer goes unused in soil. Phosphorus included in the fertilizer becomes insoluble by binding with metals, such as aluminum and calcium. Since plants cannot absorb these immobilized phosphorus, the phosphorus accumulates in the soil. To solve this problem, we decided to use E. coli to degrade the immobilized phosphorus into phosphoric acid, which plants can absorb. After producing phosphoric acid, E. coli stores it in its body in a polymeric form. By collecting these E. coli and extracting the polymer, we can retrieve the phosphorus left in the soil.

Many visitors, especially those lacking a scientific background, reacted negatively to E. coli at first. However, by introducing the properties of E. coli, we were able to change their mind. On the Post-it"

Allopurinol is used in clinics to reduce the serum urate concentration, whose group is the negative control. Group B and C indicated that we established the HUA model successfully. Group D is the experiment group, which is of distinctive lower urate concentration compared to Group A. However, the group E has similar performance as Group D, which suggested E. coli Nissle 1917 itself has a ability to reduce the serum urate concentration, which is so surprising. We can't determine if our engineered pathway is working in vivo. But it's clear our engineered bacteria itself works. It may be related to the remodeling of the gut microbiome if a lot of bacteria were given by oral gavage (Figure 11c). Though no group diarrhea was found.

Future Work
To elongate the existence of engineered bacteria in the gut to make a better colonization for human beings and sustain the                     maximum and stable gene expression as much as possible, we decided to use the plasmid to express the                     gene instead of genome integrated expression to promote the protein production. And we planned to knock                     out the genes alr, dadX in E. coli Nissle 1917, based on the paper published by In Young Hwang et al.                     from National Univeristy of Singapore. Alr and dadX are responsible for turning D-type amino acids into                     L-type amino acids to form cell walls. The knockout of those two genes leads to the death of the bacteria.                     Then we planned to add alr gene into the plasmid backbone, to form a complementary pl"

UESTC-Software,2014,Team:UESTC-Software#Overview.html_-_-_TEXT.html," infection by integrating fragments of invading phage or plasmid DNA into the CRISPR locus as ‘spacers’. Phase 2: in the immunity phase, the bacterium uses this stored information to defend against invading pathogens by transcribing the locus and processing the resulting transcript to produce CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that guide effector nucleases to locate and cleave nucleic acids complementary to the spacer. First, tracrRNAs(trans-activating crRNA) hybridize to repeat regions of the pre-crRNA. Second, endogenous RNase III cleaves the hybridized crRNA-tracrRNA, and a second event removes the 5′ end of the spacer, yielding mature crRNAs that remain associated with the tracrRNA and Cas9. The complex cleaves complementary ‘protospacer’ sequences only if a PAM sequence is present [2].
Figure 1. Functioning of the type II CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria.[2]
Potential applications for CRISPR-Cas9
In bacteria and archaea, CRISPR-Cas systems provide immunity by incorporating fragments of invading phage and plasmid DNA into CRISPR loci and using the corresponding CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the degradation of homologous sequences [3]. Figure 2 shows  the potential applications for CRISPR-Cas9.The diverse potential applications of Cas9 range from targeted genome editing (via simplex and multiplex double-strand breaks and nicks) to targeted genome regulation (via tethering of epigenetic effector domains to either the Cas9 or sgRNA, and via competition with endogenous DNA binding factors) and possibly programmable genome reorganization and visualization. Cas9 might also be engineered to function as an RNA-guided recombinase, and via RNA tethers could serve as a scaffold for the assembly of multiprotein and nucleic acid complexes[2].
Figure 2 .The potential applications for CRISPR-Cas9.[2]
Background and significance for CRISPR-X
Although the CRISPR/Cas9/sgRNA system efficiently cleaves intracellular DNA at desired target sites, major concerns remain on potential “off-target"" cleavage that may occur throughout the whole genome. In order to improve CRISPR-Cas9 specificity for targeted genome editing and transcriptional control, we describe a bioinformatics tool “CRISPR-X"", which is a software developed for design of CRISPR sgRNA with high cutting rate and minimized off-target effects. This software consists of programs to perform a search for"

During our visit to Cardozo High School, located in Queens, three members of our team presented to an accelerated biology class. Spending two class periods, our members explained iGEM, research opportunities, and common misunderstandings of synthetic biology. As this was an accelerated high school biology class, the students were able to ask insightful questions. We approached these aspects by explaining the concepts of synthetic biology and the misunderstandings the public may have by holding an opening for a general discussion. We learned many school curriculums are not focused on all aspects of synthetic biology and often diminish all of its applications. Providing more examples than just GMO’s, the class was elated to learn about our project. Our presentation was beneficial to the students as we were contacted and thanked by the class teacher.

We appealed to a younger audience by changing our activity from last year which involved the “See DNA” kit from iGEM. While the kit produced interesting conversations with attendees, we wanted younger children to gravitate towards us, so we decided to hold interactive arts and crafts instead. We had the children make necklaces out of centrifuge tubes, colorful strings, colored water, and glitter. Although the children were younger than our typical audiences, we formulated a discussion along with their parents to address concerns that they had about synthetic biology. Another way we attracted attention in educating the public at this fair was by bringing along a parrot. Just like our cyanobacteria, the parrot (Gosha) is just as green and very friendly. Our table was filled with eager parents and children ready to learn from us. We learned that using interactive activities helps foster questions and discussions about synthetic biology. Additionally, using these activities, we can help explain biology, and more specifically, synthetic biology, in basic terms.
Freshman Orientation
We talked to the incoming freshman class and their parents about synthetic biology, what it entails, and how students can be involved in research and make a difference in their fields of interest. Specifically, we talked to them about what iGEM is, what past projects have done, and what our project entails this year. Many were interested in our research program and asked about the workings of synthetic biology and undergraduate-led research. We were also able to address many of the ethical concerns parents had. They left with a positive outlook on synthetic biology and its’ applications. We approached students by handing out iGEM flyers and were"
SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#K343006_-_-_TEXT.html," bacterial production of beta-carotene is lowered or that some of the beta-carotene has been metabolized in the cell, either to a non-measurable concentration of Retinal or some other metabolite. It is also a possibility that the retinal is exported out of the cells.
The spectra from the second run of samples again show large amounts of beta-carotene produced by the K274210 biobrick or absorbed form the media in the cells where the K274210 biobrick is absent.
The only sample displaying any changes form the first run on the HPLC is TOP10 containing both the K343006 and K274210 biobricks. In the spectrum higher amounts of cell metabolites are still being produced by the K274210 biobrick but also others are produced by the cell.    In this spectra the peak with a retention time of 3,969 is close to the retention time of retinal form the standards but when examining the spectrum of the peak it can be concluded that it is not a retinal peak.
In order to assess and quantify the results a standard dilution of beta-carotene and retinal was made and measured: 10 µM, 5 µM, 1 µM, 2 µM, 0,5 µM. The standard dilutions were also measured on the HPLC with the same injection volume and program as the samples. The resulting graphs are presented beneath
Figure 6: HPLC of standard dilutions of beta-carotene and retinal
When doing an HPLC analysis it is possible to quantify the amounts of the chemical compounds in the samples.
This is done by generating a standard curve with known dilutions of the chemical and recording the area under the peaks. The peak area correspond to the concentration of the chemical in the sample.
Then the area under the peaks is plotted on the y- axis, the know concentrations of the standards on the x-axis and the regression line is calculated.
Now it is possible to calculate unknown concentrations from samples using the regression line from the standard curves.
The results for our HPLC analysis can be seen beneath the text.
Figure 7: Standard curve of area under the HPLC peaks against beta-carotene and retinal concentration. Regression lines were made.
From the equations for the regression line it is possible to calculate the amount of beta-carotene produced by bacteria grown for 20 hours in LB media.

Trap and Track - Novel assay for digital chemotaxis detection
Although there is an abundant number of chemotaxis assays available            today, most of them were designed 40 to 50 years ago and almost            none provide a real time measurement without the use of fluorescence labeling.
The use of Porous Si (PSi) and oxidized PSi (PSiO2) matrices for biological            sensing is on the rise. So far various analytes such as DNA, proteins and            bacteria have been proven to be detectable on such matrices. The common            method to monitor the interaction of said analytes within the porous films            is reflective interferometric Fourier transform spectroscopy (RIFTS), as it            allows a real time measurement and output for the user.
We present the results of an early experiment for the detection of            chemotactic activity on the porous silicon films initially developed for bacterial detection.
This assay provides us with the means to digitally quantify chemotaxis -            meaning we have a clear distinction between an attractant response            (negative trend), repellent response (positive trend) and no response (zero trend).
The following graph presents only the chemotactic responses taken from 4            different experiments, The top 2 plots, in blue and in grey, represent a            repellent response. The yellow plot represents a negative control experiment            and the bottom red graph represents an attractant response.

Original attB/P site with specific primer pairs A and B is shown in Fig.4 c. Pair A used to detect original site, while pair B used to detect recombined site. qPCR test is conducted on each sample using both types of primer pairs, obtaining CtA and CtB. By assuming the amplification efficiency as 2, recombined attL/R sites rate can be calculated from CtA and CtB. For Bxb1 and TG1, the experiments were done with previous orthogonality plasmid which have all 5 attB/P sites. Error bars are shown(n=4; n=8 for Bxb1). Experiments were set up in E. coli TOP10 strain with transcriptional factors cultured at 37℃.
All of the integrase are able to catalyze the recombination reaction in our system. Among 5 integrases, phiBT1 shows the best feature of staying low and steady recombined attL/R rate before induction and reaching high rate after induced. phiBT1 is good enough for building sequential memory structures and being a basic memory device. Although phiC31 achieves low-rate recombination, but the induction can make an obvious difference. As a result, it is enough for us to use phiC31 as a memory device. Other integrases are difficult to control by inducing due to high leakage or other reasons. However, some integrases such as Bxb1 show good performance in other teams' system, so we think the result may be affected by the system we designed(two plasmid system) in this experiment.
Validation of the sequential memory structures
Overview
The key part of our project is the sequential memory structures, making validating this part the most important work. Unluckily, we are still working on this. In Fig.8, we show the plasmid we are working on.

iGEM Bootcamp @ University College London
Monday 15th June 2015
The UCL iGEM boot camp is a week long event designed to provide iGEM participants with a crash course in the skills necessary to compete in the iGEM competition.  This years boot camp was attended by team members from University College London's own 2015 undergraduate team along with team members from Birkbeck University and the community-run London Biohackspace laboratory.  The camp primarily consisted of a number of technical workshops designed to help iGEM newcomers (and a few grizzled veterans) develop essential iGEM lab skills such as biobrick design and construction along with bacterial culturing and transformation techniques.  Further workshops were also available on topics such as how computational modelling can lead to iGEM success, constructing your own spectrophotometer and how to build an award winning wiki (without having to stay up all night on wiki-freeze deadline day). Previous iGEM participants were on hand throughout the week to provide assistance as well as offer invaluable advice on how this years teams can excel in the iGEM competition (step 1:rob a bank).  The week concluded with a mini-jamboree in which each team presented their chosen project and current progress to the rest of the group in a format similar to the iGEM giant jamboree held in Boston at the end of the competition.

However, J23119 will not activate downstream functional gene when being inverted, thus, the inverting process causes a time lapse in alkali production. Meanwhile, although the concentration of J23119 toward acid production is decreasing, there are still parts of J23119 functioning. Accordingly, pH will tend to decrease slightly.
(4) When pH is lower than 5.0, after the time lapse, alkali production is activated, and production of Flp is led by P-asr promoter.
(5) When pH returns to the range of 5.0 to 7.0, p-asr promoter is repressed, and J23119 keeps conducting acid production.
(6) When pH increases and reaches around 7.0, p-atp2 is induced again, and the system will go through a time lapse similar to step (3). pH level keeps raising higher than 7.0.
(7) When pH is higher than 7.0, after time lapse in step (6), acid production is activated again, while production of Cre is controlled by P-atp2 promoter. The latter processes are similar to step (1).
Basing on processes above, the reaction equations are described as followed:

It also takes them much more time to purge it from the body: the half-life of lead in the adult human body is 1 month, but 10 months in a child’s.[4] Low-level exposure can be quite harmful: an increase in blood lead level from 10μg/dL to 20μg/dL is associated with an almost 3-point drop in IQ.[5] Lead has also been shown to inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation, a neural mechanism required for learning.[5]

Case Studies
According to the Blacksmith Institute’s 2010 report on the world’s worst pollution problems, lead is the world’s number one toxic threat with an estimated global impact of 18 to 22 million people, more than the population of Syria.[6] Lead has long been in use in numerous industries that manufacture products intended for consumption by average families. Famously, tetraethyl lead was added to gasoline (hence leaded gasoline) to improve its octane rating and to increase longevity of motor vehicle components, a practice that began in the United States in 1923, continued through until regulations saw implementation in the 1970s, finally ending with a zero-tolerance ban through the Clear Air Act in 1996.[7] A 1988 report to Congress by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry estimated that 68 million children had toxic exposure to lead from lead gasoline between 1927-1987.[7]
Other sources of lead include leaded paint, dust that gathers on lead products, and contaminated soil. Since lead cannot be absorbed through contact with skin, the metal must be consumed in some form for it to be toxic. Unfortunately, lead tastes sweet. This means that flaking lead paint or the dust that forms on vinyl blinds imported before 1997 might be consumed repeatedly. In fact, the United States Consumer Product Safety Condition found that if a child ingested dust from less than one square inch of blind a day for about 15 to 30 days they could have blood lead levels at or above 10μg/dL.[8]
Lead can usually only enter the body through ingestion, which is why pollution of drinking water supplies is"

The obtained results can be used to calculate the promoter strength at different induction levels of rhamnose in our model. In order to use the mathematical model previously constructed in the modeling section, it has to be fitted to GFPmut3 units/cell/second. Therefore, we set up a calibration curve with exactly the same settings as the fluorescent experiment in order to correlate fluorescence signal to units of GFPmut3 per cell.
Methodology
In this experiment, the strains ∆csgA – csgA- I13504 and ∆csgA – csgA strain were both induced with rhamnose at different concentrations. The different induction levels can be found in Table 1.
All conditions (ID 1 – 6) were carried out in triplicates for accurate statistical analysis of the data. The different cultures were grown and induced in a 96-well plate. The OD600 and the fluorescence signal was recorded with a plate reader during an 18-hour period at 30°C.

In Figure 5, the fluorescent signal was normalized with the number of cells and plotted as a function of time. The red bars denote the error within each ID.
Figure 5: Fluorescence signal normalized by the number of cells for 0% (w/v), 0.2% (w/v) and 0.5% (w/v) rhamnose with the csgA and csgA-GFPmut3 construct. The error bars are included for all experiments.
As observed in Figure 5, only the strains carrying the csgA-GFPmut3 construct induced with 0.2% (w/v) and 0.5% (w/v) showed a clear increase in fluorescence signal over time. The rest of the cultures, didn’t show significant fluorescence over time.
Furthermore, we have showed that increasing concentrations of rhamnose lead to increasing amounts of produced csgA-GFPmut3 and thus fluorescence. Finally, as the fluorescence signal is normalized by the cell density, one can make statements about the activity of the rhamnose promoter. The promoter seems to not be active directly after induction, but activity is observed after a time period of 3 to 4 hours.  This is in accordance with data from literature (Wegerer et. Al, 2008), in which low fluorescence levels were observed after 2 hours of induction of the rhamnose promoter.

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Executive#_-_-_TEXT.html," include securing grant and private investment funding for research and development and a thorough market analysis. By year three we plan to secure one million in investment from venture capital funding as we bring our first product to market. Finally, by year five, we hope to reach a break-even point as we begin to expand into international markets.
Our overarching goal is to develop a biosensor technology with clear advantages in the oil and gas industry that can revolutionize how current testing is performed. The technologies we are leveraging to build our biosensors have immense potential as platforms, giving them flexibility to respond to changing market trends, industry needs, and new market verticals.
Company Description
FREDsense Technologies focuses on the development of novel, field-ready electrochemical detectors for oil sands applications. We are a product and Research and Development company based out of Calgary, Canada, focused on synthetic biology and electrochemical biosensors.
Our flagship product is a general toxin electrochemical sensor for use in water quality testing. The system involves the use of an electrochemical detector unit with a cartridge system to which water samples are added. This represents a renewable income stream, as customers must continuously purchase new cartridges for each sample tested. Our unique bacterial strain senses the presence of various toxins and reports if the sample has a high enough threshold toxicity to be of concern.
Our principal market is within environmental consulting and monitoring, specifically for the oil and gas sector. However, the general toxin sensor is a first generation product that will allow us to move into various markets over time, with applications in the environmental, health, and even manufacturing sectors. Next generation products will include related sensors for a variety of other compounds of concern for environmental toxicity and industrial processes, including sensors for naphthenic acids and hydrocarbons.
We have developed a technology with distinct advantages compared to competing products. The components of our system are cost effective, reducing the cost per unit to our consumer while maintaining valuable profit margins. Secondly, our technology is a rapid detector that is faster than any other system presently on the market. This is a significant competitive advantage, particularly as market conditions evolve to meet more stringent and dramatically increased regulatory requirements for the number of monitored sites.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#Cost Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," of 5 year survival rates of stages 2-4 and for cases were stage was unknown. [21]
The cost of a false positive was taken as the cost of a contrast enhanced chest CT scan (£359 [19] ), plus the cost of the test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110) as it would be done for 6 years - as that would be the follow up of a positive result of our test. We assumed that all patients with a false positive would subsequently have their cancer ruled out by a CT. Previous screening trials have showed that other procedures are needed, sometimes bronchoscopy, or a false positive proceeding all the way to surgery and treatment. However, we believe a CT in combination with our test would rule out nearly all false positives (especially if several miRNAs were used in tandem to look at the properties of the ‘tumor’ in a subsequent test) - and the probability of a patient having further measures taken would likely be negligible. There is also no data available to quantify this additional cost.
The cost of treatment in stage 1 is £8000 and in stage 4 is £10,050. [19] We used the cost at stage 4 as the upper bound of the cost for stages 2-4. Similar to before, this is likely to decrease were a large scale screening trial to take place and figures for individual stages used - as cost of treatment in stage 2 is far lower than stage 4. [19] We assumed the cost of unsuccessful treatment in stage 1 was the same as the cost of successful treatment in stage one plus average cost of treatment in the other stages - as if treatment is unsuccessful in stage one, a patient is likely to have their tumor progress to later stages. The cost of treatment in stage 4 is not dependent on success as the treatment is just palliative care.
We ignored the cost of recurrence of a cancer - recurrences in cancer are complex and cannot be easily modelled. Furthermore, the earlier the cancer is detected, the lower the chace of recurrence. This means our sensor that can detect NSCLC at stage 1 would drastically reduce this cost.
As Tammemägi gave the probability of cancer in the next 6 years we calculated the cost effectiveness of screening each year for the next 6 years. Hence the cost of 6 true negatives is the cost of our test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110).

Part 2: Growing Electrocompetent cells
1. 100 mL LB media was added to 2 Erlenmeyer flasks (total 200 mL of media)
2. 100 µL of Streptomycin was added to each of the Erlenmeyer flasks.
3. The optical density (OD) of cells grown overnight culture was measured.
4. The Erlenmeyer flasks were inoculated with enough of the overnight media so that the OD in each Erlenmeyer flask was 0.01.
5. The two flasks were then put in a shaker at 30 C with 300 rpm. *Note: Growing the cells at 30C instead of 37C will alter the growth of the cell membrane
6. Once an OD of 0.5 was reached in the flasks, they were removed from the shaker.
Part 3: Harvesting Electrocompetent cells.
1. While the cells are growing in Part 2, 50 micrcentrifuge tubes were labeled and then set in a box in the -80C freezer.
2. The centrifuge was turned on an cooled to 4C.
3. The contents of the Erlenmeyers flasks were transferred to 4x50mL Falcon Tubes, while making sure the tubes remained chilled.
4. The tubes were put in the pre-chilled centrifuge and spun down at 4500 rpm for 10 minutes.
5. The supernatant was poured out, being careful not to disturb the pellets at the bottom.
6. 25 mL of 10% glycerol was added to each of the tubes and used the gently resuspend the pellet.
7. The contents of the 4 x 25mL Falcon tubes were transferred so that there were 2 X 50 mL Falcon tubes.
8. These 2 tubes were then spun at 4C and 4500 rpm for 10 minutes.
9. Again, the supernatant was poured out and the pellets were resuspended in 25 mL of 10% glycerol.
10. The contents of the 2 x 25mL Falcon tubes were transferred to 1 x 50mL Falcon tube.
11. The tube was spun down again (making sure to balance the centrifuge) at 4C and 4500 rpm for 10 minutes.

MIT,2018,Team:MIT#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," directly targeting             the bacteria themselves is very new and complicated, and delving into this field requires us to start on a smaller scale. 2.             S. mutans is a good organism to study: it's the top contributor to caries, the top acid-producing bacteria, and it's the most             funded cariogenic pathogen.  According to Dr. He, ""If you can solve S. mutans, you will have solved 90% of the caries problem!""
He informed us of various treatment methods to help us think of even more viable future prospects, such as bacteria-focused caries             treatment methods (antimicrobial peptide that only targets S. mutans,  or an acid-activated antimicrobial peptide: only activated in             low pH, allows for targeting of all acid-producing bacteria), and host-focused caries treatment ideas (much more rare!) such as stopping             acid production of bacteria: biofilm formation is less of an issue than acid production-bacteria will be in the mouth no matter what.             Colonization requires a lot of gene function from S. mutans (i.e. GTFs). (Acid production is on a case-by-case basis, but S. mutans             is always number one). He also told us that Much work has already been done in terms of interfering with CSP signaling             (i.e. competitive inhibition of CSP receptor)
Since we met Dr. He in mid-August, we realized that it was too late to make any drastic changes in our experimental design.             However, Dr. He's insights will be extremely helpful to us in explaining and justifying our project and the envisioned mode             of delivery.. He was able to address some of the most prevalent concerns voiced by people we've presented to. He also offered             to put us in contact with some hydrogel experts he knew so we could devise a more concrete plan for our mode of delivery.
Conversations with Cell Encapsulation Experts
After some initial research into cell encapsulation, we decided to meet with some experts about the cell encapsulation             technique and how compatible this mode of delivery would be to our envisioned technology. We reached out to the Langer Lab,             which is currently carrying out cutting-edge research in hydrogels and cell encapsulation techniques. We got into contact             with two researchers at Langer Lab, namely Suman Bose and Derfogail Delcassian.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#blogtest_-_-_TEXT.html," our knowledge on the parameters, the number of data points compared to the high number of parameters did not give any meaningful results.
We then decided to simplify our system :
We consider that Bxb1a and Bxb1b have the same behavior. Therefore, they don't appear as differentiated in our system anymore.
The paper uses the tet system to induce their system. This was modeled explicitly before. We approximated this part to a Hill function, which takes leakiness into consideration. The parameters for the Hill function are the result from a study of an other iGEM team UCSF from last year. Please visit their page for more information. The same biobrick is indeed used in their work and in Bonnet's paper.
We consider that the dimer of the integrase and the binding to DNA were at quasi steady-state.
As we tried to fit the steady state, we obtained two different models, depending on which assumption we made. As these two models fit the Bonnet's curve well, we used them both to derive more precisely the dissociation constant of the dimerization reaction and the one of the DNA binding reaction. Each of them appear in one of the lumped parameters we fitted.
Fitting of the figure S4 from Bonnet's paper with the model 1. The assumption is a simplification of the expression of [Bxb1] after the derivation of the steady state.
Fitting of the figure S4 from Bonnet's paper with the model 1. The assumption is the fact that the degradation of the dimer of Bxb1 is neglected with respect to the dimerization reaction rate.
By considering reasonable order of magnitude for other parameters present in the lumped parameters, we find that the value of the dissociation constants are both of the order of 10-4. This order of magnitude is not surprising at all, as we know that the binding of integrases to DNA is very specific (which is underlined by the low value of the dissociation constant of this reaction) and that integrases are more stable as dimer than as monomer.

Diffusion Experiments
Monday, 25th August
Now that we tested the different constructs for leakiness, dose response and cross talk, we are investigating in the diffusion rate of AHL. Therefore we designed a chip with chambers connected by channels of different length (see figure). In one chamber we added a strain containing a regulator and a sensor plasmid, to the second chamber we added AHL or an AHL producer strain. As soon as AHL is diffused to the former chamber it induces"
Slovenia,2008,Team:Slovenia#Notebook#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," electroporation was performed by a pulse of 360 V/cm, 100 ms followed by 4 pulses of  48 V/cm, 100 ms, 1 Hz. The mice were boostered 10 days after the first vaccination using the same procedure described above.
 
BLOOD SAMPLING
Each mouse was placed in a special ventilated and heated cage to enable peripheral vasodilatation for faster and easier blood sampling. The animal was then fixed in a restrainer and local anesthetic ethyl chloride was applied to the end of the tail. About 80-100 ml of blood was collected from the tail end and the tail tip was sealed with silver nitrate to stop bleeding.

Modelling
The questions which the modelling team set out to answer were inspired by the questions the wetlab groups were asking. We had to select a reporter enzyme that would be effective and durable for our lateral flow strip system. As we scrutinized how reporters, the detector, and other biological devices could merge together in our sensor, we realized these modular protein components could be assembled in many configurations. We were eager to learn the optimal configuration in which they could be combined to be most effective in our prototype so that we could inform the direction of our experiments in the wetlab. We aimed to understand how the system would work so that we could develop the best system possible to impact the lives of those this system could impact.
To reduce the number of wet lab experiments to develop our sensor, we followed a two-pronged modelling approach to help answer our questions. First, we used spatial models in Autodesk Maya in which we assembled and animated 3D protein structures for insight into their function in the prototype. Also, we analyzed the kinetic properties of several common reporter enzymes, culminating in our selection of two novel reporters. Finally, we deployed a quantitative Mathematica prototype model to test how amounts of target DNA versus detector proteins would influence sensitivity of our lateral flow strip, and a Scilab differential model to predict how our final system would function.

The concrete equation of chemical reaction is :
After the analysis of equation above, we conclude that this enzyme catalyzed reaction is match with Ping-pong bi-bi mechanism.
The graph of mechanism is written as:
(3)KS Part
The leading role of the KS part is Ketocaylsynthase, KS domain. Its last step is activation of propionyl groups. AT domains in Module 1 or Module 2 activate the propionyl groups in (2S)Methylmalonyl-CoA (details in Loading Part). Afterwards, KS domains combine the extended units anchored on the ACP domains belonging to the Modules which the KS domains belong to with the polyketide chains anchored on the ACP domains belonging to the former Modules (or Loadings). Then new polyketide chains form and are anchored the ACP domains belonging to the Modules which the KS domains belong to.
The function of KS domain is combining the propionyl group with acetyl group at the end of the polyketide chain by forming the C—C bond. In KS domain catalyzed reactions, polyketide chains are transferred from ACP doamains belonging to the former Module (or Loading) onto KS domains, and then occur decarboxylic reaction with the extended units anchored on the ACP domains belonging to the Modules which the KS domains belong to. As a result, the polyketide chains are elongated.
The concrete equation of chemical reaction is :
(4)KR Part
The process of KR domain catalyzed reactions is a little more complex. Its leading role is KR domain. The function of KR domain is deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the β-hydroxyl ester bond. In KR domain catalyzed reactions, the carbonyl groups of polyketide chains anchored on the ACP domains are combined with the specific binding sites of KR domains through weak chemical bonds. Then the electron cloud in the carbonyl groups is  moving towards oxygen atoms so that the carbon atoms have net positive charge. At this time, NADPHs have a chance to bind to the polyketide chains and form instable ternary complexes. In order to reduce the inner energy of this ternary complexes and run towards stable, NADPHs provide hydride ions and KR domains provide protons for the complexes and"

2.4 Construct Design and Modeling
To test whether we could bind multiple metal ions on the same protein and if this relationship would be monotonically increasing, we designed peptides with one, two, and three copper binding domains in tandem (1xHHTC-Re HNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGC, 2xHHTC-Re HNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGCHNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGC, 3xHHTC-Re HNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGCHNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGCHNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGC; see biobrick page for sequence information). These three peptides were synthesized by Elim Biopharmaceuticals (Hayward, CA), and provided as a lyophilized powder at >98% purity. They were also modified to possess N-terminal acetylation/C-terminal amidation to avoid having a charged peptide [17]. 10 mM MES pH 5.5 and the Pierce BCA assay were used for reconstitution and concentration determination, respectively [18].
To check whether the proteins would retain their respective conformations when added in tandem, we used a tool produced by the Zhang lab (University of Michigan) for de novo protein structure prediction (QUARK) [15]. Based on the structures, we were able to hypothesize that the HHTC-Re domains would each be able to bind copper atoms, even when restricted spatially by ordering them sequentially without spacing.
Figure 1: Depiction of the design of the HHTC-Re repeating peptides, along with predicted ab initio structures as per the QUARK database and algorithms. Individual HHTC-Re domains retain their conformation, even in the 3x peptide.
We also developed 3 fusion proteins: CBD-2xHHTC, CBD-3xHHTC, and CBD-6xHHTC for use in the actual filter, comprised of a CBD, and HHTC metal binding repeats interspaced with a GSGGSG flexible linker. These constructs also included a Lumio tag for downstream verification of protein production, and a 6x His tag for protein purification. A challenge incurred when designing these parts was that the His tag maintains"

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#DiscoveryFestival_-_-_TEXT.html," the evening, our lab has not lacked attention. Our team was giving tours constantly and it was not unusual for visitors to stand in line because our entire team was occupied.
Idea box
Over the course of the evening many people left video messages in the idea box, and they all seemed to have a great time while doing it. Unfortunately, we haven’t analyzed the results just yet.
The Poster Game
Unfortunately, the overwhelming attention we got for the lab tour meant that we had no time (or need) to walk around with posters and try to spark peoples interest with them. Because of this, the whole poster game never worked out as planned. However, we did hang A0 sized versions of our posters (attached below, partly in Dutch) on the wall outside our improvised laboratory. Throughout the night, they attracted a lot of attention from the crowd. Apparently, the concepts of synthetic biology and its use as a solution to the world’s problems appeal to a wide audience. We were very happy to observe this.
Communication Science
Unfortunately, it will take Paulien a lot longer to analyze all the data we provided her with and write a solid report about it than we had time to wait. However, she did provide us with a first impression . She also said she had a great time observing us and she is very happy with the resulting data.
Conclusion
The attention and enthusiasm that we encountered amongst the public exceeded all expectations. Although this overwhelming attention somewhat hindered our ambition to address the festival visitors outside our own lab, it also showed that this wasn’t really required. Overall, we regard our participation in this festival as a great success!  What’s more: The same is true for the teams that visited the other festivals!
Attached below are the ‘synthetic biology posters’ that we made. To appeal to a wide audience, we tried to make them as diverse as possible in both style, level of detail and language.

SHSBNU_China,2018,Team:SHSBNU China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," undiscovered problems, the total ability of sewage treatment had dropped 40%. To address this issue, we needed to develop a sustainable consumptive material.
III. Integrated Human Practice
By discovering shortcomings of traditional treatment method, we found some critical factors that were worth considering in our project.
a. Fixing Laccase to a Matrix
The first factor was the low concentration of bacteria/enzyme during treatment. A high flow rate may wash away bacteria fast, lowering the concentration of bacteria/enzymes as well as the chance and duration of contact between pollutant and enzymes. This reminded us to adjust our project in two aspects:
(1) Attach bacteria/Laccase to some fixed matrix, preventing them from being washed away by water flow.
(2) Use lots of small plastic beads to expand surface area, increasing the chance of contact between pollutant and enzymes.
In combination of the two aspects, we may achieve a higher concentration of laccase and longer duration of contact between pollutant and enzymes. Moreover, because the laccase can process the sewage without releasing toxic gas, it will eliminate the unnecessary cost of using extraction pump and extra employee payment, which as a result can enable factory to utilize the biggest advantage of biology method with inexpensive price.
b. Biofilm × Laccase
The second factor to consider was the competition among bacteria species. Through human practice, we realized that the composition of sewage disposal was very complicated. There were usually more than one species of microorganism competing in the same environment, which may negatively affect the growth of target bacteria. By allowing our bacteria to produce biofilm, they could get an advantage of growth by sharing nutrients and getting sheltered from competitors.
Finally, we came up with the idea, using PHA plastic beads coated with biofilm and biofilm producing bacteria, then display laccase enzyme on biofilm by adding SpyTag to Biofilm and SpyCatcher to CotA laccase. PHA can also act as a carbon source to bacteria, maintaining growth of bacteria and production of biofilm for longer period. This may further reduce cost by replacing biomaterials less frequently.
IV. Public Education and Engagement
Our public education includes two sections: on campus and off campus activities.
On campus, we design and implement a layered education system, starting from series of lectures to all students, interviewing some students and evaluating their potential of being iGEMers, then our synthetic biology club offering them training in genetic engineering.
Off campus, we established the collaboration with sewage plant for exchanging the instructive information including biology, plant and policy. We strongly believe that the practic"
Slovenia,2012,Team:Slovenia#SafetyMechanismsTermination_-_-_TEXT.html,"2010).  We used the HSV-thymidine kinase fused to mouse guanylate kinase (mGMK:TK30, BioBrick BBa_K404113 , prepared by the Freiburg_Bioware team in 2010) in our system because it improves phosphorylation of ganciclovir-monophosphate to ganciclovir-diphosphate, thus preventing accumulation of ineffective intermediate products (i.e. GCV-MP, GCV-DP) due to the limited ability of the endogenous guanylate kinase (Figure 1).
We successfully implemented HSV-TK/GCV system to our cellular device to function as a controllable “safety switch”. This means that we can inactivate our cellular device whenever we want, after or even in the middle of therapy, simply by administering ganciclovir to the patient.
Figure 1. Mechanism of action of the HSV-TK/GCV system.
Following the BioBrick Standard Assembly technique we inserted the mouse guanylate kinase – thymidine kinase fusion gene (mGMK:TK30, ( BBa_K404113 )) under the control of the CMV promoter ( BBa_K782063 ; Figure 2).  HSV-TK mutant (TK30) contains six amino acid substitutions and shows enhanced sensitivity to ganciclovir (Kokoris et al., 1999).
Figure 2. Assembly of mGMK:TK30 ( BBa_K404113 ) under the control of CMV promoter ( BBa_K782063 ). Insert (mGMK:TK30, ( BBa_K404113 )) was digested with EcoRI and SpeI and pcDNA3 vector with EcoRI and XbaI, loaded on an agarose gel and the appropriate bands were purified. Vector and insert were ligated and transformed into E. coli strain DH5α. The DNA sequence of the resulting plasmid pPCMV_mGMK:TK30 was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
We transfected HEK293 cells with the pPCMV_mGMK:TK30 plasmid and monitored cell survival after the addition of ganciclovir. We daily observed cells a with light microscope and monitored the morphological signs of decreased viability. Additionally we stained cells with Hoechst and SytoxGreen514 dye to distinguish between live and dead cells with the help of a confocal microscope. We quantified viable cell numbers at different time points by cell counting and flow cytometry. For detailed protocols please refer to the Experimental methods section.

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#shadow#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"9] put together in a single plasmid (Figure 5a).
Currently, our de novo construct carries three of the enzymes necessary for naringenin production. While PAL is placed under a constitutive promoter, OsPKS and MCS are strategically put under the control of a Plac promoter instead (Figure 5b). This enables overexpression of the two more crucial enzymes involved in the latter stages of the pathway, thus helping to drive the reaction forward.
By supplementing the medium with coumaric and malonic acid as substrates, we demonstrated the production of significant amounts of naringenin in E. coli BL21* cells carrying the de novo construct. The production of naringenin was verified using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), while the expression of the enzymes was confirmed via SDS-PAGE.
With the eventual complete construct, de novo biosynthesis of naringenin can be achieved with just the introduction of this plasmid. This design complements the use of xylose as feedstock to achieve a much more environmentally-friendly bioproduction of naringenin, and ultimately, dyes.

LUTEOLIN
The choice of target compound was given careful consideration as its production is the raison d’être of Coup Dy’état, and the design of all the features in our system would revolve around its production. Our desire to renounce synthetic dyes prompted us to look for natural alternatives, which would be the first product of our system.
Figure 6. The leaky flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, and luteolin.
The conversion of chrysanthemin, callistephin, and myrtillin from naringenin involves the same enzymes: F3H, DFR, ANS, and 3GT, while that of theaflavin also includes the former two enzymes. As can be seen, these enzymes act on multiple substrates, hence their promiscuity and the need to exert tight control. Luteolin can be synthesized from naringenin using two enzymes. F3’H converts naringenin to apigenin, another yellow flavone, and FNS synthesizes luteolin from apigenin.
We explored the production of various flavonoids, all derived from the intermediate platform compound, naringenin. Chrysanthemin (pink), callistephin (orange), and theaflavin (reddish-brown) were our original candidates as many enzymes are shared across their biosynthetic pathways. A range of colours could then theoretically be"

Approach
In 2004 the Austen and UCSF iGEM team created a device sensitive to light, laying the foundation for the Coliroid project . In this project, the system is combined with the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system in the endeavour to mediate light-dependent dormancy in bacteria. As tight regulation is required for the RelE-RelB system Tashiro Y, Kawata K, Taniuchi A, Kakinuma K, May T, Okabe S. RelE-Mediated Dormancy Is Enhanced at High Cell Density in Escherichia coli. J Bacteriol. 2012;194(5):1169-76. , modelling of the toxin-antitoxin system is essential. The impact of different RelE-RelB expression levels was simulated by modelling. Using the results obtained by this modelling, a hypothetical working system-design was devised.
On basis of the modulated system, the potential of different vectors and promoters in various combinations was tested. This constitutes the foundation for how the design of the light-dependent dormancy system in E. coli has been optimised, and the final approach shaped. Ultimately, the light-dependent dormancy system, which is illustrated in Figure 3, was composed of the following parts:
The photocontrol device controlled by the PenI-regulated promoter, BBa_R0074 , on a high copy vector.
The antitoxin RelB controlled by pBAD, BBa_K2449031 , on a low copy vector.
The toxin RelE controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter, BBa_R0082 , on either a low copy vector or the chromosome.
For further information about our approach, read here.

Overview
Safety, including lab and environment safety, is always our top concern.
In lab, all members have received safety trainings before working on our project; experiment regulations are rigidly observed.
Regarding environment, we have evaluated the project feasibility and its relating security issues. We designed a kill switch to guarantee our “Prometheus” is under control while capturing Molybdenum and delivering it to roots of legumes..
The safety questions:
1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues?
We use Escherichia coli, strain DH5α and TOP10 in our work. These strains are commonly used and proved safe when handled properly. All living materials and their extract are sterilized before disposing. Students cannot access working zone without wearing lab coats, long trousers and closed shoes. For certain kinds of work, safety glasses and appropriate protection gloves are required. No other activities are allowed in the lab, and we ensure no experimental material could be taken out.
2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) you made this year raise safety issues?
None of our biobricks expresses toxic products, and all are thus considered safe. We expect no safety problem with these genetic materials.
3. Any local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Professor Wang Yue, the famous health law expert in China from Peking University Health Science Center, is among our team advisors. We consulted him about the related issues to ensure all the experiments are legal and legitimate. Besides, the lab manager, who takes charge of lab safety in Beijing Normal University,offered us a lot of valuable advice regarding waste disposal and lab safety.
