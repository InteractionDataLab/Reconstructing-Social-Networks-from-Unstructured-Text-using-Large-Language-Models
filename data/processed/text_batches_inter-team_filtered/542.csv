UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Gut_-_-_TEXT.html," impact of oxidative stress upon protein structure is significant and since structure and function are inexplicably, linked the functionality of the proteins are likely to be hindered too. Thus, we are looking towards preventative methods that will lessen the amount of oxidative stress that proteins are exposed to.
LYCOPENE CONCEPT
Our lycopene probiotic will act in the gut to neutralise ROS to regain the balance as shown in the diagram above
Lycopene is a carotenoid, and is the compound responsible responsible for giving the distinctive red colour to fruit such as tomatoes and watermelon. It is for this reason that lycopene has previously been used and characterised within iGEM as it lends itself to colorimetric detection. However, we believe this does not completely harness the power of this compound.   Lycopene is one of natures most powerful antioxidants. This is due to the numerous saturated bonds within its structure which enables it to quench ROS including singlet oxygen (2). This provides our cells with protection against damage to critical biomolecules -which can ultimately lead to ageing.
 
Chemical structure of lycopene
We are looking towards using this as a probiotic treatment which also enables us to make the use of Dundee Schools gut simulation to test the workings of this.
Proposed transformation for probiotic in a safe chassis
SYNTHETIC VS NATURAL
So why the need for synthetic biology? Why not just eat tomatoes or watermelon? Well, the synthetic form of lycopene has been shown to be more effective in neutralising this oxidative stress because it is in a more bioavailable form compared to the form that is found in these fruits (2). This enables the compound to be more readily absorbed and consequently more effective in minimising ROS damage.
Beyond this the combination of lycopene with our NarK promoter, the release of lycopene is controlled specifically in response to oxidative stress. This has an advantage over lycopene within food which is all released all at once during digestion and may in fact result in the body containing more lycopene than it can process, meaning more energy would need to be expended to digest it.
Further still probiotics are a more long term solution, as it has been shown that E. coli can occupy the gut for even 3 months! This is a huge advantage as it would not contribute to existing daily medication the elderly population are often burdened with. It also doesn't rely on a diet that is rich in lycopene, which given the price and availability of these fruits, especially watermelon, could in the long term be a"

Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With"

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#Tar_-_-_TEXT.html,"onucleotides were designed to have an annealing region without mutations at the 3’ end,       either one or two NNK codons in the middle and another annealing region to the template at the 5’ end, used in the following ligation step as overlapping region. The first pair of primers amplifies the region between the two ligand binding       sites and includes the degenerated bases at the 5’. The second pair amplifies the region external to the two ligand binding sites and includes the degenerated bases at the 3’.
Workflow overview for the generation of the site directed mutagenesis library
The two fragments have been amplified by standard PCR with Phusion polymerase (refer to protocol) and, after digestion of the template with DpnI, ligated using a homemade Gibson assembly mix (refer to protocol), transformed in TOP10 chemically       competent cells and plated on LB agar + Chloramphenicol 34 plates. The DpnI digestion has been proven to be crucial in order to retrieve mutants and not only wild type plasmids.
Once the colonies were grown, in order to conserve a copy, the colonies were transferred onto fresh plates by replica plating. Then the colonies were scraped off and resuspended in LB medium. The DNA from the culture was then extracted and       sent for sequencing. The sequencing analysis showed variability around the two ligand binding sites.
Given that we targeted 5 amino acids , the number of clones that would be needed to cover 95% of the library can be estimated with Kille et al., 2012 [5] algorithm:
\begin{equation}       L=-V\cdot \ln (1-F)=-64^5\cdot \ln (1-0.95) = 3.2\cdot 10^9       \end{equation}
Where L is the number of samples; V is the total number of variants Xn (X being the number of possible codons and n being the number of saturated residues); F is the fractional library completeness.       While this calculation gives a ballpark on the numbers of mutants that should be screened, smaller libraries have been shown to equally serve the purpose.       It is important to note that the dimension of the library could be in the way of an effective screening process, however the assay that we established is suitable for these library sizes and offers a handy set up to select interesting mutants.

Berlin,2014,Team:Berlin#Project#Detailed-Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". Peptides called phytochelatins are produced in fungus and plants to detoxify the cell from harmful heavy metals. Structurally phytochelatins are (gamma-Glu-Cys)n-Gly (n=2-7) peptides and function as metal ion accumulators through formation of peptide-metal conjugates. In this study the phytochelatin synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia leave) was used (ATPCS). The other peptide that was used in combination with ATPCS was a metallothionein from Pseudomonas Putida KT2240 strain (PPMT). Metallothioneins are low-molecular proteins with a high content of cysteine and bind well cadmium, zinc, nickel and copper.
For expression of ATPCS a trc promoter was used while PPMT was expressed using a T5 promoter. After co expressing both proteins in an standard E. coli strain(DH5alpha) for 4 h the culture broth was centrifuged and fresh metal rich LB media added.

7/1/2015: Day 23
What a big day!  Natalie stopped by to see how we were doing.  It had been a month since we’d seen her, so obviously things had progressed quite a bit- since then, we had (for the most part) finalized our concept, goals to teach, design layout, and paper prototype.  She gave a lot of helpful feedback, especially on the actual scientific accuracy.  We had an interesting conversation about what aspects of the scientific process we would have in the software side (without being too complex and confusing for users!) and what we would have in the actual wetlab component.
We also looked at possible artistic designs with Casey.  It was great to walk through the paper prototype with them since they have had so much experience with iGEM.  It’s exciting to know that actual designs are on their way!
Finally after Natalie and Casey’s feedback, we had a new version of our paper prototype!  We created a video for Romie and Anja to keep us updated.
The lab had a few other new people today as well-- two high school interns arrived today!  Since both have had some C++ experience,  over the next few weeks they’ll be playing around with Cornerstone as well and creating their own apps.
7/2/2015: Day 24
Today we examined the suggestions given by the lab’s design cards and jotted down how our project fulfills each requirement.  We also created a document to note our official phrasing and write-ups for the prototype/project.  Finally, we conducted a few user studies with some other Wellesley students who had little background knowledge of how we’d prepared the
Tomorrow we’ll work on: finalize among us phrasing and consider design possibilities

We’re continuing to work towards fulfilling basic functionality of our software, and planning a meetup with the BU and MIT iGEM teams!  I’m so excited for the chance to meet with two other teams and to share ideas and feedback.  Tomorrow we’ll be meeting with Casey, a recent Wellesley grad who has participated in many previous iGEM competitions, to discuss artwork and designs for the final project!

This competition is held by Wuyuzhang Honors College of Sichuan University aimed at helping students from different fields sharing their research works and experiences. This competition is presented as research project competition, and students got onto the stage to introduce their projects and answering questions asked by judges and students under the stage. At last, competitors will be awarded according to judges’ scoring. Judges of this year are prof. Ben Earl Alexander from Harvard University and Mrs. Zhang Lulu from Sichuan University.
We introduced our project of this year to everyone there and got praise from judges. And we are awarded with the Best Academic Performance Award. What is more important is that , we presented our project to students from different background, different countries and different majors with an international mindset. And we promoted synthetic biology and iGEM, and helped students to get to know what they are and what they do. Besides, students asked questions about iGEM such as how to participate, how to decide the project, if there must be people of biomedical majors in the team and so on. We gave responses to every questions raised by them and they were all satisfied, even more, there were students who expressed their willing of join iGEM teams of their university when they got back.

Daniel C.:
After the surgeries, can the patients see again?
Salomi:
No they can’t. They [the surgents] are focusing on the eyelids. And the eyelids are now ok but people who were blind will not be able to see again.
Daniel C.:
So it can’t get worse but it won’t get better either?
Salomi:
Yes.
Daniel C.:
Can you show us the questionnaire for the trachoma mapping?
Salomi:
So the trachoma mapping questionnaire is actually not an interview but an examination […]. There are some general questions regarding the hygiene of the household. For example:
What is your main source of drinking water?
How long does it take to go there, get water and come back?
In the dry season, what is the main source of water used for face washing?
Where do you and other members of the household usually defecate?
[...] So that is the first questionnaire that is filled out when the enumerators arrive at the household. And then we have a trachoma grader who examines each and every resident of the household and fills another questionnaire.
Samira:
So when you do the mass screening for trachoma, do you just rely on symptomatic diagnosis or do you do some laboratory tests as well?
Salomi:
No, when we are screening we only focus on the symptoms - or I should rather say the signs of trachoma.
Dominika:
So there are a number of people who are refusing the surgery. What reasons do they have?
Salomi:
The main reason why people refuse surgeries is misconception of what happens in the theater and also fear. There are a lot of misconceptions about the surgery, that when you are in there the surgeon takes off your ear or your eye and then operates you and then puts it back. So it´s not easy to convince the people in the villages. Sometimes we use the people who have been operated to convince the others and to tell them what is done and that it only takes 15 minutes.
Dominika:
Do you have projects in schools for children to educate them on trachoma and how they can avoid it?

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#proves4_-_-_TEXT.html," of the Lab, with the hope that one would reversibly inhibit the luminescence. This was clearly an approach that relied entirely on good luck, and I was not surprised when all of my efforts failed. I was conceptually exhausted, and could not come up with one further idea.
I spent the next several days soul-searching, trying to imagine the reaction that occurs in luminescing jellyfish and searching for a way to extract the luminescent principle. I often meditated on a drifting rowboat under the clear summer sky. Friday Harbor in summer, at that time, was quiet and peaceful, differing from the present-day scene that is almost saturated with busy pleasure boats and noisy seaplanes. A rowboat always has the right of way over one with a motor, so nobody disturbed my drifting vessel; even large ferries saved me a wide berth. Thus, meditation afloat was safe, but if I fell asleep and the boat was carried away by the tidal current, then I had to row for a long time to get back to the Lab.
One afternoon on the boat, a thought suddenly struck me-a thought so simple that I should have had it much sooner: “Even if a luciferin-luciferase system is not involved in the jellyfish luminescence, another enzyme or protein is very probably involved directly in the light-emitting reaction. If so, the activity of this enzyme or protein can probably be altered by a pH change, at least to some extent. Indeed, there might be a certain level of acidity at which an enzyme or protein could be reversibly inactivated.”
I immediately went back to the lab and made a squeezate. Then, I mixed a small portion of the squeezate with acidified water containing various amounts of acetic acid. The resultant mixtures at pH 6.0 and pH 5.0 were clearly luminous, but at pH 4.0, I saw no luminescence. I filtered off the liquid from the rest of squeezate and mixed the solid part, containing the granules of light organs, with water of pH 4.0. After the mixture was filtered, the filtrate, now free of cells and debris, was nearly dark, but it regained its luminescence upon neutralization with a small amount of sodium bicarbonate. Indeed, the experiment showed that the luminescent substance of the jellyfish can be extracted.
But my real surprise came in the next moment, when I added a small amount of seawater to the solution and saw that its light became explosively strong. The experiment showed that some component"

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2018,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,", teams from the mainland of China, Taiwan and Japan had a great experience.
During the time in NCHU, we presented our idea to several teams and professors. We included the background of our double-emulsion system, the experiment, the modeling and the human practices in a way similar to what we will be doing at the Giant Jamboree. Professors inquired us of our double emulsion rate and how our modeling exactly works, which was extremely informative to us.
When it was our turn to be the audience, we got inspirations from several teams, especially two teams from Taipei. They used self-made icons and animations to substitute traditional PPTs. Through their presentation, they presented their ideas similar to telling a story rather than simply reporting the project, and we were amazed by the simplicity and integrity they had and modified our presentation methods after we got back.
CCiC Conference
Thanks to team Shanghai_tech this year, our team got the opportunity to attend the 2018 CCiC Conference held in Shanghai, from August 24th—August 31st
We presented our project at CCiC, and we are grateful to the iGEMers that had given suggestions on our presenting methods. They pointed out that although we have done a lot of work, much of which sounded somewhat irrelevant to synthetic biology. We appreciate their suggestions and have made corrections on our presentation and poster to make them more clear and logical.
We are also grateful to Shanghai tech for providing the chance of a special face-to-face Q&A session in the evenings during CCiC. It was then when we encountered and discussed not only our own projects but what we had learned and what we hope for iGEM with professors from the iGEM committee.
We also had a conversation with Dr.Zhang Haoqian from Langene technology company. We discussed over how and what to do to improve the public’s understanding of biological concepts and the questions involved in our CCC project as well. We also mentioned our wish to hold the 2019 CCiC Conference so that we could also provide such a brilliant opportunity for iGEMers to communicate.

We carried out an extended, 18-hour experiment , monitoring cell density through absorbance measurement and promoter strength by fluorescence emission. The results are shown subsequently.
Figure 5: Absorbance at 700 nm of E. coli DH5α-strains with transformed Anderson promoter familiy members
Please note that we monitored the optical density at 700 nm wavelength, because the UC-Davis team was concerned about interferences of OD600 measurements with the fluorescence measurements.
To determine the relative strength of the used promoters we looked at the fluorescence signal of RFP. With increasing promoter strength, transcription should be enhanced and more RFP will be expressed. This results in a higher fluorescence signal.
Figure 6: Fluorescence emission at 615 nm of the stronger Anderson promoter family members (excitation at 588 nm). The values in brackets indicate the relative promoter strength compared to J61100, which was given the value 1.
Figure 7: Fluorescence emission at 615 nm of the medium Anderson promoter family members (excitation at 588 nm). The values in brackets indicate the relative promoter strength compared to J61100, which was given the value 1.
Figure 8: Fluorescence emission at 615 nm of the weaker Anderson promoter family members (excitation at 588 nm). The values in brackets indicate the relative promoter strength compared to J61100, which was given the value 1.
The results show very clearly that strains containing a plasmid with a stronger promoter are fluorescing earlier than those with medium and weak promoters. Also, the fluorescence intensity is significantly lower for weak promoters in comparison to the stronger ones. The DH5α-strain with an inherent J23101 plasmid (relative strength 0.7) did surprisingly not fluoresce the strongest. This might be due to a problem with plasmid stability in this strain. Also, the unmeasured J23119 BioBrick seems to hold a promoter of medium strength.
The widely plausible results show, that the protocols for promoter BioBrick characterization work quite well. Comparisons to experimental results from all over the world can be carried out using this method and promise a well characterized and frequently validated parts registry.
This collaboration was a great chance to communicate and discuss data in an international outreach and taught us a lot about other teams work routines and standards. It was a pleasure to contribute in their project to find a way to effectively share complex experimental data and to work out routines for BioBrick characterization

Purpose
In order to gain trust from the population, the technology should belong to everyone. In a way similar to the open-source software industry, people should be able to improve our project or create their own versions of it. This idea of openness is very common among the community of synthetic biologists, but a lot of pitfalls have to be overcome to make it a sustainable reality.
A parallel could be drawn with electronics in the 1960's, when computer programming was extremely low-level and belonged to the realm of academia. Since then, it has reached a way wider population, thanks to the creation of frameworks allowing for abstraction of the most technical parts. How could the same principles be applied to synthetic biology, in the context of metabolic engineering and vitamins production?
Even though a lot of lab strains designed for easier modification have been designed in the past, they usually have a very general purpose and biotechnology remains a matter of specialists where every modification has to be made from scratch. We imagined a repurposed organism made especially for the quick construction of these self-replicative tiny factories, that could be easily used by startups, community labs or just by enthusiasts. In the following section we discuss the constraints associated with it, and what such an organism could look like.
For the product to be usable, several specifications have to be taken into account:
It must be easily extendable:
Our micro-organism should be a chassis allowing for quick addition of standard cassettes
It must be modular:
The different metabolic pathways should be independant so they can be put together without going through tedious troubleshooting,
It must survive in the real world:
To make our micro-organism more resistant to contamination, we need to design it so our modifications come with a minimal fitness cost.
It must be all-in-one:
For people with limited equipment, having only one strain that does everything is a huge advantage, because only one bioreactor and one production line is needed. This makes it accessible to community"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated human practices_-_-_TEXT.html," existing design should work and suggested looking into the design of his B-series of Zika virus toehold switches to improve our existing switches. We did so, and modified our design to base them on these switches which have reduced system leakage. They have shorter loops and no-refolding domain which helped increase sensitivity. Based on his feedback, we also increased the loop size for the 15b-5p switch design. This compensates for its long stem (which reduces on state activity), increasing dynamic range. With his help, our switches were optimized for their application as a diagnostic tool. Read more about our first series switches on our design page .

iGEM EPFL
After speaking to several experts who highlighted the importance of reducing false positives and false negatives (see applications section below), we began to explore ways to improve the design of our toehold switches. We spoke to iGEM EPFL - another team working with toehold switches. We explained the issues we had with homologous miRNAs that reduce the specificity of our sensors. iGEM EPFL suggested that we design our switches to utilize the mechanism employed in “Ribocomputing devices for sophisticated in vivo logic computation”. [1]
Based on this advice we designed a second series of toehold switches that can distinguish between miRNA sequences with one nucleotide differences. This improved our design , effectively reducing false positives, a crucial part of any diagnostic method.
With reduced cross-hybridisation, we could create an effective multiplexing assay: multiple switches that each regulate the production of a different reporter protein with a distinct emission peak. This would drastically increase the efficiency and scope of the test. As the second generation of switches can detect single base mismatch differences the sensitivity and specificity of the entire system would be improved.
Professor David Rubinsztein
Professor David Rubinsztein, Professor of Molecular Neurogenetics at Cambridge University, suggested that we use luciferase instead of GFP as our reporter protein. He explained that it may be able to provide more sensitive readings. We produced 4 composite parts as a result - with 2 being toehold switches containing luciferase. However, the constructs with luciferase were so long that, in combination with our inducible promoter, we were unable to insert them into the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone in one ligation step. Unfortunately, we did not have time to ligate the individual components of the constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone so we were"

Plasmids strategy
We are building a system containing TetR and LacI, that control the expression of a selection gene. The sequential use of these two repressors allows us to have a direct activation of the selection gene when TetR binds its recognition sequence.
The selection gene is either RFP or a lysis cassette. RFP allows direct recognition of correctly assembled plasmids, which is also useful to see if the transformation has been efficient. Furthermore, it is an easy way to detect TetR binding. The lysis cassette will be useful for chemostat cultures, allowing us to recover DNA from mutants in which TetR binds to a sequence (either consensus sequence or modified one). We hope that the chemostat chambers will allow high-throughput in vivo selection of our mutants.
We need several plasmids to build our entire system. We chose a 2-plasmid strategy that looks like this:

Today we set up new overnights of cholera by adding 4 mL of SLB and 50 uL of our previous overnight from 8/26/13 into a test tubes and placing in the 30° incubator overnight. We prepared two overnight cultures and one control.
We also ran the GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit on the recombinant E. coli cells containing the piG91 plasmid using the protocol below to pull the iGem plasmid backbone out of the E. coli cells in preparation to clone our biobrick parts into the iGem plasmid backbone for submission to the iGem registry. We prepared two minipreps and the final product concentrations were: 28.1 ng/uL and 36.0 ng/uL.
Protocol
Pellet 1-5 mL of overnight culture of recombinant E. coli culture by centrifugation at ≥ 12,000 × g for one minute. Resuspend pellet in 200 uL of provided Resuspension Solution.
Lyse resuspended cells by adding 200 uL of Lysis solution. Immediately mix contents by gentle inversion 6-8 times, until the mixture becomes clear and viscous. Allow the Lysis reaction to proceed for approximately two minutes, but do not exceed five minutes.
Neutralize lysis and precipitate cell debris by adding 350 uL of Neutralization/Binding solution. Gently invert 4-6 times. Pellet cell debris by centrifuging at ≥ 12,"
Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," or predicted by advanced software to have slow insertion time (slow insertion time-G5).
Next, we chose a gene to optimize, and came up with superfolder GFP, a well studied reporter gene that was described by the 2008 Cambridge iGEM team (part BBa_I746916) . We optimized the gene using our five criteria, then assembled plasmids containing all the necessary parts for the gene to be expressed. The ""fast"" optimized GFP has been submitted as a part to the registry, as it is the only variant that we have finished characterizing (part BBa_K1506002) .
In order to find out more about the translational efficiency of our GFPs, we designed a degenerate ribosome binding site (dRBS) to be inserted in our construct before all five variants. By measuring the expression plateaus at high translation initiation rates (TIR), we will be able to see how efficiently our GFPs are translated. Raising or elimenating plateaus at high TIR will be a marker of how effectively we optimized the gene.
Our final design looked like this:
Includes a promoter, RBS, leader sequence, variant gene, and terminator
Our Results
Unfortunately, we were unable to progress beyond the cloning phase with G4, and beyond the insertion of dRBS with G1 and G5. Of the two variants that we characterized, only the results for G2 have been sequence verified and analyzed at this point.
Shows the adjusted average fluorescence of the cells that we measured graphed with the strength of the ribosome binding site in that strain.
The results show only vague indication that expression of GFP was increased as TIR increased. Unfortunately, only 14 strains were successfully characterized and sequenced. Characterization of the other GFPs will allow us to determine the success of our optimization.
Future Plans
First, the cloning will be completed. Once all five variants are present in the backbone with the degenerate ribosome binding site inserted, fluorescence data will be collected. Once each measured colony is sequenced, the fluorescence will be graphed alongside the predicted strength of the ribosome binding site. This will give us a good idea of the translational efficiency of each GFP. By comparing fluorescence data for a single ribosome binding site across multiple GFPs, we will be able to determine the effects of our optimization criteria.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Market#_-_-_TEXT.html,", water soluble toxins. This system is composed of microporous polyethersulfone membranes, between which a solid absorbent compound is held. These systems would be deployed in a similar fashion to the SPMD technologies, and often used in consort with the SPMD. Examples of both of these technologies are detailed below:
Figure 10: Environmental Sampling Technology's SPMD and POCIS systems for long-term monitoring of organic and water-soluble toxic chemicals in water samples.  The systems use membrane technologies to trap a variety of toxic molecules and allows for long-term monitoring of a particular site.
Both these technologies are very innovative, however can only be used for sample capture over time. They must still be retrieved and brought to a lab for sample extraction and analysis on traditional analytical machinery. As opposed to on-site spot testing or continuous active monitoring, these methods are also unable to indicate at what point in a given sample collection timeframe that a perturbing event occurred, only that one had occurred during that given time frame. On-site and continuous monitoring provides the ability to not only detect the time frame within which a change occurs, but also monitor the levels that a given condition changes over that time frame.
Using Competitive Analysis To Select Price Point
Below, is a table summarizing our competitive advantage against many of these competitive products:
Figure 11: Competitive technology comparison chart, detailing our technology platform (FRED) versus other prominent toxin monitoring methods presently in the market.  Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is a highly analytical, sensitive measurement technique while being expensive, highly technical, and non-portable.  The new SPMD/POCIS systems (detailed below in emerging technologies) offer new strategies at long term monitoring and are therefore not direct competitors of our technology.  Finally, the Microtox system is a direct competitor which we hope to gain advantage to by being faster, more portable, and more reliable of a measurement system.
Pricing will be determined based on cost associated with the development of the technology. While conducting our assessment of the market, we found that the single-use based general sensing technologies of our competitors involve detectors (lab grade or portable devices) between $10,000-$25,000. Each sample test costs approximately $150-$250 depending on the specifics of the technology and the complexity of the sample to be tested. Therefore, it is our objective to reach a market pricing that would be competitive to these technologies. Our initial price point that we hope to achieve is $100 per sampling, and $5,000 per detector system.

They are bound by law to investigate every call, and so it was likely that a great deal of energy and resources would be wasted responding to the unfamiliar devices. Instead, Mr. Maag urged anyone contemplating this type of project to get in touch with their local WMD coordinator through their local FBI office to inform them of the purpose, location, and appearance of the devices. This information could then be disseminated through the system so that any calls would be easily resolved.
Regarding the laws governing deployment of sensors on NYC waterways (and sampling in general), the question becomes one of jurisdiction with interactions and coordination across several departments including the FBI, the NYC Police Department (Water), the US Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Health.
The meeting concluded with questions from the iGEM team about FBI procedures and investigative philosophies. It was fascinating, because we found a lot of common ground around the topic of investigative procedures!

Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.

We obtain the expected information that the signal over noise ratio is greater by one order of magnitude for the riboregulated system than for the non-riboregulated system. A drawback from the riboregulated system is that the amplitude of the signal corresponds to the amplitude of the noise in the non-riboregulated system.
The experimental design also allowed us to detect eventual cross-talk with other signaling molecules, the one corresponding to the las system and the one corresponding to the rhl system. No cross-talk was observed with the signaling molecule of the rhl system. However, the las system signaling molecule activated the Lux promoter. We chose to model this cross-talk, which corresponds to the induction of a promoter, by an Hill function. This fitting allowed us to verify that the Hill function was adapted to describe a cross-talk phenomena. The derived parameters indicated that the concentration in the las signaling molecule had to be high in order to have an effect on our system (It was two orders of magnitude away from the needed concentration of AHL to activate the system). Nevertheless, once activated, the effects of these crosstalk are not to be neglected. Check the following article for more information on the experimental setting.
These results are promising and we look forward to fit the dynamic data of this system.

First cross talk experiments
Friday, 11th August
After having constructed the necessary regulator and sensor plasmids we were able to start first cross talk experiments. Therefore we transformed competent cells with different combinations of regulator and sensor plasmids. One example would be the strain siG0024 which contains the regulator plasmid piG0041 producing LuxR under a constitutive promoter and the sensor plasmid piG0051 that encodes for sfGFP. The latter is under control of a pluxR promoter, hence it will be transcribed in the presence of LuxR and Lux. To assess crosstalk and"

Anthocyanin
The magenta pigment will be anthocyanin, a pigment commonly found in plants. It is produced using the following genes: DFR, which codes for Dihydroflavenol 4-reductase (Anthurium andraeanum), F3H, which codes for 3B hydroxylase (Malus domestica), ANS, which codes for Anthocyanin synthase (Malus domestica), and 3GT, which codes for 3-o-glucosyltransferase (Petunia hybrid) (Figure 6).  The E. coli membrane transporter yadH has also been shown to export anthocyanin from the cell (Yan et al., 2008, Lim et al., 2015).  The DFR, F3H, ANS and 3GT genes constitute a pathway that converts eriodictyol into anthocyanin (Figure 7) and overexpressing the yadH transporter in E. coli has been shown to increase anthocyanin yields (Lim et al., 2015).  A key reason for choosing to produce anthocyanin as opposed to a different pigment, is that it can change color according to the pH level of its environment (Yan et al., 2008). This may allow us to have more versatility in making ink of different colour and shades, simply by adjusting the pH of the solvent. The efficacy of this method has yet to be determined.  Previous constructs for anthocyanin production have been submitted to the iGEM Parts Registry (BBa_K1497023).

This process would correspond to Ag43 because Ag43 is belonging to same family and has sequence similarity with AIDA-I [3]. It is generally confirmed that the structural and sequential similarity is correlated with functional similarity in proteomics. And the fact that the passenger domain is cleaved in the 60C will be additional evidence of non-covalent binding between each cell’s Ag43 [4]. The presence of transported Ag43 α domain is predicted in about 10nm of cell surface, so the cells that will aggregate with each other needs to be very close. If there were some obstacles near cells, they cannot aggregate. In other words, if there were rich other large proteins or cell surface structure, e.g., type 1 fimbriae and flagella on the cell membrane, Ag43 would not promote aggregation (Fig. 5) [5].

We appreciate to previous iGEM teams, especially iGEM 2010 Peking University team. We could easily get characterized Ag43 gene derived from K-12 strain flu gene. Compared with aggregation module of PKU iGEM 2010, our aggregation module is induced directly and executes aggregation more rapidly. We assembled a construct which is composed of pBAD+AraC (BBa_I0050) as promoter, ribosome binding site: RBS (BBa_B0034), Ag43 as protein coding region (BBa_K346007) and double terminator: dT (BBa_B0015) on a low copy plasmid pSTV28. (Fig. 6)
Fig. 7  An image of Ag43 expression induced by L-arabinose. If you added L-arabinose to cell culture, AraC binds with it and reveal from pBAD region and the construct is started to transcription.
The induction of pBAD promoter is negatively controlled by AraC repressor. In the absence of L-arabinose, an AraC protein remains in pBAD promoter region and prevents transcription. In the presence of L-arabinose, AraC is released from pBAD by conformational change, and then RNA polymerase is allowed to start transcription of downstream sequence. Consequently, in this devise, we can induce Ag43 protein by addition of L-arabinose. And we inserted additional gene,"

Got the error why kanamycin plates didn't show colonies. It seems I added twice the amount of kanamycin in plates. Since the stock antibiotics were of 1000x concentration, just diluting to 1x would be sufficient. For 20 ml plates just adding 20 µl of any antibiotic would be sufficient. Thus all the kanamycin containing biobricks must be redone.

11. We helped the HUST-China with their promoter sequencing and test. Also they helped us build a part of the oscillator.
12. Beyond the lab work, we also did a lots of interesting things. You can see them in the outreach . We had collaboration with other teams, spread iGEM to the public and social media. And we also paid an attention to the safety. Specially, we held the CCiC meetup in Wuhan in this summer with 16 teams joined. Also we described and evaluated our project from the viewpoints of humanities, aesthetics, economics and law.
As for Best Information Processing Project:
Conventional engineered circuits in cells have only a simple regulatory network to process information. Once the environment changed, the approach to handle the information might be invalid. We adopted an elegant means of systems integration to make the cells have adaptability and work well in complex environments. Our engineered cells can process information according to the environment based on rewirable circuits; meanwhile our design overcame some common challenges in Synthetic Biology like host overload and crosstalk.
As for Best Model:
Different from most modeling work in iGEM, we first described the biological processes related to our project rather than list the equations used before directly. In this way, we made sense of the necessary preconditions we needed and it became easier to perform stochastic simulation. Before simulation, we incorporated useful information from wet lab to adjust some parameters and analyzed how some promoter properties would influence our devices. We revealed that the systems behaviors in the repressilator were closely related to the absolute promoter strength of the weakest promoter among the three genes. Many modeling approaches, including deterministic and stochastic simulations, phase analysis, parameter scanning, theoretical inference, were presented in our modeling part. Moreover, we introduced a novel design principle to help other researchers to finish their custom designs.
As for Best Policy & Practices Project：
1. Enhanced the iGEM community by initiating an iGEM consortium in central China, held a nation-wide meetup, and collaborated with many other iGEM teams in various forms;
2. Increased public awareness by online video, weekly campus seminars and youth educating;
3. Designed the first ethical-analyzing paradigm in iGEM to help future iGEMers open up thinking;
4. Rediscovered various aspects of iGEM with Runic symbol system;
5. Analyzed the behaviours of stakeholders with economics theory and law for policy reference.

Issues concerning Material Transfer Agreement
We obtained the plasmids for the GECO proteins [1] via Addgene. Addgene is a non-profit organization which is dedicated to providing the scientific community with access to plasmid research tools. The nominal fee for ordering plasmids is used to cover operating costs and improve the repository. There is no fee for depositing plasmids. All requests through Addgene require a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA), covered under the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UBMTA). By signing this MTA, we were not directly able to distribute our GECO-BioBricksTM to the Registry.
The MTA only allows distribution of modified plasmids to nonprofit organizations for research and teaching purposes only. This distribution to a third party will require a new MTA. However, both the Registry as well as iGEM does not make use of MTAs. Once we found out about this dilemma, we feared we would not be able to send in our GECO-BioBricksTM to the Registry.
Luckily, however, there was one way to avoid the dilemma by asking the providing scientist, Robert Campbell from the University of Alberta, for permission to distribute the modified GECO-plasmids to the Registry. His response to our request was: 'You have my permission to add the GECO variants to the Registry. I would just ask that our paper describing them [1] is cited in any published work that involves the use of the GECOs.' We hereby would like to thank Robert Campbell for his permission to add the GECO-BioBricksTM to the Registry! Although both Add"

Metal Sensor Team
Introduction
So far, we have shown that our test transformation in Bacillus subtilis with pGFP-rrnb has worked; the plasmid has successfully integrated into the amyE gene of the Bacillus genome removing the bacteria’s ability to break down starch. Today, we need to transform some DH5α E.coli bacteria with a biobrick which we need for our metal sensing system. The BioBrick is called BBa_J33206 which is the Bacillus subtilis ars promoter and arsR gene plus E. coli lacZ and is carried on plasmid pSB1A2. Once we have prepared the BioBrick, we shall insert it into E.coli and grow the cultures on ampicillin plates.
As well as this, at some point in the near future we would also like to carry out a test PCR reaction on the genome of the Bacillus subtilis which will have the pGFP-rrnb plasmid integrated within it. Today we will need to set up the controls as well as the samples we intend to use in the test PCR.
Practical Outline
There are two tasks which need to be accomplished today:
Transform some DH5α E.coli bacteria with BBa_J33206
Rehydrate BBa_J33206 BioBrick
Carry out heat shock transformation protocol
Plate out cultures on ampicillin + LB plates
Prepare samples and control for test PCR of B. subtilis genome containing pGFP-rrnb plasmid
Grow overnights for 3 cultures extracted from plate containing wild type B. subtilis

Goal
To elucidate if the recombinant proteins generated by this sublab are going to be functional.
Background
When performing a protein structure prediction by homology modelling strategies, we usually obtain several independent models. Each of these models, corresponds to one of the proteins which have been linked together to form the recombinant one. Thus, it is not possible to obtain a complete single structure for a recombinant protein only by using a protein homology modelling server.
Strategy
In order to study the possible structure and functionality of the fusion proteins described in this flip-flop system, an indirect docking modelling approach has been carried out. Our approach consists in performing a docking experiment in which we introduce the pdb model of every protein fused in the recombinant main protein. Once the docking method has been performed, the final peptide range of the first protein fused (about the last 30 amino acids) and the initial amino acids of the second protein fused are located in the resulting pdb file, to study any possible interactions. Interactions between these parts of the proteins would mean that the recombinant protein could acquire a native folding structure which would have negative influences to its functionality.
Procedure
Get a pdb model for each protein which is going to be fused. To pursue this, the protein homology modeling server Swiss Model and CPHmodels 3.0 server were used to obtain one putative structure for each protein. The results were compared and contrasted, and the best models were chosen. So, model structures were obtained for the TetR protein and for the Swi6 CDS and the Sir3 BAM protein domain.

pHCMC04 was chosen as the plasmid for our Bacillus genetic construct to be inserted into. This vector yields compatibility with both E. Coli and Bacillus. This vector contained a Bsal site which was corrected for. A PCR cleanup was performed on this vector after performing site-directed-mutagenesis with specially designed primers. 1 μl of DPN1 and 2.2 μl of cutsmart was added to get rid of methylated DNA (containing the Bsal site). The vector was incubated with these reagents at 37 degrees celsius for 1 hour.

A pHT43 vector was order and primers were designed to clone out IPTG from this vector. PCR was performed, along with a gel electrophoresis to verify that the IPTG inducible promoter was cloned out of this vector. PCR cleanup was implemented to purify this clone out.

As Peter Carr said,” Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work”, HP is the link between our experiments and real life and is an integral part of the project. Therefore, we need to carefully design our HP to promote our work to real life, and improve our project to benefit the world based on feedback from HP.
Human Practice
This is NEU_China's third trip to iGEM, and the members of team A are mostly major in biomedical. We are quite concerned about the advances in biotechnology and the cutting-edge research that can make a difference in the medical field. So we want to try a new track, Therapeutics.
Once in a group discussion, a team member shared that her sister's experience with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and we became interested in it. After reading some academic literature, we found that the incidence of IBD is related to the destruction of intestinal bacterial strings, and the incidence of this disease in China is increasing. Therefore, we chose the treatment of IBD as the topic of our project. In addition, we refer to past projects and hope to control the disease by a release of immunosuppressants by engineering bacteria.

His research work spans a broad spectrum of biological                             sciences, with many different interdisciplinary collaboration. He has been engaged in iGEM activities                             for the past 9 years and sees it a very effective way of vertically integrating education while                             training our critical thinking skills. When we're facing problems, he encourages us to explore                             by ourselves rather than directly telling us the solution.

Protein Purification - Dialysis
Finally the fusion protein is dialysed and concentrated. 4.5mL of sample (MonoQ chromatography elution fraction 2-10 of fusion protein) were dialysed according to the purification protocol with dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 1mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5).
Protein Purification - Concentration
After dialysis, 4.5mL of sample of fusion protein was concentrated to a final volume of 0.6mL and  stored at -20℃, according to the purification protocol. Trace amounts of contaminating background was observed, however, the fusion was significantly more in quantity and the background was tolerated for functionality testing. The final concentration of the solution was determined according to the BCA protocol and resulted in a concentration of 0.56mg/mL.

Liz, Kaylee, Elisa, and Ariel did a 7 minute presentation at the Rose-Hulman Undergraduate Research Symposium on the basic premise of our iGEM project, focusing mainly on the development of the plasmids, the problem it addresses, and predictions made by the system’s model. Following the presentation, we answered questions from students and faculty about the project, most of which were geared toward how this could be implemented safely. It was a great opportunity to educate the campus community about our project and get live feedback about areas of concern. One of the biggest concerns people shared was how we planned to keep our bacteria from escaping loosely into the environment. One concerned student asked, “what if your bacteria ate my milk jug and my milk spilled everywhere?” We can use the feedback from this experience to better inform our implementation methods.

The drylab team met briefly on June 17 to begin discussing some ideas.  We went over some of the growing methods for Ganoderma lucidum, brainstormed some non-packaging related ideas for a fungal biomaterial, and discussed how we could test some of the physical characteristics of the final product.  We thought it might be a good idea to test the thermal conductivity if it were to be used as a drinking cup.  We also determined that people probably do not want to drink out of a fungus cup.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields.

We decided to locate TEV Protease gene sequence into pET45-b because our essential want to control protein is TEV Protease. And we decided clonning DAMP-Pexiganan gene sequence into pColA vector.  For clonning DAMP-Pexiganan protein sequence into pColA vector we toke out our gene with NotI enzyme from PSB1C3-DAMP-Pexiganan plasmid. We did ligation with pET45-b vector which digested the same enzyme. Following ligation, the resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21 competent bacteria.
We did colony PCR in order to check the accuracy of cloning with using pColA forward and pColA reverse primers. If the clonning resulted negative expecting band would be 192 bp. On the other hand if we succesfully clonned these part, expected band would be 908 bp.
After colony PCR consequences we have put the positive resulted clonnings 16 hours liquid culture  after that we isolated plasmid DNA with miniprep plasmid izolation method. We make cutcheck to our attained plasmid DNAs for put a second control step. Our restriction enzymes those we used are XbaI and SpeI.

ABOUT KELN
We worked in collaboration with Kyoto to improve KELN. Kyoto developed KELN, a software for supporting to easily make HTML table, and they kindly offered it to other teams. We actually used KELN to create wiki like Achievement , Protocol , Calendar , and InterLab . In that process, we realized some points to be improved and new potential to apply it to wider work area, so we gave Kyoto team feedbacks.
It't a really helpful software in saving times to create wiki for the small teams like us, so we wish this KELN to be more useful and help more iGEMers.
KELN is now available on https://github.com/iGEMKyoto/KELN/releases .

Hill function fitting
After the wet-lab tests were conducted, the florescence–concentration of ths/ttr was fitted using the formula:
F = Florescence
A = the fit of the minimum response with no thiosulfate
B = the maximum response at saturating thiosulfate concentration
k1/2 = concentration of thiosulfate at half-maximum response
n = Hill coefficient
Top10 and Nissle strains with the GFP system in aerobic and anaerobic environments
After the testing via Flow Cytometry, we obtained the following data for the ths sensor:
From these data, we can clearly see that the florescence of bacteria increased with increasing ths concentration.
We used the above-mentioned Hill equation to fit the data, and we found that the data can be fitted perfectly. The figure fitted using matlab is shown below:   However, the data of bacteria with the ttr sensor were not satisfactory.
However, the data of bacteria with the ttr sensor were not satisfactory.
The bacteria were tested with only four inducer concentrations: 0mM, 0.01mM, 0.1mM, 1mM. Thus, we decided to do a second test of the GFP system.
Top10 and Nissle 1917 with the GFP system in an aerobic environment (more Data)
This time, we tested 7 inducer concentrations: 0mM, 0.01mM, 0.05mM, 0.1mM, 0.3mM, 0.7mM, and 1mM.
The data of this second measurement are shown below:
After data input into matlab, we obtained the figure shown below:
However, the ttr sensor still did not work as designed, so the data could not be fitted.
Consequently, we decided to test bacteria expressing the chromoproteins.

1. Motivation
Environmental pollution by plastics has long been an issue of concern across the globe. According to National Geographic, an astounding 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic have been produced and accumulated since its introduction in the 1950s. Triggered by the disturbing facts of plastic accumulation, the world has come up with many solutions to tackle this problem, for example by degrading PET. But there has been no defined solution to tackle Polyethylene, one of the most common plastics, as of yet. The HKUST iGEM team hopes to solve this issue by degrading PE and turning it into useful resources for everyone.
2. Choosing Polyethylene as our Plastic Substrate
Through doing more secondary research from the World Wildlife Fund and ScienceDirect, we identified Polyethyelene (PE) as one of the most prevalent sources of plastic pollution and yet seems to be one of the toughest kinds to eliminate. Plastic bags made out of PE take up the largest percentage of marine debris (90% of all floating marine debris), which caused major damage to aquatic life. On the other hand, people have found it extremely hard to degrade PE, as it is essentially made up of a long hydrocarbon chain with no chemical groups for enzymes to recognize and digest. It has also proven to be very resistant to chemical attacks.
In 2015, the Hong Kong government imposed a levy scheme on PE plastic bags in order to minimize its environmental impacts. Nonetheless, some plastic bag use remains, along with past wastes which wound up in landfills, waiting for millennia to be decomposed. As such, our team is committed to tackle this problem and help fulfil Hong Kong government's vision of a cleaner Hong Kong using our genetic constructs to degrade PE.
3. Taking it a Step Further -  Converting Waste to Electricity
Our team realized, however, that simply degrading polyethylene would produce fragmented alkanes, which could potentially be harmful to the environment as well.
We wanted to turn this problem into an opportunity by using our end product to potentially solve yet another environmental issue. We realized that energy security is another pressing issue which countries face.

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#CRISPR_-_-_TEXT.html," the cells were pelleted and the lysate loaded onto a IMAC column.
After protein purification the elution was tested in Bradford reagent for protein concentration, unfortunately no proteins were obtained. We concluded that the elution solution was not strong enough 100M concentration and we performed this again with a 500M concentration, which resulted in a slight positive Bradford elution.
A protein gel was run to test the purified proteins but no proteins at the Cas9 size could be seen, at this point we realised that we were not using a cell line with a T7 promoters and this would result in our cas9 protein not been expressed.
To correct our errors, we re-transformed the NTU-Singapore cas9 into cells, which have T7 promoters.
We then performed the protein culturing steps again and isolated then eluted the say way as mentioned previously. The results from this Bradford were also positive and the 3 sample Wt, 459 and 662 were run on a protein gel with the results indicating that we successfully purified out the cas9 protein from Singapore.
When then performed the same in vitro testing outline earlier to test its functionality, which resulting in a successful visualisation as the Cas9 cut the PCR product into two portions (1000bp and 200bp).
Further testing was done to try and optimise this system.
Week 8

1 colony of mutant heme #1 was diluted in 100 µL and 1000 µL Milli-Q water and 1 µL of DH5a pure PCR product in 100 µL and 1000 µL Milli-Q water.
Dilutions were boiled for 5 mins (100 µL samples) or 10 mins (1000 µL samples). Samples then pipetted up and down 2-4 times before centrifuging for 10 mins at 13, 400g.
1:1 PCR MasterMix was used.
5 µL of template supernatant for each mutant heme #1 sample with 5 µL of MasterMix.

Oxidative Stress Researchers
Overview
Although for OxyPonics we chose to ultimately focus on the field of hydroponics, we did not forget the wide applicability our biocircuit might have in a variety of sectors. Our biocircuit senses relative levels of reactive oxidative species (ROS) in living systems utilizing fluorescent fusion proteins. By coupling these proteins with light sensitive expression of an antioxidant, we can respond to and regulate ROS levels to a setpoint we decide. This biocircuit can be used to optimize cell growth and minimize damage.
Cornell is an academic research hub with researchers studying oxidative stress in a range of contexts in multiple fields. We tapped into the accessible depth and breadth of knowledge on campus not only to evaluate and validate the conceptual aspects of our potential circuit, but to gain perspective into what other applications our ROS biocircuit could be adapted to. Furthermore, we learned what key considerations to keep in mind as we made decisions concerning our biocircuit and other OxyPonics components.
Key Takeaways
Oxidative stress harms living cells and limits what research can performed on them. Our oxidative stress quenching biocircuit could expand research possibilities in the fields of cell and molecular biology as well as biological engineering.
ROS can cause damage to DNA and high levels will be harmful to plants.
Oxidative stress is a feature of plants’ immune response and small amounts can promote plant health. Hence, a minimum level of ROS should also be maintained.
E. coli and plants may not be able to grow together. We need to develop a physical barrier to enclose the bacteria.
Plants can release oxidants through their roots when stressed, so this would be an ideal location for our biological sensor to be positioned.

BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the flat stage.
Fig.5 For the toxin protein MazF, we concluded that the influence of strong RBS is more evident.
Fig.6 For the toxin protein HokD, the replacement of RBS will influence the expression of hokD. The weaker RBS B0031 leads to lower expression of toxin protein HokD.
We tested the lethal efficiency of HokD and MazF under different RBS. Compared with the positive control (pSB1C3 empty vector), the three experimental groups showed obvious difference. For MazF, the strong RBS B0034 was proved to have highest lethal efficiency. For HokD, the weak RBS B0031 was proved to have the lowest lethal efficiency.
4. sgRNA targeting genome of strains with no NHEJ repair system
To test the effects of Cas9 and targeting sgRNA, we separately constructed two plasmids containing sgRNA and Cas9 protein. We co-transformed the two plasmids into E.coli TOP10, and added 10mM arabinose to induce the expression of Cas9. In order to validate the effect of Cas9 and sgRNA, we did quantitative analysis of colony formation after induction to confirm CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated DSB in E.coli TOP10.
Fig.7 experimental procedure
The cells were diluted 102–104 fold and plated onto agar plates containing AmpR and CmR. The results showed that the control group with no induction was growing better than the testing group when both of them were diluted 103 fold, which means the DSB did have the lethal effect and can be used as a candidate for killer device.

Recombination
Aim
Considering the factor of the potential deficiency of executor killer due to the completely lost of plasmids and the number of ""in-promoters"" will affect our system, we decide to integrate the killer device into the genome. This group mainly provided a tool for genome integration. The insertion fragment is our testing device, including the expression cassette of rfp and killer gene. With this recombination system, we can get the upgraded type of our P-SLACKiller.
Results
1. Coupled CRISPR/Cas9 system with λ-Red recombineering to integrate the donor fragments, but we haven’t finished the second plasmid construction
2. Tried the traditional lambda Red recombination and successfully inserted four testing devices into the genome, locus of LacI.
Experimental details ["

Aimed at the final goal of our project, we simulated the kinetic equations of chemical reactions occurring in each domain, including AT, ACP, KS, KR, ER, DH, and TE. Then we tested these equations and analyzed their feasibility.
DEBS 1 is the first part of the PKS which catalyzes and synthesizes 6dEB, the precursor of erythromycin. Its domain sequence is AT, ACP, KS, AT, KR, ACP, KS, AT, KR, ACP. Theoretically, the kinetic model of domains which have been stacked is match with the kinetic model of DEBS 1+TE.
In modeling section, we kept pace with the members who are responsible for experiment. We stacked the related equations according to the sequence of DEBS 1+TE. Meanwhile, we also simulated the kinetic equations of the whole DEBS 1+TE. Then we compared the equations of domains which have been stacked with the equation of DEBS 1+TE, and verified the feasibility of the model.

Hopeless Case
Hi! I am second year medical student. Participating in iGEM is one of the greatest personal experiences I’ve ever had. The time I’ve spent during the lab works and other activities was very instructive for me in every sense.  Apart from science, music is an important part of my life. I've been playing the violin for 11 years in different orchestras.  I would like to thank our whole team for the fairy-tale summer and the great time we had together. And of course special thanks to our advisors and instructors for all their patience:)

They put forward a lot of suggestions, which are very important for us to improve the experiments.
Here are the inspirations and suggestions we got from the exchange:
The Novozymes Company
—Transformation of results
The intelligent metabolic approach we are studying is very meaningful and the product we chose to validate that our route could work were also very marketable.
The production technologies of amino acids are very mature, so their prices are very cheap. Novozymes and other biotechnology companies choose to produce polymers to form new materials that ultimately increase their added value.
Did our project focus on this new intelligent metabolic line or industrial production of γ-PGA?
We could first transform at the genetic level and then combine our model to filter out the excellent strains which can better improve the yield of products and solve many products and solve many problems in fermentation.
How to achieve high density production and save costs?
Furthermore, they showed great interest in our project. After our efforts, they were finally willing to make an attempt to transform our experimental research into fermentation production.  We visited the fermentation workshop to discuss the specific details of the fermentation production and the precautions as long as we finished exchange.
Unbelievable, they actually agreed with our request. We went farther than we can do. What’s a wonderful experience! Our project took a big step forward, which greatly inspired our fighting spirit. While our competition was about to end, we would also explore the subsequent fermentation production together, and our project would never stop!
Long live our project!

Here, we introduce a truncated but functional DAC, which localizes to the cytosol and can easily be purified. Furthermore, we obtained protein crystals and the protein structure by X-ray diffraction analysis. For the first time ever the 3D structure for this cyclase, which is conserved among all important Gram-positive bacteria, was resolved. This structure will be an important starting point for bioinformatic docking studies (BBa_K1045003)
Best Model Approach:
To test an antibiotic on the new target, we isolated (as mentioned above) the truncated DAC and did activity measurements on it. Using this data, we can now screen thousands of substances for impacts on the function of the DAC (in silico and in vitro screening). Furthermore, we created in vivo reporter systems in E. coli, giving us the ability to sense the amount of c-di-AMP inside the cells, as well as to find possible inhibitors or competitors for c-di-AMP. Last but not least, the combination of the two: An in vivo reporter system with the DAC expressed in the same cell will be the c-di-AMP pathway from Gram-positive bacteria, reconstructed in E. coli. This way, it will be ready to screen for substances lethal to it´s Gram-positive relatives, without harming our host. In consequence, our model will facilitate the search for novel antibiotics hitting a novel target in Gram-positive bacteria.
About our parts
We have two new parts built, namely: BBa_K1045003 , BBa_K1045017
We also improved some parts, one of them is BBa_K1045011
We did qRT PCR analysis, single cell microscopy and RFP analyses in different growth phases of the original part BBa_J23117. These measurements contribute to a highly increased characterization of this part and three others from it´s promoter family. We also inverted this part, thus improving it and making it usable in an inverted expression unit. This we used in order to express our repressor DarR on the same vector as our reporter system. The improved part submitted to the registry is BBa_K1045011.

Hans-Joachim Wieden - Supervisor
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#HP-content_-_-_TEXT.html," the freedom from pain, injury and disease, 4) the freedom to express normal behaviour, and 5) the freedom from fear and distress [9]. These are thought to pose a checklist for any husbandry system [8]. It is quite obvious, though, that most husbandry systems cannot live up to all of the Five Freedoms, and it is equally obvious why this is the case. One might argue that farmers and consumers, like farm animals, are also sentient beings, some of whom cannot afford the high-welfare food which would be produced if the Five Freedoms were properly considered [8]. Therefore, the well-being of animals in livestock is closely linked to economic factors. Yet, this cannot be taken as an excuse for a continuation of mistreating animal rights. The challenge here is to design production systems which can live up to several different types of demand: of humans not wanting to spend a fortune on their nutrition, of those interested in ethical questions concerning animal welfare, of the animals themselves which have to be properly treated, of the economy which has to be kept running, and of course of the climate which has to be preserved.  How does our methane-metabolizing E. cowli do in this unsolved equation? It is supposed to be administered to cows in the form of small alginate beads in which the bacteria shall be encapsulated. Would this harm the animal? We do not think it would. We would even go as far as to say that our approach would harm the animal less than some past approaches do. Most of them have in common that they either target the methanogenic bacteria of the rumen or other organisms associated with them, resulting in a decreased rate of methanogenesis [10]. However, methanogenesis is important in this complex ecosystem because it removes hydrogen which would otherwise inhibit certain microorganisms [11]. In contrast, what we are planning to do would not influence methanogenesis itself and thus the microbial community in the animal’s digestive tract. Therefore, E. cowli does not restrict any of the Five Freedoms.
Nevertheless, some people might be skeptical about feeding live bacteria to cows whose milk they are supposed to drink and whose meat they are supposed to eat. So-called direct-fed microbials are not a new development, though, and have already been used to influence the microorganisms of the rumen [12]. Therefore, choosing this approach was actually not as controversial a decision as it might seem at first. Besides, humans even use probiotics on themselves. More problematic to legitimate might be our use of a genetically modified organism. Its sole modification, however"
William_and_Mary,2015,Team:William and Mary#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," the impact of specific archaeal RBSes in protein expression. Since there is little existing framework for archaeal work, the collaboration effort promoted the utilization of methanogenic archaea or methanogens as a potential substitute host for situations when E. coli is not the logical choice. The study could lay the framework for a new archaea-based InterLab Study modeled after the existent iGEM-sponsored E. Coli InterLab Study. The team imaged 29 samples for the UGA iGEM team and recorded fluorescence measurements for the samples. Data was reported to the UGA iGEM team.
Collaboration With Cambridge-JIC
Cambridge-JIC iGEM 2015 is working on Project OpenScope, an initiative to create a 3d-printable programmable digital microscope. Upon request, we provided them with replicates of fluorescent constructs which we created for the Interlab Measurement Study (J23106 + I13504 and J23117 + I13504). They wanted green fluorescent samples with which to test the imaging capabilities of their microscope and the collaboration allowed us the opportunity to confirm that our some of our InterLab constructs were actually fluorescing as they should. Cambridge was successful in visualizing the fluorescent constructs and sent us images.

Evry,2016,Team:Evry#HP#MOOC_-_-_TEXT.html," questions received from his online students as if it took place in a conventional classroom.
A quick development
MOOCs is thus a new way of spreading knowledge which is only born less than 10 years ago; but when looking at data its development is outstanding.
According to Dhawal Shah - founder of the MOOC aggregator “class-central”, in 2015, there are about 4200 courses which have been set through MOOCs, from more than 500 Universities. Besides, number of students have doubled in a single year, from 16-17 million in 2014 to 35 million in 2015.
Figure 1. “By The Numbers: MOOCs in 2015 How has the MOOC space grown this year?” by Dhawal Shah, published on class-central.com, available at https://www.class-central.com/report/moocs-2015-stats/
Thus, we considered that MOOCs are an efficient way of communicating on synthetic biology since it enables to reach a high number of people at the same time, its development seems exponential and it doesn’t suffer from physical barriers. In order to have an in-depth point of view, we settled some experiments. Moreover, as we were only focusing on MOOCs advantages, we had the feeling that our point of view was kind of biased. Therefore, we decided to consider points hindering MOOCs global development. After some reflection, we chose to focus on the internet digital divide because of the close relationship between MOOCs use and internet access.
Our experiment : Perception of online interactions with high school and university students
Even though distant learning is the essence of a MOOC, we were wondering how students perceived courses given through a screen instead of physically, and whether they would be willing to incorporate this format to their daily courses.
We decided to recreate the MOOC format in a physical classroom, before asking feedbacks from students.
For practical reasons, we recorded a video of the course in which we developed different topics to introduce high school students to PLA and synthetic biology. However, since the distant interaction between participants and the MOOC's  teachers is a key element, we established a video call with students during our MOOC session.
Helped by the Parisian “Maison des Initiatives Etudiantes” (Student’s Initiatives House) we gathered in a professional studio to record our home-made lessons.
As our course was entitled for high school students, the main difficulty was to synthetize complex notions in short videos. We had to adapt our vocabulary and define basic concepts in order not to be too technical. For instance,"
