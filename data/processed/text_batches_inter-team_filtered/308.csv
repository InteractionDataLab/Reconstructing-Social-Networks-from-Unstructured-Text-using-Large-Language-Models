Inoculate with G. hansenii culture and incubate at room temperature for up to one week or until desired volume is achieved.
Troubleshooting tips:
Contamination - When producing cellulose in large vats, contamination by fungi or bacteria can become a major issue.
Recommendations -
Be certain to work with G. hansenii in the hood and to thoroughly seal the vats.
You can also try adding an antifungal that will not act upon bacteria to the medium.
The strain of G. hansenii we are using has some resistance to kanamycin, so you could perhaps try adding that. Wild-type bacteria sometimes have natural resistance to certain antibiotics, so we ran a quick experiment to see if G. hansenii is resistant to any of the antibiotics in our lab. There was some growth in the kanamycin plates / cultures – however, it was too slow to merit the addition of kanamycin to all cultures.
You could also try transforming the G. hansenii via electroporation (see 2014’s adapted Acetobacter transformation protocol here ).
If all else fails, you could grow G. hansenii in a large (and we mean LARGE) Erlenmeyer flask. This significantly reduces risk of contamination, although surface area is limited.
No growth – The cellulose has stopped growing after a while.
Recommendation - If cellulose is no longer being produced, try adding extra glucose/fructose. Bacteria can’t make cellulose out of thin air!
Cellulose Processing: By solving key issues in cellulose processing, we hope to expand the possibilities of microbial cellulose. We identified brittleness to be the major problem, given that it results in poor flexibility (especially bad for folding) and limited strength of material. Additionally, we theorized that breaking down residual cell components could improve cellulose binding and sheet color. After an investigation spanning from literature reviews to DIY paper making forums, we decided to use glycerol to greatly enhance flexibility and integrity, as well as acetic acid to gently remove extraneous cell structures and pigments from the cellulose.
Here is the protocol we developed to process cellulose sheets:
Soak in acetic acid for one hour.
Wash with ddH2O a few times.
Soak in glycerol for one hour.

Since he is focussing on a different area but does not seem to be completely uneducated in websites and webdesign and is 24 years old, we decided     that if we cannot find another skilled (younger) person, we can try it.
5.) Group photo
A preliminary group photo was taken last week and will be included in the booklet as long as we don’t have another one.
6.) Scaffoldin
Udhaya, Julian and Verena met up with Ela and Silja to further design the Scaffoldin. On the first meeting some interesting organisms for putative     cohesins/dockerins could be found. Now Ela compared a variety of cohesin structures (sequences) from those organisms by alignment and bioinformatical     reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. Ela gave all organisms a letter code. For example: “CTHE” for Clostridium thermocellum. Due to the fact that     we want to use (only) 4 different cohesins, we need to cut off scaffoldin proteins that naturally offer more than 4 cohesins in the protein structure. To     ensure that there will be no unexpected interactions with our desired cohesins (and to have a back-up if the first construct doesn’t work), we finally     decided to go with a naturally long scaffoldin protein and a shorter one which only harbors 4 cohesin places:
1) Main construct : Clostridium thermocellum
Scaffolding protein CipA (cohesin type I) with dockerin type II. CipA contains in sum 9 cohesins. The first two are somehow     disconnected by a CBM (cellulose binding motif). A deletion could"

We hope that this description of and business concepts and the word list of complex medical terms we have also included can inspire future teams to think about the product development of their projects.
We have divided our product development in two different parts: the journey to finding a need and the journey to putting a product in the market. We have taken this decision for a matter of simplicity and thought this is the key point to do so as the product design step of the product development is a turning point for the innovator in which there is a change from a more social, value based mindset to a more utilitary and practical one.
Disease state fundamentals
What is this?
Disease state fundamentals is establishing a detailed knowledge of the relevant disease state, with a particular focus on its mechanism of action. A disease state fundamentals  is key to validating any need and understanding how it can best be addressed.
Word list
Physiology:The way in which bodily part functions
Epidemiology:The study and analysis of the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in defined populations
Pneumothorax: There is a tear in the lung and air escapes into the chest cavity
Dyspnea: Shortness of breath
Recurrent sinusitis: The small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead get inflamed
Mucociliary clearance: Self-clearing mechanism of the bronchi
Anatomy of the lungs
The human lungs are a pair of large, spongy organs optimized for gas exchange between our blood and the air, as our bodies require oxygen in order to survive.
The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes, that branch many times into smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli. Small blood vessels called capillaries run along the walls of the air sacks.1.
Physiology of the lungs
When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the capillary blood At the same time, a waste product, carbon dioxide (CO2), is removed from the blood, into the air sacs. This gas exchange process brings in oxygen for the body to use for vital functions and removes the CO2.
The airways and air sacs are elastic, each air sack fills up with air like a balloon, and deflates when breathing out.
The air sacs are covered in a viscous substance"

In the latter case, it is not important to choose specific atoms. Instead, a catalytic residue of the amino acid such as “OH” or “Nhis” is specified. The next lines of the TEMPLATE::ATOM_MAP      record define the residues using one-letter or three-letter-codes that are prefixed by “residue1” or “residue3”, respectively.      The second record, beginning with the tag “CONSTRAINT”, contains all relevant distance, angle and torsion constraints for the matching. Each constraint is described with five parameters.      In the case of the distance constraint, the first parameter describes the optimal distance “x0” between the chosen residues, the second parameter describes the tolerance “xtol”,      the third parameter defines the strength “k” and the fourth parameter specifies the type of bond (1 for a covalent bond, 0 otherwise). If the modulus of the difference between the actual distance “x”      and the specified optimal distance is smaller than the tolerance, then the penality score is zero. Otherwise, the constraint consists of the term
k*(|x-x0|-xtol)
to the penality score. For the angle and torsion constraints, the description is similar.      If necessary, additional hydrogen bonds to other atoms of the ligand are specified in terms of additional blocks, using the tag “VARIABLE::CST”.      Finally, most of the blocks described above can be optionally followed by an “ALGORITHM_INFO” record that stores details of the matching algorithm by parameter values.      We refer to the Rosetta documentation for further details.

If unicode_c of each chain is different with others, then we could sort the chain list by comparing their unicode_c (just the same with comparison of two strings). However, it is not always so: chains with same unicode_c may be equivalent or not. It is due to the mark asterisk *. Unicode_c knows where are the binding sites, but it does not know the binding details of that part. In other words, unicode_c could not solely determines the order of the chains since it lacks of information of the trees defined in our Chain-Node model. The forest (set of trees) in Chain-Node Model describes the binding details of parts in chains. We need to find something like unicode_c to represent the essence of the associated trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bond state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i',j') if i < i' or i = i' while j < j'). The recursive definition of tree nodes' weight make it possible to sort the forest. For convenience, we add a virtual node ROOT, whose weight value could also be obtained under the general rule, as the root of all trees in the forest and make a conversion from forest to tree. The tree structure could be uniquely determined by recursively sorting all children of each nodes by their weights.
Back to the question above, if two chains have the same unicode_c, which should be arranged ahead? The answer lies in the exchange of them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees. The tree structure (with virtual root) is also possible to change. If the tree structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If"

Thus, if we wish to choose $N_0$ to ensure that $p_0(\infty)\leqslant 10^{-3}$, then we require \[ \left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)^{N_0}\geqslant 10^3 \] i.e. \[ log_{10}\left(\left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)^{N_0}\right)~=~N_0 log_{10}\left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)\geqslant 3 \] and finally, \[ N_0\geqslant\frac{3}{log_{10}\left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)} \]
For example, if $\mu=1$ and \[ \lambda=1.01,\quad 2,\quad 10,\quad 100,\quad 1000, \] $No$ must be chosen such as \[ N_0\geqslant 695,\quad 73,\quad 10,\quad 3,\quad 2,\quad 1. \]
It is a little bit more difficult to determine $p_0(\infty)$ when $\lambda=\mu$ because the expression $(\star\star)$ is not defined when $\lambda=\mu$. But, by reminding us that the exponential is $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ on $\mathbb{R}$ -particularly in $0$- and admit so a Taylor-expansion in the neighborhood of $0$ :
\[ e^t~=~1+t+\frac{t^2}{2}+\frac{t^3}{6}+\frac{t^4}{24}+\ldots+\underset{t\rightarrow 0}{o}(t^n) \] we can write $p_0$ as \[ p_0(t) = \left(\frac{{\displaystyle\mu-\mu(1-(\lambda-\mu)t+\underset{\lambda\rightarrow\mu}{o}((\lambda-\mu)t)}}{{\displaystyle\lambda-\mu(1-(\lambda-\mu)t+\underset{\lambda\rightarrow\"

Since the KAN plates were old, it might be speculated that the plates were old, and so, the colonies were not selected for KAN resistance.

The gel stab PCR produced a product of the right size, but the 2kb side product was still brighter. The 2-PCR protocol also still had substantial side products but at least they did not completely overshadow the real product. We will accordingly go ahead and do a gel extraction on the 2-PCR samples so that we can try lambda red with them next week.

4. Extract the DNA of the remaining bacteria with miniprep (See “minipreparation” protocol).
5. Digest cultures with XbaI and do an electrophoresis to verify the size of the plasmids.
6. Select those clones that show fluorescence and have the correct plasmid.
Measurements
1. Cultivate the selected clones in microcentrifuge tubes during 15 hours with 600 µL of LB media. Remember that the tubes must have a hole in the cap.
2. Take 200 µL of every tube to a black 96-Wells plate (of COSTAR). Also, include a negative control (LB media).
3. Measure in a Plate reader (Biotech Synergy HT). Set the excitation filter of 460±40nm, emission filter of 528±20nm and sensibility of 60.
4. Process the data in Excel. The Optical density (OD) and fluorescence of the media is subtracted to the data. From the results, divide the highest OD to every data to obtain a correction factor. Then multiply that factor to the fluorescence to obtain the relative fluorescence.
5. Graph the resulting data.

AtNHXS1 consists only of 4 transmembrane helices, the C-terminus and the 5 nearest transmembrane helices were deleted, resulting in the increase in Na+/K+      selectivity ratio described previously [15].
Fig.2: Comparison of AtNHXS1 and AtNHX1. AtNHXS1 was generated through DNA shuffeling and lost 5 transmembrane helices and the regulatory C-terminus. This mutant of AtNHX1 is more efficient and is not negatively regulated, resulting in higher sequestration.Integrating this transporter into the vacuolar membrane of a plant could increase the salt tolerance.
AtNHXS1 also shows 2 mutations (L29P and S158P) in its amino acid sequence that might be responsible for the increased sodium transport activity and thus enable increased sodium sequestration      in the vacuole [15].
AVP1 is a  vacuolar membrane bound H+-pyrophosphatase, which is encoded by only a single gene [23].  It hydrolyses cytosolic inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) to orthophosphate (Pi) to use the      derived energy to actively pump protons into the vacuole [24–26]. This process not only reduces the cytosolic PPi concentration, but more importantly acidifies the vacuole [27,28].      The difference in electrochemical potential for protons across the tonoplast, generated by the vacuolar H+-ATPase and AVP1, can then be used by vacuolar transporters, e.g. AtNHX1,      to pump ions into the vacuole [27,29,30].
Fig.3: AVP1 uses pyrophosphate to pump protons into the vacuole thus causing acidification of this compartment. The proton gradient can be used by secondary active transporters like AtNHXS1 to pump ions into the vacuole against their concentration gradient.
AtAKT1 is a potassium channel originally from Arabidopsis thaliana root tissue. It mediates potassium uptake over a wide range of potassium concentration in the extracellular room [31–34].      While there are multiple other families of transporters involved in potassium uptake, AtAKT1 specifically is a high affinity transporter in the plasma membrane [35–37].

THIS IS HOW WE DO OUR THING!
Our protocols
LB medium preparation
Five grams of tryptone, 2,5 g yeast extract, and 5 g NaCl were dissolved in 500 mL deionized water, its pH corrected to 7, 00, and autoclaved on liquid cycle (15psi) for 20 min. The solutions were let cooled and the required antibiotics were added as follows, and kept at 4°C:
Antibiotic
   Concentration   
Ampicillin
100 µg/mL
Chloramphenicol
25 µg/mL
Kanamycin
50 µg/mL
Tetracycline
10 µg/mL
Table 1: Bacterial selection – antibiotic concentration.
LB-Agar medium preparation
Antibiotic free LB medium components were mixed with 7.5g of agar to final volume of 500 mL, dissolved with deionized water, autoclaved (15psi) for 20 min, and before solidification, the respective antibiotic were added at the final concentration specified in Table I, and distributed in Petri dishes. The dishes were kept at 4°C.
Preparation of competent cells
A single clone of E. coli XLI blue and DH5α were inoculated into 50 mL LB medium, kept growing overnight at 37°C with 250 rpm shaking. Then, 4 mL of the culture were transferred to 400 mL LB medium and grow approximately 8 hours (OD600 = 0,390  XLI Blue and 0,4 DH5α).
The culture was aliquoted in pre-chilled 50 mL tubes and maintained on ice for 10 min. Then, tubes were centrifuged for 7 min, 1600 g at 4°C and supernatants poured off. Pellets were resuspended with 10 mL ice-cold CaCl2 with the tubes kept on ice. A second centrifugation steps was done for 5 min (1100 g, 4°C). The supernatants were poured off and the cells resuspended with 10 mL ice-cold CaCl2, once again tubes"
LZU-China,2015,Team:LZU-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". All of these countries belong to developed country.
We drew some interesting conclusions from all of the 369 questionnaires.
During the research, we tried to let the respondents estimate the heavy metal pollution level in the earth and choose some countries and places suffering from severe heavy metals contamination without providing them with any statistics. After collecting enough data, we compared and analyzed the questionnaire statistics we collected.
Fig 1  A map we painted based on the statistics of the questionnaires. The white spots on the map represent those places that are considered to be suffering heavy metal pollution in water.
Obviously, from the public perspective, severe heavy metal pollution usually occurs in industrial areas and comparable prosperous cities in the developing countries. Without a doubt, it is very easy to understand that the environment is sacrificed to get economic growth.
In fact, for most countries, when it comes to their growth from ‘developing’ to ‘developed’, with multiple factors including population growth, industry accumulation, imperfect industrial techniques along with climates and geography of their own, actually do have more and more severe heavy metal pollution.
We did the similar analysis of China according to data from Chinese questionnaires as well.
Fig 2  A map of China river basin and the red spots represent those places that are considered to be suffering heavy metal water pollution.
According to the Chinese residents, whatever the pollutant is, pollution seems always concentrate at the middle and downstream of a river. At the same time, the industrial center of China lies at the downstream of the Yangtze River and Yellow River, so these areas are believed to be the worst-hit by heavy metal pollution. However, taking the Yangtze River as an example, there are several polluted areas in the upstream which are in the same severe situation as the downstream.
Fig 3 Serious heavy metal pollution in water considered by respondents.
The data of this graph comes from our Chinese questionnaire as well. Most people regard mercury, lead, copper and chromium as the most serious heavy metal pollution. On the one hand, it may be an objective reflection of present situation in China. On the other hand, reports from different media in recent years might contribute to the variation of the data, because the reports about mercury , lead, copper and chromium contaminants were in the majority, which corresponds to our graph. But we still need to do some professional statistics when it comes to how serious it is about the heavy metal water pollution in China.
What’s more, the analysis of our questionnaire survey around the world verified the necessity of our idea and project.

Our project focuses on the translocation of three different CDI systems from EC93 and Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 (containing two CDI loci) into one lab strain of E. coli to create a super-soldier organism that is able to selectively inhibit the growth of these strains. A lab strain containing CDIEC93, for instance, would be able to target all bacteria containing the corresponding receptor for CDIEC93, which would in this case be BamAEcoli. In order to target EC93 itself, however, we aim to switch CdiA-CTEC93 with a toxin from ATCC 13048 so that the immunity protein of EC93 does not prevent growth inhibition. It has previously been shown that CdiA-CT regions are modular, and systematically modularizing the toxin region using appropriate restriction sites is another goal of our project. While the CDI system in EC93 targets the BamAE. coli, the relevant receptors in other species of pathogens and even in other strains of E. coli is unknown. An additional facet to our project would be to find the receptors that each CDI system of ATCC 13048 targets by creating a transposon insertion library. Mutants that display a whole or partial CDI immunity phenotype will be sequenced to determine which genes have undergone transposon insertion, providing insight into which receptors may be targeted by ATCC 13048 CDI systems.

Methodology
In order to test the expression of foreign CDI systems in DH5-α and Enterobacter aerogenes, we need to express CDI systems on a plasmid. Our plan begins with two cosmids given to us by the Hayes lab located at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Each cosmid contained either the CDI system from EC93 or EC869 and was expressed in EPI100 or X90 (respectively). As a control, we performed aggregation assays and competition assays on these two bacteria. The next objective was to extract and express the cosmids in DH5-α to see if we could express foreign CDI systems in DH5-α. We would also perform competition and aggregation assays on the transformed DH5-α. Assuming this is successful, we would move on to expressing both CDI systems from Enterobacter aerogenes into DH5-"

Complete Project Information- Beyond the Summary
Abstract
Codons are groups of three nucleotides that specify a single amino acid, which is then added to a growing polypeptide chain during translation. Even though each codon spefifies only one amino acid, some amino acids are coded by multiple codons. It has been demonstrated that the genome of E.coli shows statistical preference for some of these degenerate codons over others, and it is hypothesized that these codons translate more efficiently than non preferred degenerate codons. We constructed synthetic reporter genes entirely from codons hypothesized to be fast or slow,and characterized them in E.coli. As of right now, we have characterized the level of GFP expression in G3, the fast coding sequence for superfolder GFP. GFP 2, the common coding sequence has been successfully transformed in the plasmid and data is expected to be analyzed for that variant by the giant jamboree. There are still issues with getting a dRBS in the G1, rare, and G5, the calculated slow insertion time. G4, the slow codons, has not been successfully introduced to the backbone, so it has been decided to forego this variant due to time constraints.
Illustrates the principle of codon redundancy. The number in each degenerate codon refers to the criterion that would lead to it being chosen.
Why is this important?
Examples of bioproducts vital to our lives are medicines, fuels, and even industrial chemicals. Codon optimization is important because it gives engineers an additional point of control over protein synthesis.
Our codon optimization research is important for the additional reason that it will help future researchers to develop more comprehensive models of translation. A better understanding of translation is an example of a foundational advance in biology that will lead to faster, more efficient research in many areas of biology. If, for example, our research shows clearly that certain degenerate codons are preferred because they can be translated more efficiently this will allow scientists to search for a mechanism that predicts these effects, and will invite engineers to redesign genes to be translated more efficiently.
Metaphor Alert: Codon optimization can be thought of as an extra dial that can be tuned to rationally control output of genetic systems.
Background
Codon optimization refers to the idea that the"

Wednesday (06/06/18)
Lab 1
The students spent most of the day brainstorming ideas in order to host a meet-up for nearby iGEM teams. At the meeting with their mentor, the students discussed the viability of different “search and attack” mechanisms and current research being done to possibly implement into the project. The team brainstormed and looked into different ways of being able to sense fungi.
Lab 2
The students of the RX lab picked colonies from the plates that were streaked the day before.  These picked colonies were streaked onto a new plate of LB with ampicillin and then flicked into a culture tube filled with LB broth with ampicillin.  After these steps were finished, the students then traveled to UES to research various topics for project ideas
Thursday (06/07/18)
Lab 1
The LabPats began the day by making plates with chloramphenicol resistance. The students plated their old E. coli cells from last year and letting it settle in incubation. Later in the afternoon, the students and mentors discussed the viability of their project idea and creating a basic plasmid outline to begin sequencing through IDT.
Lab 2
The students of the RX lab performed a mini-prep of their culture tubes as a way to teach the new members of this process and as a refresher to the previous iGEM students  The students then traveled to UES to continue research each of their various topics.
Friday (06/08/18)
Lab 1
Early in the morning the students listened to a presentation given by Vanessa about fungal contamination on aircraft. The students were very excited as they themselves were working with biofilm contamination in aircraft fuel tanks and it was very eye-opening to listen to their own mentors talk about her own research in the area. The students were able to learn a lot and absorbed new information on how to approach their project and design their own plasmid module. Next, the plates with the old colonies from last year were put in the fridge to be grown as a cell culture on Monday. Afterwards the students began introductory MatLab courses on modelling and how to model synthetic biology in order to enhance their project this year.
Lab 2
The students of the RX lab started their day by attending a mandatory general safety presentation for their inprocessing.    After, they were trained on how to perform a digest of the of the extracted DNA.  They next formed a gel and ran the digested DNA on the gel.

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," , which is a blue protein that makes the mycelium greener. The idea of optimizing the appearance of the fungal products is appealing to a company such as Ecovative Design, as this creates more business targets.
Another point of interest for Ecovative Design was the idea of strengthening physical properties of the fungus, where we have been investigating if it is possible to control either the branching pattern or the cell wall thickness of the fungus.  Through our research, we found the gene gfA, which synthesizes the limiting metabolite in the chitin pathway (1). In addition to these genes, we have modelled the growth of the fungal mycelium and its branching patterns.
In parallel to working with the genetics of the fungal engineering, we also tackled the process of protoplasting and transforming filamentous fungi. Ecovative Design shared their protoplasting protocol with us and we got to work on implementing the protocol.
During our experimentation, we tried to optimize the protocol by substituting an expensive reagent, driselase, with a more affordable one. We used higher concentrations of Glucanex than originally and different digestion times instead of following the protocol with their digestion times and concentration of driselase. It was originally speculated that only Glucanex could be used, increasing the profitability of Ecovative Design. However, further research is needed as we did not successfully produce any protoplasts in any of the tries.
Green Challenge
The Green Challenge is an annual challenge at DTU in which students can enter with either a startup or a project. We entered with our iGEM project to take advantage of the hundreds of experts ranging from researchers to politicians in multiple subjects. As we were still in the early process of our project, we knew that we would gain most by keeping it simple and let the experts ask us questions to learn more about aspects in which we had not really thought about yet. Therefore, we only presented ourselves as ‘Mycomaterials’. There was encouragement from most and one of the winnings projects of the event was also regarding mycelium products for common use.
SnapChat takeover
We were lucky enough to be offered to take over the DTU SnapChat account for one of the three days of the BioBrick Tutorial. Our vision in doing so was to primarily let the roughly 11,000 other DTU students get an inside view of what being a member of the DTU Biobuilders means. The takeover happened before we had settled on a project, so the main focus was showing the event and bringing the audience along in the activities that took place during the tutorial."

Figure 7. Gene circuits of the control groups. (a) Plamsid C1   differs to the original plasmid in that Linker2 is shifted to Linker3, which is a 8aa flexible protein domain linker   that cannot be cut by rTEV protease. (b) Plasmid C2 has the coding sequence of INPNC and Linker2 deleted. (c) Plasmid C3 is a plasmid with only the promoter, RBS and terminator left on the   vector.
Cells of the experiment group and control groups were cultured to the exponential phase. Afterwards rTEV protease   as well as buffer were added to the cell cultures according to the protocol from the company. The cell cultures were   co-incubated with rTEV protease and centrifuged afterwards to separate the cells and MVN-mRFP that was cut down by   the protease. The fluorescence intensity of the supernatant could stand for the amount of MVN-mRFP and was measured   by microplate reader (experimental details are described in the Protocols).
The same procedure was applied to every group for 3 times. The average results are shown in the chart below (see Chart 1), and the fluorescence intensity data is shown in A.
Chart 1. The fluorescence intensity data measured by a microplate   reader.
As can be seen from the results shown here, the fluorescence intensity of the experimental group is higher than   that of the C2 and C3 groups by a large margin. Considering the precision of our equipment, this can demonstrate   that the MVN-mRFP fusion protein is truly displayed outwards by using the INPNC displaying system. The   results of the Experimental group and C1 group are close and it may be because of the breakage of Linker1 when we   centrifuged the cells. However, the relatively high result of the C1 group is still in accordance with the   demonstration.
E. coli - M. aeruginosa binding assay
This assay is the final testing to identify the binding effect of our genetically modified E. coli. First,   we designed and constructed the plasmid for the experiment group (see Fig. 7). As described in the Design, we   inserted 2 transcription units into the same vector pSB1C3. One transcription unit that encodes INPNC-MVN under a constitutive promoter was first introduced by the means of PCR and Gibson Assembly. The second transcription unit   that codes for GFP only was first constructed in another plasmid"

Aachen,2018,Team:Aachen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Taking melatonin for a sleep problem might deprive yourself of an effective treatment that a physician could be able to give to you.             Soft measures for improving sleep could be nightly rituals and other non-medicinal measures.             Basically, the benefits of melatonin have really conclusively in my personal opinion been only shown in jet lag and to some extent             to the indication of Circadin at the moment.             So if you ask about short-term safety risks we are not that worried, but we are with using it for a long time and with indications where             it might not have any kind of effects.
Katrin: I read that a side effect of taking melatonin is blood in the urine. Do you know where that comes from?
Taina Mattila: Unfortunately I don't know. But of course melatonin is a hormone,             that is involved in a lot of different systems in the body and has the potential to affect them.
Katrin: Circadin is only allowed from the age of 55 years onwards. When the company wanted it to be allowed,             they only asked to allow it for the age of 55 years onwards. Can you imagine why             they took this limit and not for example and didn't allow it for all adults?
Taina Mattila: The main large trial was performed in patients over 55 years of age.             So the data for lower age groups was not available to such an extent that it could be approvable.             There was a lot of discussion in the CHMP and in the end, it was approved with a majority decision.             You should also know that the indication is specifically for insomnia characterized by poor sleep quality.             So it is not an overall insomnia indication and it is limited to age.
Katrin: Is there a discussion about lowering the age limit?
Leon Bongers: In general one can say that the age limit will not shift as long as the company is not asking for             it because a change or an application is made by a company.             And as long as a company does nothing, the age limit will not change.             So they have to substantiate why the age limit could be lower. But I think they have no chance of lowering it in normal healthy people.
Taina Mattila: They would be asked to show some new data for it, so I don't think the company is interested in doing studies for that.
Katrin: I recently read that Germany said that that there are not so many studies, and also there are no long-term studies.             What can you tell me about it?

Safe Project Design
Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment
Including an ""induced lethality"" or ""kill-switch"" device

EPFL,2016,Team:EPFL#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," can see the iGEM is not only a competition about synthetic biology but also about education, teamwork, and communication. For students this means that participating in iGEM is considered to be a very complete course/curriculum during their studies. Furthermore, participating in iGEM gives a diverse set of skills which is readily appreciated by future employers – notably: teamwork, research skills, organization. Interestingly, just over half of respondents felt that iGEM helped develop their leadership skills and commitment to quality, and less than half felt that iGEM helped increase their writing and data management. To a certain degree, this is understandable. In our experience – and this was confirmed through our interviews, teams have a tendency to split up tasks among group members. Only some will do most of the writing, and handle most of the results. Worryingly, though, is that only half of respondents felt that iGEM improved their commitment to quality. This may be due to the fact that this is a fast-paced competition, and the emphasis is often placed on getting a certain list of things accomplished rather than creating projects that are fully functional or well designed. This may also reflect the fact that some teams are left feeling disappointed when large amounts of effort put into specific tasks go unrewarded because they don’t meet judges’ criteria. To ameliorate this in the future, maybe more importance should go towards good experimental and project design in the judging procedure.
When asked to describe what they would want for future iGEM teams that they did not have, the most cited issue was a lack of proper mentorship during the competition. Time restraints were also cited as a common issue. Although it is difficult to develop a suggestion that can be applied to all groups, as iGEM is treated differently in different places – for us, for example, it is a summer project that gives us credit towards our bachelor’s project – these two shortcomings might be alleviated, in part, if iGEM encouraged more schools to offer iGEM as a semester-long class preceding the summer. This would ensure that group mentors are actually available to the teams they are sponsoring, and that the proper time is taken before the summer (when most teams are working the most) to plan out and set up the project.
Happily, and somewhat unsurprisingly, all participants shared their memories about the Giant Jamboree and responded that it was a wonderful experience. For most of them it was the first participation for a large scientific event and allowed them to be prepared (and excited!) for future ones.

Protocol Model Development
Prior to beginning the development of ProtoCat 3.0, we did research                   on currently used protocol models. We began by brainstorming with members of our team who had                   lab experience to get a foundation upon which we could improve. We tested the robustness of                   this initial model by trying to represent the protocols uploaded to ProtoCat 2.0 with our new                   model, tweaking and updating it along the way. Once we felt our model could adequately handle                   the protocols we anticipated in ProtoCat 3.0, we met with our adviser, Dr. Santiago Schnell,                   and ran our protocol model by him. Taking his feedback, we went back and further refined our                   model to the one that we use in our current implementation of ProtoCat 3.0.
Standard Protocol Format
Standardization in synthetic biology has gained a lot of traction,                   such as the BioBrick and Registry of Standardized Biological Parts. However, the procedures                   used to generate them tend to be diverse in nature, with a bacterial transformation                   protocol likely requiring different information than a ligation protocol. Online protocol                   repositories must account for such differences when creating their data models, which will                   usually require either a simplified model (such as solely text-based) or a more arduous                   upload process. These different models become a problem when trying to share protocols between                   the repositories, because the formats that the protocols are stored in are not compatible and                   require an external conversion tool to get from one format to the other. In order to begin                   working towards a standardized protocol format format, we reached out to OpenWetWare and                   Protocols.io, two well known protocol repositories. We have began discussing how we will                   reconcile our respective protocol models in order to get the best protocol model. The first                   steps have been taken to build a cooperative relationship and create a standard protocol that                   will help make protocols even easier to use, test, review, and design.

More realistic characterization
Currently, we have characterized our constructs by growing our engineered cells in media buffered to varying levels of pH, and then by measuring fluorescence normalized by optical density over time. Alternatively, we plan to test our constructs by dropping pH over time, as what might occur in the oral environment after mealtimes. By simulating the pH fluctuations in the oral microbiome, we hope to achieve a more accurate representation of the utility of our dual-state promoter in the intended environment.
Incorporate genes for oral health
Ultimately, we envision our dual-state promoters being used to appropriately induce genes that might prevent tooth decay. A variety of genes have been identified the encode proteins and molecules that combat tooth decay.
For example, Tsumori et al. were able to prevent the formation of a dental biofilm by using the mutanase gene, which isolated from Paenibacillus humicus. S. mutans, a major bacterial culprit in the progression of tooth decay, uses glucosyltransferases located on its outer bacterial membrane to synthesize glucan from sucrose. Glucan is a water-insoluble molecule with a high mutan content that S. mutans uses as a link to bind to one another and to the dental surface. In the presence of mutanase, an enzyme that breaks down mutan, Tsumori et al. were able to suppress the formation of S. mutans biofilms.
Alternatively, other plaque bacteria, such as Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus rattus, and Lactobacillus fermentum, have been implicated in returning the oral pH to neutral, or slightly above neutral, through the production of ammonia. These bacteria have developed the arginine deiminase system, which encodes the enzymes arginine deiminase , ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and carbamate kinase, in order to do so. These three main enzymes are used to produce ammonia from arginine found in the diet and saliva. In the future, the arginine deiminase system may be isolated and linked to a dual-state pH-inducible promoter to combat pH fluctuations"
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," to the individual citizen, but also to the community as a whole, as it creates a sense of city cohesion and hence a high quality of city life.
Mrs. Dienhart introduced us to several considerations that shaped large parts of our project. We do not know the needs of every urban area in Odense and consequently, we have aimed to create a device that is changeable to a city in movement such as Odense.
Furthermore, this interview was also a source of inspiration for our ethical and safety thoughts. While we ought to strive for a sustainable tomorrow, we do not necessarily have to provide an exhaustive description of what the future should look like.
Interviewing the City Renewal Project My Bolbro
Rikke Falgreen Mortensen is the manager of the Bolbro’s city renewal project called Mit Bolbro i.e. My Bolbro. We arranged a meeting with her with the intent of further investigating how the PowerLeaf could and should be integrated in an urban area of Odense, in this case the neighbourhood of Bolbro.
Bolbro is an old neighbourhood in Odense historically known to be the home of the working class. While Bolbro provides a homely atmosphere known to the locals, it has had a hard time attracting new residents. However, this is subject to change as the neighbourhood in 2016 received approximately 1.6 million US dollars to renew its city space and to create an even more appealing, and vibrant neighbourhood. This will be achieved by including the locals, as Bolbro is characterized by having a strong, engaging civil society. Mrs. Mortensen is not only an expert in urban renewal, but also in how to include local citizens in reshaping the public space in which they reside.
Mrs. Mortensen also argued that a changeable design would be the optimal solution to fit the challenges one faces in creating a vibrant, green city ambience. Such a task depends on different preferences, laws and needs. A technology needs to be both flexible and accessible to successfully contribute to the process of creating an engaging city environment. She showed great interest in our device and even offered to implement it in the parks of Bolbro, should the product become a reality.
We had a discussion with Mrs. Mortensen about the creation of a prototype based on the wishes of Bolbro’s local citizens. Following this conversation, she provided us with a pitch that aimed to help us develop this prototype.
“Hauge’s square is a spot in Bolbro, which we aim to make a central place in Bolbro; a place that invites the citizen to meet and dwell. Your solution should be able to contribute to help citizens"

Many were intrigued by synthetic biology. By the use of questions and discussions, we were able to clarify common misconceptions of synthetic biology and were also able to detail its many applications in the field of biology. We were happy to be able to partake in this event as it allowed us to interact and educate students who will be entering college. We were successfully able to explain synthetic biology was also able to bolster public awareness of the field.

During our Bake Sale Fundraiser, we spread knowledge on synthetic biology, while giving students brain fuel during Finals Week and raising money for our research. We were successful in communicating our project with fellow students and faculty. As we were in the library, many students passed by and were intrigued by our poster (and snacks). When they asked what our cause was for, we introduced them to the iGEM competition and the field of synthetic biology. As they learned about synthetic biology, we also explained our project, which they found fascinating. During this event, we were also fortunate to meet Dr. Devinder Mahajan, the Graduate Program Director for the Chemical Engineering Department, who was fascinated by synthetic biology and our project and offered to meet with us to discuss the ramifications our project may have in the energy sector.

With this visit, two of our team members presented to a research class with students ranging from sophomores to seniors at W.T. Clarke High School, a local high school in the East Meadow School District. We explained what iGEM is, the importance of synthetic biology and how it works, and what our project entails. In addition to spreading the knowledge of iGEM, we discussed how important it is to engage in research, and explained how one could start obtaining research experience at an early age. As a reminder of how molecular biology is fun and exciting, we gave the students temporary DNA tattoos. The teachers at WT Clarke High School enjoyed our visit and asked us to come back to present to first-year students. We gifted the faculty with the forum activity from Building with Biology called “Should we genetically engineer mosquitos?” to bring further interest about the ethical considerations of synthetic biology. We also sent them our PowerPoint® as a resource for future students. While engaging students, we hoped to spark more interest in the field of synthetic biology by showing them the many opportunities that are available for them.

Results Summary
As of 18th September 2015, we have achieved the following. The data can be found in the time line of key experiments below.
1) We assembled BioBricks that alter bacterial glycogen. We have detected changes in branching but have been unable to detect the addition of acyl groups by putative acyl transferases by NMR. This might be because the amount of acylated glycogen is below the detection limit this method. We are currently considering different methods for measuring acylation and mining for more putative transferases. Expression did not interfere with glycogen production. This might be because the enzymes made few or no modifications or because, as predicted by our model, enzymes that can modify any carbon positions do not compete with the glycogen synthases and alter the structure and yield of glycogen. Interestingly, the mass of glycogen increased with one putative transferase. This will need to be repeated and investigated further as this enzyme may have an unexpected activity.
2) In plants, we have been able to direct proteins for modification of glucan chains to the chloroplast, the site of starch synthesis. We have also demonstrated that the quantity of starch produced is not affected by expression of these enzymes. We now need to produce plants stably transformed with our constructs in order to be able to obtain enough starch to analyse.
3) We have also cloned the coding sequences of the butyrate synthesis pathway, which requires eight coding sequences in two separate BioBricks and into a single BioBrick. We were unable to detect the desired production of butyryl-CoA  in lab strains of E. coli by LC/MS. We are now planning to troub"

Alberto, Thom and Siwat met Dr. Stephen Webster, a science communication professor, who gave hepful feedback on the science comm framework. He also really liked the philosophical perspective of PixCell (the nature-machine interface). Also today we finally received our stipends ! Also we received sponsorship for molecular Maya, a  super cool software to model and animate proteins, and DNA in 3D.  Also we received sponssorship from SnapGene, amazing! Next monday we have the presentation to the centre, we need to start thinking about real applications. Tom Ouldridge proposed a system to keep cells spatial separated by making that some cells survive only at certiain voltages. You can do a lot of ""interesting things in non-homogenous pots"".

Today, in wet lab the Kanamycin V3 worked but the V4 did not. In the afternoon, Thomas and Alberto miniprepped the sucessful V3. Josh updated the protocols.  Luis and Will got comsol licence from a chemical engineering professor and had a talk with Tom about modelling. They decided to continue to use Matlab and maybe use comsol when it is needed. Luis and Will coninued working on modelling the redox small molecules.  People were also preparing the ppt for next Monday's presentation.

Cell growth curve on the plate reader was set up. Luis, Will and Josh spent a lot of time with Tom Ouldridge discussing about the model. Also Alberto and Josh prepared the pyocyanin solution in the fume hood, as it is very toxic. And it's an amazing prussian blue color.  Ferrocyanide is a ""mediterranean sun"" yellow. At 5, Ben Reeve (CSO from CustoMem and former Imperial iGEMer) came into the lab to chat with us about our project and how to improve team dynamics. A flat structure is ideal. It is important to do social activities outside the lab as well.

Another important part: bilayer
Simulate the actual membrane
One type of human bilayer = have a smoother curve
Or a hydrocarbon bilayer/disc
Talk to them if we could have a simple bilayer with true phospholipid
Explicit water on the outside
Size of the environment (10nm cube, etc.)
Ask if there is data already existing
Friday, August 26th
The team also met with a PhD scholar, Xiaoan Li, whose research project focuses on water filtration using nanoporous membranes. Robert, a student who works in Li’s lab, is also in the meeting. He was a previous member of the winning iGEM team in 201_. Here’s what we talked about:
Ask Dr. Mayi or Deirdre about other membranes that we could test
Examples
centricon: small scale version, 5kD (ask Goodarzi’s godmother): not as big, small scale purification, good for centrifuge works
filter sterilization membranes (0.22 micron)
Watch 2011 NASA - video
figure out what carbon nanotubes we need, they got some. They have PPL, carbon nanotubes. Once we’ve tried everything and still fail, then we should ask them.
Other ideas
dissolving O2 on the actual membrane
We need less than 200 nm of pore sizes
SEM, AFM: contact Matthias Amrein - does lung cells; Michael (runs SEM)
use something conductive, Teflon is not conductive

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Law&Patents_-_-_TEXT.html," issues need to be addressed on a national level. Furthermore a funding instrument called the ‘Mobilization and Mutual Learning Action Plan’ exists at the moment, an ambitious project that attempts to bring together all stake holders and try to let them work on a joint agenda. More specifically if they think that a new technology is emerging, that can cause new controversies, they can talk about the societal ramifications.
Currently the European Commission has an idea to fund a big project in the area of synthetic biology, in which research conducting bodies themselves submit proposals. For example an interesting issue to be tackled is to find ways in which synthetic bio fuels could best be developed in a technically feasible, economically viable and socially acceptable way. The EC wants to set up a framework to support such projects.
The results do not necessarily have to go in a code of conduct. The idea is to create a base, trying to create certain awareness about the societal aspects of synthetic biology and indeed also stimulate an early engagement of society with the field. One of the good things that have come out of the long protected debate about GMOs is that the EC has gained a lot of knowledge on how to organize those type of interactions with society. It is not easy as there is always a certain limitation to what can be done by the EC.
We, the K.U.Leuven iGEM 2011 team, remarked that we also had a debate on synthetic biology and found it difficult to rise the awareness of those people: synthetic biology is really technical. It is indeed a big challenge: the earlier you have this engagement and the earlier you start interaction with the public, the more vague it is. At this stage what one can say about synthetic biology is limited. Therefore it is definitely difficult to really get the attention of citizens: you have to speak about the impact on their daily life, on changes to their daily practice and the gain for them. This was also a lesson that was learnt from the earlier debates on GMOs.
The challenge at the moment is indeed the question “Whether it’s already the right time to reach out to the public?”  To address this the EC has been in touch with more professional stakeholders, policy makers, NGOs and the National Ethics Councils as they are professional representatives of society, are easier to identify, have some more knowledge on this field and can spend some more time in looking into what happened in this field.
Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Objections
Intrinsic objections involve claims that state that ‘developing and using a certain technology is inherently wrong regardless of the results of doing so’. The others are “extrinsic objections” involving claims that this technology"

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," who informed us on the ethics, biosafety, and biosecurity of putting our projects together and then testing with human users. The questions and concerns raised in our dialogue with domain experts informed our design process greatly, and also made us realize that greater education and public awareness about synthetic biology was needed. As a result, careful considering was given to how we wanted to implement our projects.
Safety Issue Concerns
Because we are a computational team, we did not create and BioBricks devices. Instead, we simulated the hierarchical creation of these devices in Eugenie . Although users may not be interacting a genuine lab environment, lab safety can still be increased by exposure to software simulating synthetic biology experiments. Through our user study testing, we discovered that in general, the students expressed increased understanding and appreciation of both the theory and technical aspects of synthetic biology research and experimentation. Various errors and warning messages were created in our software itself to educate students about the concepts each project was conveying. And each time our team iterated, these messages were refined based on user experience. While we did not create concrete biological parts, our efforts indirectly inspire safer creation of BioBricks in the future.
Keeping Ourselves and Our Users Safe
The Institutional Biosafety Committee, under the Wellesley College Office of Environmental Health & Safety regulates biosafety concerns on campus.  However, we are a computational team and do not work with biological organisms or hazards in our local lab environment.
Intern Yoav demoing zTree to
high school students
The Wellesley Human-Computer Interaction lab does test iterations of our software projects with human subjects. Before each testing session, participants were asked to sign consent forms detailing the voluntary nature of the study, the task involved in the study, and were informed that if at any time during the study they experienced discomfort, they are permitted to stop and leave. We were extremely sensitive to a user’s physical, mental, and emotional demands during each study, taking notes on physical and verbal cues from students; we were very assuring during the study, and informed our users that any crashes or technical difficulties were our fault as designers and programmers and in no way their fault or responsibility. After each study the user task was altered or refined further to clarify the task and increase student comfort in testing out our software project, and participants were compensated as appreciation for their assistance.
Working for the Future
Throughout our research experience, both in the wet-lab and in the software development process, we practiced and emphasized collaboration, communication, safety, awareness, and outreach, as well as the concepts of abstraction, modularity, standardization, and protocol. All"

NTNU_Trondheim,2018,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"Goal:
Separate the PCR product from circular DNA
Isolate the linear DNA (pgRNA with anti-luxS from the gel
Transform the linear DNA into competent cells
InterLab study - transformation of plasmids to competent cells
Procedure:
Separation of linear DNA from circular DNA:
The leaner DNA obtained from PCR (from day 8 – 29. June. 2018), was separated from the circular DNA (original plasmids) after running the sample (25 μL) mixed with loading dye (5 μl) on gel electrophoresis (gelGreen) simultaneously with a ladder (1 μL gene ruler + 1 μL loading dye + 4 μL dH2O) for 50 min at 90 V. The sample and the ladder were prepared by the gel electrophoresis protocol.
Gel digestion and DNA isolation:
The agarose was digested and the DNA was isolated from the sample following the gel purification protocol.
Determine the DNA concentration and purity:
The concentration and the purity of the isolated DNA was determined by using Nanodrop.
Transformation of PCR product to competent cells: The PCR product (5 μL) was transformed to competent cells after following the transformation protocol.
InterLab – transformation of plasmids to competent cells:
The plasmids listed on the protocol, was transformed into competent cells (DH5α) after the following protocol:
Thaw the competent cells on ice (10 min), and pre-chill the eppendorf tubes.
Resuspend the DNA in the wells (provided by iGEM HQ) with dH2O (10 μL).

   i. Strength:
         1. Convenience.
         2. Adaptability.
         3. High Cost/Performance Ratio.
         4. Inelastic to change in test conditions.
   ii. Weakness:
         1. Technology Barrier.
         2. Branding Barrier.
         3. Strict Market Admittance Criteria.
         4. Distribution Barrier.
   iii. Opportunity:
         1. Favorable national economic condition.
         2. Positive national policies.
         3. Uprising Health-consciousness.
   iv. Threats:
        1. Well-established industries control the high-end markets with related products.
        2. Industrial chain is currently complete
        3. Technological applications are matured
b. Comments:
   Comparing to technology equipped by clinics and hospitals, The use of adjustable aptamer and genetic modified microbes made JACOB more economical, adaptable, and stable. The integration of automated proceeding made JACOB more user-friendly and portable. JACOB does not need professional physicians reading results, behaving like glucose meter but less risky. In China it is likely to be deployed in units of household or local communities. Similarly, for United States the Food and Drug Administration classified the core mechanism of JACOB as Class I medical device (if designed to not detecting cancer biomarkers), means no premarketing control is required. It is worth noting though"

He is experienced in industrial economics research.  Professor Liu’s team is currently promoting CAR-T therapy for solid tumors, including liver cancer. We interviewed Professor Liu on campus on June 25th Topics include:
[Read more] [Backwards]
Q: What do you think are the economic characteristics of modern gene therapy and biological therapy?
A: They are expensive but can be very effective.  One must judge a product by both its price and its effect.  To fully consider this, a cost-benefit analysis is sometimes necessary.  For example, if a drug can prolong the patient’s survival time by three years while another can do ten years, it makes such a great difference for the patient that even if the latter product is much more expensive, he/her would probably still favor it.  As for the affordability, modern biologics’ prices are getting lower and lower each year as the technology is improving so fast, medical insurance system also adapting, so I guess we shouldn’t consider this as a significant problem.
[Read more] [Backwards]
Q: How do you choose projects for investment?
A: We try to avoid projects that are too popular when selecting projects for investment. During the interview, we also asked about the future of genetic drugs.  Professor Liu affirmed the prospect of synthetic biology and showed enthusiasm towards the future development of genetic drugs.  Currently gene therapy has only been applied in rare diseases or lymphomas and there remains a big gap for genetic drugs to be ever used against solid tumors.  This project shows our effort toward filling such a gap and in theory it is a promising strategy for the treatment of liver cancer.
[Read more] [Backwards]
What did we learn?
The pharmaceutical industry tends to avoid investing in over-popular products as to reduce the intensity of competition and to keep the profits as big as possible.  This indicates that newly-developed, investment-seeking projects need to be unique and innovative.
[Read more] [Backwards]
As a matter of fact, our project has been retrofitted to the possible side effects of canonical RNA interference and has adopted a new target, which is at the forefront of current gene therapy.
Professor Liu also told us that it is very important to look at the market and competitors when evaluating our own project, during which adjustments should be made according to the current demand of the market.

What did we add?
Indeed, only by conducting a complete cost-effectiveness analysis can we evaluate whether the project would be cost-effective. "

Fig. 3 Minimum, maximum and average levels of mRNAs and protein for BamA, OmpA and lgA
Tab. 3Average, minimum and maximum number of protein molecules after 2 hours
Protein
Number of molecules
Average
BamA
2.8*1020
OmpA
2.78*1021
IgA
3.44*1021
Minimum
BamA

2.63*1019
Maximum
BamA
1.28*1021
OmpA
1.28*1022
IgA
1.58*1022
In average, minimum, and maximum cases the protein expression of OmpA, lgA, and BamA follows the same trend which is unaﬀected by ﬂuctuations of mRNA level. Each protein is expressed at a rate primarily proportional to its length and to a magnitude primarily dependent on the mass of available DNA.
Sensitivity Analysis
Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Testing (FAST) indices represent the proportion of the output variance of the model attributable  to a particular variable and its interactions. Focusing on BamA expression as the protein of interest, total order FAST sensitivity indices were calculated using the BamA protein level each 20 minutes as the model output (Fig.  4).
Fig. 4 FAST sensitivity analysis of BamA
As it can be seen from the graph, number of BamA plasmid copies contributes most to output variance over the whole time span. Also, BamA mRNA degradation rate is considerably faster than BamA degradation rate - with mRNA halﬂife of the order of minutes and protein halﬂife of the order of hours - hence the greater FAST index.
Conclusions
Prior to starting the wet lab experiments, we had hypothesized that the addition of mRNA into our system would ensure that BamA folded and inserted into liposome membrane more efficiently, thus enhancing the expression of OmpA and IgA. Therefore it was decided to purify BamA mRNA and add it to the reaction mixture as a template instead of DNA as we assumed that skipping the transcription step would increase protein synthesis"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Nucleotide Design_-_-_TEXT.html," very sequence of DNA as incorporated nucleotides and read during next generation sequencing as a ratio to a reference nucleotide. The ratio of incorporated reference and substrate/product nucleotide is proportional to the catalytic activity of the biomolecule, which catalyses the catalytic conversion.
The spectrum of attachable substrates defined defines the capabilities of such catalysis recording system. Taking advantage of the chemical synthesis, virtually any substrate can be linked to the 2'-Deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate 2’-OH and N4- functional groups. The combination of modifications added to the nucleotide, chemical and biochemical reactions allows to create a dynamic system which can account for almost all of the enzyme catalytic reactions.
1. Oxidoreductases
As the name implies, oxidoreductases catalyze the oxidation and reduction reactions. A range of substrates containing alcohol, carbonyl or carboxylic acid, amine or ether groups with different carbon backbone can be used to measure the catalytic activity of oxidoreductases - alcohol dehydrogenases, monooxygenases, reductases, cytochromes. The main approach, shown below., utilizes the instability or chemical properties of formed reaction products. Covalently linked product molecules spontaneously and easily (beta elimination reaction) are removed from the modified cytosine, switching the state of the nucleotide to accessible.
2. Transferases
Transferases catalyze the transfer of functional group from one compound to the other. The most popular transferases are phosphotransferases and aminotransferases. Cytosine linked substrates bearing carbonyl/amino, hydroxyl groups with a specific carbon backbone are easily synthesized and can be used for specific catalytic reaction activity recording. Image below. depicts main example of such catalytic “activity” recording. Reaction product, bearing carbonyl group takes part in beta elimination reaction to producing accessible 2'-Deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate.
3. Hydrolases
Hydrolases catalyze the transfer of a chemical group from substrate to water molecule. Functional groups of interest present in the substrate can be easily linked to 2'-Deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate 2’-OH and N4- positions and can act, not necessary, as the connecting bond. Utilizing the vast majority of connected substrates, different amidases, esterases, phosphoesterases, glucosidases and sulphotases can be screened. Image below. shows an example reaction cataly"

Freiburg,2016,Team:Freiburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the feedback differs from previous result, since now we gave others an insight in our final medical approach and thoughts.
Another great opportunity of sharing and collecting experience was the iGEM meetup in Marburg, Germany. We reached a whole new level of communication since we were able to exchange information directly with other teams and present our project in front of this motivated audience. All the positive feedback and tips of the iGEMers really boosted our motivation Gladly we were able to exchange informations and developed bonds with other teams. In this way, ideas for new collaborations formed and a resulted in our Bacillus subtilis manual.
In the end we wanna thank everyone for participating in our surveys, giving us the opportunities to gain more knowledge, improving our project in different ways and raising awareness for the field of synthetic biology and our project of targeted drug delivery. Finally we can say that for progress, indeed, communication is needed.

Afterwards, they were spun down for 1 minute in a microcentrifuge.
At this stage, the samples could be stored at -20oC or ran on a gel immediately.
Two gradient gels consisting of a 12% separating gel and a stacking gel were prepared and the samples ran at 100V until proteins reach end of the stacking gel at which point the voltage was increased to 200V for 20 minutes.
One gel was stained using Instant Blue and the other was used to transfer the proteins onto a membrane.
After the proteins had been transferred onto the membrane, the membrane was blocked in 5% Marvel milk overnight at 4oC.
The next day, the membrane was washed 3 times in 1xTBST buffer and then suspended in 10 ml of 1xTBS buffer to which the primary anti-His antibody was added and left for one hour. The protein ladder was cut off before adding the primary antibody.
The membrane was then washed 3 times in 1xTBST buffer for 5 minutes and then suspended in 10 ml of 1xTBS buffer, to which the secondary antibody was added and left for one hour.
The membrane was then washed in 3x10 ml 1xTBST buffer for 5 minutes.
The blot was then soaked in developing solution for 5 minutes before being wrapped in a plastic cover aligned with the protein ladder that was cut off at step 12.
Once in the developing room, the film was exposed to the blot for 30 seconds, 2 minutes and 5 minutes and then placed in the film developer.

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," water bear can survive from UV, and the bacteria can also survive from UV, so it is certain the CAHS protein works.
As for the colony recovery rate, the CAHS also showed great effect. The B+ group colony recovery rate was highest, which reached about 40%. While those of the B- group and B0 group were no more than 2%. After being irradiated by UV for 1min, the B+ group was still the highest in the three group (UB_B0, UV_B+ and UV_B-).
Figure 12. The colony recovery rate. (B0 is E.coli BL21 without BBa_K2623014, B+ is E.coli BL21 with BBa_K2623014 and IPTG, B- is E.coli BL21 with BBa_K2623014, UV means the desiccant bacterial under UV for 1min.)
Here are the pictures of the culture plate. We used the disposable plastic petri dishes, and appended the sealing film on the aperture. When we started, we used the glass petri dishes, but the effect was not obvious at all. All the petri dishes had chloramphenicol, and the B0 group bacteria had transformed BBa_S0100.
Figure 13. the plate of colony for counting. (B0 is E.coli BL21 without BBa_K2623014, B+ is E.coli BL21 with BBa_K2623014 and IPTG, B- is E.coli BL21 with BBa_K2623014, UV means the desiccant bacterial under UV for 1min. And the 104 & 105 means Dilution ratio)
Conclusion
Our experiment shows the great function of CAHS protein in improving the desiccation tolerance and UV tolerance. We think that the CAHS protein is a very potential protective agent for bacteria storage. Except expressing the CAHS protein with plasmid, we can also knock the CAHS protein gene into the genome of bacteria through homologous recombination. And we believe that a new way for storing the bacteria is available.

Interested in engineering the living, I joined the iGEM 2010 Paris team. I think iGEM is very formative on both scientific and human side. I couldn't miss this adventure. We won the Best Foundational Advance Prize. This year, I'm the advisor of the iGEM Grenoble team. It's a new challenge because Grenoble takes part in iGEM for the first time. I want to share my experience with them and help them to reach the Final.

I am a microbiologist at the university of Grenoble. In the past, I have combined biophysics, molecular biology and bacteriology to understand the functioning of Escherichia coli. More recently, in a systems biology approach, I have used precise measurements of gene expression to test predictions of mathematical models of the corresponding regulatory system. Synthetic biology, and thus iGEM, is the next step in understanding biological systems: if we really understand the functioning of a system, we can modify its behavior. In iGEM we move from designing a desired behavior to instantiating the network in the real organism: a formidable challenge in"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," for creating photomasks
The first step we had to take towards the production of liposomes was to design, fabricate and prepare a unique microfluidic device. A microfluidic channel design was created with the AutoCAD platform. The prototype acts as a photomask during the photolithography to create a master for the fabrication of microfluidic chips.  Our design consists of an array of 16 separate microfluidic channel devices distributed parallelly in groups of four on a single chip (Fig. 2). The dimensions of the microchannels limit the size range of the synthesized liposomes. To dig deeper into the details of how the dimensions of the microfluidic channels influence liposome size we created a phase-field based SynFlow model with COMSOL Multiphysics. Auxiliary parametric sweeps were performed that defined the dimensions needed to attain cell – sized liposomes, a range from 5 µm to 30 µm. The final design can be downloaded here and used by anyone interested in the synthesis of liposomes.
Fig. 2 a AutoCAD design for the photomask. There are 16 individual microchannel devices on a                                        single chip. b One device consists of three inlets, an outlet and a star-shaped junction.
Photolithography as a tool for microfluidic chip fabrication
After calculating the exact parameters for microfluidic channels and receiving a printed photomask, photolithography is performed to create a master for microfluidic chip preparation. After completing this step, PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) is poured on to the master left in a thermostat overnight. Inlets and outlets are punched with a biopsy puncher, and the PDMS is cleaned and plasma treated before attaching it to the PDMS coated microscope glass slides. Fig. 3 presents a simplified scheme demonstrating photolithography and other +6steps towards creating a microfluidic chip. To learn more details about the fabrication process, refer to our Protocols . We called our chip LipoDrop.  The final form of LipoDrop is shown in Fig. 4.

Establishment of New Human Practice
Here we present an outline of our workshop for the benefit of other collegiate iGEM teams reaching out to high school iGEM teams. We believe that formal collaborations between college and high school represent an innovative new approach to human practices with benefits for both the high school and collegiate teams. This was an effective way for us to engender excitement about both synthetic biology in high school level students as well as for our college students to demonstrate further mastery of the field of synthetic biology in general and their research topic specifically by creating presentations and activities designed for the high school level.
1.  Do an activity that will get the students up and moving. They sit behind a desk all day,You need to get them excited!
2.   Explain the point of the activity in a way they can relate.
3.  Show an interesting video to give them an explanation from another perspective.
4.  Do an experiment to give them hands on experience and a real-life example of your topic in action. This will also give the students a chance to see real culturing methods and use equipment. Be sure to give demonstrations of proper techniques and safety protocols.
5.  As the students finish the experiment, talk to them in small groups about their results. Why did they see those results? The students will be more willing to ask questions and explain what they know in a small group setting.
6.  Introduce the topic of synthetic biology with a short video or activity.

Then we started to name anything that popped up in our heads. After going back and forth for a bit and discussing what we wanted, we settled with possibly calling the exhibit BacPack and having three extreme environments: Mars, The Deep Ocean Cave, and Antarctica. After that, we came up with some criteria and some goals for this exhibit. We also listed some of the environment details as well as what could possibly be engineered in those different environments. That night, Vivien, Sam, and I were all assigned to research some past iGEM projects

Today was a day full of paper prototyping. I felt like I was in elementary school again from all the paper cutting and coloring. It was honestly a lot of fun and super helpful because I got to really understand every single step of our interaction and our prototype.
6/18/2015: Day 13
Today we did more prototyping, and we actually finished our prototype!!!! Orit’s children also came by to interact with our paper prototype. They were very engaged and interested in the prototype, and we ran through the prototype a few times with both of them. They gave us really interesting and helpful feedback such as adding videos to our project, and challenge states that added more complexity to our prototype. We are going to talk about their feedback in depth tomorrow and next week.

Today we went to the NEGEM meetup at Boston University.  A lot of different team from various schools in the New England area came. It was really exciting to see so many people at this meet up. To be honest, I was really nervous to present today because the whole room consisted of people who were very experienced with biology. It was cool to sit through all the presentations about project ideas. NEGEM was really helpful because we got a lot of really helpful feedback from the people participating. It was definitely a great experience.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioSensor Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html,". We also added a FLAG, lumino and 6x histidine tag in order be able to extract the expressed protein using nickel column purification. The lumino tag is a specific six amino acid sequence that binds to the LumioTM Green [4] which allows the fusion of the lumino tag and the chromoprotein to be detected on an SDS-Page Gel without having to run a staining protocol. The FLAG tag allows for anything after its sequence to be cleaved off of the protein when the extracted protein is incubated with enterokinase [5].This was done in case the lumino or histidine tag interfered with the chromoprotein structure.
Additionally, a cellulose binding domain was added to each of the chromoproteins. This cellulose binding domain was from the BioBrick BBa_K1321366 which also has a GFP fused to it. For the purposes of our experiments, we isolated the cellulose binding domain from this part using PCR. The cellulose binding domain sequence was isolated from Cellulomonas fimi and has been shown to bind irreversibly to cellulose [6]. In order to ensure that the addition of this larger protein did not interfere with the structure of the chromoproteins, we extracted both the chromoprotein without the cellulose binding domain and with the domain and ran the same heat testing experiments.
The extracted protein was concentrated using microfiltration tubes then allowed to dry on cellulose sheets which had wax wells printed on them. These cellulose sheets with the dried chromoprotein were then placed in a preheated oven and the temperature was increased at five minute intervals until a temperature change was observed.

Ideas
For Human Practice, we found out that activities such as unpreceded use of agrochemicals and long-term application of urban sewage sludge, industrial waste disposal, waste incineration are the main sources of heavy metal in agricultural soil. While remediation of heavy metal in contaminated soil is done by physical and chemical processes which are costly and non-sustainable.   In this case, we planned to combat heavy metal pollution problem in the soil through the alliance between microbe and plant, by manufacturing our chassis——Bacillus megateriumthrough getting the different complement of metal-binding proteins that handle metals inside cell as a metal-trap to alleviate metal stress of phytoremediation.
Metal-binding proteins
Our alleviating system refers to two kinds of metal binding proteins-MT and MBP derived from 2014 Cornell( BBa_K2384007 ) and 2010 Peking University Biobricks( BBa_K346003 , BBa_K346004 ) respectively.
MTs(metallothioneins)-are low-molecular weight, cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins found in wide variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi and all eukaryotic plant and animal species. MTs contain 61-62 amino acids and are structually composed of two globular metal-binding domains(α and β) with metal ion. The C-terminal α domain contains 11 cysteines and the N-terminal β domain contains 9 cysteines. The 20 cysteine residues in MTs allow it to bind up to a total of 7 cadmium ions.[1]Several systems have been developed to allow for stable construction and high level expression of recombinant proteins in bacteria. To avoid being degradated by proteolytic enzyme, the expression of MT in frame with GST allows for stable expression. Im previous research, the fusion protein was prone to increase metal ion sequestration in E.coli, this time we intended to try to express fusion protein in our chassis.
This figure is engineered metal binding domain of MerR family.( Protein structure constructed by BNU )

We are only 7 members on the team. Even so, we did most of the work ourselves. Torleif, Marthe and Ragnhild spent hours after hours in the lab. And after a lot of frustration, sweat and even some tears they managed to finish the project on time right before the due date. We have two informatics students on the team, Roza and Paul. Roza designed her first webpage (our wiki) almost alone and she did a really good job. Camilla helped her a lot on the wiki and she edited the images for the wiki. Hans made a supercool 3D-printed model on his own and he even did the electrics by himself.
Despite this, we did got some help and this page is dedicated to you. Thank you all for helping us, in one way or another. This project wouldn’t have happened without you!

High Fidelity PCR
To amplify MEpKantME (~1kb, entails full expressional cassette for kanamycin resistance, flanked with MEs), high fidelity PCR was done using pSB1K3 as template DNA and IV013 and IV014 as forward and reverse primers respectively. PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol.
The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 45sec and an annealing temperature of 65°C. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 4 °C.

Jun 29: A day at MIT
Today, we got a break from all the coding and spent the day at MIT. We watched a physics lecture by professor Walter Lewin and then met up with the MIT iGem team for lunch. I had to leave after lunch, but the rest of the team spent the day checking out the MIT iGEM team’s lab and hearing about their project.
Jul 2 & 3: Back to MoClo
Me and Kara have continued our work on the MoClo designer. Much of the structure and layout of the user interface is falling into place and we have begun to focus on the behavioral aspects of the planner. The big feature we need to tackle is getting drag and drop properties to work on all parts of the planner. Seems a little complex to me but Kara and I have already hurdled over some speed bumps so hopefully this shouldn’t be a huge problem.
Jul 5 & 6: Drag and Drop
Still working on the UI. We have gotten a lot of smaller functions such as a search box, mock parts adders, and other things working but drag and drop is giving us a lot more trouble than we had hoped for. Even when we get drag and drop to work in one area of the program, the type of drag and drop need in another part of the program is different and requires a new set of methods.
July 10: Progress
We've been struggling with drag and drop for a couple of days but we are finally getting it to work consistently. We were having the most trouble transferring data between different workspaces. We have consistently taken the approach of creating a duplicate of an object on a touch down event, having the duplicate take the place of the original object, and dragging the original object between workspaces.
July 11: Lonely at the Lab
I spent much of today touching up the UI of the MoClo planner so that I can begin more work on the backend of the planner. Consuelo, Wendy, and Kathy were gone to BU today so the lab was a bit quiet today. It was eerie...
July 16: Backend
I spent today working on the backend of the MoClo planner. I was working on making sure that the data sheet populated with the correct data from the registry of standard biological parts and I began a bit of work on making the publications page populate with the correct information.
July 18: Beach Day
It was a nice break from work!

Qu’est-ce que iGEM ?
International Genetically Engineered Machines ( iGEM ) est une compétition internationale de Biologie Synthétique, organisée par le Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) où s’affrontent plusieurs centaines d’étudiants issus des plus grandes universités du monde.
iGEM est basé sur un concept simple de standardisation des gènes, les BioBricks . Chaque gène devient alors simple à utiliser et simple à agencer afin de permettre l’ingénierie du vivant de manière systématique.
Les grands objectifs sont de promouvoir le développement open-source d’outils pour l’ingénierie en biologie et contribuer ainsi au développement d’une société utilisant les biotechnologies.
Pour nous, iGEM est avant tout une formidable expérience professionnelle et humaine. Les étudiants doivent y concevoir un projet de R&D, organiser et mener un programme interdisciplinaire, travailler en équipe, communiquer et promouvoir son travail à l'international.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#SiruiNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Monday, the meeting was rather short.  Orit suggested that we focus more on things having to do with troubleshooting, and features that can be added to the ELN that deal with visualizing troubleshooting in the lab.
Friday, 6/8: Casey and I had a meeting with Orit today about microinteractions.  Orit suggested that we look more into sifteo cubes as it might be used in the art project for the future, and that we should also focus on interactions that can be done on the bezel.  A lot of the research that we thought weren't ""feasible"" might actually be more realistic than we previously thought- the beauty of HCI!
Week of June 11th: Interviews, Background Research, & Brainstorm Sessions Galore
Nahum and I are brainstorming features for the ELN.
Monday, 6/11: Today we visited BU today and finally met the wetlab members, Shawn and Monique.  Wendy, Casey, and I did a presentation on the basics of HCI, and also did brainstorming for the development of the ELN.  We covered some ideas we had for the ELN, microinteractions on the beast, and the art project, compiled from our presentations last week.  In return, Traci did a presentation/crash course on topics in biology to be covered this summer in the lab, as well as the MoClo method, which will be the main focus of the wetlab team this summer, as they will be using it to characterize parts.
First meeting of the Wellesley and BU 2012 iGEM teams.
Tuesday, 6/12 & Wednesday, 6/13: These two days we had a massive-scaled brainstorming session.  Our lab took over one of the physics classrooms upstairs, and taped poster-boards to the walls.  Then, we divided up the groups based on projects covered: art project, semantic search, ELN, and Beast, and then go to work on brainstorming.  Not only did we draw all over the boards, but we also wrote down on sticky notes comments and concerns, and then shared them with the rest of the team.  The upside was that we threw around a lot of ideas, but the downside was that there were a lot of ideas to digest, and no established way to organize all the ideas, so some ideas that might not be essential now, but come to good use later were laid aside.  There were a lot of information thrown at us today; I think we might need a few days to digest everything,"
