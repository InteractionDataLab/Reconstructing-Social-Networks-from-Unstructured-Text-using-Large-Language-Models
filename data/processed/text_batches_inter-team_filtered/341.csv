Question:
On a region polluted by the Heavy Metal,
Should we use E. coli designed by iGEM Nagahama?
Frashman opinion by Moriyama Takuto
We thought how to use E.coli designd by our team. We must not take out transgenic organisums out side of laboratory. It controlled by Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms. If we use this transgenic E.coli, we should tell the necessity of it. It is important to tell the necessity of transgenic organisms for develop  synthetic biology. We should to learn risk of transgenic organisms.
Frashman opinion by Takuho Otsubo
I thought that we should not use E.coli designd by our team.
this E. coli can catch cadmium.
And we may reduce pollution with cadmium by collecting this E. coli.
However, there can be the risk leading to threatening ecosystem to use genetically-modified E. coli.
It is important to check pollution of cadmium.
However, I thought that it is more important that I not threaten ecosystem.
Therefore I am against using E.coli designd by our team which may threaten ecosystem.
Team opinions
We discussed the theme. We thought what problems it has and answered it.
Q-1) Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab
A-1) In our project, we does not use biological materials without E. coli and all DNA parts are already cloned in plasmid. We are only using DNA parts, such as synthesis of amino acid, that are not dangerous for human, so there are no safety and health risks.

British Columbia - 2012.igem.org
The Applications and Applicability of Engineered Microbial Consortia Our project sets a foundational advance by engineering microbial consortia with the purpose of distributing metabolic pathways to increase their efficiency, whereby they become more desirable from a biotech standpoint. We thus set out to find the following information from our industrial partners:
What are some potential industrial applications of engineered microbial consortia?
What advantages are there to employing biological methods versus current chemical methods?
How feasible is it to implement biological methods?
Are Research & Development sectors of current organizations/companies interested in pursuing synthetic biology options?
Our Approach Our team contacted Chevron and arranged a visit to the Chevron refinery in Burnaby, BC, Canada. We communicated with Chevron representatives to find out more about the existing methods of desulfurization and costs of refining crude oil. We connected with Alberta Innovates – Technology Futures (AITF) representative Karen Budwill and Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI) representatives John Vidmar and Nicolas Choquette-Levy to discuss the progress of our project and obtain some industrial insights.Industrial Insights
From our Chevron visit, we learned:
How refinery desulfurization works:
Sulfur-rich fuels are catalytically hydrogenated (hydrotreated) at high pressure (700 psi) and temperature (800 °F), creating H2S gas.
The H2S gas is absorbed from the fuel stream by being contacted with amines at high pressure.
The amines are then heated to release the H2S gas to the two-step Claus process.
In the first step of the Claus process, the H2S gas is partially combusted, creating water, elemental sulfur and sulfur oxides.
The Claus process's second step catalytically reacts the combustion products with more H2S, creating water and elemental sulfur with very high yields.
Industrial-scale desulfurization is massive. The diesel hydrotreater at Chevron Burnaby treats 18000 barrels of diesel fuel every day, removing"
Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Brainstorm_-_-_TEXT.html," so the concerns outlined above are especially relevant, and led us to reject a number of project proposals.
Ideas on the longlist
Radiation detection/scrubbing - This idea was rapidly discarded because the team did not want to work in a radioactive environment over the summer!
Removal of poison in catalytic converters - Although we thought this was a great application, heavy metal detection and removal have already been done many times in iGEM so we wanted to go instead for a more original idea.
Water treatment/filtration - Again, a common topic in iGEM, that we couldn’t find a sufficiently original angle to approach for our project
Fertiliser production on demand - something we thought would be too similar to Bristol 2010’s project.
Disease detection from blood serum - although we thought this would be a great achievement if we managed it, there weren’t many parallel lines of enquiry that we could branch off to if we couldn’t achieve the main aim.
Generic disease diagnosis paradigm - inspired by Imperial College 2010, but unfortunately our research didn’t get anywhere.
Drug delivery transport mechanism - the idea was to use tissue recognition to target drugs to the relevant region in the body. Unfortunately, not only was the project difficult, but we did not want to release live bacteria within the human body (outside the gut). The patient would be likely to have a strong immune response to the bacteria as well, which would be extremely difficult to avoid.
Curing cholera - we were thinking of trying to counteract the ion leakage associated with cholera, but it turns out that the simplest way to cure cholera is abundant hydration (with clean water), which is more likely to be available than GM bacteria, in general!
Insulin implant for diabetics - a bacterial implant that releases insulin on demand based on blood sugar levels. This idea was discarded because of the immune response triggered when bacteria enter the bloodstream, as well as the potentially harmful technology of having bacteria that can live in your bloodstream, if we succeed in overcoming the immune mechanism.
Scent detection - although this is highly applicable (for biosensing at a distance), we couldn’t find enough information in the literature to pursue this idea.
Hormone releaser - in particular, adrenaline synthesis really caught our imagination, but we didn’t want to create E. coli (that originally could survive in the human gut) that produced chemicals that can interfere with human physiology - dangerous ground!
Eutrophication prevention/reversal - the main issues here were the unpredictable effects of introducing a GM foreign species into the local ecosystem, and the fact that nitrate removal had"

Therefore, the subparts J23101, J23115 as well as E0240 were transformed directly from the 2014 distribution plates into NEB 10β cells. Afterwards the plasmids were recovered using the illustra plasmidPrep Mini Spin Kit . The purified plasmids J23101 and J23115 were cut with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and SpeI, while E0240 was cut with XbaI and PstI. The restricted plasmids were then ligated together using the T4 DNA Ligase. Afterwards, the ligation product was introduced into the pSB1C3 linearized backbone provided by iGEM headquarters with the 2014 distribution which we had also cut with EcoRI and PstI. All restrictions and ligations were performed using enzymes and buffers of the NEB iGEM Kit . The final product was once again transformed into NEB 10β cells.
The correct identity of the resulting constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The sequencing data (consensus sequences) can be found here .
Note: We used the mutated version of J23115 as sent out by the iGEM headquarters. The mutation makes J23115 effectively the same promoter as K823012. We will still refer to the promoter as J23115 though, to keep it more easily recognizable with the other Interlab Study results.
Inoculation and Cultivation
The cultivation of our bacteria was performed in 500 ml shake flasks filled with 50 ml LB medium . The cultures were kept at 37°C and 300 rpm shaking frequency. Appropiate antibiotics were added to each media (kanamycin for I20260, chloramphenicol for B0015, J23101.E0240 and J23115.E0240). Both antibiotics were added from a 1000X stock stored at -20°C for a final concentration of 35 µg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 µg/ml kanamycin, respectively.
The precultures were inoculated from the same cryo stocks. They were cultivated for 16 hours and then sampled for OD measurement with a spectrophotometer. Then 2 ml of each preculture were centrifuged (5 minutes, 6000 g) and then washed twice with PBS buffer. Afterwards, all cultures were inoculated to have the same starting OD. Inoculations were carried out under sterile conditions at the clean bench.
Sampling

Future work: What’s next for Synthetic Palm Oil?
Whilst our iGEM Project is over, we looked at a variety of ways to build onto our project in the future.
Beta-Carotene Enhanced Palm Oil
It may be possible to optimise the palm oil produced to provide a healthier alternative to traditionally produced palm oil. One such example of this would be the introduction of beta-carotene into the palm oil component mix.
Beta-carotene is a precursor to vitamin A. Vitamin A is essential for a variety of health aspects – from eyesight to a strengthened immune system. Vitamin A can prove toxic at high levels, which is why introducing beta-carotene would be a safe alternative. The human body only converts sufficient beta-carotene to reach optimum vitamin A levels – preventing a potentially toxic excess of vitamin A.
This idea could potentially make use of the work of Uppsala iGEM 2013 , who have been working on genetically engineering beta-carotene as part of their project this year.
Implications for the taste and appearance of this optimised palm oil alternative may however make this goal hard to achieve. Many food production companies would be keen to derive the benefits of beta-carotene enhanced palm oil but would be unlikely to implement such a product if changes to appearance and taste occurred as a result of using beta-carotene enhanced palm oil.
Waste paper/agricultural materials as a source of Glucose
After attending the 2013 YSB 1.0 London conference and speaking to the UCL Academy team we were really interested in how we might find an alternative feed stock to glucose. Achieving this would dramatically decrease the running costs of any palm oil production plant, as glucose is one of the major cost factors in starting materials for production of our synthetic palm oil. The UCL Academy team worked to produce a cellulase BioBrick (due to be submitted to the registry in 2014) which would break down particular cellulose fibres in paper structure, producing glucose. We would also be interested in exploring the application of this biobrick in terms of the use of cellulose from argicultural waste, such as rice husks, as a feed stock. Not only would this reduce the cost of producing our palm oil, but would also aid in the disposal of waste.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Phage Display_-_-_TEXT.html," substance which cannot enter the cell is nevertheless being degraded.
A fairly easy test would be to use a fusion of amylase to pVIII, and assay for starch degradation. There is no amylase BioBrick (with DNA available) in the Registry, so we'd have to make it.
Example systems
A simple version of the system would work as follows:
E. coli are grown up containing a plasmid coding for a pVIII fusion gene, i.e:
Promoter--RBS--Leader--Amylase--(Linker?)--pVIII.
These E. coli are infected with M13.
They create new phage; some of the modified pVIII proteins incorporate into the capsid.
More complex versions would either incorporate more pVIII fusions, or multiple strains all of which have a pIII-fusion to attach to beads.

As the team leader I was overseeing project progress and keeping track of deadlines. Held weekly report meetings and ensured that the project is going well as a whole. Organized Jamboree travel arrangements. Programmed most of the wiki website, added content and helped design it. Helped individual managers in their tasks - worked with Michelle on the Policy & Practice case study, helped Anne with organizing Fund Raising, helped Marit with PR efforts.  Contributed to good team cohesion and ensured that communication goes smoothly, within the team, with supervisors and supporters, and with other project stakeholders.
Max - Science Manager
I have worked with several others on the scientific background of the project and formulating the goals. This also involved the development of assays needed to assess whether we actually achieved these goals. Next to this I have worked a lot in the lab on different aspects, ranging from standard plasmid isolation and restriction/ligation to imaging samples with the spinning disk microscope. I really enjoyed working on the design of e.g. promotional material, presentations and the hardware manual. Further I presented at the RIVM/Rathenau event and will present at the Jamboree. Additionally, I have helped with development of the 3D printer and financials, although most credits go to fellow team members.
Hector - Lab Manager & Safety Manager
As Lab Manager, my function inside the group has been the design and coordination of the experiments performed in the laboratory. Also, I have been involved in the supply of the necessary materials for the project. On the other hand, as Safety Manager, I have been checking the regulations that apply to every module of our project, and checking their fulfillment in the working area. Specifically, the project parts where I worked were: lab setup, cloning experiments, characterization experiment, modeling counseling, safety forms fulfillment, protocol design, presentation storyline writing and wiki content writing. Furthermore, I actively helped the other team members in punctual tasks along the summer.
Samantha - Modeling Manager
As the Modeling Manager, I was responsible for translating the biological and chemical processes leading to biofilm formation in mathematical models. This included developing a model able to predict the protein production capacity of our cells and developing a model able to estimate the strength of our formed biofilm. In order for the modeling to have good synergy with the lab, I designed and performed experiments supporting the biological modeling. Furthermore, I interpreted and statistically analyzed part of the experiments and made the comic images throughout our wiki trying to explain our project in an accessible manner.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," how beneficial early detection of NSCLC is, but we had not explored the clinical implementation of our sensor before talking to him. He suggested offering the test to high risk individuals for whom the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of their cancer could lead to an increase in the rate of survival: in the case of NSCLC, this could be carried out by offering the test to those with a certain smoking history. To determine which individuals had a sufficiently high risk of developing NSCLC, for our sensor to be cost effective, we have designed a cost model - take a look below.
He also proposed that if the concept of our test were to be proven and a variety of miRNAs could be detected as biomarkers for a range of cancers, then our test could be used as a screening tool for anyone over a certain age, due to the increase in cancer prevalence with age. His comments led us to research the required criteria below for our sensor to be used as a screening tool. His advice on the high sensitivity and specificity required fed into our need to create a second series of switches.
Dr Sujal Desai
We discussed the use of our sensor for high risk population screening with Dr Desai, a consultant chest radiologist. He informed us that lung cancer rarely presents before age 40, and to maximize the test’s value it should be offered to those aged 55 and above, with a smoking history - so that we would not waste money offering the test to too many people who were very unlikely to have cancer.
To integrate their advice, we worked with our our modeling team to work out who would we should screen. Tammegami et al.’s probability score is the probability of an individual getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. [2]
Using our model which combined this with the data for our project and standard NSCLC treatment, we worked out for what probabilities it would be cost effective for us to screen. The model showed that our tool could be cost effective at cost per QALY - saving lives and saving the NHS money. It shows that even if our sensitivity was lower than we expect, our sensor would be extremely cost effective.

Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Notebook#Journal#Weekly_-_-_TEXT.html,"enced.  A transformation of rox1-pTUM100 and Panb1-pTUM100 yielded only few colonies - can't have everything in one week.
Week 8
Unfortunately, first exams reduced lab-work even further. We had a successful PCR of Panb1 and Tadh1 and attempted ligations of rox1 in pTUM (cut with X/S) and of Panb1 in pTUM (cut with E/P). We tried some Transformations on plates with ampicillin- aliquot, unfortunately there were still colonies on the negative plate.
Week 7
Control restrictions of Padh1 and Psuc2 with Xba/Spe and Eco/Pst restriction sites were accomplished, unfortunately there were no bands in the agarose gel. Likewise, we prepared some more PCRs of Panb1 and Tadh1 but could not identify any stains on the subsequent gel. We retried the agarose gel electrophoresis with a higher sample volume without achieving the desired results. Our transformed pTUM100-ligations of the parts mPR Dr, mPR Xl, mig1, and luc did not grow that bad, but we had a massive problem with colonies on our negative plates! Our first suspicion was, that the aliquot with the ampicillin-resistance did not tolerate the daily thaw-freeze-thaw-freeze procedure. Furthermore, we tried some PCR`s. However, we had neither product nor Primer-bands. In addition to this, we cut rox1 out of pGEM with Xba/Spe and purified it. Since many ligations and transformations resulted in empty vectors (or even worse: no vectors at all) we started experimenting with higher concentrations of chloramphenicol and ampiciline in our plates.
Week 6
Chemo-competent cells: next try. This time we actually did everything correct and had wonderfully working chemo-competent cells! Our first colony-PCRs of Padh1 and Psuc2 were successful - stains were at the correct positions in the initial gel. However, gelextractions of both cultures yielded empty vectors...
Week 5
This week, summer semester started thus time for lab-work decreased gradually.
We have created new chemo-competent cells since previous attempts failed due to insufficient cooling of cells. However, we had no luck again and had way too low trafo efficiencies with these cells. Even worse, Pfet3 PCRs still were annoyingly problematic for reasons we simply could not work out. Fortunately, we managed to complete a PCR of luc (hunder"
BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," for pure nucleic acid.  According to the Nanodrop manual, ""If the ratio is appreciably lower, this may indicate the presence of co-purified contaminants. "" It seems that Z0842 is entirely suspect, so we should try re-doing the miniprep tomorrow.  Should innoculate a culture tonight in order to do that.
Also, realized that it would be beneficial to miniprep some of the yeast plasmids in preparation for the necessary insertions of parts into shuttle vectors.  Thus, in addition to Z0842, also innoculated three cultures with pRS304*, pRS305, and pRS306.  Put these cultures in around 5 pm.  Will try to check up on them around 10 am tomorrow, giving them roughly 17 hours in the incubator (again, put tubes at a slant).
Transformations of remaining limiter parts will be postponed until their significance can be demonstrated in the construction scheme.  For now, it is more important to construct the simple test devices to show that the functional parts we received are, indeed, functional in our testing conditions.
These simple test devices consist of two constructs.  The first construct is either a repressor or an activator, while the second construct is a reporter that has specific paired activity with the first.  We will be testing their function not only in a different yeast strain than that used in the original testing of these parts (MHY500 or MHY501 as opposed to PSY580A) but also in different media (i.e. a mixture of methionine and galactose at set concentrations rather than galactose and raffinose?).

Plastic Toxicity Assays
L-lactic Acid
L-lactic acid in LB with Stress Response cells. MG1655 cells were grown on 0 mM and 5 mM L-Lactic Acid. Lactic acid is a byproduct of polylactic acid degradation, a key component to our project. Cells grown in 5mM L-lactic acid show a pronounced lag phase before commencing log growth. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Ethylene glycol
Ethylene glycol in LB with Stress Response cells. MG1655 were grown in ethylene glycol, a byproduct of polyurethane degradation. Cells were grown in 0mM, 100mM or 200mM Ethylene Glycol. At 37°C, the concentrations of ethylene glycol used do not affect growth, however at 30°C, the increasing concentration results in halved growth. A two-tailed t-test addressing the null hypothesis, temperature does not affect growth with ethylene glycol shows that the null hypothesis must be rejected as p = 0.001. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C and 30°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Reduced growth at 30°C likely due to decreased efficiency of MG1655 ethylene glycol break down enzymes. These enzymes (see UC Davis 2012) are endogenously expressed and detoxify Ethylene Glycol.
3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB)
Toxicity of 3-hydroxybutyrate in LB with phaCAB and EV expression. 3HB was tested at 5 concentrations for toxicity - 1 μM, 100 μM, 1 mM, 10 mM and 237 mM. Between 10 mM and 237 mM, there is a clear toxicity effect observed. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.

The second batch was left in the water bath at around 60 degrees for about eight hours and had turned significantly darker.  Poured plates with this anyway, but they may be unusable.  Another reason why these plates may be unusable is that the agar was around 60 degrees when antibiotic was added, meaning that they may not actually have active AMP within them.
Also, almost all plates from both batches had bubbles in them, requiring application of flame.  However, lacking a good flame, we were forced to heat up a loop and attempt to remove bubbles using this.  The result was that some bubbles remained on the plates and that the agar was burnt in some places.

When the former academic research unit strives for the NEP project (National Energy Program),                                                      the technology that the audited authority usually requires that project must be adopted by the industry.                                                      Therefore, both the academic research center and the industry usually sign the cooperation letter of intent for review.                                                      For China Steel, it is willing to support the academic research community to conduct                                                      forward-looking technical research with national resources                                                      to provide the technical information needed to evaluate feasibility.
The medium we need will still consume energy in the process of preparation,                                                      and it may cause carbon emissions simultaneously.                                                      We wonder how to regard upon overall carbon footprint may be increased from the perspective of enterprise.
If the overall footprint of the carbon fixation process developed may be positive (increased),                                                      in general, from the perspective of carbon reduction within the enterprise, there is no possibility of application.                                                      If the derived external carbon reduction benefit is greater than the internal carbon loss,                                                      it proves to have a positive net benefit to the environment.                                                      As long as it meets the feasibility of engineering and economic, the enterprise is willing to adopt it.
Research on carbon fixation, what is the driving force for China Steel in addition to economic benefits?
Regulatory requirements, corporate identity and social responsibility.

Process
We attended the Biotechnology Green Energy Expo and had a                                          business matchmaking with International Technology Research Institute (ITRI).                                          The Dr. Shen was a manager of Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) Application Project                                          in Green Energy and Environment Research Laboratories of ITRI.                                          He gave a short speech about the condition of CCS in Taiwan.                                          CCS technology is a relevant technology with our E. coli carbon utilization system.                                          Therefore, through business matchmaking, we introduced our project and all the design                                          including what we improve after the customer investigation with CSC.
Suggestion and Question
The currently solution in Taiwan is CCS, however,                                          the policy and the inhabitant are big challenges of CCS technology.                                          ITRI had cooperated with lots of industrial and academic institutes and developed advance                                          CCS technology, however, most of them cannot have real implementation.                                          The public doubt the safety about storage high density carbon underground.                                          Therefore, ITRI now contribute to develop carbon utilize technology.                                          That’s the point that ITRI will adopt our project into their lab.

Construction in eukaryotic cells
Life process in eukaryotic cells is much more complicate, especially when it is related to signal transportation. We choose microRNA to transport cues and Bxb1 to realize the flipping process. Using microRNA can not only simplify the design of the system, making sure the transportation is precise and efficient, but also ensure the independency with other life processes due to the orthogonality of the microRNA and other signals. MicroRNA also has great scalability. Compared to Cre-loxP recombination system, Bxb1 recombination system requires different enzymes to flip back and forth, which makes the whole system more controllable. As shown in the picture, Bxb1 sites and microRNAs are located in the intron of the reporter. If the sequence has flipped, the two exons of Cyan are segregate from each other, and Cyan would not translate correctly. So we can detect whether the sequence has flipped from the expression of Cyan. From the circuit, we can get such truth table and corresponding logical relationship.

Figure 1. Plasmid Design Zwitterionic Antifouling Protein.
Plasmid Design
First of all, we have designed a polymer chain consisting of mainly Glutamic Acid and Lysine. This polymer chain needs to be expressed onto the outside of the cell, but still has to be attached to its membrane. Therefore, we have incorporated the sequence for the zwitterionic polymer into the display part of the display protein the Penn 2012 team has used. This is the original Ice Nucelation Protein and was also used for COMPy . After quite some waiting on the synthesized antifouling sequence – or insert – and labor in the BioLab, we have successfully obtained and transformed the plasmid shown in Figure 1 . The most important parts of this plasmid are, in order, the display protein, an alpha linker for flexibility, our Glutamic Acid- and Lysine-rich sequence, linker for flexibility and finally a HA-tag for immuno assays. The protocols used in order to assemble this plasmids by means of digestion and ligation can be found on the Protocol page .
Evaluation of Expression
Figure 2. ZAP labelled with Anti-HA antibodies.
ZAP has been designed with a HA-tag at the end of the zwitterionic sequence.  To show whether or not the protein is expressed the bacteria are labeled with fluorescent anti-HA antibodies. The antibodies were added to the bacteria after protein expression in a concentration of 316 nM. After one hour of incubation the cells were washed and analyzed with FACS . These results clearly show that ZAP is expressed ( Figure 2 ) due to the shift of the graph to the right. This indicates protein expression and thus expression of ZAP. It is remarkable that there are quite a few cells with a lower level of fluorescence.
Future prospects
Unfortunately, the process so far in designing and characterizing ZAP has been quite time-consuming. It was not possible to further investigate the antifouling properties of the E. coli that have expressed these Zwitterionic Antifouling Proteins before the deadline of the iGEM wikifreeze. Since there were no antifouling testing antibodies commercial available for the bacteria strain (BL21 DE3) – these are merely available for the cell’s lysate and not for living cells, no easy test could be performed on the ZAP producing cells"

The Pseudomonas Autoinducer-1 (PAI-1) Sensing System
Initial Planning and Cloning Strategy
Building the PAI-1 Sensor
Characterisation
Initial Planning and Cloning Strategy
Pseudomonas autoinducer-1 (N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone) is a second quorum sensing molecule produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that works in concert with LasR to increase the expression of a number of virulence genes, including those for several proteases (lasB, lasA, aprA) and exotoxin A (toxA)1. LasR is a transcriptional activator that binds the autoinducer molecule PAI-1, causing the protein to dimerise and to activate transcription of various promoters including that of the lasB gene2. It has been reported that the LasR-PAI complex can also activate the Vibrio fischeri luxR promoter2,3. Both PlasB and Pluxe were adopted as LasR-PAI-1 inducible promoters in our device. Using pre-existing BioBricks we have designed new circuits to engineer E. coli to express the LasR transduction system for the detection of PAI-1 (as shown in Fig 1), along with promoter-less gfp fused to either the lasB or luxR promoter.

Pasteur Paris
This year, we, the WPI iGEM team, collaborated with the Pasteur Paris iGEM Team . Both of our teams conducted research on biofilms so we decided to test each other’s protocols for quantifying biofilm growth to make sure the data was consistent throughout different labs. This comparison will be used to prove that any data collected using these techniques is accurate because of the reproducibility. If the data between the labs is significantly variable, then we know that the data collected depends heavily on how exactly the protocol was carried out, so the protocol should be edited to make it more consistent.
Our data concluded that the plate rinsing protocol that we followed was more effective than that of the Pasteur Paris iGEM team because submerging the plate in water is more likely to cause contamination, even into empty wells. We successfully grew biofilms using this protocol, but the data we collected shows the most biofilm in the empty column, which must be a product of contamination during the rinsing process. If we had more time, we would work further with Pasteur Paris to perfect a method of quantifying biofilms.
Pasteur Paris Collaborations Page
Graph
This graph shows the massive amount of error associated with this method of rinsing plates, especially in the empty wells that should not have had any biofilm at all.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
We also collaborated with the MIT iGEM team . We held a skype call to discuss different means of quantifying biofilms and we provided them with our crystal violet biofilm assay protocol, and they shared their colony forming units of planktonic cells protocol with us. We used this protocol when testing biofilm formation on lettuce leaves.

Improve a previous part or project
We improved the characterization of BBa_K873002 , an HSP promoter that had no previous data about its activity or activation temperature. We showed that it was only slightly activated at high temperatures and that its activity greatly decreased over time. Vilnius iGEM recreate our characterization protocol and got similar results.
Proof of concept
We conducted a proof of concept experiment to show that our Super Cells not only were able to overproduce reduced electron donors, but were also able to utilize them for a biological process. Our cells were able to overproduce biotin, a molecule that is synthesized in a reduced electron donor dependent pathway, when we overexpressed genes coding for ferredoxin, an electron donor, and pyruvate ferredoxin oxiodreductase, an enzyme that reduces the electron donor.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#flagellin_-_-_TEXT.html," yeast surface ($C_{ns}$) gradually increase until around 10 hours. Notice that at hour 10 there are still some monomers left in the solution, but the number of seeds has stopped increasing, meaning that after this point, the main process becomes elongation.
$\theta$ also virtually ceases to increase after 10 hours, which implies that this is an appropriate time length for the nucleation step.
Finally, let us put the value of $\theta$ into perspectives. At 10 hours, $\theta = 1.2 \times 10^{-3}$. Each yeast has around $4 \times 10^4$ display sites (Shibasaki et al., 2009), giving about 48 flagellin seeds formed on each yeast on average. Note that polymerization of flagellar filaments in vitro can reach up to $50 \ \mu\text{m}$ (Lino, 1974), that a flagellar filament consists of 11 longitudinal rows of flagellins (O’Brien et al., 1972), and that the axial spacing between flagellins is $5 \ \text{nm}$ (Champness, 1971). If we attach an enzyme on each monomer, the number of enzymes displayed on each yeast will increase by $48 \times 11 \times \frac{50 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{m}}{5 \times 10^{-9} \ \text{m}} = 5.28 \times 10^6$, which is 100 times that of an ordinary yeast display system.
Conclusion and Discussion
We have two main results from the model we developed.
The first is that by assembling flagellar filaments on the yeast surface, we can increase the display capacity by as much as 100 times that of an ordinary yeast display system. Note that in our simulation, there were no external interventions. In practice, when most of the monomers in the solution have polymerized and are no longer useful, we may change the buffer into a new one with abundant monomers. In this way, we can increase the display capacity even more. Also note that the flagellar filaments formed in the solution can be recycled and turned into monomers again by imposing conditions such as strong acidity.
The second is that within an experimentally reasonable range, the percentage of successful nucleation among display sites increases almost linearly with respect to the concentration of flagellin monomers, and that the process completes at around 10 hours. This conclusion provides directions for wet lab experiments, which is to make"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

High Fidelity PCR
The dxCas9 coding sequence contains forbidden restriction sites to be RFC compatible. Therefore, Gblocks were ordered at IDT. The dxCas9 is to large to order as one Gblock. Therefore I ordered two Gblocks, also incorporating Linker-Tn5 coding sequences (Gblock 1 and 2). To be able to construct also a different variant of the fusion protein, two Gblocks were ordered in the order Tn5-Linker-dxCas9 (Gblock 3 and 4).
To amplify the Gblocks 3 and 4 as well as the pACYCDuet-1 backbone, high fidelity PCR was done. The template DNA are the Gblocks 1 (primerset 045 & 046) and 2 (primerset 047 & 048) and pACYCDuet-1 (primerset 049 & 050). Additionally, we use the templates Gblocks 3 (primerset 079 & 080) and 4 (primerset 081 & 082) and pACYCDuet-1 (primerset 083 & 084). Multiple 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol .

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Modeling#Techniques_-_-_TEXT.html," 0.5 \). Below this particular value of p, no such path will exist. \( \  p = \ 0.5\ \) is called the critical chance, denoted by \( \ p_c \). Above \( \ p_c\), there is an infinitely big cluster of connected trees that spans the entire field. Note: this does not mean that all trees are connected, but it does mean that there is an infinitely large cluster of burning trees. If the chessboard is not infinitely large, then percolation theory states there is not a critical chance \( \ p_c\) above which there will always be a path of burning trees that connects the two opposite sides of the forest and below \( \ p_c\) there never will be a path of burning trees that connects the two opposite sides of the forest. However, percolation theory does state that there will be a sharp transition from 0 to 1 in the chance that there will be a burning path connecting the two opposite sides of the forest [3].
Though this is a relatively easy example, percolation theory is mathematically very complex, especially if the problem is not infinite. Percolation theory is also not restricted to two dimensions, but one can also use it for problems in one, three or even an infinite number of dimensions (or any other number).
In the model we constructed for our conductive curli module, we have something similar. We randomly place cells on a surface of a two dimensional chip and want to know when there is a conductive path between the two electrodes that are on opposite sides of the chip. The cells are modelled by disks with radius \( r \). There is a conductive path between the two electrodes when there is a cluster of cells that are connected to each other and the two electrodes. Therefore, percolation theory can be used for our problem. However, we are not dealing with a large chessboard with squares that can be occupied or not, but we are dealing with continuous space. The theory that deals with these kind of problems is called continuum percolation theory [4].
However, to keep it easy, we discuss here a discrete problem of conductance between two electrodes [3]. Imagine a grid where each square can be made of copper with chance \( \  p \), or be empty with chance \( \ 1- \ p \). On opposite sides of the grid are two electrodes that are connected to a battery. We already discussed that the chance of percolation increases very sharply above a certain \( \ p \). However, we are not only interested in the"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,". Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Before the actual lab work was started the whole in silico had to be planed. Therefore 10 different parts were designed. Each of them contains a biobrick suffix and a biobrick prefix, a promoter and ribosome binding sites. To this special bricks, unique restriction sites (XbaI, SpeI, EcoRI and PstI) are added for control digestion and directed ligation of the different parts. The toxin parts (Fig.1, Fig.3, Fig.5 and Fig.7) contain the tac-promotor because the toxin and the DAM methylase should be expressed after induction with IPTG. With the Dam methylase a 50% higher mutation rate is obtained. The chromoprotein part (Fig.2, Fig.4, Fig.6 and Fig.8) possesses a constitutive promoter for the reason that the chromoprotein and the antitoxin should be expressed the whole time. Other parts are the vector (Fig.10) and the lacI part (Fig.9).

Let the gel solidify for 30 minutes.
Combine 10 µL of the digestion with 2 µL of 6x loading dye.
Place the gel with the cassette into the electrophoresis box and add TAE buffer until it covers the entire gel.
Remove the comb to expose the empty wells.
Add 5 - 6 µL of DNA ladder to the first well.
Pipette the digestion and dye mixture into the wells.
Set the voltage to 120V and run the gel until the dye runs approximately three-fourths of the way down the gel (about 30-45 minutes).
Using the proper protection, view the bands with UV light, and cut out the wanted bands which can be stored at -20 ˚C in a microcentrifuge tube.
GEL PURIFICATION
Determine the mass of each gel fragment by weighing it and subtracting the mass of an empty microcentrifuge tube.
Add Buffer QG so that there is 300 µL of buffer for every 100 mg of agarose gel.
Incubate at 50 ˚C for 10 minutes or until the gel has dissolved and mix by vortexing every 2-3 minutes.
Check that the color of the mixture is yellow and similar to that of Buffer QG, adjusting pH if necessary.
Add 100 µL of isopropanol for 100 mg of agarose gel and mix.
Place a spin column in a 2 mL collection tube.
To bind DNA, add the sample to the spin column and centrifuge for a minute at over 10,000 g.
Discard flow-through and place spin column back in the same collection tube.
Add 0.5 mL of Buffer QG and centrifuge for a minute at over 10,000 g.
To wash, add 0.75 mL of Buffer PE, with ethanol added, to the spin column and centrifuge for a minute at over 10,000 g.
Discard flow-through and centrifuge for an additional minute at over 10,000 g.
Place spin column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 µL of Buffer EB to the spin column and centrifuge for a minute at maximum speed. (For increased DNA concentration, add 30 µL of elution buffer, let column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for a minute at maximum speed)
Discard the spin column and store DNA at -20 ˚C.

Dr. E. coli : The smallest protein injector in the world
   Our main project is on Type III Secretion Apparatus which is one of the most amazing biological devices. This apparatus which looks like a syringe can pass a whole protein molecule from a bacterial cell to a target eukaryotic cell. However, this apparatus is an organelle of pathogenic gram-negative bacterium such as Salmonella and Yersinia. So we are aiming at making this device safely available using E. coli.
PCR Based Assembly Protocol
   Sometimes standard protocol fails to produce plasmid or BioBrick is toxic to host cell and can't be amplified. In moments like these PCR is handy. We think we might slightly improved it. You no longer have to guess if restriction was successful.

Overview
The goal of NEU_China_A is to design a biological system to alleviate intestinal inflammatory diseases and prevent potential colorectal cancer. We chose the human probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917, as our chassis for constructing engineered probiotic. On the one hand, when the engineered bacteria senses an inflammatory signal in the intestine, it would release an anti-inflammatory compound (interleukin-10, IL-10) to reduce the intestinal inflammatory responses. On the other hand, engineered E. coli could secrete myrosinase to convert the cruciferous vegetables contained glucosinolate into sulforaphane that act as similar as IL-10 and prevent colorectal cancer induced by chronic inflammation.
1. Chassis
The very first one coming to our minds was to choose a suitable chassis when we                 decided to use engineered bacteria to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease. Through literature review,                 we have found a bacteria that is clinically widely used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease                 - E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) [1], which was isolated by German fetus Alfred Nissle during the First World                 War from the feces of a German soldier who was insusceptible to infectious diarrhea [2].

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Selection#BindingControl_-_-_TEXT.html," differences in the RFP intensity (fugure 4C). The cells with cI-SH2 proteins had an about 35% lower RFP signal after measuring the RFP intensity in 50,000 single cells. Normalized on the GFP production, the differences raises to 44% lower RFP intensity per measured GFP intensity.
Figure 4: FACS measurement. The three bacterial cultures with the single reporter (blue), the GFP and the reporter (red) and the GFP, reporter and carrying the functional cI-SH2 fusion protein were measured. Illustrated  is the GFP(A) or RFP(B,C) intensity in dependence of the measured cell events. The arithmetic mean is pictured under the graph.
Therefore, an in vivo validation of the DNA binding domain is also possible. One possible explanation for the reduced RFP production copared to the native reporter level with the binding of cI is the possibility that the binding protein could compete with the RNA polymerase for the DNA sequence with the binding site. Therefore, the polymerase   represses the binding cI protein and continues the expression of the genes. Under normal conditions the cI protein binds at four binding sites and builds an octamere structure to completely repress the transcription activity. The single binding site OR1 could lead to a lower binding strength of cI and therefore, a higher chance that the RNA polymerase could repress the cI protein.   All in all the binding of cI was shown under in vivo and in vitro conditions.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved"

Biotechnology Program and Abraham Lincoln High School (ALHS)
The ALHS Biotechnology Program is a two year pathway developed by George Cachianes and co-taught by Julie Reis: Lincoln High Biotech Webpage
The curriculum during the program can be broken down as follows
First Year: Introduction to biotechnology, DNA cloning, and the industry and career opportunities
Second Year: Students study and perform several lab protocols including running polyacrylamide and agarose gels, western blots, DNA minipreps, column chromatography, etc.
This year 5 members of the UCSF iGEM team were chosen from students that have completed this 2 year class. Read more about Nate, Helena, Louis, Verna, and Kendall at the team members page!
City College of San Francisco (CCSF) and the Gladstone Scholars Program
This year, to try and expand our team applications were accepted from local community college students. If you are from the SF Bay Area and are interested in participating next year, contact our coordinator Veronica Zepeda!  This summer our team was joined by Yesenia Lopez, who currently attends City College of San Francisco and was a previous participant in the Gladstone Scholars Intern Program.
Peking University and UCSF iGEM Exchange
We initiated an exchange program wherein UCSF funds a trip for a student to do research at a lab at Peking University for one summer, and Peking University sends a student to UCSF for the same purpose. This summer of 2012, we had a student from Peking University named Jingyi Xi help us with our modeling portion of our project. We also sent a former UCSF iGem member, Tina Chen, to Peking University"

We are still in the process of determining where these inconsistencies are coming from by looking into the first set of reactions that takes place when glucose is introduced to E. coli.
I was able to identify the series of reactions the take place immediately following the uptake of galactose, which include converting alpha D­galactose to beta D­galactose, and elementary reactions depending on enzymes such as 4­epimerase and galactokinase, a greater amount of energy was required to initiate the conversion of galactose to glucose to G6P than was required to initiate the conversion of just glucose to G6P.

Knocking out PDH and PFL
J_exp4
Lastly, Laura was working on finding an alternate path in the model that produced acetyl­coA. However, the only reactions listed involve the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl­coA. We are interested in determining which reactions can be potentially knocked out of the model to maximum the production of acetyl­coA. Tom wanted me to run gams files that removed the PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) and PFL (pyruvate formate lyase) reactions from the model, which are directly involved in the production of acetyl­coA, to determine if whether or not knocking one out will maximum flux through pyruvate synthase (POR5), which is the only other reaction involved in the production of acetyl­coA. However, our findings show that knocking either PDH or PFL from the model has no effect on the flux through this reaction, or on one another. Considering the flux ranges remained the same (0 ­ 10,000) for the PDH and PFL reactions, these reactions can potentially be removed from the model. When both PDH and PFL were both knocked from the model, the flux ranges varied slightly through the pyruvate synthase reaction­ from ­9,948.9478 ­ 444.251305 (for the lower and upper bounds respectively) to ­4068.693 ­ 444.251. Even though the lower bound was less negative, its magnitude was still significantly larger than the upper bound."

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!

China Steel Corporation (CSC), located at Kaohsiung,                                                 Taiwan, was founded in December 1971. With annual production (in terms of crude steel) around                                                 10                                                 million tons, CSC                                                 produces a range of products including plates, bars, wire rods, hot and                                                 cold rolled coils,                                                 electrogalvanized coils, electrical steel coils, hot-dip galvanized                                                 coils,                                                 and Ti/Ni-base alloy.                                                 The domestic market takes roughly 69% of CSC’s production and the                                                 exports                                                 take the remaining 31%.                                                 CSC is the largest steel company in Taiwan, enjoying more than 50% of                                                 the                                                 domestic market. Major                                                 export destinations are Mainland China (including HongKong), Japan and                                                 Southeast Asia.[1]
After participating at the Asia-Pacific conference,                                                 we                                                 organized some questions                                                 and made a report to CSC. We consider the implementation of                                                 industrial and have a presentation                                                 to CSC. We also got some feedback from them. Their concern is                                                 that                                                 the smoke emitted by the factory is not completely carbon dioxide, but will contain some                                                 impurities like SOx and NOx. So                                                 they asked more about whether E. coli can survive and react in                                                 this                                                 environment. In addition, they                                                 also praised our idea of removing carbon and solving the disadvantages                                                 of                                                 microalgae space. They                                                 even said that they are very supportive of young people’ s ideas and                                                 there                                                 are opportunities for                                                 cooperation in the future.
After the interview, we thought more about the growth environment that E. coli can tolerate, including                                                 excess CO2 concentration , SOx, NOx and even metal                                                 particles.                                                 Therefore, we hope to                                                 design a system that processes metal particles and cooling gas                                                 beforehand                                                 in the factory, and                                                 recycle the used waste medium.

    Brasil-USP team is very concerned about the project’s biosafety, and considered it not only while working in the wet lab but also while designing our biological system. Below you can find more information about how our team handled this subject.
Safety Training
    All of the students involved in our project have received safety instructions for working at the laboratory. Graduated students have attended a course offered by São Carlos Institute of Physics ( IFSC/USP ) about basic safety aspects, and then instructed undergraduate students about the precautions to be taken. The course included topics such as: the use of appropriated clothing and personal protective equipment; correct use of equipments such as autoclave, laminar hood flow, electrophoresis chamber and centrifuge; handling safety aspects and disposal of biological and chemical agents; specific danger of the main reagents used at the lab; and precautions about bioaerosol. All of the knowledge obtained in the course was applied on the project developed for iGEM.
Risks of The Project
Parts
    The goal of our iGEM project 2015 is to produce roxA (Rubber oxygenase) and Lcp (Latex clearing protein) in E.coli under laboratory or industrial conditions. Both of these proteins are not entirely elucidated, but it is known that they are responsible to degrade poly(isoprene) into smaller molecules. The main molecule produced in this process is ODTD (12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1"

CIEI-China,2017,Team:CIEI-China#HP#Gold Integrated#backup_-_-_TEXT.html," we gladly heard that they considered the forum as a useful chance to modify their own presenting process. “The suggestions from Dr. Wang made us jump out of the box easily and immediately came up with new idea about how to design our wiki,” said the leader of CIEI-Beijing, “quite amazing!” As an old saying goes “bystanders always know better”, the improvements mentioned by the professors, indeed, sparkled every single teammate’s mind, provoking them to find better solutions to their problems and move forward.
What’s more, idea-sharing seminar gave the forum members chances to exchange ideas about poster design and production, as well as listen to advice and stories from experienced professor, who is now running his personal bio-company.
Visiting the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science
In February, we brainstormed the idea of our project. During this time, we visited the Institute of Zoology and discussed with Dr. Wei, the expert of Conservation Genetics, for advice. We made clear of the prospection of idea with the professors; and they confirmed that our research topic will be very meaningful in the society and gave us some very useful suggestions.
Field Trip to Tsinghua University and Peking University
On July 20th and 21st, 2017, our team took a field trip to Tsinghua University and Peking University to attend a meeting with instructors and their former iGEMers. We explained our project idea and they warmly offered us some specific suggestions in our experiment design and human practice. Informed that our attempt was to improve the salt resistance of the yeast and increase the efficiency of food waste disposal, they generously provided us some information from the former teams which had studied the similar project from a different perspective. After the communication, we had a pleasant dinner and appreciated their help. Then they offered their contact information to us, looking forward to our further improvement.
Online communication group
Because it is hard for us to have face to face communication with other teams, we had a We-chat communication group FAFU CCiC with them. This group consists many teams, like BIT-CHINA. We shared our idea with many college students, and they gave us many professional suggestions and kind help.
Education
School
Several of our teammates gave the speeches in biology classes of Beijing 101 International Department and Beijing Changping New Oriental Foreign Language School. In every speech, we mainly introduced the history of iGEM, and how creative the match is—lots of innovation are originated from this match. Then, we introduced our project—how to effectively decompose the kitchen waste with"

Public Engagement and Education
This year, we've done a lot of works on human practices with painstaking effort. In addition, we consider seriously and extensively whether our project is safe, responsible and good for the world. Therefore, we designed and carried out numerous human practices around our project, and we integrate a lot of human practices considerations into every part of our project. Besides, we also conduct public engagement and education activities to have conversations with participates while inviting public input to shape the direction of our work and spreading synthetic biology and iGEM.
We really want to spread synthetic biology and iGEM to the public especially college students. Moreover, we found out most of the patients with hyperuricemia did not understand and care their own disease, and the public have so much misunderstanding about transgenic technology. So we conduct many public engagement and education activities to establish dialogues with participates while inviting public input to shape the direction of our work and spreading synthetic biology and iGEM. See all of our public engagement and education activities in this page.
“Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship” Experience Exchange with Students from West-China School of Medicine
In China, “Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship” is the most direct and convenient access to research for undergraduates. Many undergraduates who have interest in research would participant in this program and apply for projects they found attractive, which can help them get exercised in the related academic field. Since there are a large amount of students taking part in the program, experience sharing meetings are held every year to invite students doing research to share their ideas, designs, defenses, and implements. This year, we took part in the Training Program with our project of iGEM and finally got the sponsorship of the national fund. Under this situation, we are privileged to be invited as the sharer in the 2017 Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Experience Sharing Meeting held by West China Medical School, and spread our iGEM project to the audience in this meeting.
We have two purposes in this meeting, one is to introduce our project to the medical students of West-China Medical School, answer their questions and collect their advices, because we think opinions from medical students are valuable for us. After the meeting we communicated"

Today I did gel electrophoresis of yesterday’s Colony PCR.  I also did a miniprep of yesterday’s overnight cultures of both I0500 and I13453 and I determined the concentration using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer.  I then performed a restriction digest with EcoRI and PstI.  This is another verification step for the arabinose promoters.  If it works, we would expect to see band sizes at ~ 1.4 kb (1210 bp for the gene + 200 bp for the Biobrick Prefix and Suffix) for I0500 as well as bands at ~ 330 bp (230 bp for the gene + 200 bp for the Biobrick Prefix and Suffix).  I also spent some time looking into what kind of genes of interest we could use to test out our system.  I’ve been looking into some human genes that have been found to misfold in E Coli.  These could work as a positive control, in order to demonstrate that our system is working.

Throughout this wiki there are words in bold that indicate a relevance to human aspects. It will become obvious that human aspects are a part of almost everything in iGEM.
Collaboration
This page is a brief overview of the collaborations that we undertook with other teams during the summer. We did not keep a dated notebook of our collaborations, but the information is all held in emails between the teams.
Information and parts bridged the oceans between the Illuminati of Edinburgh and the WiFi Coli project of UNAM-Genomics Mexico. Our communications with UNAM-Genomic Mexico are available for perusal on their wiki .
We also worked with the Osaka iGEM team in the joint development of a RFC standard for the design and construction of new BioBrick parts and devices.
Mexico UNAM-Genomics
Our main collaborators on this project were Mexico UNAM-Genomics, who have been absolute stars this summer and supplied us with half the things this project needed to actually work in any way.
In early July it became apparent that Mexico were doing exactly the same project on bacterial light communication as we were. And when I say exactly, I mean down to each individual proposed BioBrick. Of course, we first panicked, then decided, since we were never going to complete this project ourselves, that we should contact them. This we did via an immediate email.
It turned out that Mexico had seen our project too and were also interested in collaboration. We held a Skype conference in mid July to discuss where to take the project. Both"

Depending on the radiation intensity and exposure time the damage caused to the genome is reversible; cells can repair their DNA and continue to grow, although they might carry point mutations. Since UV studies are scarce, our team decided to assay the maximum resistance of E. coli strains to UV radiation of a fixed intensity (340 µW/cm2). The experiment consisted of subjecting spot plated E.coli strains to timed pulses of UV light and comparing the output to a control set of bacteria which received no radiation at all.
Figure 4: Characterization of XL1-Blue (left) and DH5α (right) subjected to UV light (340 µW/cm2). Both strains are rather sensitive, but DH5α resists UV light better than XL1-Blue.
Therefore, E. coli proved very sensitive to UV light We also studied how sensitive these strains are when transformed with our Biobricks. As shown in Fig 5, Biobrick-expressing strains were more sensitive to                UV light compared to plasmid-only strains. However, Biobrick7 provided some resistance to radiation in DH5α compared with the controls.
Figure 5: Resistance of DH5α (left) and XL1-Blue (right) to UV pulses (340 µW/cm2). X axis values are given in seconds. Both strains are very sensitive to UV light with a maximum resistance of around 6 seconds.
pH & Salinity (1)
We also characterized E. coli resistance to a range of extreme pH values and salt concentrations. As shown in Table 1, none of the extreme conditions tested resulted in a total inhibition of E. coli’s growth.

Vacuum (1)
We designed a simple experiment to subject E.coli to Mars-like vacuum. It consisted of streaking Petri dishes and incubating them in deep vacuum                 during 48 hours. We also maintained control plates, grown at atmospheric pressure. After this incubation period, we measured the diameter of three colonies of each Petri dish.

‘Synthetic biology for kids and adults and everyone in between’
The University of Melbourne took up the challenge of teaching synthetic biology to all ages, embracing a ‘science for everyone’ approach. In so doing, we engaged in education outreach activities with kindergarten students from three childcare centres as well as both university and high school students from across Australia.
 
For kindergarten students
We decided to write the first in a series of children’s books for pre-schoolers aged 4-6 themed in the spirit of iGEM entitled ‘The Adventures of E. coli’ for a number of reasons:
Children aged 4-6 are in a key learning stage, during which their interest in science can significantly influence their long-term science education outcomes (Bowman, Donovan, & Burns, 2001, pp. 8-9).
There are lots of resources about science for older kids but not so many for kids at such a young age.
Picture books provide a springboard for further classroom activities
With the assistance of IndieMosh (Publishers link is here: http://www.indiemosh.com.au/author-42-iGEM-Melbourne-childrens-biology-science ) – a self-publishing facilitator – we managed to get our book in print and on Amazon, please see http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-E-Coli-Bianna-Makogon/dp/1925219208/
After we successfully published our book, it was time to take it to the audience. We approached childcare centres across Melbourne and negotiated for our book to be read to pre-schoolers and for our team members to come along and teach the kids about science.
The book reading was well received and was followed by playing some science-related games, and having a chat about science in groups. Please check out the video we made about the day:
We believe that through this book, young children can learn about basic concepts and the language of biology, forming a scientific foundation to be built on in future years. Moreover, it is our hope that this book will inspire children to continue to learn about science and to appreciate all the wonders that it holds.
The Kindle book is available from here: http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-E-Coli-Bianna-Makogon-ebook/dp/B00O"
