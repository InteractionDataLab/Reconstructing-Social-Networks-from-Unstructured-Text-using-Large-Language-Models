Water Samples
At the Oxford University SynBioCDT meet-up we asked multiple other UK iGEM teams to send us samples of water so we could measure the concentration of oestrogen and check for dangerous levels, while simultaneously looking for bacteria that already contained the oestrogen degrading pathways seen in Taiwan.
Hello iGEM Teams,
It's been a long, exciting and no doubt exhausting Summer. We have come a long way from the water samples you provided us in the Oxford Meet-up! You might be wondering what we did with them: Initially we tested the oestrogen concentration of the water, and found it to be too low for us to detect. In parallel with this we used the water samples to isolate bacteria we thought might possess the ability to degrade oestrogen. The behaviour of the circuit found in the sample isolated in Taiwan (2017) was not imitated by any bacteria from the water samples collected throughout the United Kingdom. Through these water samples we have expanded our understanding on just how rare these degradation circuits can be for such a common molecule as Oestrogen. We have all come a long way this Summer, and we wouldn't be here without you.
Thank you for helping us,
The Warwick iGEM Team
The team that sent us water samples are: Univeristy of Exeter, University College London, Cardiff University, University of Nottingham, Newcastle University. A big thanks to all these teams for collaborating with us and sending water samples to us.
Oxford
Oxford and Warwick shared DNA with one another - after both teams required more plasmids from each others kitplates, we filled in a few safety forms, met up and exchanged DNA. We were looking for help with our mathematical modelling and Oxford university were open to supporting us. They taught us how to create a hill function for our construct, and what information a hill function could transfer. See our modelling page for more.

Analysis
To prove the accuracy of kinetic equations of the related domains, we stacked the related equations according to the sequence of DEBS 1. When establishing the kinetic model of domain, we got into trouble. According to the analysis of reaction mechanism and kinetic equation we show before, the initial value of the kinetic equations on second AT domain depends on the concentration of DEBS 1, that is, the result of the kinetic equations on Module 2 are not affected by the result of previous domains.
However, if we have a further simplified model in which the second AT domain is ignored, the whole kinetic model stacked will be affected by the whole DEBS 1, including Loading, Module 1, Module 2.
Therefore, we establish two kinetic models stacked, and compare them with each other. Then we compare them with the kinetic model of the whole DEBS 1.

Figure 6. Influence of ssDNAp on d-AuNPs aggregation. At a concentration of 133mM NaCl, the d-AuNPs start to destabilize while with presence of ssDNAp the destabilization occurs at higher NaCl concentrations. A) Wavelength ratios of 620/520 of d-AuNPs solutions with NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 333mM with and without ssDNAp. B) Visual outcome of the d-AuNPs solution with NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 333mM without (top) and with (bottom) ssDNAp.
To further evaluate the influence of ssDNAp concentration on the d-AuNPs stabilization, we measured the stability at different NaCl concentrations with varying ssDNAp concentrations. Increasing ssDNAp concentration stabilizes the d-AuNPs, reducing the aggregation and changing the color of the solution from red to purple.
Figure 7. Influence of ssDNAp concentration on stabilization of d-AuNPs. At higher primer concentrations, the d-AuNPs are more stabilized. A) Spectrum of d-AuNPs solutions with NaCl concentration of 333mM incubated with a ssDNAp concentration ranging from 0 nM to 2.5nM. B) Visual outcome of the d-AuNPs solution with NaCl concentration of 333mM with increasing ssDNAp concentrations.
2.3 Visual Difference between Target and non-Target DNA
Design: We incubated DNA with targeting ssDNAp or non-targeting ssDNAp to show the visual difference between the two.
Results and interpretation: The ssDNAp was incubated with the corresponding target gene doping DNA to let the ssDNAp anneal and form the secondary structure. Subsequently, the d-AuNPs were added and their aggregation was analysed. The ssDNAp targeting EPO was compared with a ssDNAp that is not targeting EPO. The on-target ssDNAp stabilized the d-AuNPs as the ratio 620/520 wavelength was lower compared to off-target ssDNAp  (figure 8).

We estimated 15 minutes of lab technician’s time based off the advice of Professor Lovat's research team and Dr Pregibon. The processing of miRNA takes approximately 2 hours for 8 samples. However, if this process was further automated, this cost could be significantly reduced.
The total figure is likely to be an overestimate, as the two major components, namely the PAXgene blood RNA tube and the miRNAeasy Mini Kit which make up over 70% of the total aren’t for clinical use. These products are targeted at researchers and small volume applications, and have many extra features to match - which would not be required for our sensor. Economies of scale and stripping the products down to their core functions could introduce further significant savings.
We believe our test would cost less than £15 ($20) once this is taken into account, making it extremely cost effective as it can test for several diseases simultaneously.
Large cost savings could come by testing saliva instead of blood. Looking into the financials:

One of the colonies for construct 11 showed the correct band size, so it was sent for sequencing, but the part was 100bp of the Blac gene. We transformed constructs 9, 10 and 11 from GenScript in pSB1C3 again. Colony PCR showed some positive results for construct 9 and 11.
We also did a gel shift assay to test the binding of TALE A to its target site. We tried different concentrations for TALE A + [A] and we picked two of those to run TALE A + [B]. However, the concentrations of protein were too high. We will repeat the assay next week if lower concentrations of TALE.
Week 21: September 16 - September 20
This week, we did  plasmid prep and verification digest of constructs 9 ( pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE B -link-Kcoil) and 11 ( pSB1C3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE A -link-Blac). We have some good results for construct 11, so we did overnight of those, plasmid purification and submitted it to Parts Registry along with our other constructs.
We also repeated the gel shift assay, this time with TALE A and TALE B . The concentration range was from 0.1ng/uL of protein to 40ng/uL. Because Red Safe, which we used for staining the DNA, is not very sensitive we loaded higher amounts of DNA recommended and the gel revealed nonspecific binding by the TALES. We repeated the assay and this time we added chromosomal DNA to prevent nonspecific binding. We also added the recommend amount of DNA (55pM) and stained the gel after it ran with SYBR Green. This time, we were not able to see any bands at all.
We transformed construct 11 into E. coli BL21, cultured the colonies, induced them with IPTG and purified the protein. We performed Bradford Assay on our samples and the concentration range was between 0.20 and 1.06mg/mL. We ran these samples on a 7.5% SDS page gel.
Because construct 11 has Blac on it, we cultured the cells in ampicillin too as beta-lactamase provides resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics The medium density increased suggesting that beta-lactamase was functional in our construct.

2) Error-Prone PCR
In our experiment, we noticed that CUP1 promoter still has a certain degree of leakage expression. To make a better biosensor, we planned to reduce the leakage expression and increase the sensitivity. To reach this goal, we took the fluorescence intensity at both inductions or not into evaluation indexes.
The technology of error-prone PCR was taken into our experiment. Although there are many methods to introduce genetic diversity into a parent sequence, error-prone PCR is the most common way of creating a combinatorial library based on a single sequence. By adding some heavy metal ions into the PCR buffer and preparing dNTPs with different composition, new mutants were introduced into the CUP1 promoter. The whole procedure is shown in the following figure.
Fig. 4-5. The procedure for error-prone PCR experiment
Fig. 4-5. The procedure for error-prone PCR experiment
The library of promoter mutants obtained from error-prone PCR were ligated into plasmid pRS416 with two restriction sites (BamHI and XbaI). After that, we enriched different plasmids from E.coli and established the plasmid library with 132 samples. Then, different plasmids were transferred into S.cerevisiae BY4742 to test the fluorescence intensity under different conditions.
First, we tested and selected mutants with less leakage. Compared with control group, we test the fluorescence intensity with no induction and selected two mutants with lower fluorescence intensity. Actually, we test a lot of mutants, but most of them were not positive result. We picked EP-3, EP-5, EP-9, and EP-28 whose fluorescence intensity was less or close to the control group, and sequenced them. The sequencing results can be found in the parts' information: BBa_K2407013 (EP-3) , BBa_K2407014 (EP-5) , BBa_K2407015 (EP-9) , BBa_K2407016 (EP-28) .

Fig. 4-6. The leakage expression of different promoters
Second, we worked on the sensitivity of the biosensor. Leakage expression was not the only thing needed to be solved, and we also needed to increase the response range when it was induced. A good biosensor needs less leakage and more sensitivity.
We tested the 4 selected biosensors and control group with 0, 10, 100, 500, and "

Plants as Remote Sensors
The passage of “The Stockholm Convention on Persistant Organic Pollutants” in 2008 clearly demonstrates that the world has taken a much more active approach in addressing concerns about the environmental and ecological impact of pollutants (Rodriguez-Mozaz et al, 2006).  By demonstrating the practicality of plants as model biosensors for remote sensing, the Nevada team has addresses several issues that have plagued the field of biosensors since their original conception.  First by utilizing a natural receptor that can be localized to a specific cell type in plants, Nevada has shown the usefulness of transgenic plant biosensors that will respond locally to toxic compounds.  In addition, natural biosensors that do not inhibit basic metabolic functions and only fluoresce allow for a simpler model system that is easily adapted for future uses. Secondly, model plant organisms are much larger reporters of environmental stresses and can be easily clustered together to form ‘reporter clusters’ that are easily viewed at the source of the contamination.  Finally, the natural life cycle of plant organisms (when compared to traditional microorganism biosensors) is much longer and allows for the continued monitoring of a contaminated area over a much longer time while still providing a feasible option to control the plant’s reproductive cycle.  As discussed in “Perspective on Optical Biosensors and Integrated Sensor Systems” (Ligler, 2009), the use of on-site optical biosensors to tackle complex and difficult issues like environmental monitoring, food testing, and even counter- terrorism are driving issues in the proliferation of remote sensing technology.
Despite these potential successes, challenges still remain when utilizing and applying biosensors to environmental concerns.  Societal concerns about contamination with wild type plants are an ongoing and legitimate concern.  It may be possible to eliminate such concerns by engineering in a sterility defect that is coupled with a fluorescent reporter; it may be possible to prevent transgenic contamination.  For example, utilizing satellites to image biosensors from space would require a different, possibly IR receptor that can be viewed at"
TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#landmines_-_-_TEXT.html," would be a device that can be bought without any restrictions, bombs can be easily tested by their manufactures. Then, they can work on improving their quality and even making them undetectable. This will generate undesirable outcomes that will make the current methods used for screening landmines less efficient.
To mitigate this, strict practices and policies need to be developed for commercializing ELECTRACE.  A first step was done by our iGEM team, by discussing with different stakeholders that are active in combating the negative effects of landmines. Next, the governmental agencies play a pivotal role in designing suitable policies that allow safe and ethic commercialization of ELECTRACE. Our team envisions this device,  serving as a landmines detection application, to be  sold only to anti-mining organizations, and by any means should not be available on any retail store. This will reduce greatly this risk.
Another concern is related to the safety, more specially the danger that genetically modified organisms will escape from the lab into the environment and pose a detrimental effect on the earth’s ecosystem [8]. All these concerns can be mitigated by ensuring that all the safety requirements are met.
For an iGEM project, subsequently for our iGEM team, safety is an element of pivotal importance. First, during the development phase, our team strictly followed all the safety requirements imposed by TU Delft University, that hosts our laboratory. The safety procedures that guided the activity of our team, were thoroughly reviewed and approved by the chairman of the Safety Committee of the Applied Sciences faculty of Delft University of Technology, Jos van Winsen.
In addition, our team considered the safety for the end product. The is one of the reasons, why the team decided to realize the device  using  the well know bacterium E. coli. Also, a key element to mention here is that the organisms used for the device do not pose any risk to humans or the environment.
To conclude, there is a balance between the risks posed by bringing synthetic biology outside the lab and the positive externalities derived from the usage of ELECTRACE. Our team developed a microbial based sensor, capable of detecting landmines in a responsible way. Using landmines as a proof of principle for ELECTRACE, makes it  a device that reflects deep values, including human safety, sustainability, justice and integrity. In consequence, the benefits of using ELECTRACE to detect landmines mentioned previously, outweighs the possible negative effects.

BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Integrated Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," shows that when the cap structure of microtubule plus end subunit containing GDP- beta tubulin instead of GTP- beta tubulin, microtubule becomes unstable and will quickly depolymerize.
Fig.3 Microtubule dynamic instability
As is shown in the figure, there are two kinds of Dimer, called GDP and GTP, with blue and red two connected to the circular. These dimers have close relationship with each other, and there are three important modes of their action:
GTP-tubulin dimer in endpoint can aggregate new GTP to make the single protofilament grow, and microtubules extend.
At the same time, the endpoint GTP may also be made off, thereby protofilaments shorter.
Any place of GTP (in addition to the right endpoints of the GTP) made made random hydrolyzed to GDP have a chance.
We built a simple GUI interface to simulate the Microtubule dynamic instability. As for a tubulin, we can adjust the parameters of K, R, h, GDP and GTP to display number and length of tubulin in real time. Among them, K, h, R is the number obeying certain distributions.
According to above principles, we built the simulation process of the visual program in MATLAB@, Fig 2 is the schematic diagram of the principle of GTP hydrolysis. Among them  means GTP, D means GDP, R means the probability of endpoint GTP polymerizing with new GTP, K means the probability of endpoint falling off, h means the probability of GTP hydrolysis into GDP. It should be noted that once GTP is transferred to GDP, it will not have polymerization, fall off, or hydrolysis, and will become stable state.

*It should be noted that most of our analysis is on a “team” basis with less focus on individual founder characteristic, therefore, enabling factors related to individual characteristics are omitted in this study.
[2]
Advising
Once the paradigms of important factors were established for entrepreneurship, experts in biotech and entrepreneurship were contacted for further consultation. The advisors included academic advisors and professors in synthetic biology, representatives of BioM (the biotech cluster in Munich, Germany), entrepreneurial advisors from the startup accelerator TechFounders and current and past participants of iGEM. All of these advisors contributed to the research methodology as well as the quantitative survey and qualitative interview design.
Research Approach
First, 11 of qualitative interviews were held to better understand the factors that affected Founders and non-Founders from the iGEM population. Second, a quantitative survey was designed to analyze the significance of different variables in business creation in biotech (specifically in iGEM). From the survey a statistical analysis was performed to measure the degree to which the variables affected founding a business.
The survey analyzes current and past iGEM participants, who are working in relatively the same, with similar education levels, time frames and resources.
Potential Limitations of the Data
Although the sample size (n = 140) is decent for data analysis, a larger sample size could potentially provide better results. Furthermore, as there were only a handful of business founded from iGEM (less than 20), the sample size of Founders from iGEM remains small due to this limitation. However, this only strengthens the reasoning for conducting research on this topic, to understand why so few teams have founded businesses and what can be improved to make it more common in the future.
Qualitative Data Approach
For the qualitative data, 12 past iGEM participants were interviewed, 4 of which founded a business (Founders) and 8 who had not (non-Founders). The goal of the interviews was to understand the Founders/non-Founders decision process and the"

In our system, we used roGFP2-Orp1, which can reflect the ROS level in cell immediately through                         the rate of the concentration of two kinds of protein states, as our signal output. But                         according to this measurement principle, the concentration of whole roGFP2-Orp1 can effect the                         final signal output strength, even detect the same sample. So, we built a series of gene                         circuits with different transcription level promoters to express roGFP2-Orp1 and hoped to solve                         this interfere. Four common promoters were chosen, FBA1, TEF2, TEF1, ENO2. We tested four gene                         circuits and found different promoters could work as expected. Considering the application of                         our system in the future, we made this collection of these four parts and wished these parts                         can be used in different antioxidant detection.

We run an electrophoresis of the digestions we made yesterday, but it hasn't worked properly, it seems the process still needs some fine-tuning.
We spend some time preparing the rewards for those who gave us money for the project through the crowd-funding platform. Letters, funny badges, videos...

We have a nice visit today! Lauren, from the team of Pennsylvania, is here to tell us about her project, and learn a bit more about ours. Carlos is having an intense discussion on kinetics with her while Marta struggles to design the primers we'll need for the PCR reactions next week. There's no way to get them exactly right, what a nightmare!

We think that besides a competition, iGEM is a social event and a unique opportunity to get in touch with young scientists all around the world with the same interests as you. It is really grateful to interact with other teams, share experiences, help each other and talk about science. For this reason we have tried to follow as many teams as possible to know what they are working on and try to help as far as possible.  Twitter and Facebook are great tools for this, as well as the new social network only for igemers that the Trieste Team has recently developed:
More specifically we have been collaborating with the following teams:
Copenhagen and Chile
As we are working on very similar projects (the development of a biolamp that includes cyanobacteria) we have been contacting each other during the summer to help us and know the general aspects of our projects.
Chile has been open to send us some of the BioBricks they have construct, but because lack of time we couldn't test them in our system.
We have provided Copenhagen the metabolic model of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and a software to analyze it to help them with the modeling part. On the other hand they offered us the luxCDABE cassette provided from Tom Knight without the illegal XbaI restriction site, as well as some DH5α E.coli strains done by themselves.
Thank you to be open to work with us :)!
Uppsala
We asked Uppsala (at the beginning of July) if they could send us the system they developed last year (link a la wiki) to test if it could work in Cyanobacteria. They send us the following parts:

We discussed the foundations of synthetic biology itself, the core problems in the synthetic biology field and potential routes to go down with our project. Our following discussion focused on taking a measurements based approach to iGEM instead, testing components to identify their optimum operating conditions. The idea was to attempt to identify how environmentally dependant the biobricks are.

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#modelorganism_-_-_TEXT.html," when talking about living things: in synthetic biology, the term chassis primarily concerned bacteria, and specifically Escherichia coli. A chassis is meant to receive designed devices composed of standardized parts realizing specific functions.
Thus a chassis is meant to become a living tool, such as a biosensor (giving us reliable results concerning the state of an environment), a biological factory (producing materials of values, like drugs or fuel) and a cleaning machine doing bioremediation. Even when used for more fundamental purposes (exchanging information, counting), the interest of chassis is to be the container of any application that we can imagine being possibly implemented in it. As the parts implemented in the chassis aimed to be standardized and as the chassis is aimed to be inserted in an industrial system of production, the chassis has to fit some criteria of technological artifacts, as safety, efficiency, reliability and profitability [11]. These are, according to M. Bunge, the epistemological principles driving technology.
These principles of technology applied to living beings make some of us feel uncomfortable, especially when it starts dealing with animals. Not that we are absolutely against animal experimentation, but we are not sure that chassis is a term epistemologically relevant concerning animal biotechnology. After all modifying genomes in order to change the properties of a living being did exist before synthetic biology. Rationally designing animals is not new; mice have been deeply modified in order to serve science since the “construction” of OncoMouse in the mid-80s and these operations lead to intricate controversies on patent laws [12]. Engineering a synthetic, orthogonal hormone as a communication device certainly provides an interesting tool to do research on Xenopus and maybe helps reducing the number of tadpoles needed to test drugs and cosmetics in biotechnological companies. But we have to make it clear that Xenopus is not a tool, it is an animal, an organism on which we are doing tests.
This statement implies some epistemological differences, a tool or an instrument is a well known artifact that gives an output corresponding with the input. We are not interested on what is happening inside it. Chassis gives us the idea of a framework which had no other meaning or end but supporting man-made objects. A chassis is nothing by itself, has no end in itself, it is something that has to be built on. It is not interesting as we already know it because we built it in a particular purpose. There is no adaptation, no research to do on an already existing chassis as everything is already designed to be functional. Hence we believe that this term might be misguiding.
The chassis is an ideal of"

Cell Free Protein Synthesis System Optimisation: The Results
BioBricks used: BBa_K515105 (Imperial College London 2011)
Rationale and Aim
Cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems have large potential as alternative chassis for applications such biosensors or diagnostic tests. This is because generally, biosensors are needed to function outside of the laboratory environment. Whole cells, which are traditionally used as chassis, can be problematic in these scenarios due to issues with containment and release of genetically modified organisms. While CFPS systems are promising alternatives to whole cells, there are currently some drawbacks, primarily their cost and variability between batches of cell extract. To address these issues, this part of the project had the following aims: (i) develop a functional CFPS system, (ii) demonstrate the usefulness of a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach towards identifying which supplements are the most crucial for maximal CFPS activity, and (iii) demonstrate how DoE can be used to optimise each batch of cell extract for maximal CFPS activity.

Atlanta Science Festival
The Atlanta Science Festival is a three day celebration of science.  Lambert's iGEM team was proud to be chosen as a sponsor of the event.  We held a Discovery Dialogue entitled Synthetic Biology that was open to the public.  The panelists included a FBI agent, State Legislator, Immunologist from the CDC, Biologist who serves on the Ethics board at Emory University and Professor of Chemical Engineering.
The varying perspectives led to a lively discussion led by the students.  Topics ranged from how genetic engineering impacted their jobs, ethics of genetic engineering, biological weapons, GMO's in agriculture, regulations and labeling among others.  The public took part in a question and answer session as well.  The attendees were polled prior to and again when leaving about their attitudes towards synthetic biology.  More than 60% stated at the beginning that they were hesitant to approve the science of genetic engineering. After the panel discussion that dropped to just under 19%.  The Discovery Dialogue was such a success that Lambert's team has been asked to partner with the Atlanta Science Festival with a longer event.  Based on the feedback we received from the participants during this coming year, 2016, we are putting together a 1/2 day event that will include sessions: focused on agricultural use of synthetic biology, health and medicinal therapies and panel discussing the safety of synthetic biology.[description]

On another note, the metabolic pathway of adrenaline includes the intermediate dopamine from which it is possible to synthesize opioids such as morphine26. With in-depth knowledge, material and extra work, it would, therefore, be possible to use our system to synthesize these opioids for resale on the black market or for recreational use.
Do benefits outweigh the risks?
Every development in science can have consequences, on health, environment, society, economy, religion and more. The purpose of bioethics is to study the ethical issues related to biology and medicine. Our main concern about bioethics with our project is about biosecurity because adrenaline is already an existing medicine. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), an independent federal advisory committee charged with advising the U.S. government on biosecurity issues and “dual use” research - that which may be used for either good or ill - defines the term as follows: “biosecurity refers to the protection, control of, and accountability for high-consequence biological agents and toxins, and critical relevant biological materials and information, to prevent unauthorized possession, loss, theft, misuse, diversion, or intentional release”27.
There are two opposing principles regulating actions in the area of synthetic biology: the “proactionary principle” and the “precautionary principle”. They range from doing nothing - that is, allowing the field of synthetic biology to proceed without limits or regard for public or environmental safety - to halting or substantially slowing its progress until risks can be identified. The “proactionary principle” also assumes that an emerging biotechnology should be considered “safe, economically desirable and intrinsically good unless and until shown to be otherwise”28. Those are both extreme measures and a middle ground would be an ongoing system of “prudent vigilance” that carefully evaluates risks of harm along with benefits.
Responsible research calls for prudent vigilance, establishing processes for assessing benefits along with safety and security risks both before and after projects are undertaken, and as technologies develop and diffuse into the public and private sectors. Scientists have been conducting biological researches that pose risks throughout the history of modern science. Over time, safety and security procedures have expanded and evolved to increase the likelihood that risks will be anticipated, mitigated, and monitored and that responses can be activated quickly should harmful consequences arise. These principles allow for the well-being of the communities today and, more importantly, of future generations.
All this considered, responsible science should reject the technological imperative: the mere fact that something new can be done does not"

In addition, Mr. ZHANG Jingyun helped us design all the constructs and primers on our side, and Dr. LIM Yan Ping.
We would also like to thank Dr. FOO Jee Loon from the National University of Singapore, who provided invaluable insights on the more technical aspects of our project.  For further details on how Dr Foo’s suggestions have shaped our project, please refer to our Human Practices page.
Mr. Clarence TAN Kang Lek loaned and set up his DSLR to help us create a time lapse of our biomanufacturing of luteolin in a bioreactor.
PART 3: HUMAN PRACTICES
Please check out our Human Practices page for a list of our interviewees.  They helped us better understand how to tackle the problems we faced, and provided a refreshing  and holistic perspective on our project.
PART 4: HARDWARE
Miss TAN Annie and Mr. YIP Chi Ho, Justin helped us with the procurement of equipment for assembly of our hardware, for example helping us purchase bearings for use in our peristaltic pump. They also helped process our Item Request Lists so our purchases could be reimbursed.  While we did not actualize the ideas generated by Mr. Brian Shohei TEO during our discussion on how to refine the design of Light Wait, we still learned much about good design practice and unconventional thinking, and did our best to practice these principles in later designs.  He reviewed our Hardware page, along with Mr. Eugene EE. Mr. Anuwar bin SHUKOR and Mr. TAY Peng Yeow supervised us and ensured our safety in our use of the 3D printer and laser cutter.

We would like to thank Dr. YEOH Jing Wui for imparting to us the principles of mathematical modelling which helped us analyse the relevant biochemical pathways, introducing to us the concepts of optimisation,  and perhaps most importantly, being approachable and allowing our team to consult her throughout the course of our project. She gave us useful and practicable advice  - for example, when we were not able to get good fits based on our model, she told"
BIT,2018,Team:BIT-China#roGFP2-Orp1MichaelisEquationModel_-_-_TEXT.html,"$$
Here we define a new parameter OxDroGFP2 to reflect the degree of oxidation of                     roGFP2.                     Meanwhile, facilitate subsequent calculations.
$$OxD_{roGFP2}=\frac{[roGFP2_{ox}]}{[roGFP2_{ox}]+[roGFP2_{red}]}$$
According to Hypothesis 3, we can correlate the redox state of roGFP2 with the fluorescence value                     measured by the macroscopic observables easily. To establish this relationship, several molecular                     quantities followed need to be defined. i405red, i405ox, i488red,                     and i488ox are the fluorescence                     intensities contributed by a single roGFP2 molecule at the indicated wavelength and redox state.                     Ntotal is the total number of roGFP2 molecules. Nred is the number of reduced                     roGFP2 molecules. Nox is the number of oxidized roGFP2 molecules. Based on the assumption that the overall fluorescence                     intensity is equal to the sum of the fluorescence intensities from the individual roGFP2 molecules,                     the relationships were given in Table 1.
Table 1. Relationships Between Fluorescence Intensities and Probe Molecules
Condition
Formula
Limiting condition 1:
Ntotal = Nred
I405red = Ntotal · i405red
Complete reduction
Nox = 0
I488red = Ntotal · i488red
Limiting condition 2:
Ntotal = Nox
I405ox = Ntotal · i405ox
Complete oxidation
Nred = 0
I488ox = Ntotal · i488ox
Actual measurement
Ntotal = Nred + Nox
I405 = Nox · i405ox + Nred · i405red
I488 = Nox · i488ox + Nred · i488red
By substituting the resulting equations (right column of Table 3) into OxDroGFP2=Nox/Ntotal,                     the                     relationship between OxDroGFP2 and the macroscopic observables can be deduced.[1]
$$oxD_{roGFP2}=\frac{I405\cdot I488_{red}-I405_{red}\cdot I488}{I405\cdot I488_{red}-I405\cdot                     I488_{ox}+I405_{ox}\cdot I488-I405_{red}\cdot I488}$$

Dose-response curve
This graph shows the action of IPTG on RFU output. Since it doesn't seem to saturate, there was perhaps still some repression by LacI occurring in our cells. Interestingly, LacI does have a quantifiable action on our Ptet promoter - meaning that we can use it efficiently in our second reporter system .

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

At lower temperature, cI dimer (cI repressor, BBa_K098997 ) will block the RNA polymerase from further transcription, which leads to the gene after this circuit BBa_K098995 can’t be expressed. Although, at higher temperature, cI dimer (cI repressor, BBa_K098997 ) will degrade and RNA polymerase can transcribe the DNA sequence again, which means that the expression of the gene after this circuit can be recovered.

Also, our two captains and our PI met Dean Wolf, Dean of Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, Roger Trippel, Senior Director of Development and Individual Giving, and Abigail Kaun, Special Assistant to the Dean. We discussed the project to-date, our outreach efforts, and shared ideas for managing both our and future iGEM UCSC team’s funds.
Created first batch of YPD medium and also created 80% glycerol freeze stocks of our Y. lipolytica strain. We attempted to miniprep our pXRL2- and pUC19-containing E. coli but we made a mistake by switching the order of wash buffers used from the Zyppy Miniprep Kit. The Nanodrop curve of the plasmid sample was ragged and thus we will need to attempt this again.

This week, the captains held check-ins with each individual on the team to hear concerns and alleviate worries, since we are now halfway through the summer. While the captains were busy with meetings, the rest of the team was working hard as always. Our modeling team started a growth curve for Yarrowia lipolytica so we can better understand the yeast’s growth rate, our riboswitch team began lab work, our plasmid team started linearizing plasmids, and our outreach team continued to update the wiki page and started creating a presentation for high schoolers.
Four of our team members and our PI took a vacation to Minneapolis that wasn’t much of a vacation at all. The small group toured Medtronic's Operational Headquarters, Physiological Research Laboratories, and the University of Minnesota's Visible Heart Lab. Almost every other second of the trip was spent on the BMES Coulter College Conference, which required teams to come up with a medical solution to a need. Our team focused on hypertension in resource-constrained settings and developed a solution in the form of a blood-pressure-monitoring phone case and app. Even after the conference, the fivesome was hard at work; they met with the University of Minnesota iGEM team, toured their lab, and gave advice about human practices, outreach, and fundraising.
The first step to prepare for Gibson Assembly was to linearize pUC19 and pXRL2 via PCR. We performed PCR Over the course of this week we had bands in strange and random locations. We were led to believe"

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Components_-_-_TEXT.html," Pumps
We have adopted the design of syringe pumps from the 2016 BostonU_HW Team, Neptune. Neptune originally utilized these pumps to input fluid to microfluidic devices, but we have integrated them to TERRA in order to actuate control valves on microfluidic devices.
Actuating valves of CIDAR Lab microfluidic devices typically requires manually applying a negative pressure to control ports and the PDMS layer using syringes. This then requires the scientist to stay by the microfluidic chip throughout the entire experiment and allows for human error. By utilizing syringe pumps,  TERRA allows scientists to automate experimental processes and reduces error.
The syringe pumps are comprised of 3D-printed supports and servo motors. The 3D-printed supports include mounts for servo motors and syringes, as well as an arm that attaches the servo motors to the syringes. The arm allows for the conversion of rotational motion of the motor to translational motion of the syringe plunger. This system enables scientists to automate actuation of valves, thereby controlling the selection of output fluids from a microfluidic device.
Click here to learn more about how we integrated and improved on Neptune's syringe pumps:
Improving on Neptune
TERRA includes both front-end and back-end software to collect data, process data, and control hardware accordingly. The front-end software, the UI, is where the user will directly interact with TERRA while the back-end software is responsible for controlling the XY Plane and Control Syringes.
User Interface
The UI is an intuitive web application that enables the user to interact with TERRA. The interface is designed so that it takes the necessary experiment information from the user and sends it to the device. The user will enter how many outputs their microfluidic chip has, the flow rate on the microfluidic chip, and properties about the fluid itself (density, continuous vs droplet, etc.). Given this information we are able to use our TERRA droplet predictive model to calculate a dispense time. The user can then select which wells each output should be dispensed into. This information is sent to the Arduino and enters the back-end software components. The video below demonstrates how an experimenter would use the UI.
The UI is able to facilitate communication between the user and TERRA through the use of Peripheral Manager, a daemon that runs on the workstation and facilitates communication between cloud-based applications and hardware connected to the workstation. This communication link uses WebSockets, a communication protocol that enables two way communication between the browser and server. Peripheral"

6Conclusion
“Study the past, if you would divine the future” – Confucius
Scientific study is generally perceived as the development of new ideas and novel data, but underlying this is the fact that scientific advancement is made by building formerly known information on top of new innovation.  Indeed, without the discovery of the cell, synthetic biology would never exist.
In the same way that scientific advancements can be made by looking at prior invention, the Lethbridge iGEM Team believes that synthetic biology ethical advancements can also be made by looking at ethical concerns of the past.  Due to the fact that synthetic biology is such a new science, we are in the position to dictate ethical rules that should be implemented as new discoveries are made.
Lethbridge iGEM Team has chosen to look at significant scientific discoveries of the past and analyze them from ethical, environmental, economic, legal, and social standpoints.  Learning how ethics has been dealt with (or should have been dealt with!) in the past can significantly shape the direction of ethical development in the field of synthetic biology.
Through our analysis of cloning, antibiotics, internet, and nuclear power, the Lethbridge iGEM Team will “divine the future” of ethics and its relationship with the newly developing field of synthetic biology.
Cloning
Most textbooks and scientific papers define cloning as the biological process during which an individual(s) produces identical individuals mostly as a result of asexual reproduction.  In biotechnology, cloning refers to creating multiple copies of DNA fragments, cells or organisms.  At the molecular and cellular level, cloning and genetic engineering have greatly impacted the manner in which we live our lives. Research in these areas have led to the development of techniques such as PCR and recombinant technology, which have numerous applications in the lives of humans - from advances in medicine which facilitated synthesis of insulin for diabetic patients, to the modern day forensic units, which use PCR to amplify DNA and identify criminals.

Bioterrorism
Synthetic biology might, in the wrong hands, lead to the development of weapons. Yet knowledge of the subject is required as is also the case with nuclear or chemical weaponry. In the case of synthetic biology, it might even be easier if one wishes to do harm to use a much simpler different method. Right now when submitting a research proposal the dual-use agreement is obligatory and also questions have to be answered regarding the purpose of the project and its potential misuse.
Pandora’s Box
Opening the box of Pandora is not seen as a good concept. Every innovation can be seen as a box of Pandora as there is always a risk associated with them. To keep the box closed for this reason would halt innovation. An extra ethical question might arise according to Johan De Tavernier if this technique shifts from bacteria to higher animals. Then the integrity of the animal itself becomes a factor. Then a cost-benefit analysis has to be done where the suffering of the animal is added to the equation before the project is started. The goal has to justify the means as it were.
New Patent War
Our panel members and our moderator.
Patents lead to a concentration of power and result in social inequality. The opinions were divided among our panel members. On the one hand, patents are needed for investments in research and development and innovation although it is not proven that there is more research and development after implementation. It is certainly necessary to convert the new invention into a product and bring it on the market.  On the other hand, it blocks access to knowledge and there is a new trend of acquiring patents by looking for people who might have breached this patent in order to acquire a reimbursement.
Next to the patent system, one can also use the open-source system. In this system all the information is freely available and anyone can make use of this information without consent of the publisher. An interesting new development for the future is a hybrid form between the two systems. A number of examples already exists: In the medical applications an exception of the patent for third world countries is made to improve the availability. Another example is the addition of an exception to a patent for countries where the genetic material of the developed product is coming from.
Questions From The Public
Is dual use a valid reason to halt synthetic biology?
There are risks associated with synthetic biology. Is dual use a valid reason as every advancement in technology also tends to increase its potential for destruction? Shouldn’t we look at the time it takes to repair when something goes wrong? For instance in case of a nuclear disaster it will take thousands of years to revert to its normal state."
Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Blog#14-06-23-01_-_-_TEXT.html," antibiotics research due to economic reasons. Today, they can make more money out of cardiac and cancer treatments that patients have to take for years, than out of antibiotics that the patient has to take just for a few days to get healthy again. As the German business news magazine Wirtschaftswoche reported today, the circumstances are so extreme that even governments – usually the last ones to react – are now investing in order to make antibiotic research palatable for the pharma industry again: The EU plans to accelerate research through their New Drugs for Bad Bugs program while the British GlaxoSmithKline receives 200 million dollars from the US Ministry of Health with the order to develop new drugs against antibiotic resistant germs. But it did not take any government money for big pharma companies such as Roche and Bayer to make a face-turn and invest again in fields closed or demerged a long time ago. The French-German company Sanofi, too, also expects good business. In collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biotechnology and Applied Ecology in Gießen, they retrieve their collection of over 120.000 frozen microbes that once was a good source for novel drugs. Some of the fungal and bacterial strains are more than a century old. Such stocks are not only an invaluable treasures for companies like Sanofi, but they are also a sort of life insurance for human kind against the constantly emerging new forms of extremely aggressive, life-threatening germs. Nonetheless, it will take years until market-ready drugs arise from the now kicked off research projects. Thus hope especially rests on some few pharma and biotech companies that unperturbedly did their research, and that are already one step ahead of the others. They are already up with new or pre-commercial drugs. It will depend on these new remedies whether mankind in the 21st century will or will not give way again to pathogenic germs.

Throughout our summer outreach we noticed that while most high school students were in the process of learning about DNA and genome editing, they had never been exposed to the modern applications and techniques used in bioengineering. After discussing with teachers and researching the teaching standards, we learned that the Virginia Standards of Learning had not been updated since 2010 and held an outdated representation of synthetic biology.
The Current Biology Standard States
The student will investigate and understand common mechanisms of inheritance and protein synthesis. Key concepts include exploration of the impact of DNA technologies.
This standard and the 2010 curriculum framework do not include modern technologies like CRISPR-cas, DNA transformation or the advancements of DNA sequencing. Instead, the standard and framework focus primarily on the human genome project, ethics and eugenics and cloning. These examples no longer encompass all that is possible and relevant in synthetic biology.
As synthetic biology grows it becomes more important for students of every discipline to have an up to date understanding of the science. Additionally, because synthetic biology is inherently multidisciplinary, students who hope to work in any STEM field will ultimately benefit from a strong understanding of bioengineering. To broaden our reach and ensure we could impact as many people as we possibly could, our team decided to improve the Virginia Standards of Learning. Changing these standards will benefit the 1,293,049 students currently enrolled in the Virginia public school system, and have a lasting impact as more students enter and graduate from the Virginia school system.
We began by reaching out to Dr. Anne Petersen, the Virginia State Science Coordinator. Our email described the importance of updating the Virginia Science Standards to reflect the advancements made in synthetic biology. The email can be found here . The email also included a proposal for a new science standard which can be found here .
This email resulted in a lasting collaboration. Over the past months we have shared our activities booklet and corresponded extensively over email and over the phone to create a new biology standard representing synthetic biology under standard BIO. 5. The final draft of the"

The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) had invited the Hessian iGEM teams to the ACHEMA in Frankfurt. The ACHEMA is the largest exhibition on Chemical Engineering, Environmental Protection and Biotechnology and offered the teams a wide range of interested audience during the presentation of their projects. At the booth of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the teams of Darmstadt, Frankfurt und Marburg were able to present their projects. The Darmstadt team could not only inspire the audience with posters, but also with a presentation as well as many flyers for their project. Laymen, scientists and companies could be convinced by the project ""Next Generation Recycling"" of the Technical University of Darmstadt. The contact to the other iGEM teams from Hessia was of course promoted and it was possible to replace the content and progress of the projects. The project offers in the area of environmental protection many approaches, so it was not surprising that the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU) was interested in the project. Members of the DBU stayed a long time for intensive discussions at the booth. To conclude, the ACHEMA offered the team an exciting platform on which they could perform a ""reality check"" of their project. The interesting discussions with members of economy and science showed them the deep meaning of their project and point out that the iGEM Team of Darmstadt is on a good path.

And for precise quantitative data, we chose fluorescent proteins (GFP, BFP, mRFP) as our actuators to mix the colors. What’s more, to avoid the influence of leakage of the fluorescent proteins and get more colors, we also constructed 3 plasmids which only contained 2 output fluorescent protein genes (GFP & mRFP, BFP & mRFP, GFP & BFP), and transformed into the E.coli with pJFR1, pJFR2, pJFR3.
Figure 7. The process of overlapping the fluorescent pictures, filtering the colors and get the results.
We chose lights of 13 wavelengths from 395 nm to 660 nm, to test our system and produce colors. We firstly use light to illuminate our bacteria for hours on the plate, and then use fluorescence camera to excite the red, green and blue fluorescence and capture the photos. Then using imageJ and Photoshop, we can overlap the three pictures, filter the colors and get our results of mixing colors(Figure 6).
Figure 8. The color spectrum built from fluorescent color mixing.
Figure 9.The rose we created by using the colors we mixed.
The figure7 demonstrated the results of our fluorescent color mixing. Using color picker to pick out the mixed colors from our pictures, we built a even wider spectrum with more colors, with which we created a colorful rose as shown in the figure 8. This result further proved that our system worked and our concept that we can use convenient method—light control—to achieve the mixing and changing the colors of the bacteria was valid.
Figure 10. The color spectrum built from fluorescent color mixing.
To semi-quantitatively analyze the fluorescent plate results, we extracted the RGB value of the pictures and got curves showing the relationship between the R value, G value and B value and the wavelengths of the light. From the figure 9 we could see the trend and the peaks of the curves, that the B value reached the top at the wavelength of 490nm, the G value at 565nm, and the R value at 620nm. The R, G, B value could roughly show the expression of red, green and blue fluorescent proteins and their fluorescence intensity, greatly fitted with the literature data that the blue-light sensor was induced best at 470nm, green-light sensor"

The result of this toxicity assay is, that wild type plants are not negatively affected by waste water treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, which were sampled from the local WWTPs Großlappen (waste water 1) and Garching (waste water 2). So the filter system could work effectively placed in the effluent stream of WWTPs or on surface water. However, sea water seems to influence the vitality of the moss, so the implementation of the PhyscoFilter in salt water is not recommended. Furthermore we can conclude that substances the genetically modified moss should degrade (Erythromycin, Catechol) or accumulate (Diclofenac) only affect the plant - if they do at all - at concentrations much higher than they occur naturally (see table 1). Also the assay indicates that it is possible to grow the plant on agar plates with often used antibiotics (Tetracycline, Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, Kanamycin), since the working concentration has no influence on the moss. This can be very useful to prevent bacterial contamination of plates. As expected G418 shows toxic influence on wild type moss and can therefore be used as selection substance for transformed plants, though it takes a few days to take effect.

Assumptions
To derive mathematical equations describing the above systems, we made some simplifying assumptions.
We neglect the effects of dilution/ growth. We thus assume the cell’s volume to be constant over time.
We assumed that the components in our system are neither affected by nor affect other cellular mechanisms.
As there is no additional information gained from modeling transcription and translation for the dark state of YF1(yDD) and the inactive form of FixJ (ji), we lumped these processes and assumed that they can be described by a single parameter.
We also assumed the rates of production, binding, and degradation of mRNAs and proteins to be linear which results in a first order differential equations system
To model the influence of light on the system, we assumed light activation to occur similar to the model of phytochrome B dimerization described in Klose et al 3 as
N
⋅
k
2
. In addition, we consider in our system the different stages of YF1 (yDD, yDL/LD, and yLL) as described by Möglich et al 2 . Translated to our system, this means that with increasing light intensities (N), the pool of activated YF1 (yDL/LD and yLL) would deplete the dark state of YF1 (yDD), which is responsible for the phosphorylation and thus activation from inactive FixJ (ji) to active FixJ (ja). As all stages of YF1 form a dimer, we assumed dimerization to occur quickly and be the dominant and relevant form for our system. Lastly, we assumed a quasi steady-state approximation (Michaelis-Menten kinetics) for the effect of activated FixJ (ja) on the expression downstream of the RFP (RFPm) reporter gene. A detailed system design is provided here.
Results
With our mathematical model we can describe the behavior, as shown in Figure 12, of both systems as tested in the lab by Ohlendorf et al 1 . We can thus say that we built a simplified mathematical representation of the pDusk and pDawn system which can describe the systems’ behavior.

Our project aims for the biological implementation of cellular automata with XOR logic gates. In order to achieve this, we found a way to create a regular grid of cells with a defined, optimal neighborhood. This means channel length, well size, and medium were optimized and the properties were modelled with Matlab and Comsol whenever feasible. With these in silico results in mind we used CAD software to design our custom made molds, which where then 3D-printed and used for the production of PDMS chips . The cells containing one of our genetic circuits were encapsulated in alginate beads and loaded on the millifluidic chip arranged in a Sierpinski triangle. All other wells were filled with beads containing cells not able to produce GFP as a background reference. This approach allowed us to establish a method for measuring diffusion and cell-to-cell communication. In particular, a step towards the emergence of complex patterns by cell-to-cell communication was made. Also the Comsol model regarding pattern formation was confirmed experimentally with our rapid-prototyping approach. The final time-lapse video of the cell-to-cell communication experiment is shown below in video 1.

Speaking to Kevin Esvelt, the inventor of PACE, was a real pleasure. We had the great opportunity to host Kevin Esvelt for a lecture at our university and when he visited our iGEM lab he provided extremely helpful advice not only on how to set up PACE technically, but also on how to design corresponding experiments safely and responsibly and how to communicate our project outside the scientific community.
Kevin Esvelt made us aware of possible challenges we would meet when running PACE, for instance, he mentioned that phage-washouts in the lagoon are a problem he faced several times when setting up PACE in his own lab for the first time. Therefore, we developed a real-time PCR readout to test, whether phages are still present in the lagoon and if not, to re-inoculate to keep the evolution going.

Project description
The development of sensitive and selective biosensors is an important topic in synthetic biology . Biosensors can be applied in a wide range - from the detection of environmental toxics up to clinical diagnostics. Because cells have to sense their surroundings, there are a lot of natural systems that are similar to a biosensor. Prejudicial cellular biosensors often show negative side effects that complicate any practical application. Common problems are the limited use outside a gene laboratory due to the use of genetically engineered cells, the low durability because of the usage of living cells and the appearance of undesired signals induced by endogenous metabolic pathways.
To solve these problems, the iGEM-Team Bielefeld 2011 aims at developing a cell-free bisphenol A (BPA) biosensor based on a coupled enzyme reaction fused to S-layer proteins for everyday use. Bisphenol A is a supposedly harmful substance which is used in the production of polycarbonate. To detect BPA it is degraded by a fusion protein under formation of NAD+ which is detected by an NAD+ dependent enzymatic reaction with a molecular beacon . Both enzymes are fused to S-layer proteins which build up well-defined nanosurfaces and are attached to the surface of beads. By providing these nanobiotechnological building blocks the system is expandable to other applications.
An overview of our project is shown in the figure below. The background and the current status of each subproject is described further below . To have a quick insight of what is happening in our lab take a look at our Lab"

TEAM SPIRIT!
Our team consists of thirteen bright undergrads, working eagerly for nine months, transforming our project design into reality. With the kind help of our advisors and instructors, we managed to make the most of our time. We learned, grew and bonded together over the (mostly) stressful hours of digestion, gel electrophoresis, PCR and ligation. These are the people with whom we celebrated when things went right, and who propped us up when things were less than right. We wanted you to know them and us better. Don't be afraid to say HI if you see us in the Regional Jamboree. Who knows, maybe we might end up doing research together in the future!

Project Overview and Inspiration:
Stephen Hawking recognized that humans are like eggs in a basket - drop the basket and all is lost. Planet Earth is the basket, and over the long-term, a calamity - be it through climate change, disease, asteroid collisions, etc. - is a statistical certainty. Colonizing Mars is the first step in distributing the eggs to other baskets. However, colonies must be able to sustain themselves on what can be found locally. There isn’t much on Mars, but there is perchlorate, and that is why we feel that this project and others like it will contribute significantly to what is evolving into a major international effort. In short term, Mars missions will develop, and spin-off a range of creative technologies that will allow us all to live more comfortably, efficiently, and cleanly on planet Earth.
Our project was hatched from what we learned of iGEM from the “Fusion” Science Expo we attended last fall, and the movie, The Martian. When we dug deeper, we stumbled on the work of Davila et al [1] who proposed that toxic concentrations of ClO4 in Martian soil was actually a resource that could be exploited both as a source of rocket fuel and O2, while remediating the soil in the process. It was also shown that 2 enzymes from soil bacteria on earth could biodegrade ClO4 to O2. Here, we plan to build on this work and the work of others [2], [3] by developing an integrated and inexpensive process for: 1) perchlorate extraction, purification and concentration using activated charcoal, and 2) using engineered E. coli that grows on colony bio-waste to efficiently convert ClO4 to O2. A graphical overview of this proposed process is shown below.
Our process begins with a methodology for mining and extracting perchlorate. We hypothesize the usage of an activated charcoal column-based purification and concentration method. The concentrated perchlorate is then be shuttled to either be used"

Trends: Mutating Serines to Leucines and charged amino acids to Phenylalanine had a very negative ΔΔG values. This suggests the protein's stability could be greatly improved with the addition of hydrophobic residues.
**Additionally, only residues that stabilized the protein more than 1.0 kcal/mol were used in the next step, since the Position Scan function has a margin of error of .50 kcal/mol. **
Mutate Multiple Residues
Through the mutate multiple residue function in Yasara, we were able to use the data collected through the B factor and position scan calculations to build thermoengineered monomeric Griffithsin variants. For this step, we wanted to maximizing the thermostability of the protein while minimizing the number of changes made on the protein. We also wanted to remove all of the methionines from the molecule to assist in the purification of our protein, even if that meant slightly destabilizing our protein. The ΔG of folding was used to rank protein variants by their thermostability

Trial 2: Mutated top 5 amino acids Stability (ΔG): -11.402 kcal/mol.
Trial 3: Mutated top 10 amino acids Stability (ΔG): -20.816 kcal/mol.
Trial 4: Mutate every unstable amino acid (38 residues) with DDG>1.0 kJ/mol Stability (ΔΔG): -40.319 kcal/mol.

ITU_MOBGAM_Turkey,2013,Team:ITU MOBGAM Turkey#project_-_-_TEXT.html," to produce recombinant fusion proteins. GST tagged fusion proteins involve a GST protein attached to their N-terminus. GST tag provides higher expression rates and solubility to the recombinant protein that is fused. Moreover, detection of the protein is possible due to the substrate of GST, glutathione (GTH). (3)
Methods
Expression and characterization of Intrinsic Factor (IF) protein was aimed in this module of the project. For this purpose, Gastric intrinsic factor (gif) gene that encodes for intrinsic factor (IF) protein was chosen.
First of all, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is going to be performed for both amplification of gif gene and addition of restriction enzyme digestion sites (BamHI and XhoI).  Then, PGEX-6P1 expression vector will be digested by BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes and the resulting sticky ends of the vector will be ligated with the sticky ends of gif gene.
Second, after the completion of insertion of gif gene into the vector, expression vector will be transformed into the E. coli DH5alfa strain. Then, bacterial growth will be achieved in order to express GST-tagged intrinsic factor protein.
Third, intracellular IF protein will be isolated and expression of the intrinsic factor protein will be confirmed by SDS-PAGE.  Following with the confirmation that IF is successfully expressed, IF protein will be isolated by using affinity chromatography. In this process, GST-tagged IF protein will be purified with the help of its affinity to bind to GSH containing supporting matrix. After the purification of GST-tagged If protein, its purity will be confirmed by applying another SDS-PAGE. If desired purity was achieved, cleavage of the GST-tag will be performed by using the specific protease.
Finally, characterization of the intrinsic factor protein is going to be achieved. The characterization process involves the binding of vitamin B12 to the intrinsic factor protein.
Result
For purification and characterization of recombinant GIF protein,  GIF gene has been amplified via PCR with primers that are designed with BamHI and XhoI restriction recognition sites. Amplified gene products and PGEX-6P1 were cut with BamHI and XhoI. Then, a ligation reaction was set up for GIF and vector. After transformation of ligated products, plasmids were isolated and were cut with BamHI and XhoI for validation (Figure 1).

Möglich et al. (2009) proposed that the YF1 proteins form dimers. This would also bring the histidine kinase domains close to each other. It is proposed that the autophosphorylation actually works in trans within the dimer. They hypothesized the Jα helix linker would form a coiled coil with another YF1 protein. The linker would mediate the signal from the sensor domain to the effector domain inhibiting/enabling its kinase activity. The conformational change from the incorporated flavin domain is suggested to rotate the linker helix. The relative angle of the two domains greatly affect the mechanism. If one amino acid was added to the Jα linker, the relative angle changes and the effect of the sensor domain would be inverted: in presence of light the histidine kinase is active but in darkness, it is inactive. This presents interesting approaches and easy solution to invert the YF1 signal.
In our three channel switch, we fused a CI protein to the Bradyrhizobium japonicum FixK2 promoter. Thus, in the absence of blue light (470 nm in our experiments), the angle between YF1 domains induces autophosphorylation of histidine kinase of YF1, which then transfers a phosphate group to FixJ activating it. The P-FixJ binds to FixK2 promoter activating the CI transcription. The role of this CI protein in our switch is described in the next section.
Lambda (λ) Repressor
Lambda repressor plays a crucial role in our switch. The repressor is a part of the lambda phage and it regulates the lysogenic and lytic states of the virus. The lambda phage genetic material can be integrated in the host genome as prophage. This phase is called lysogenic cycle and during that state, the host cell can proliferate and function normally. However, in lytic cycle the phage genetic material is separate from the host genome and it is heavily expressed to produce more viruses which eventually lyse the host cell (hence the name). Lambda repressor is the region in the lambda phage that is responsible for regulating the current state in infected host. This phage has some very interesting characteristics that are described in this subsection.
In the center of the lambda repressor there is a lambda repressor protein CI ( BBa_K105004 ). This protein represses the genes in the lytic cycle and maintains the lysogenic state. Moreover, this protein is autoregulated in a very special manner"

OD600 reference point - LUDOX protocol
We used LUDOX CL-X (45% colloidal silica suspension) as a single point reference to obtain a conversion factor to transform our absorbance (Abs600) data from our plate reader into a comparable OD600 measurement as would be                       obtained                       in a spectrophotometer. Such conversion is                       necessary because plate reader measurements of absorbance are volume dependent; the depth of the fluid in the well defines the path length of the light passing through the sample, which can vary slightly from well to well. In a                       standard spectrophotometer, the path length is fixed and is defined by the width of the cuvette, which is constant. Therefore this conversion calculation can transform Abs600 measurements from a plate reader (i.e., absorbance                       at 600nm, the basic output of most instruments) intocomparable OD600 measurements. The LUDOX solution is only weakly scattering and so will give a low absorbance value.
Note: many plate readers have an automatic path length correction feature. This adjustment compromises the accuracy of measurement in highly light scattering solutions, such as dense cultures of cells. We don't"
