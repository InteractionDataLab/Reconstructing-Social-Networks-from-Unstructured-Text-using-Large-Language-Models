CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset by the additional correct diagnoses. Everyone with a positive test result would have a CT scan anyway to confirm the presence of their cancer.
The major drawback to a low specificity is the psychological impact of a patient being told they have cancer when in fact they do not. Again, through using multiple miRNA signatures in tandem - i.e. the levels of different miRNAs related to a single disease, and calculating a weighted score involving all of them, so that an abnormal level of just one miRNA does not necessarily lead to a false positive.
We can also alleviate the problem of false positives by ensuring doctors tell patients that the results our sensor provides just indicate the need for further testing, and are not a diagnosis.
Dr Desai also advised that the result from our test could be combined with a score from patient history to quantify their risk (e.g. Tammegami et al.’s probability score). This total score would then be used to increase accuracy of the test.
NICE Criteria for screening tools
To incorporate the feedback from doctors into the applications of our project, we have explained how our sensor meets (or would be applied so that it meets) the NICE criteria for a screening tool.
NICE Criteria

The condition being screened should be a serious health problem in terms of frequency and/or severity
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality, with 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 2012. In the UK in 2014, there were 46,403 new cases and 35,895 deaths. [4] 80-85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC. [5]
The epidemiology, natural history and development of the condition from latent to declared states should be understood and/or there should be robust evidence about the association between the marker and the disease
Much is known about NSCLC, and although there are still a lot of research going into understanding cancer characteristics. The same is true for most other cancers. Although miRNAs are still being characterized, Hennessey et al. demonstrated a potential link between miR-15b and miR-27b to NSCLC. However, validation is still required with a large patient cohort for clinical use. Expert Dan Pregibon anticipates that the use of miRNAs as biomarkers is not far off.

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

For high school students
In an effort to broaden the accessibility of the iGEM competition to those who appeared to be currently underrepresented in the competition (e.g. disadvantaged students, females and Australian high school students), we approached a private high school in Victoria with the following aim:
To find a well-resourced, private high school to partner with an iGEM team (e.g. UoM) to field a team consisting of half private high school students/half underrepresented students – who would have their flights to Boston funded by fundraising done primarily by the private high school.
After extensive email & phone correspondence spanning several months, the school decided it was not currently in the position to go ahead with the iGEM team proposal due to upcoming infrastructure developments, though would be interested in fielding a team after these are completed (scheduled for 2016). Nonetheless, the school did encourage us that other APS schools would likely be interested in hearing about iGEM and our team concept.
Whilst we didn’t achieve our ultimate goal, this activity did raise awareness of the iGEM competition with all the key science staff members at the school which requested not to be named on this wiki (for further details please contact our team leader Sean).
Finally, we would encourage all Australian teams to work on the following goals:
improve iGEM's accessibility to those of disadvantaged backgrounds
increase female representation in science & iGEM
increase the participation of Australian/international high school students in the iGEM competition.
In addition to our negotiations with the private high school, we also aimed at widening the participation of high school students in the iGEM competition by collaborating with the University of Sydney on The Strange Nature Writing competition.
We spruiked the competition not only on our project flyers which described the iGEM competition, our project and the Strange Nature Writing Competition, but also through our development of a promotional"

We talked about our projects and learned, that their project for this year’s competition involves the synthesis of a novel antibiotic to be used in humans.             As we exchanged ideas we came up with a way to collaborate. Since it is interesting to examine against which bacteria a novel antibiotic has an effect, we planned to test the antibiotic, made in Tübingen, in another bacteria, in Erlangen.             Thereto the Team from Tübingen sent us Clorobiocin, a molecule similar to their novel antibiotic, a protocol for an agar diffusion test as well as the needed material. As test bacteria, the corynebacteria C.             glutamicum has been chosen and we finally studied the influence of Clorobiocin on the C. glutamicum strain 13032 with the PEKEX2 plasmid for selection.

Penn_State,2012,Team:Penn State#Projects_-_-_TEXT.html," the binding between Amino Acids. However, they cannot read the codon code themselves, and require the help of tRNA (transfer RNA). Each tRNA codes for a single codon, or a set of similar codons. Each type of tRNA can only carry a single amino acid at a time, and can only ever carry that given Amino Acid. Each tRNA has bases that are a complement to the codon that they code for. The tRNA molecules carry Amino Acids to the ribosome where the Amino Acids are bound together to form a protein.
We have mentioned how there can be a number of codons that can code for the same Amino Acid, and subsequently, a number of tRNA molecules that can carry a given Amino Acid. In nature, and in many organism, only a select few of these tRNA and codon combinations are used instead of all possibilities for the same amino acid. This is called codon bias.
Our goal for this project is to see which codons are preferred, or biased. We also want to investigate if this bias can change over time or in different circumstances or stresses. For this we will be using the standard lab stain of E. coli, DH10B.

Project 2: Multidirectional Promoters
Project Overview
Before we can make a protein, we need an mRNA to carry the information about the order of the amino acids. But before we can make mRNA we need to know where the genes are in the DNA of a cell. Before RNA polymerase can make a copy it needs to bind to the DNA. This is assisted by a variety of factors, other proteins, that look for a specific sequence in the DNA. This sequence is called a promoter because it promotes the transcription of the DNA into RNA by the RNA polymerase. These sequences are generally upstream, or ahead, of a gene's coding sequence.
However, not all promoters cause RNA polymerase to transcribe downstream in the expected ""forward direction"". Some promoters can cause RNA polymerase to go in the opposite direction from what is expected, or go in both directions. This is what we are trying to find out; do different promoters go in different directions, and what is the directional preference of different promoters.

Team Kent along with our advisers decided on our project. After a series of brainstorming sessions, we decided on  a project aimed to synthesise magnetite nanoparticles in E. coli ‘Mag-nano-tite’ was chosen. We felt that this would be a relevant project based on current research, that explores the numerous applications for magnetic nanoparticles including waste or heavy metal removal and drug delivery (Kumari et al 2015) (Berry et al 2003) (Estelrich et al 2015). We saw that some bacteria synthesise magnetosomes which are organelles that contain and synthesis magnetite crystals. Through our research we discovered Mam genes, these are a group of genes which encode proteins that aid in magnetite crystal formation (Schüler 2007). The limited literature on these encoded proteins eventually became a focus in our project.
Modelling
We have introduced a new type of mathematical modelling; this novel Big Data topic modelling approach has been introduced to iGEM for the purpose of human practices. Kritam, a team member, used topic modelling to uncover thematic structure in document collections. This provided a simple way to analyse large volumes of unlabelled text.

Eight of the ten Team Kent members for iGEM this year are bioscience or chemistry students. Rita, Braulio, Jasmine, Sam, Hanya, Andrew, Rachel and Daniie together underwent a learning experience in the wet-lab. Together they carried out a vast range of experiments which included Gibson Assembly, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), Ligation, TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) imaging.

The microbial synthesis of natural flavor compounds has become a very attractive alternative to the chemical production (D. Guo and L. Zhang et al 2017).      In recent years microorganisms such as E.coli and Yeast have been metabolically engineered to produce different flavors like limonene, geraniol or rose (D. Guo and L. Zhang et al 2017, W. Liu and R.

Figure 2: Prefix and suffix sequences
All components of the genetic circuit are added to the system with these prefix and suffix. Once added to the system, in order to be compatible with the RFC[10] standard, a part does not have to contain these four restriction sites, they have to be unique to the prefix and suffix.
Assembling method
Figure 3: Assembling method
Scar
The use of this assembling method leaves a scar between the 2 assembled parts, with the following DNA sequence:
- 5'  [part A]  TACTAGAG  [part B]  3’. When using the alternate prefix in the case of the assembling of a RBS with a protein coding region, the scar DNA sequence would be:
- 5'  [part A]  TACTAG  [part B, that starts with ATG] 3’.
The only disadvantage of the RFC[10] assembly standard is the impossibility to make fusion proteins. The 6bp scar includes a stop codon and the 8bp scar includes a frame-shift and a stop codon. The alternative to this problem is to use a scar-less assembly method or DNA synthesis.
Biobrick part
The biobrick part is composed of the sequence located between the prefix and the suffix. This sequence includes the devices that will perform the given functions in the cell (i.e protein production).
Each device is a composite part, which means it is composed of several basic parts assembled together to ensure a specific function. A basic part is a single functional unit coding for a basic biological function and cannot be split into smaller units. Promoters, coding sequences or RBSs are examples of basic parts. Two parts make up our device: one in charge of the XylR protein synthesis and one in charge of theGaussia luciferase synthesis.
Plasmid backbone
The plasmid backbone is the sequence that begins with the suffix and ends with the prefix. The plasmid backbone mainly serves as support for the propagation of the biobrick part. It includes the origin of replication and the antibiotic resistance marker.
The presence of the antibiotic resistance marker in the backbone allows the selection of only clones that incorporate the plasmid thanks to an antibiotic in the medium. Clones that do not incorporate the plasmid do not have the antibiotic resistance and thus cannot survive in the selective medium.  In the iG"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," we can observe a rise in concerns over the purity of food, which in turn lead to a focus on maintaining a certain standard in foods. Over time, this concern became the driving force behind the development of pesticides, and to a certain extent, GMO. With the introduction of these solutions to food purity, a new and opposite response could quickly be observed in the public. With pesticides and GMO, the public quickly grew concerned that food would be unnatural, and thus we can observe what is known as a reverse halo effect Konnikova M. The Psychology of Distrusting G.M.O.s. THE NEW YORKER. 2013. .  A reverse halo effect is defined by the unconscious creation of a negative assumption based on a positive evaluation. In this case, the positive evaluation, would be the ensured purity and health benefits of GMO foods, where the negative assumption would be the concerns for unnaturalness.
So we detect a tendency in the public to follow a reverse halo effect, which is most often associated with GMO foods. The problem we face today, is the continuation of this reverse halo effect, where the public would receive any GMO device negatively, simply by association to the word GMO. So how do we change this dynamic between GMO and the public?
The conclusion we reached was that in order to change a tendency in public opinion, it was important to educate the coming generations on the possibilities of GMO. Another important aspect seemed to be a general perception of GMO as an unnatural element that would harm both humans and nature alike. As such, we wanted to illustrate how GMO could be used, not to harm nature, but to help lead it towards a more sustainable future. So, we set out to teach children of all ages about GMO in general, as well as about our own PowerLeaf, to show them that this concept, which is considered to be unnatural, could actually be used to help nature.

Danish Science Festival
At the Danish Science Festival we hosted a workshop for kindergarteners, during which we taught them about synthetic biology, sustainability, the history of GMO, and bioethics. The children would in turn teach us as well, as they showed us the endless possibilities for bacteria designs,  through the “Draw-a-Bacteria”-contest. This inspired us to reevaluate our initial idea.

Following the Danish Science Festival, we were contacted by two enthusiastic 6th graders, Bastian and Magnus. The two boys wanted to learn more about iGEM and GMO, which they intended to write about in a school project. They were curious to"

Description
Inspiration from cryptography
    We are a team full of creative thoughts, and all kinds of interesting ideas generate every day. Since we are particularly interested in cryptography, the idea of combining it with synthetic biology was put forward naturally.     Taken the limit of manipulating bacteria to realize encryption into consideration, we decided to try an easy mode of encryption in bacteria first.     To begin with, some basic concepts of encryption should be clarified. The original information that need to be encrypted is called “the plain text”. The encrypted plain text is called “the cipher text”. A type of document contains the encryption rule is called “the code book”. The system used to realize the encryption of the plain text is called encryption system. Some encryption systems are executed by human, which are rather primitive (like the Caesar Cipher). And some other are executed by machines, which is a leap for computation speed. That is called the cipher machine.     Originally, we adopt a basic encryption system. It uses binary numbers as input and output. After inputting a series of binary numbers (e.g. 1001), cipher machine will encrypt them according to the codebook (e.g. inverting all the even bit), and output the cipher text (e.g. 1100).
Realizing it in E.coli
    We intend to build this system in E.coli, and create a biological cipher machine. However, E.coli can’t read or tell binary numbers. The first problem to be solved is how to input and output the information. What is the “language” that E.coli is most familiar with? The expression of protein! Then we set about to translate the binary numbers into their “language”.     In our design"

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to"

pSAD
pSAD is a constitutive promoter in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. It is is a high  expression constitutive promoter that controls the expression of the gene encoding for a ferrodoxin-binding protein of photosystem I. This pSAD promoter was submitted in 2014 by the Concordia team (BBa_K1547005). To be compatible with the PhytoBrick standard (RFC1000), an illegal BpiI restriction site was removed (A289T). We cloned pSAD by PCR amplification in A2-A3 fusion site to use it for our retrotransposon design. The acceptor plasmid is the MoClo Universal Level 0 plasmid (pL0): pAGM9121. We sequenced again the sequence to be sure there are no unwanted mutations.
Role in our project
Our part is compatible with the PhytoBrick MoClo standard. This PhytoBrick was intented to be used as a constitutive promoter for the transcription unit of paromomycine in the CARGO of our synthetic retrotransposons for directed evolution in the Chlamydomonas. It is part of our reporter system to characterize the activity and transposition rates.
paromycin resistance gene
The sequence of the paromomycine-resistance marker is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. The aphVIII gene from Streptomyces rimosus encodes an aminoglycoside 3’-phosphotransferase gene (aph). From the aphVIII gene sequence of the BioBrick BBa_K1884013 (iGEM16_SZU-China)"

Recoding can be accomplished via:
Introducing orthogonal tRNA-aaRS pairs [2]
Mutating tRNA-aaRS pairs [3]
tRNA misacylation by promiscuous RNA enzymes (Flexizymes) [4]
Other iGEM Teams are also working on codon reassignment and recoding for alternative purposes. Check out the awesome project at Bielefeld where they focus on expanding the genetic code!
Bielefeld-CeBiTec
Encrypted Sequences
Novel Genetic Codes
Again, though genetic recoding is a developing technology, the field will only grow and develop as our scientific understanding and computational ability to design RNAs and proteins improves. In the same way that we currently have access to large libraries of promoters, ribosomal binding sites, and protein coding sequences, it is not hard to imagine the construction of a library of tRNAs that can be charged with non-canonical amino acids. Whether this is achieved via flexizymes, mutant pairs, or orthogonal introduction, computational selection of internally consistent sets of tRNAs and charging machinery will make it trivially easy to design a novel genetic code, and cell-free options like the Next vivo system would make deploying a novel genetic code relatively uncomplicated and achievable for individuals that possess basic technical ability.
Despite the benefits of genetic recoding, we should be careful and consider the unintended consequences of this technology. Undermining the faithful reproduction of a protein by a universally conserved genetic codes strikes down a cornerstone used in many fields within biology- particularly within genomics and bioinformatics.
The apparent risk of this technology is that genetic recoding may allow harmful sequences to be “encrypted”, thus masking the information contained within while retaining the ability to faithfully produce the encoded protein.
When the available sample space provided by the genetic code and our understanding of the translational machinery is analyzed, it becomes apparent that recoding allows for a potential to generate numerous genetic codes. A lower-bound estimate of the total set of non-redundant genetic codes can be found ccording to the following formula:
Where n is the number of nucleic acid bases, l is the length of the codon, and a is the number of amino acids that need to be assigned a unique codon.
When this space is calculated with conventional parameters: n=4, l=3, and a=20, we estimate that there are (64 Choose 20)*20! possible combinations. Or put another way, 4.77 x 10^34 entirely novel genetic codes within which to"

With this project,while  the environment will be cleaned from PET, the E.coli would add pyruvate to the cell cycle and use it as a new source. We divide our project into two parts. At the first part we found gene design for converting the PET into 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde in iGEM database. The arrangement at the bottom explains the first part:
At the second part, we wanted to go further and researched the gene parts for convertion of 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde into pyruvate. This part will give us the chance of adding new parts to iGEM database. In this arrangement, it can be observed in detail:
Why do we want to degrade PET? As you know, plastic smears into the soil and water easily, although plastic producing companies claim that, they collect the plastic lower quality available again and this way allows recycling , it is possible to see PET in water and soil. Our aim is to separate freshwater(rivers and lakes), salt water(sea and oceans) and the most important, the soil from this carcinogen with biodegradation method which we design with E.coli. Despite of recycling of PET, after a while it would be a substance which is unusable and unrecyclable and because of this reason we want to design an organism to degrade it.
How the PET smears to the lakes? Ultimately, people live close to water resources, at the same time betray water. Plastic smears water at different forms( like bottle,bag or pot) and the damage increases with uncollected years. Derraik, J.B, (September 2010).

How does our project work?
Totally degradation of PET to pyruvate is done by E. coli.
As an analog: The project depends on E. coli that eats PET as we eat sandwiches.

The team from the University of Southern Denmark have just got the first proof that the system works and they are now conducting further characterization to see what types of light it responds to, and how quickly they can get the bacterium to move.
The pictures below show two petri dishes, a normal and a synthetic bacterial culture, respectively. Both have grown for 44 hours, and both have been half covered. One can see how the manipulated culture moves towards the dark area.
The idea is at some point to be able to create a flow in a micro tube by coating the tube with a layer of the new type of E. coli.
“It has actually proved to be a problem to mix liquids properly in very small areas,” explains Barnkob.
“By adding the bacteria, they can whip the liquid with their little tails, which means that you can control how liquids mix in small micro-tubes.”
Wild type MG1655 grown on plate show no preference toward light or darkness
A culture of modified E. coli where the left half of the plate has been exposed to light and the right part of the plate has been placed in darkness. It can be seen that the modified bacterial strain has moved away from the light side of the plate toward the dark side
Great interest
iGEM is short for International Genetically Engineered Machine and allows students from universities around the world to participate in the emerging field of synthetic biology, which is sometimes also called the do-it-yourself biology.
The competition has been held since 2004, and Denmark has been represented by two teams since 2009 - one from The University of Southern Denmark and one from the Technical University of Denmark.
“What we thought was really cool about this project, is the principle of converting light energy to mechanical energy by shining light on a bacterium,” says Barnkob.
“The important thing about iGEM is getting to grips with the biological programming language and find out what you can do with it and what you cannot.”
Over the past six years, students have built so-called BioBricks that make up the foundation for programming biological organisms, which range from bacterial cameras and bio-beer to biological landmine detectors.
Last year the students from Univerity of Southern Denmark made a bacteria-filled bandage that ensures a better supply of antibiotics to a wound. The team from the Technical University of Denmark got a gold medal in 2009 for the design of a ‘redoxilator’ that emits a green glow when the bacterial metabolism is high and ready for production.

Extracellular enzyme scaffold
Overview
A cell-associated protein scaffold which could accommodate various enzymes or binding proteins can create a cellular assembly line by drastically reducing inefficiencies of product and reactant diffusion and by aligning binding sites to targets.  This concept is what makes the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum and other organisms so efficient at breaking down cellulose.  See the review by Schwarz for an overview of this system.  A protein known as scaffoldin is a consistent part of each cellulosome, and provides the basic structure to which each catalytic enzyme attaches.  In many cases a cohesin module can bind a wide range of proteins to the scaffoldin, and a dockerin module binds the scaffoldin to the cell surface.  If we could export the scaffoldin and a dockerin module to E. coli, it may be possible to add the cohesin domain to the non-catalytic regions of desirable enzymes and create a synthetic ""reaction line.""
Problem areas
Protein folding may be quite different in E. coli, especially from thermophilic source organisms.
The dockerin module binds to the cell wall of the gram positive source organisms, which ecoli of course doesn't have...
Integrating a foreign cohesin domain into native enzymes is in the realm of protein engineering, with which I am not familiar

TU_Munich,2011,Team:TU Munich#extra#german_-_-_TEXT.html," Design eines logischen AND-gates, welches zwei Eingangssignale in ein Ausgangssignal umwandelt. In unserem Fall erweist es sich als nützlich zwei verschiedene Wellenlängen von Licht als Eingangssignale zur Induktion von Genexpression zu nutzen. Nur wenn ein Bakterium mit beiden Wellenlängen gleichzeitig getroffen wird, exprimiert es ein Protein, z.B. ein farbliches Molekül. Somit können wir drei-dimensionale Strukturen im Gelblock erzeugen. Unser AND-gate basiert auf Lichtsensorsystemen, welche von Edinburgh's iGEM-Team aus dem Jahre 2010 entwickelt und optimiert wurden, und auf kürzlich erschienenen Ergebnissen aus dem Voigt lab an der UCSF [ 4 ].
Dieses logische gate, welches an der UCSF entwickelt wurde, basiert auf einer amber Stopp-Codon Supprimierung durch die nicht-kanonische tRNA supD. A lichtsensitiver Promotor induziert die Expression von mRNA mit einer Stopp-Codon Supprimierung, welche für T7-Polymerase kodiert. Diese Polymerase kann nur von den Ribosomen translatiert werden, falls die korrekte amber tRNA vorhanden ist. Die tRNA wird durch einen zweiten lichtsensitiven Promotor, welcher anfällig für eine zweite Wellenlänge ist, exprimiert. Nur wenn beide Signale vorhanden sind, findet die Expression eines durch einen T7-Promotor kontrollierten Proteins statt. Wie entschieden uns für Blau- und Rotlichtpromotoren, da ihre Anregungswellenlängen sich signifikant voneinander unterscheiden. Aufgrund dieser Konstruktion sollte es uns möglich sein, Genexpression nur an gezielten Punkten zu induzieren.

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Biodetox_-_-_TEXT.html," or used as automobile fuel, among other uses. One way to produce biofuels from biomass is by using bacteria to ferment the sugars in plant matter to fuel alcohols. However, the bioenergy industry faces problems converting this inexpensive plant matter into high value fuels. Biomass is tough to break down and requires costly pretreatment processes before it can be converted to fuel. Pretreatment produces toxic byproducts, including furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), which will kill cell cultures and inhibit the conversion of biomass to usable sugars.
To solve this problem, we intend to engineer bacteria with a recently discovered metabolic pathway that consumes furfural and HMF. Koopman et. al. identified the six enzyme pathway from Cupriavidus basilensis and showed that it functions in Pseudomonas putida.  In C. basilensis or P. putida, HMF can be used as the sole carbon source. Engineering bacteria with this pathway would allow them to survive and produce biofuels but also use the toxic HMF as an energy source. However, this pathway does not function in Esherichia coli is commonly used to manufacture valuable chemicals, including fuels, because it is fast growing, easily manipulated, and well-studied.  Based on our recent experiments, the pathway also does not function in Pseudomonas fluorescens, a microbial relative of P. putida.
The first and foremost objective of our research is to identify the genomic differences that allow the pathway to function in one organism, P. putida, but not E. coli or P. fluorescens.  We will do this using a novel approach, combinatorial dCas9 gene knockdown.  Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that cleaves DNA at precise locations.  Cas9 binds CRISPR RNAs (clustered regularly spaced short palindromic repeats) in order to bind corresponding DNA sties.  The deactivated form of Cas9, dCas9, contains two mutations that block its endonuclease activity, but it still can stably bind DNA and block transcription.  Gene expression can be lowered 100- to 1000-fold. To carry out combinatorial gene knockdown, we will construct CRISPR RNA libraries containing all possible 3-gene combinations for the 19 target genes we have identified. These libraries and the dCas9 system will be co-transformed into P. putida construct containing the HMF pathway. These colonies will be grown for the furoic acid assay and"

The target of this portion of the project is to characterise frost resistance mechanisms to see if investing the resources to put them into crops would be worthwhile. The long term project outcomes will be producing the template seeds of frost resistant crop plants which could then be licensed to / produced with a seed producer.
IP Management: A summary of the novelty, IP position and our strategy around this
We have met with a UniServices IP advisor and were advised our current portion of the project is not patentable. Future portions of this project may be defendable. One potential avenue for this involves patenting transgenic seeds once they are created. This has been done before by Monsanto and this form of patent has recently been held up by the US Supreme Court. Further analysis may validate this as a potential avenue.
Commercial Plan: A summary of commercial objectives and potential business models
The proposed strategy is that at the conclusion of a PhD, completed with the data produced during this initial portion of the project, seeds for frost resistant crops could be patented. These patented seeds could then be licensed to seed producers. Alternatively, the producers of this patented seed could go into a partnership agreement with a seed producer. This is up to the IP owners at the time.
Further market validation will be needed to confirm the existence of this need, market, and potential strategic partners i.e. Plant and Food Research, and licensees
Technical development:  Summary of technical development objectives and planning so far
We aimed to characterise the candidate protein, DaIRIP4, in a plant chassis and are presenting this work in Boston as a requirement of the iGEM Competition. This leads to a completed data set on this frost resistance mechanism which could then be transferred to the next stage of the project, assessing its effectiveness against other frost resistance mechanisms.
Market
Overview
The target market for this project is large seed manufacturers who would license the seed design for mass production. The customers of this product would be farmers all over the globe.
Worldwide there is a constant uncertainty around genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Each country has their own views and laws on the subject, but the need for them is becoming more apparent. Climate change, a growing population and profit are drivers of the market expansion. New Zealand has not allowed the cultivation of these crops because their fragile ecosystem but other countries such as America are embracing the idea. More than half the EU has recently banned modified crop cultivation (Coghlan, 2015) yet they continue to import the crops products, meaning although these countries do not grow the plants the market for GMO"

Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Overall, Biotic Blue’s unique value proposition resides in its ability to degrade specific pharmaceutically active substances in wastewater. We offer an energy cost-efficient product that does not need specialized personnel to be run. In addition, unlike other advanced solutions taking place at the effluent treatment, Biotic Blue has a unique approach since it will be implemented in a prebiological step of WWTPs. This will prevent the development of antibiotic resistance, inhabiting the activated sludge.
Intellectual Property
The core of every innovation is knowledge, and it can be used to create market advantage. Intellectual Property (IP) will become a key asset for Biotic Blue because our invention will be protected by law after filing a patent and applying for a trademark . By protecting these IP rights, we will add extra value to our creation, improve our chances of finding business partners and potentially attract investors to support our future activities. Moreover, we will be able to defend Biotic Blue against competitors.
Patentability
We ensured the patentability criteria through conducting an extended Google search, reading of scientific reports, attending conferences and searching for existing patents (landscaping). After all this investigation, we can confirm that our invention does not hinder its patent eligibility and, therefore, shows novelty, nonobviousness and industrial applicability.
Landscaping
The landscape analysis brought us direction, clearance to our product potential and minimized the risk of patent infringement .
We used the database Espacenet from the European Patent Office (EPO) to conduct the patent search. In each search, we wrote a combination of a minimum of three keywords, which were: magnetic particle(s), magnetic bead(s), degradation, enzymatic, protein, enzyme, pharmaceutical(s), antibiotic(s), water, water purification and wastewater. We identified a total of five patents which needed to be deeply analyzed in order to avoid infringement on existing inventions.
The first patent, “Laccase- Laccase encapsulated magnetic Cu-alginate beads and the method of bioremediation of water pollutants using the same (KR20170143114)”, was rejected on 06/02/2018. The claims referred to a method for treating wastewater"

The higher numbers of differences to the reference in other samples is supposed to represent true mutations. Analyzed samples are our reporter plasmid grown in E. coli JS200 with plasmid expressed wild type polymerase I or error prone polymerase I, respectively.
The calculated mutation rate for the control is 7.55×10-4 mutations per base pair, which is higher than the expected sequencing error of 1.6×10-4 (Illumina 2014). The mutation rate of the wild type polymerase I is 7.3×10-4 and therefore very similar to the control. Use of EP Pol I increases the mutation rate to 10.3×10-4 mutations per base pair. Under the assumption that the difference between the wild type polymerase I sample and the control (0.25×10-4) is the measurement inaccuracy, the error prone sample lies over 10 times this inaccuracy value above the control.
However, it is also possible, that the overexpression of proteins participating in DNA repair like wild type polymerase I leads to a decreased mutation rate.
Furthermore, we used another script than looks for mutations by scanning the generated TSV files for bases, which deviate from the consensus base. All this mutations are summed up, deviating which kind of mutation (reference base &arr; mutated base) is present. This results in an extensive overview of the mutations introduced by the error-prone polymerase but also the sequencing errors.
Figure 7: Observed mutation distribution of the different sequencing libraries. All mutations (n) inside the sequencing data were classified as the appropriate mutation type. The squares show the percentage of mutations from the reference base to a mutated base.
We observed a significant change in mutational spectrum between the error prone polymerase I and the control (p = 1.43×10-6, χ2 = 44.89) but no difference between the wild type polymerase I and the control (χ2 = 3.86). Especially the strong increase of the transitions G→A and C→T is notable. But also the general portion of transition of the complete mutations increases from 28.9 % and 32.7 % in the control respectively in the wild type polymerase I to 43.4 % in the error prone polymerase I strain.

Have a look!
Collaboration is a must!
When it comes to research, it is essential to establish collaborations with other teams. In the iGEM competition, there are several ways to share, communicate and set up a network with the community.
Strategy
Our project includes two different strategies:
1st
The obtention of the genes that codify for the α and β chains of the HLA-DQ protein from a celiac patient.
View basic parts
2nd
The design of an expression system for the heterologous expression of the HLA-DQ in E. coli.
View composite parts
The first strategy implies using a DNA sample from a celiac patient. With this in mind, we considered testing the designed HLA gene extraction protocol using DNA samples of different patients.
This would demonstrate that the PCR protocol we have designed to obtain the personalized HLA-DQ of each patient could be applied to all the celiac users of the sensor.
Why?
It would help us to check whether our protocol is robust or not. In other words; if it could be used to extract the HLA-DQ genes from any celiac patient.
As explained in PCR standardization , the resulting genomic Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) between the primers designed and the HLA-DQ genes surprisingly resulted in a perfect alignment for sequences sharing CD-DQ haplotypes. This means, for primer regions, all DQ2-associated sequences match perfectly, and the same happens on DQ8. Moreover, for P2, P3, P1’ and P4’, primer region alignment is perfect, and so, there is no need to edit the standard primers.
To this aim:
The collaboration with the iGEM UPF team was essential. To make things easy, we provided them with a detailed and comprehensive PCR protocol. The 19 paged dossier includes all the information necessary to extract the genomic DNA from a patient's saliva and to set up the PCRs.
We invited them to ask for any celiac friend up to give them his/her DNA through a sample of saliva. In this context, the iGEM UPF team conducted two sets of PCRs, one using a DNA sample from a friend, and the other, using Roger's DNA as a control.
The results were promising
They successfully obtained the β chain from both, the DNA sample of their DQ2 fellow and Roger's.

What does that mean?

We see bands around 200 bp, but it is not certain if this is our gene of interest or not.
We ran the PCR products on a 2% agerose gel and we got the following:
Here it could seem like we have a band on the first sample that matches the positive control. Another PCR was made to verify the results, but this showed signs of contamination, as the negative also showed bands that was alsom identical to the positive.

Experiment: Confirmation of amilCP construct integration.
Another round gDNA preparation and PCR was performed to confirm integration of amilCP constructs in apparent transformants. Extra care was taken in order to ensure no leakage from wells as this had been a problem earlier. These gel can be seen in the results page for amilCP .
17/10/2018
Experiment: Sequencing of gDNA.
We would like to know where the inserted fragments are in the genome o A. oryzae. Therefore, we have send a sample of the most successful transformants to sequencing with primers that point out of the cassette.
We tried to ethanol percipitate our previous samples, but we got very low DNA concentrations, which means we cannot expect resonable results. We have therefore performed a new extraction of gDNA from the same spot on the plate and disolved the DNA in 50, 100 and 200 µl of Milli-Q water.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#test18_-_-_TEXT.html," an energy imbalance between calories consumed and expended. To increase expenditure of fatty acids (calories), HKUST 2013 Team aims to introduce glyoxylate shunt as an artificial futile cycle in HepG2 cell.
Part 1 Sense Fatty Acids: We investigated four different sensing mechanisms using: 1) fatty acid metabolism regulator protein (FadR), 2) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) 3) liver- fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) and 4) binding immunoglobulin protein, HSP5 or glucose regulated protein (GRP78). The four sensing mechanisms were measured and compared.
Part 2 Introduce Glyoxylate Shunt: We introduced two key enzymes of glyoxylate cycle: isocitrate lyase (ACEA) and malate synthase (ACEB), which allow plants and bacteria to use fatty acids as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Here, the amount of fatty acids was measured to compare fatty acids uptake rates of cells expressing glyoxylate shunt.
Integration of Parts: The integration of sensing mechanism and glyoxylate shunt allows inducible glyoxylate shunt, in which the high levels of free fatty acids in the medium increase fatty acid uptake rate of glyoxylate shunt.
Although the problem of malnutrition may remain unsolved, the inducible glyoxylate shunt introduced to mammalian cell increases consumption of fatty acids, lowering the risk of excessive fat accumulation that presents risk to health.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.
--Luojun Wang, author of USTC_SOFTWARE human practice
Human Practice,""the C project""
Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.
Jiong Hong (in the right picture), advisor of our team, gave lectures introducing safety and ethnics issues of synthetic biology.
Luojun Wang (in the head picture), members of our team, gave lectures promoting iGAME.
A survey* on how students know about synthetic biology and their interests for tutor game was made.(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and 20)
Analysis of the results of the survey The first chart shows students' favorite game types for iGAME, and the second chart shows their knowledge of IGEM project.
The Circos Map
We tried many methods to plot our survey more straightforwardly and clearly before we finally chose Circos mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship. Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate our survey.(as in the right picture) Circos is somehow like pie chart yet it can present multi information as all the statistics are proportional and clear on the graph.
In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame. For example, light pink means they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we"

Kyoto,2011,Team:Kyoto#Luminescence_-_-_TEXT.html,"as sometimes drown in electrophoresis tanks. Hence we are convinced that a liquid medium is a feasible and simple way to capture insects. If E.coli can lure insects(drosophilas), it can capture them.
Ways to lure insects
There are different ways to lure insects: smell, pheromone, and light. Smell is a popular way to attract insects, as seen in some plants. For example, the Rafflesia attracts flies by it's distinctive odor like rotting flesh. Pheromone is a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers social responses in members of the same species. It is effective in very low concentration, and there are some pheromones which have different functions: aggregation, alarm, territory, and so on. Light is also a way to lure some kinds of insects by appealing to their phototaxis. Moths and flies have phototaxis. A few species use light to lure insects: Cornitermes cumulansand and Arachnocampa use light to hunt insects.
In this study, we focus on using light as the method to lure insects (drosophilas) because of the following reasons:
Lighting is a visible action and we think that it is suitable for our purpose to create animal-like E. coli.
There is an available biobrick which has the function to emit light: BBa_K3225909 created by iGEM 2010 Cambridge Team.
2. Light as a method to lure drosophilas
Drosophila melanogaster
We chose Drosophila melanogaster as one of Carnivorous E. coli’s prey, and our model organism. D. melanogaster has a positive phototaxis, lives all over Japan, and they are small (the length of its body is only a few millimeters). Besides that, it is one of the popular model organisms and available for us.
Suitable wavelength of the light to lure drosophilas
Fig.3
According to the article [1] , drosophila melanogaster has a strong positive phototaxis to the light of wavelength shorter than 500nm.(Fig.3)
BBa_K325909, one of the biobricks created by iGEM 2010 Cambridge Team, is the lux operon from the Viblio fischeri which can be used as a L-arabinose --> blue light devise. There is a graph which shows the spectrum of light emitted by V. fischeri in 2010 Cambridge Team's WIKI(--> link )."

C. difficile & phage characterisation
C. difficile growth analysis
The growth of wild-type C. difficile SBRC 078 was compared with the growth of the lysogenic version of this strain. By measuring the OD at 600 nm of the two bacterial cultures over a 24-hour period. It was determined that the lysogenic strain has a slightly longer lag phase than the wild-type strain (Figure 1) but both strains reached the same maximum OD. The maximum growth rates for the two strains were similar with wild-type reporting a maximum growth rate of 0.26 µ/h and the lysogen measuring 0.23 µ/h. The negative control (broth containing no bacteria) reported a maximum growth rate of 0.007 µ/h showing no contamination over the time-period. The similar growth rates of the wild-type strain and lysogen showed that when lysogens were created in the gut as part of the therapy, the lysogens would be able to maintain their population over time in the same way as wild-type strains, therefore ensuring they are able to compete for nutrients and act as a probiotic to reduce colonisation of incoming toxigenic C. difficile strains.

With the presence of extracellular Gln, membrane amino acid antiporter GadC[16] could transport Gln into the cell, and glutaminase A can transform Gln and water into Glu and ammonium(Figure 1.). Gaseous ammonium will consume H+ proton and increase intracellular pH, while Glu can anticipate in decarboxylation process led by decarboxylases GadA(链接), and the latter process will also consume H+ proton. More details about GadA wil be discussed in fine-regulation subsystem(做链接).
Design
Our project chose glsA as function gene for acid-resistance device which can regulate intracellular environment and protect E.coli from extreme acidic environment(Figure 2.). J23119 is a constitutive promoter and control transcription of glsA. When environment become acidic, GlsA will be activated and function with the anticipation of glutamine(Gln). When environmental pH return neutral, activity of GlsA will be repressed[18].
Experiment Results
Construction of standard part
We constructed J23119 promoter, B0034 with function gene glsA standard part on plasmid PSB1C3. J23119 promoter and B0034 sequences were gained from iGEM Registry.
We firstly applied PCR to clone glsA gene from genome of K12 strain. As J23119 promoter and B0034 are short(small) fragments, we straightly designed these sequences on upstream primer. And we designed SpeI and PstI restriction enzyme cutting sites on downstream primer for further experiments. Then, because EcoRI and Xba restriction sites are too long for upstream primer, we needed to perform a second time PCR. This time, EcoRI and Xba restriction sites were designed on upstream primer. Eventually, J23119+B0034+glsA with four restriction sites were inserted into PSB1C3 plasmid.
cPCR was performed to verify whether these sequences were successfully inserted into plasmid. Figure 2. shows that No.10 and No.13 were ideal results. We cultivated these two bacterial colony, preserved these bacterium and extracted plasmid. The final step is to record the base sequence and compare with standard sequences.

Overview
Materials
To achieve our goal, the materials we use should be self-assembling protein subunits that can polymerize into long fibrous proteins. After searching and comparing many materials, we finally chose α-/β-tubulin and flagellin.
Approach
After a thorough discussion of various plans, we finally decided to build two parts: the display module and the secretory module. So here, with the special structure of surface display system, we can display the particular subunit onto the yeast surface as a linkage site and secrete other subunits into the extracellular environment to create a subunit-rich surroundings. With the optimal condition, those subunits could reconstitute into polymers.
Display module
A-agglutinin System
Among various GPI-anchored proteins, α/a-agglutinin is one of the most common proteins that have been utilized for the display of proteins on a yeast cell surface (Liu, 2016). The native a and α agglutinin receptors are believed to act as adhesion molecules to stabilize cell-cell interactions during mating and to facilitate fusion between the a and α haploid yeast cells. A-agglutinin has a core subunit encoded by AGA1 and a binding subunit encoded by AGA2. Both a-agglutinin and the core subunit of a-agglutinin consist of a secretion-signal region, a functional region, a support region, and a putative GPI anchor-attachment signal. After genetic engineering, foreign proteins can be fused to the C-terminal of the binding subunit of a-agglutinin. As AGA1 protein is secreted from the cell and becomes covalently attached to the β-glucan (Invitrogen, 2002) in the extracellular matrix of the yeast cell wall, AGA2 protein fused with a foreign protein on its C-terminus will then bind to aga1p through two disulfides bonds. As a result, the heterologous proteins are covalently linked with the glucan-layer.
It is worth mentioning that AGA1 gene is controlled by GAL10 promotor in the genome of S. cerevisiae EBY100 strain, while AGA2 gene is controlled by the GAL1 prom"

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#landmines_-_-_TEXT.html,". Mr. Brady said that the price for screening the area is around $1 per square meter, including all the costs: logistics, administration costs, etc. However, in some cases it can be more expensive, depending on the location.  A notable aspect to mention here is the huge amount of square meters that have to be initially screened.
Also Mr. Lenz mentioned the high costs of landmine detection: “Private companies will ask between €2.500,- and €10.000,- for the screening of a single construction site, which comprises just doing historical review and taking a look on air photographs.”
From all the interview conducted we concluded that there is still room for improvement of the current methods in use. Also, the main important elements that need to be taken into account in the detection method are: speed, versatility, costs and maintaining the safety standards.
Using ELECTRACE to detect landmines
In the section ELECTRACE , we described the microbial based sensorial system developed by our team, as a plug&play device to which every inducible (biosensor) promoter can be added. As a proof of principle, we developed a promoter inducible by landmine compounds TNT, DNT and DNB. In this way, we provide a novel approach to the landmine detection, which is cheaper, faster and more cost-effective by using synthetic biology.
To detect landmines with the ELECTRACE system, one injects a groundwater sample of a possibly contaminated area into the device. We will make use of the fact that landmines, and especially IEDs (improvised explosive devices), are not tightly sealed and leak TNT and DNT. These compounds can then be found (although in very low concentrations) in the groundwater. Detection of these compounds in groundwater is therefore a clear indication that there are landmines in the proximity.
ELECTRACE will not be able to determine the exact location of the landmines. However, it will be able to screen large areas fast, greatly reducing the area which has to be manually screened with metal detectors. In this way, the ELECTRACE system would be a great add-on to current mine detection methods. This will be due to the advantages of the generic ELECTRACE system determined in the ELECTRACE section: inexpensive, portable, easy to handle and quantifiable.
First, our device is cheaper compared with the current methods in use. While the price of the present methods can go up to €10.000,- for the screening a single construction site, ELECTRACE has only moderate fixed costs and low variable costs. "

This is accompanied by an increase in absorbance at the wavelength 405 nm and a colour change from colourless to yellow. The concentration of 4-Nitrophenol produced could then be calculated with the Beer-Lambert Law, as the extinction coefficient of 4-NP at 405 nm is 18,000 M-1 cm-1. This experiment was performed with both the crude cell lysate and purified PHB depolymerase. Our data shows that this enzyme is definitely active.

Project Summary
The goal for this project is to identify the essential genes required for the function of the 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) catabolism pathway found in Cupriavidus basilensis.(1) Furfual and its derivatives are toxic byproducts of the pretreatment process used to produce biofuels from biomass. They inhibit microbial growth and fermentation yields. This pathway also functions in Pseudomonas putida but does not function in an industrially relevant organism like Escherichia coli. Determining the essential genes associated with this pathway would allow researchers to engineer E. coli to produce biofuels from biomass and has the potential to make biofuel production cost effective. Sugar is an expensive feedstock, but with the HMF pathway, fermentation bacteria could grow off of the toxins produced in pretreatment. This would also allow for harsher pretreatment conditions and result in higher biofuel yields. We planned to used a combinatorial gene knockdown method using deactivated Cas9 endonuclease (dCas9) and the CRISPR system. We would use a furfural assay to determine which constructs had stopped catabolizing furfural. Sequencing of these constructs would tell us which genes are being turned off, and which need to stay on for the pathway to continue functioning.
Current Status
Due to the large size of the dCas9 system (5.5 kb) and the HMF pathway (7.5 kb), we had significant difficulty producing plasmids with these components. The HMF pathway was successfully integrated to a broad host vector, but the dCas9 would not insert. We decided to insert these large systems into the genome of P. putida to alleviate the problems to due high base pair cloning and because P. putida is naturally resistant to several antibiotics, which made it unfeasible to insert multiple plasmids containing the dCas9 and HMF pathway. It is resistant"

Dialysis of Silk in Lithium Bromide
Cut 15 cm of dialysis tubing. Folded up bottom and clipped.
Filled tubing with 20-25 mL of the silk/LiBr solution.
Folded and clipped other end of tube and placed into 1L of ultrapure water.
Silk was heavy enough to weigh down dialysis clips, so a floating thing was used to keep the tubing up.
Wet Spinning Extrusion Practice
Placed 2mL of 20% w/v cellulose acetate in a syringe.
Attached syringe to syringe pump. Attached 27.5 gauge needle.
Positioned needle such that it descended vertically into a 70% ethanol solution.
Ran the syringe pump at a rate of 6 uL/min.
Fiber formation was not observed while the pump was running.
While the pump was off, fiber formation was observed. Occasionally, the fiber was extruded in a coiled structure.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#testing#Wikipage template_-_-_TEXT.html," construction of randomized promoter libraries. We modified Assembly PCR [12] to create promoters with randomized spacing and frequency of Transcription Factor Binding Sites. It relies on using different oligos containing a transcription factor binding site (or random DNA) plus two annealing sequences (see Fig. 1 for a comprehensive explanation of the method).  We use two sets of oligos, one for the top strand, one for the bottom strand. The oligos for each strand have the same annealing sequences (which are complementary to the annealing sequences of the other strand). If these oligos are pooled, they will randomly anneal to each other, thus generating randomized repeats of the transcription factor binding sites of interest at varying spacing. In order to be able to clone the construct, we also add two stop oligos (termed stop 5' and top 3') which contain only one annealing sequence, plus a cutsite (SpeI 5', HindIII 3'). Double-stranded DNA is created by running a seven-cycle PCR, and amplified by a  25-cycle PCR. Then, the resulting (proximal) promoter is cloned 5' of a core promoter (we used the core promoter of JeT [10] ) by inserting it into pSMB_MEASURE ( Part:BBa_K203100 ), the promoter measurement plasmid we developed (from there, it can be excised like any standard biological part in a submission plasmid). Thus, a mixture of different promoters in the same plasmid backbone is generated. These can then be transformed into bacteria. Each colony represents a single putative promoter, which can be transfected into mammalian cell. 24 hours after transfection cells are exposed to the conditions of interest and control conditions, serving as a reference. Promoters active under the desired conditions, but not under control conditions, are selected for further characterization.
Please see a detailed protocol for RA-PCR below .

Generation of a library of constitutive promoters
Most efforts of obtaining such promoters focus on cloning them from nature. This approach is, in eukaryotes, flawed for three reasons: First, promoters in eukaryotic cells are very complexly regulated by a wide variety of transcription factors, and thus, pathways [1] . One is the concept of ""genetic switches"" (see [2] for a recent review)

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Pur"

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KaraNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," to mention reading up on SBOL as well. And C#! It should be a very intense, information-dense week.
Programming, Finally (June 24 - June 30)
25Jun 2012
Started reading up on SBOL: core data model, file format, visualization extension Started working on a paper prototype demonstration video for Traci for the MoClo planner: lots of drawing, again, and cleaning. Also worked with Nahum to script it. Filming begins tomorrow. Maybe embed the video once it's done?
26Jun 2012
Finished building video paper prototype and then switched over to working on the MoClo Planner UI. It was hard, but not so bad once Nahum and I got the hang of things. The structure part of it, anyway - describing behaviors was a bit more mind-bending, and we had a time of it trying to understand how to manipulate our shutters. We did pick up a little bit about C# but all-in-all it was a tiring and frustrating and confusing sort of day. Tomorrow, we're going to look into older code and see what they did to make drawers behave, and consider how to use SBOL in the MoClo planner. SBOL Visual is definitely going to figure in it.
27Jun 2012
Continued working on implementing structure and function of MoClo planner.  Fixed level-moving so they move properly, respecting boundaries, and   started implementing button event handles in Level 0 to populate filtersPanel with the appropriate filters for each part type.  Designed a user control to represent each part, including info like its name, id, sbol image, and selection and data sheet options

Ludox Measurement
From the provided Ludox in the Interlab kit, 4 total samples of 100 µl Ludox were added to a clear-bottom 96 well plate. In addition 4 samples of 100 µl water were also added to the plate
The OD600 absorbance of the samples was measured using a Infinite Pro 200 plate reader
FITC Standard Curve Measurement
The FITC stock tube was obtained from the Interlab kit. The FITC was prepared by spinning down the tube, resuspending in 1 mL of 1xPBS solution to create a 2x FITC solution, incubating for 4 hours at 42°C, and diluting the solution with 1xPBS to create a final 1x FITC solution
The prepared FITC solution was serially diluted in a clear-bottom 96 well plate. In wells A2-A12 100 µl of PBS was added. 200 µl of the FITC 1x solution was added into A1. Starting with A1, 100 µl of A1 was pipetted into A2 and mixed, afterwards 100 µl of A2 was pipetted into A3 and mixed, this method continued until 100 µl of A10 was added and mixed in A11. 100 µl of A11 was pipetted into liquid waste. For each mixing the solution was pipetted up and down three times. This same procedure was conducted three more times until A1-A12, B1-B12, C1-C12, and D1-D12 were filled
The samples were measured using a Infinite 200 Pro plate reader. The settings were: Excitation at 495 nm with a 9 nm bandwidth and Emission at 530 nm with a 20 nm bandwidth. The OD600 was also measured

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our"

What is the most exciting thing natural scientists and engineers can do together? - The iGEM summer competition!
iGEM is an international student competition in the field of synthetic biology, organized by MIT. Each participating university sets up an interdisciplinary student team consisting of 8 to 10 biologists, chemists and engineers.
Half of the team has to be composed of undergraduate students, but also MSc and PhD students can participate.
The team's goal is to collect ideas on a novel biological system, analyze the biological and engineering design alternatives, including mathematical modeling of the system, and to choose the 'best' design.
This system is then translated into DNA code and tested experimentally in vivo.
In November 2008, all teams shall present their projects at the MIT in Boston. Back in 2007, there were 57 teams participating from all over the world, including teams from MIT, UCSF, Caltech, Duke, Stanford, TIT, Princeton, Cambridge, Imperial, Harvard, UC Berkeley, and more teams from the US, Australia, India, China, Japan, and Europe ( https://2007.igem.org/Main_Page ).
After major successes in 2005 (best engineering), 2006 (best device) and 2007 (best presentation), ETH is participating again this year, and professors Sven Panke and Jörg Stelling are assembling a mixed team of engineers and natural scientists from the Bachelor, Master and PhD level. If you want to be part of the iGEM experience, apply until April 11th.
Nine students got selected for this year's team, and on Wednesday, April 16th, the first meeting was scheduled.
As you can see on our Team Members Page , students from very diverse fields were offered the possibility to participate in the ETH iGEM team.
Boot Camp
The following weeks were what last year's team had referred to as ""Boot Camp"". Our advisers organized two weeks of an intense crash course into the field of synthetic biology, during which, on the basis of paper discussions, we learned about the diverse aspects of the field:

Forum: “From Past to the Future”
In order to make people learn more about iGEMers’ scientific career and how iGEM influenced their choice, a forum, called “iGEM NYMU-Taipei talk: From Past to Future”, was held on the final day of the exhibition. We invited two senior iGEMers, Shang-Jui Tsai, who attended iGEM 2011 and now is a Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and Jui-Tzu Huang, who attended iGEM 2014, to share their stories and career development after iGEM.
Interestingly, Shang-Jui shared his idea with us via webcast from Baltimore. His Ph.D. project just derived from his iGEM project- “Wireless neuro-stimulator featuring Optogenetics”. It was very cool for us to turn iGEM project into career goal and objective. We expected the two inspirational talks to promote public awareness of iGEM, and unlimited possibilities after iGEM competition.
After iGEM NYMU-Taipei 10-Year Exhibition
During the exhibition, we had a wonderful chance to communicate with other iGEM teams, students in National Yang-Ming University and the general public. We also understood more deeply about the team history of NYMU-Taipei, improving our project and having us to know what our future career may look like. The whole exhibition meant a lot to us and we would like to express our highest thanks to all teams who attended this exhibition, and all people who helped and supported us.
Though iGEM NYMU-Taipei 10 Year Exhibition had ended, just like Sir Winston Churchill once said, “Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.” We hoped that all our effort and the exhibition would make positive change in the world and the iGEM community.

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

CU_Boulder,2015,Team:CU Boulder#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"eking iGEM 2013 is a sequence of genes that promotes transcription via a metabolic pathway that converts naphthalene to salicylic acid.
Integrase: This gene produces a recombinase enzyme isolated from mycobacteriophage Bxb1. Bxb1 Integrase recognizes attP and attB sequences from the phage genome. When these sequences are orientated anti parallel, whatever region they flank will be inverted by the recombinase.
Plasmid #2
Genetic Switch
Genetic Switch: Located downstream of a constitutive Anderson promoter are attp and attb Bxb1 integrase recombination sites (represented by black arrows). By being placed into the DNA sequence in an antiparallel manner, the integrase will invert the segment between the two sites. In our design, a terminator is flanked by these recombination sites so once the integrase is expressed, the terminator sequence will be flipped, preventing the terminator from halting transcription. In this scenario, Lux I and GFP will be expressed.
LuxI: The LuxI gene produces an enzyme that converts the small molecule SAM (S-adinosylmethionine) into AHL (N-(B-ketocaproyl)-L-homoserine lactone. AHL molecules will diffuse through the cell membrane and can enter the neighboring cells, binding to those cells’ LuxR transcription factor.
GFP: Green Fluorescent Protein serves as our primary reporter. Only cells that have been exposed to naphthalene will express the integrase, which will invert the terminator. Then GFP will be produced, which will allow the differentiation between cells that turned red due to cell-to-cell signaling and those that turned red but also were exposed to naphthalene.
Signal Amplification
LuxPr Promoter: The LuxPr promoter is an ineducable promoter induced by the LuxR transcription factor when bound to AHL. In our construct, it will only be activated once naphthalene is present in at least one cell. AHL produced from that original cell exposed to naphthalene will diffuse throughout the media to neighboring cells where it will bind to the neighboring cells’ LuxR transcription factor. This will allow expression of RFP and is the final part of the signal amplification.
LuxR: Expression of the LuxR gene produces the LuxR transcription factor, which in our design is being constitutively promoted.
RFP: Red Fluorescent Protein serves as out secondary reporter. Once AHL has bound to the LuxR transcription factor, the LuxPr promoter will be activated and RFP will be expressed, and"
Frankfurt,2012,Team:Frankfurt#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," practical realisation became urgent. What we needed most was laboratory space, which emerged to be even more difficult than the need of financial support. We invested a lot of our time during February and March in these two important reqirements for a participation in the competition.
Of course we also enforced the answering of scientific questions during this time. An unsolved problem was the selection of an suitable organism. We were first favouring Escherichia coli for its easy handling and the fact that some teammembers were experienced with it as well as for being the most popular ""iGEM-organism"". However we expected to face inpregnable obstacles when using a prokaryote and so decided to use Saccharomyces cerevisiae for our trials, which brought us in contact with Prof. Boles who was also willing to act as our team instructor.  With the help of Prof. Soppa, dean of studys at the faculty of biology, we were allowed to use the facilitys of the microbiological practical at the Institute of Molecular Biology for realising our idears. We gained financial support from a special subsidy fund of our university (""Qualitätssicherung der Lehre"" ~ Quality assurance of teaching) and are searching for further support from both business enterprises and scientific organisations and institutions.

Restriction free cloning (RFC)
The first PCR-step in the RFC was run with different concentrations of DMSO to inquire into what concentration would be optimal. The results of this PCR is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Agarose gel with the PCR products from the first test PCR with different DMSO concentrations. The first 4 wells in the upper left corner has 0% DMSO, the 4 wells in the upper right corner has 3% DMSO, the 4 wells in the lower left corner has 5% DMSO and the last 4 wells has 10% DMSO. The upper bands are the PCR products and the lower are primer dimers. The gel shows that the PCR products are 250 bp long, which is the correct length. The products with 5% DMSO have the sharpest bands on the gel.
The results from the previous PCR showed that 5% DMSO was the optimal concentration for our primers and therefore a new PCR was run under the same conditions as previously: This was to yield more product that could be used in the next step of the PCR. The results from this PCR is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: 2% agarose gel with PCR product (primers) from the first PCR done with 5% DMSO.  Wells 11 to 20 contain primers for catechol 1,2 dioxygenase and CueO. These have the correct length; around 250 bp. The other wells contain negative controls. The upper bands show primer dimers.
After the second PCR the PCR products (pSB1C3 backbones with the laccases CotA and CoeO with inserted HlyA-tag as well as catechol 1,2 dioxygenase with inserted HlyA-tag) were transformed into competent DH5α after digestion of methylated plasmids with Dpn1.

Relating Relative Promoter Units to Transcription Rate
Assumption:
The first major assumption, is declaring ""Promoter Activity"" , to be a direct model of transcription rate. ""Promoter Activity"" is the number of RNAP molecules that clear the final base pair of a promoter (with units of [PoPS]  = Polymerase per second).
Thus,
Where,
Thus, through simple substitution:
The modelling can further be simplified through a series of assumptions:
1) GFP expressed from test and standard promoters, have equivalent maturation rates, as they mature under the same conditions:
2) Since both the test and standard promoters are carried on the same plasmid backbone, assume they have the same average copy number:
3) Since promoters have been standardized to have identical transcription initiation sites (predicted) and identical sequences downstream of the site, we expect them to produce the same mRNA sequences.
Therefore,
Expect transcribed mRNA to be identical, implying mRNA degradation rates are equivalent:
Thus, we assume translational rates of immature GFP from some mRNA are equal:
4) Assume that immature GFP is stable. Therefore, protein degradation is negligable compared to dilution due to cell growth.
Thus:
Thus,
and if
Then,
Therefore, we assume the difference between growth rates of cells containing the test promoter construct and cells containing the standard promoter construct, is negligible compared to the maturation rate of GFP.
Thus, for the purposes of QGEM's modelling;

Relating Transcription Rate to Proteins Produced
Assumption:
CsgA alone and CsgA-fusions (such as CsgA-AFP8 and CsgA-SpyTag) behave similarly in terms of transcription in the cells.
The transcription rate of the CsgA gene is modeled as follows:
where,
Thus, by the stated assumption, the transcription rate of CsgA-fusions can be modeled with the same equation.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," for the single droplet to house k DNA molecules. λ shows the average number of DNA molecules per droplet.  For example, if you want to have a single template per droplets, you might choose λ to be 1. The Poisson distribution predicts, that 36.7% of droplets will have one molecule. However, it also predicts that 18.4% of droplets will house 2 molecules and 6.1% - 3 molecules. Following this notation, In order to avoid artificial data, caused by multiple DNA templates in one droplet, the concentration of the DNA template was kept at 1 per 10 droplets (λ = 0.1).  As seen from the graph, 90.4% of droplets will be empty and 9% will have 1 template. On the other hand, 0.4%. of droplets will house 2 DNA molecules, meaning that droplets with 2 DNA templates are generated rarely
3. Catalytic biomolecule production
General description
Once the encapsulation is finished, biomolecules are then produced in the droplets. In principle, there are two major approaches of producing catalytic biomolecule in the CAT-Seq system:
1. Nucleic Acids: encapsulating DNA or RNA molecules encoding the catalytic biomolecule. After the encapsulation the droplets can be incubated in order to produce the biomolecule. If the catalytic biomolecule is an enzyme, in-vitro protein synthesis (A) kit can be used in order to produce it. Otherwise, if it is a Ribozyme (B), it can be produced using in-vitro transcription reagents. Also, there are cases where the catalytic biomolecule is a Deoxyribozyme (C). Then, all that is required is to encapsulate the DNA library!
During one of the collaborative meetings with experts from microfluidic technology field in Life Sciences Center located in Vilnius, we have received information that synthesizing biomolecules from a single DNA template is an extremely inefficient process. That is because when there is only a single  template of DNA, the mRNA synthesis yield is extremely low and there is not enough mRNA to make an enzyme.
After doing in-depth literature research to try to solve this problem, we have found out that around 1990s people immensely increased short microRNA synthesis yields by circularizing DNA templates. As RNA polymerase goes around the DNA in circles it produces long strands of RNA molecules. Within those long molecules were the repeating small units of microRNA. They coined this"
