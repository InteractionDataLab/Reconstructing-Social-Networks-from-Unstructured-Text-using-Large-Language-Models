Cre-Lox System
A major biosafety concern when genetically engineering organisms is horizontal gene transfer.  This transfer of genetic material between organisms is most prevalent in prokaryotic organisms where plasmid DNA can be easily expelled and absorbed.  When working with eukaryotes like fungi, every engineered gene is placed directly into chromosomal DNA, which is neither expelled nor absorbed by other organisms easily due to its size; however, cases of horizontal gene transfer between fungi have been reported [1], so preventing the transfer of potentially harmful genes is still very important to our project.
We identified the resistances to geneticin and hygromycin as the two most important genes in our toolkit to control.  To prevent horizontal transfer of these genes, we chose to use a Cre-Lox recombination system.  In this system, each gene is flanked by short sequences called lox sites, which are recognized and cleaved by the activated Cre recombinase protein [2].  We designed a biobrick containing two lox sites with unique non-biobrick assembly standard cut sites between them, allowing us to easily insert all our resistance genes between the lox sites.
We plan to implement the Cre recombinase protein behind the pelA inducible promoter from Aspergillus nidulans. This promoter is both repressed by glucose and induced by polygalacturonic acid, allowing for full control over the expression of the recombin"

Liquid Crystal Molecules Perturbations Model
Liquid Crystal Molecules Perturbations Model
The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models that help simulate and                     predict the process and consequence of biological systems. We developed two models, the radial                     domino model and the blooming model to describe the potential perturbation mechanism and                     interaction modes between protein particles and liquid crystal molecules. The protein density                     threshold can be calculated by this model.
Purpose
An important part of our liquid crystal experiment is to determine an optimal antigen                         concentration, so we creatively proposed two models to calculate the β2-M density                         microscopically. The trouble is that we do not know the range of antigen molecules that can                         perturb liquid crystal molecules. Therefore, we consulted the relevant parameters, proposed two                         models, calculated the range of the single antigen molecule to perturb the liquid crystal, and                         finally determined the threshold of the antigen concentration, which was consistent with our                         experimental results.

Hypothesis
Fig.4 Two possible mechanisms for β2-M to disturb liquid                                     crystal
The process of protein perturbation of liquid crystal molecules is particularly complicated, so                         we can only guess the disturbance mechanism on our own. Inspired by dominoes and the blossoming                         of flowers, we proposed that there might be two mechanisms of disruption. We called them RADIAL                         DOMINO MODEL and BLOOMING MODEL
Fig.5 RADIAL DOMINO MODEL
Simplify the β2-M and 5CB as ball and stick. The distance between each two sticks is                         equal. Due                         to the interference of the ball, the first stick next to the ball will be inclined at an angle.                         The first stick will affect the next stick until the last stick is aligned vertically.
Fig.6 BLOOMING MODEL
This model is actually an extension of the previous model. Simplify the 5CB into one side of the                         polygons. As the molecular shells increases, the angle between the two sides of the polygon will                         tend to be 90°.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#SYNENERGENE#Application Scenario_-_-_TEXT.html," vary, like oil, phosphorus is a nonrenewable resource and, like oil, phosphorus production and supply will at some time in the near future fail to meet global demands. Therefore, as a means of bridging the gap between supply and demand better recycling or reclaiming methods must be established.
How does it work?
Our project focuses on providing the biological and mechanical designs necessary to remove excess phosphorous from water sources. Our solution uses a three part system to achieve this design goal. Capture, Store, Extract. The bacteria, embedded in xerogel beads to prevent their release, are engineered for an increased ability to take up phosphates. This “luxury” uptake is a system adapted from phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) which are currently used in waste treatment plants. Once inside the cells, increased expression of ATP dependent and independent polyphosphate kinases binds the phosphate into polyphosphate polymers. The endogenous system for storage in E. coli. The genes that would normally free phosphates from this chain are downregulated until expressed by a user defined trigger. The cells then release much of their phosphate and “dump” it into the surrounding media. The media can be transported elsewhere while the cells stay embedded in the exogel beads. This phosphate enriched media can be further refined to further valorize our product.
Patent & Business Plan
The patents we would issue on our system would be two fold. The first would be patents concerning the genetic pathways to induce luxury phosphorus uptake, store that phosphorus and release it on command. This would allow us to benefit from the retail value of our organism. We would couch this within the unique ability to capture, store, and release compounds from the environment in a more concentrated form allowing the patent to potentially cover more than just phosphorus. The second level of our patents would concern the way these engineered bacteria are housed within the xerogel beads, and the larger phosphorus reclamation module that allows them to uptake luxury amounts of not just phosphorus but other compounds that have increased value when concentrated from the environment.
Our business plan would have three levels to allow flexibility on our part and on the part of those wanting to implement this system. The first level of this model would involve our company directly owning and operating the system. This would allow us to collect the phosphorus to sell without competing interest from a stakeholder. This could be implemented in high phosphorus areas (where phosphorus could be easily collected and resold) or as a pilot program for cities or environmental groups to demonstrate how our system would work. The second level would allow us to"

When CAI is present in the medium, TetR production turns off, which can be seen as a small change in TetR concentration. Even though the change is small, it is enough to decrease the dimer concentration by a factor of 10.
It is now time to see if this decrease is enough to turn on the production of the signal. When TetR is produced, it dimerises and represses pTet and the chromoprotein gene found downstream. Using the Hill equation for repression we have that the response equation is:
After running the model we found the figure below:
Even though chromoprotein increases by 500%, maximum concentration is less than 10uM, which makes it difficult to see without a microscope. So we decided to change the model and add a positive feedback loop.
At first we thought of using the same promoter as before, pTet , which has an activator protein called TetA . In this case, the promoter and the activator compete for the DNA binding site, so the expression for the system is:
In order to have more options, we tried the system with another positive feedback: Psp3 with pag promoter from the Cambridge 2009 Team . In this case, the activator and repressor have different DNA binding sites, so the expression for the change in the response through time is:
The figure below shows how the system will behave if positive feedback is added to the circuit. On the left is the response of Sherlock coli if the Psp3 protein is used as an activator. We can see that the chromoprotein concentration will be adequate for the system, but basal production is high compared with the maximum production.
On the other hand, response with TetA has a higher chromoprotein concentration, and the increase when CAI is in the medium is 12 times greater than the basal concentration. This is exactly what we wanted!!!
We chose the system with a positive feedback that includes activator TetA. The figure below shows how the system behaves with the two impulses. We can see that Sherlock coli takes about 20h to start producing the chromoprotein and 72h to reach its maximum expression.
In order to get this behavior, we needed to find the right set of parameters. You can check the Parameters Section to understand how we did it.

Osaka,2010,Team:Osaka#Project cellulase_-_-_TEXT.html," geothermal heal are known as renewable energy source; however, it only covers 19 % of global final energy consumption (2008).   We need an energy resource that does not depend on fossil fuel.  If we can create a cellulose degradation system, people can use the most abundant carbon resource in the world at a low cost.  This will solve world problems such as energy and food consumption and contribute to energy sustainability.
BioBricks
From BioBrick, we used endo-glucanase, cenA, (BBa_K118023)and exo-glucanase, cex, (BBa_K118022). Also, we used beta-gluctocidase which the Edinburgh team kindly provided us. We initially cloned these genes into Silver fusion-compatible BioBricks. Furthermore, we cloned several other cellulase for new parts in BioBrick.  To improve efficiency of cellulase, we also cloned cellulose binding module protein (BBa_K392014).In order to produce cellulase outside of microbe we used secretion tag, PelB(BBa_J32015)and OmpA(BBa_K103006).
Cellulose Binding Module
Cellulose and hemi-cellulose are insoluble; therefore, it is necessary to have close interaction between insoluble sugar chain and aqueous enzymes for optimal function. Cellulose binding modules (CBMs) are used in natural cellulolytic systems to enhance the activity of cellulases. We cloned several CBM in Silver fusion-compatible BioBricks for use in our cellulase constructs.
Secretion Tag
For secretion of cellulase outside of microbes, we inserted secretion tag in sequence. From Utah University, we got HlyA, TorA, and GeneIII for secretion tag of Escherichia coli. For Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aglutinine 2 and sec tag were presented from New York University and we tried to clone alfa-aglutinine1 and suc tag by own.
New Cellulase Parts
We cloned several new cellulase parts for BioBrick.  These enzymes are Cel44A, Cel5B, Mananes, and xylanase.
Testing the cellulase
In nature, cellulose exists as insoluble compound.  Therefore, in addition to pure cellulose, we used ASC and CMC as substrates to test for cellulase activity. ASC stands for Acid Swollen Cellulose and it pretreated with condensed phosphate. CMC is an abbreviation for carboxymethylcellulose and it is a derivative of cellulose. The structure of C"

Sweet Sensing Yeast
Description
Low-caloric artificial sweeteners (LAS) and Low-caloric natural sweeteners (LNS) are among the most widely used food additives worldwide, regularly consumed by lean and obese individuals alike. With the improvement of people's living standard，desired sweeteners are expected far more eagerly due to the growing living level and the developing science technology. The goal of this work is to introduce the human sweet receptor T1R2-T1R3 system to create a practical application of a sweetener sensor using an engineered yeast strain. Initially，we replacing the endogenous yeast G-protein Ste2 with the human sweet receptor T1R2-T1R3, additionally, we deleted some genes to further improve the sensitivity of the T1R2-T1R3 reporter signal. And we also introduce a RFP expression cassette to characterized the relative sweetness degree by RFP fluorescence intensity. Our work will assist the development of a fluorescence-based - sweetening agent sensing system using engineered yeast.
GPCRs constitute the largest family of membrane proteins and are involved in the majority of signal transduction. The common architecture of GPCRs has a seven transmembrane domain structure (Fredriksson et al., 2003; Takeda et al., 2002) that responds to a remarkable range of stimuli, including neurotransmitters, hormones, and ions (Lefkowitz and Shenoy, 2005). G proteins are binary switches that are ‘oﬀ’ when bound to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and ‘on’ when bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The P-loop is responsible for the correct positioning of the triphosphate moiety of the bound nucleotide (M. Saraste,1990). Activation of the G protein stabilises the eﬀector binding site via an interaction with a conserved threonine residue in switch I and a glycine residue in the switch II region, which form hydrogen bonds with the γ-phosphate of GTP in combination with a Mg2+ cofactor. This functionality is conferred by an ∼20 kDa G"

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#BiobrickConstruction_-_-_TEXT.html,", but we lacked the primers for the constituvely expressed lacI gene until now. To generate the DNA for the constitutively expressed lacI gene, we took BBa_K081005 (const. promoter+rbs) cut with only SpeI and  BBa_I732100 (lacI) cut with only XbaI, and ligated the two together, and then did a PCR on the ligation. It worked beautifully.
The primers also arrived to isolate the VMA Sce-I intein, and Alina provided yeast genomic DNA. The PCR was done successfully.
A previous potential part, ArgE, was restriction confirmed, and will be sent for sequencing at the soonest convenience.
The PCR for yddg was finally a success. The part has been restriction digested, along with the pSB1C3 plasmid, and a ligation will follow.
We finally received the DszA forward primer, and did a restriction digest on it as well. It will be ligated as well in the near future. The DszA gene  has several Pst1 sites, which limits some of the reactions we can do with it, but we can still place things before it by cutting with EcoRI and/or XbaI.
Joe has found inconsistent results with his fluorescent proteins on the various promoters, and we have plans to standardize the promoter and rbs for the fluorescent proteins that will be used. Additionally, there is some overlap between YFP and GFP that is proving difficult to account for, so we are going to try to switch one to either BFP or CFP.

There were colonies on the MinC Intein plate, the ArgE BB plate, and the GFP construct LB plate, but nothing on the GFP construct M9 plate. This may have been because there was no lactose or IPTG to induce the metA gene. Interestingly, there was a green fluorescent patch, but it was rather weak and had no distinct colonies. We plan to pick several colonies from the LB plate and try growing them in M9 culture with and without IPTG overnight. We also plan to do a cPCR on the MinC plate using the intein primers. There were no colonies on the DszA or yddg biobrick plate. We have had no luck with electroporating cells with ligation mixtures, although we have had some success with heat shock competent cells. We think there may be something in the ligation mixture that is interfering with the electroporation, and could probably be fixed by"

For this, the lacZ sgRNA expression cassette ( BBa_K2643010 ) was inserted into the episomal pACYC vector already containing the fusion construct ( BBa_K2643000 ). IPTG-Induction of protein expression then enables immediate loading of the fusion construct with the sgRNA. An additional requirement for activity is a donor DNA sequence flanked by Mosaic Ends (MEs), which can be recognized by the Tn5 transposase domain for cut and paste integration near the sgRNA target. This disrupts the lacZ gene and renders catalytically inactive beta-galactosidase, which can be visualized by blue/white screening with X-gal figure 9.
Figure 9. Overview of the single-step genome editing mechanism in the in vivo assay. (A) The fusion construct is loaded with a sgRNA that targets lacZ and recognizes ME flanked kanamycin resistance cassette for (B) picking it up. (C) CRISPR-mediation drives the loaded complex to the genomic lacZ locus, where the transposase domain (D) integrates the donor DNA. (E) The host strain contains an integrated copy of kanamycin resistance, while the lacZ gene is disrupted.
In this setup, we required a strain that contains T7 promoter expression system, as well as an intact genomic lacZ copy. Therefore, we chose to work with E. coli BL21DE3 as a host strain for the in vivo assay. This host was transformed to harbor the plasmid containing both the fusion construct ( BBa_K2643000 ) and the lacZ sgRNA cassette ( BBa_K2643010 ). The resulting strain was used for electroporation of donor DNA.
In our laboratory experiments, the donor DNA sequence was a kanamycin resistance expression cassette, flanked with MEs. Integration of this linear fragment into the lacZ locus would thereby confer the ability to grow on medium containing kanamycin, while still making use of the blue/white screen (note the selection medium contains kanamycin, chloramphenicol, IPTG and X-gal). In presence of kanamycin, cells should only be able to grow if the supplied donor DNA sequence is integrated into the genome. For non-targeted integration, intact lacZ confers chromogenic catalytic functionality when growing on"

Typically mammalian expression vectors have a multiple cloning site (MCS). The gene of interest (GOI) to be inserted into the MCS is therefore required to hold restriction sites compatible with the expression vector. The insertion of the GOI is achieved by digestion and ligation and this classical cloning method can be quite cumbersome. Furthermore, the integration of the gene of interest in the expression vector by restriction enzymes and ligases can have a low efficiency as well as provide a high number of false-positive transform ants (6).
Filamentous Fungi
Fungi are a diverse group of organisms, whose biological activities affect our daily life in many ways. The filamentous fungi are in particular of great importance in production of medicine, in the industry, in agriculture, and in basic biological research. Filamentous fungi for example produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, which are of interest in the pharmaceutical sciences as a prolific source of chemical compounds for the development of new drugs. Some of the filamentous fungal species are pathogenic to humans, whereas others have value in the production of antibiotics such as penicillin. Fungi are therefore of great importance industrially as well as in our daily life.
Growth of filamentous fungi
The vegetative growth of filamentous fungi starts in the right conditions with the germination of a spore. The spore germination leads to formation of hyphae (7). A fungal hyphae is a long tubular modular structure composed of individual cells (8). Hyphae extend only at their tips and are typically divided into individual cellular compartments by the formation of septa as shown in the figure below (9).
Filamentous fungi grow by the polar extension of hyphae and multiply by branching (10). The branched hyphae form a network of interconnected cells called a mycelium (7). The mycelium forms a radially symmetric colony that expands over a large area until growth is limited by for example lack of nutrients (7,11). The fungal mycelium appears to be a formless collection of corresponding vegetative cells. However, the various cells within the mycelium interact to form an ordered network with different hyphae or cells playing distinct roles in the acquirement of nutrients from the environment (7).

Q: Until now, synthetic biology has been a hot topic over the pass decades. Could you share your anticipation of its development in the next decades? Or what do you expect to see in the future?
Dr.H: From my perspective, we may be able to understand more about the origins and nature of life, as well as accomplishing more complicated scientific challenges on a deeper level. Synthetic biology is a very special field because the research techniques employed within it differ from traditional ones. So, for me, I am really looking forward to further development in this aspect.
Q: What opinions do you hold for commercializing techniques in scientific research?
Dr.H: For any technique, the process of developing from laboratory to society requires a reasonable period. Even though synthetic biology is a relatively new field, its promising prospect in technical commercialization can be shown from a number of aspects. For instance, the industry of synthetic artemisinin has progressed through a complete period, including stages like laboratory, entrepreneurship and production. Recently, there are also many interesting tryouts of applying methods in synthetic biology to medical science but still, it will take some time for them before actually dominating the market.
Q: Moreover, do you have any suggestions for high school students who are interested in biology?
Dr.F: The first and the most important thing is general education, which means that you need to cover a wide range of subjects during your learning journey. Especially, nowadays, a lot of influential breakthroughs are in interdisciplinary field, such as artificial intelligence and synthetic biology. Given that traditional educational models are built on the sorts of disciplines, the knowledge you learnt is relatively limited so that in order to catch up with the current trend, you need to expand your horizon as much as possible. Thus, if you are developing further in scientific research, the investigative methods and thinking pattern of yours will surely be a lot different than otherwise.
Dr.H: I think that during high school, you should communicate more with others if you have the time and the vigor. Developing your interested fields of study is the most important thing during high school and by communicating with different people in different fields of study such"

From this derivation it is clear that the Hill's function \(H(c)\) can be interpreted as the binding probability of ligands with a concentration \(c\).
Hill's function for different values of \(K_d\).
Binding probability and interactions
Hill's function gives a ligand/receptor binding probability and will be used to model the mRNA or gRNA transcription caused by the dCas9-gRNA in the case of simple activation or inhibition. In the complex case where activation and inhibition compete we have to take into account a possible interaction between the two dCas9-gRNA complex: the presence of one complex on the activating/inhibiting sites can partially prevent the attachment of another complex. This is in particular important in E. Coli, where the distance is between 33 and 37 bp (in S. s. cerevisiae this distance is as long as 67 bp, for the best activating/inhibiting sites). The partition function of such system, following what we did in the previous section (the same lattice model and microstate counting can be applied and we took the energy of the system with a free promoter as reference), is given by         \[                 Z = 1 + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a] + K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i] + K_a^2[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a][\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i]e^{-\beta J}         \]         where we assumed that the association constant is the same of the activating and inhibiting dCas9-gRNA complexes (i.e. the energy of dCas9-gRNA bound to activating or inhibiting sites is the same) and where \(J\) is the interaction energy between the two complexes.
If we consider and independent binding, i.e. the complex on the activating and inhibiting sites does not interact \(J=0\), the partition function can be factorized:         \[             Z_0 = \lim_{J\to 0}Z = (1+ K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a])(1+ K_a"

He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!
Shubo YUAN

Where the zeroth-order component function <math>f_{0}</math> is a constant representing the mean response to <math>f(x)</math> , and the first order component function <math>f_{i}(x_{i})</math> gives the independent contribution to <math>f(x)</math> by the ith input variable acting alone, the second order component function <math>f_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j})</math> gives the pair correlated contribution to <math>f(x)</math> by the input variables <math>x_{i}</math> and <math>x_{j}</math>, etc. The last term contains any residual nth order correlated contribution of all input variables. The basic conjecture underlying HDMR is that the component functions arising in typical real problems are likely to exhibit only low order l cooperativity among the input variables such that the significant terms in the HDMR expansion are expected to satisfy the relation: <math>l<<n</math> for <math>n>>l</math> .

It doesn’t help anyone to use a lot of jargon in order to look smart when nobody understands you. It might also be tempting to just deem the people with opposing views as idiots, but it is our duty to try to understand their backgrounds and where their attitudes are coming from.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Introduction
Our aim with these tools is to assist the user with primer design for coding and non coding Biobricks. In order to achieve this we chose two slightly different approaches for designing coding and noncoding Biobricks. While only one input sequence is needed in order to design a coding biobrick we chose to use flanking regions of the sequence of a non doding biobrick. The reason herefor is that using flanking regions of a non coding sequence which is supposed to be amplified enables the possibility to create a broad range of primers which meet the necessary criteria for a working primer.
Hence we created Adjacent Regions and Design Primers.
Adjacent Regions finds upstream and downstream sequences of the desired target sequence which can be used for the design of non coding Biobricks. Besides the source genome of the to be amplified biobrick the user has the option to choose cutoff rates for the downstream region as well as the upstream region.
Click here to use Adjacent Regions.
Using these upstream and downstream sequences the user can design primers for non coding Biobricks with Design Primers.
Click here to use Design Primers.
Design Primers is also able to design primers for coding sequences. Here the only needed input is the coding sequence of the Biobrick. Design Primers also has a number of options:
The length of the annealing region of the primers.
The Biobrick standard.
You can choose between the ""Classic"" Biobrick standard and the ""Freiburg"" standard.
Whether to check for enzyme restriction sites in the input sequence or not.
You can choose between all known restriction sites, only those used in the two Biobrick standards or none at all.
For coding sequences Design Primers varies the primer length between 15 und 35 bp and names only those potential primers which and with a G/C on the 3' end.
For non coding sequences Design Primers uses the by the user set primer length and finds all possible primers within the upstream and downstream regions. It checks every primer for selfannealing and uses only those which are predicted to be not selfannealing.

Suggestions to our experiments (see Results )
As is hard to obtain the initial parameters in the equations above on our own without any                     experiments, the only way to obtain these parameters is to look up in former research or other                     teams work. Fortunately we got a copy of these parameters from team William and Mary iGEM 20166.                     These parameters include \(K_X = 0.36 \), \(K_d = 0.1 \), \(beta = 0.0023 \), \(K_{deg\_mRNA} =                     0.009 \), \(K_{deg\_tetR} = 0.631 \), \(K_{trans\_tetR} = 235.5 \) (All units are combined of                         nM and s). Considering that both Salmonella and E. coli are in Enterobacteriaceae, we assumed that in Salmonella these                     parameters are the same                     with those in E. coli since we just wanted to figure out a useful instruction to wet lab.
To gain the parameters in bacterial growth curve, we carried out an experiment to measure the growth                     of Salmonella. Then we fitted the obtained data into a logistics model. By doing these we                     figured out that                     \(r = 60min^{-1} \), \(K_{max} = 0.9997 \) and \(C = 7.2319 \). Results and diagram are shown below                     (Figure 7):

After complete the work above, we used MATLABTM to solve the equations above and                     acquired a series of diagrams which visually demonstrated the relationships and helped the wet lab                     group get                     an overall view of how ATc influences the expression of GSDMD.

Optimization of Fermentation Conditions
Optimal pH
During the fermentation process, problems like low efficiency of gene expression and low yield always occur. The formula of culture media and the condition of culturing in fermentation have direct or indirect relations with these issues. Particularly, pH can affect the dissociation of some certain components and intermediate metabolites ，which can influence the capacity utilizing these materials of bacteria. Meanwhile, the fluctuant environmental pH  have certain impact on the pH level in the cells in the form of weak acid and alkali influencing the metabolic reaction of the cell. Therefore, an appropriate control of pH is crucial to the effective gene expression. That is the reason why  we need to  discover the optimal pH for the fermentation of G.xylinus.                                 The scope of pH variation in the culture media during fermentation process is wide. In order to study the optimal pH for G.xylinus fermentation, we use acetic acid with 200 ionic strength to maintain the pH in the outside environment.

2.WriteSBMLFile
Convert from db0.dat to SBML file
The class WriteSBMLFile is used to output a SBML file base on the species and parameters selected from the database. the amount of the exporting file is based on the users requirement.In this part, the class WriteSBMLFile extract data from the two following file: “subs.dat”; ”dbt.dat”.
Although we have listed all the types of bio-chemical reactions, it is also needed to make the mathematical expression fit each certain reaction. Since the SBML uses ASTNode(binary tree) to store the formulas, we choose to traverse binary tree and replace the name of each node the certain species and parameters. Thus, the kineticlaw is been made uniquely for each bio-chemical system.
Here are the steps of converting “subs.dat” and ”dbt.dat” to SBML file:
1. Create new SBMLDocument and model
2. Scrape the species names from ""subs.dat"", and create new species in model
3. Get reactions related information from""dbt.dat"". As the graph, put them into the model by categories
4. Rename the node to species name corresponding
5. Validate the model
6. Output SBML file
3.Verifying and other functions
One of the most important features of libSBML is its ability to perform SBML validation to ensure that a model adheres to the SBML specification for whatever Level+Version combination the model uses. Since it is difficult to ensure that everything in a model is constructed properly. The ability to perform automatic checks then becomes very useful.
LibSBML implements verification of SBML in two steps, represented by the two methods SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() and SBMLDocument::checkConsistency(). The former verifies the basic internal consistency and syntax of an SBML document, and the latter implements more elaborate validation rules (both those defined by the SBML specifications, as well as additional rules offered by libSBML). When an application builds up a model programmatically and is finally ready to say ""yes, this model is finished"", it should call both of these methods to help ensure the correctness and consistency of the finished result. Conversely, if it is reading a model from a file or data stream, the function will automatically verify the syntax and schema consistency of the document. The application only needs to check the results by interrogating the error log on the SBMLDocument object, then call SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() for checking the model against the SBML validation rules.
As mentioned above, SBML uses ASTNode"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," able to use carbazole as a nitrogen source and thrive in this media. The strains we tested from glycerol stock included putida LD1, putida environmental strains 28-30, and Florescens PF5. Each of these strains had two cultures grown; one with carbazole and one without it. E. coli grown with carbazole was used as a negative control as it does not contain the pCAR plasmid. At timepoints of 22, 46, and 117 hours of growth samples were taken to do an OD600 reading to measure bacterial growth and had an ammonia assay performed on it. The detection of ammonia acted as a proxy for detecting carbazole degradation as it is an endproduct of the pathway. With this in mind an additional control strain of LD1 was grown in media containing glucose and ammonia. This is to detect the possibility that Pseudomonas can use ammonia as a source of nitrogen after it has degraded carbazole which would be problematic as far as using ammonia levels to determine carbazole degradation. So far we have been having difficulties reading the results of the ammonia assay with a plate reader and may resort to testing our samples using a different assay protocol next week. The OD600 readings were initially very high at 22 hours and then dropped at 46 hours.
Week 11 (July  9-July 13)
Decarboxylation
The sequencing results sent in for the petrobrick did not yield a high complementarity rate, therefore were unsuccessful. As such, we were not yet able to proceed with the production media protocol to attempt to produce hydrocarbons because we are not certain as to whether the petrobrick part has been isolated. It was then decided that the colony PCR would be redone with a new colony, followed again by a mini-preparation and restriction digest before gene sequencing occurs. If the sequencing results again yield a low complementarity rate, it can be deduced that the petrobrick sent to us in the 2012 kit plate does not contain a proper functional petrobrick.
Desulfurization
Following successful amplification of the dsz operon genes in the previous week, the genes were constructed into the PSB1C3 vector. Colony PCR verifications were observed to be positive. Furthermore, the insertion of part J13002 (pTetR)in front of the previously biobricked hpaC was attempted. Overnight cultures were also prepared using two colonies each for J13002 and R0011 (an IPTG inducible promoter that we hope to build in front of B0034). These"

We made the model about the activity of R0011 and determined parameters from the result to estimate RPU of R0011 at IPTG concentrations we couldn’t measure. The result is shown in Fig.3.
To know more about this model, go Modelling .
Fig.3: The RPUs at various concentrations of IPTG. The blue line indicates the fit/calculated curve predicted by our model. The data represent the mean +/- s.d. obtained by triplicate experiments,
Discussion
The result indicates that the maximum activity of R0011 is about 1.6 RPU and the minimum is less than 0.01 RPU and that R0011 has wide range of activity (the maximum activity of R0011 is at least about 160 fold greater than the minimum activity at least). The maximum activity of R0011, 1.6 RPU agrees with the previous data [5] . The wide range of RPU can change the effect of lysis cassette variously, and it is useful to characterize lysis cassette.
The graph of cell growth indicates that cells are in log phase growth at 3h and 3.5h after dilution. This means that time we measured RPU was correct. In this characterization, there is two way to measure GFP fluorescence. One is to measure GFP fluorescence after cells are lysed by cell lysis reagent and the other is to measure GFP fluorescence without cell lysis. We think both measurements are valid because RPU of R0011 with 1mM IPTG measured with cell lysis corresponds to the previous data [5] and the way of measurement of RPU without cell lysed is recommended one by a previous igem team [6] .
By the way, we found that supplemented M9 medium was contaminated by approximately 0.01mM lactose.
We thought that lactose in the supplemented M9 medium comes from casamino acids because casamino acids is made from milk which contains lactose. Therefore, we tried to culture E.coli and measure RPU without the casamino acids because lactose in the supplemented M9 medium can induce R0011. However, without casamino acids, the growth rate of E.coli declined and we could not measure RPU. All RPU data was measured with casamino acids. Accordingly, the real value for RPU of R0011 at low IPTG concentration may be lower than the value gained from this experiment. CV in 0mM IPTG is so high, 0.611, and CV"

The total expenses this year are projected to amount to $64 500 with that money being used towards paying students, travelling and lodging at MIT, paying for laboratory materials, and buying T-shirts as well as a mascot suit. Our current financial status is sufficient to cover approximately 80% of this with $54 600 in total funds. These have been provided by BioAlberta, Alberta Innovates Technology Funds, O'Brien Student Centre, and Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research.

The overnight colonies of the cpxp in pSB1AK3 was pink, which means it was expressing RFP and the construction was unsuccessful. We have decided it would be best to wait for the new primer to come so that we can create new PCR product and construct with that because it contains the entire biobrick suffix, which eliminates the risk of scarring.

Peroxidase
White rot fungi, the fungi responsible for the biodegradation of lignin in wood, are remarkable in their ability to degrade a wide variety of environmental pollutants. Insoluble, generally very recalcitrant chemicals are mineralized by the fungi. The fungi also mineralized (oxidized to CO2) some chemicals that are already highly oxidized. In general it is thought that this biodegradative ability is related to the ability of these fungi to degrade lignin. This ability, which is unique to white rot fungi, is thought to be dependent on a family of peroxidases secreted by the fungi; however, a purely oxidative, peroxidase- based system cannot be used to completely degrade lignin. Lignin is highly oxidized so it is difficult to oxidize further. Lignin is a complex heteropolymer with no stereochemical regularity, due at least in part to the free radical mechanism of synthesis. Lignin biodegradation must therefore involve a nonspecific and non-stereoselective mechanism.
The lignin peroxidases are somewhat unique in that they have higher oxidation potentials (- -1.35 V) than do most peroxidases ( -0.8 V). In this way these enzymes have a somewhat greater range of chemicals that they can oxidize. Due to this none specific, and highly effective oxidation abilities, Lignin peroxidase is an excellent candidate for bioremediation- not only for dioxins, but a wide range of aromatic pollutants.1
The C-O--C bond cleavage occurs via the nucleophilic attack of water on a cation rather than via the scavenging of a radical by molecular 02. The first step in this proposed mechanism is the one-elect"

There is still a lot of work to be done in order to correctly demonstrate that our “intelligent biosensor” works as expected. Further testing with different concentrations of the compound of interest is needed so that we can verify that, under specific conditions, only one of the reporter proteins will be expressed.  With our project, we were able to demonstrate that the PoPS amplifiers work as expected; however, we couldn’t prove that our genetic frame behaves the way we anticipate. Therefore, in the future, we must do more tests measuring the fluorescence of our whole cell reporter at different concentrations of the substance of interest and analyze the results so we can provide evidence that this genetic frame works properly.
Once we have demonstrated that our genetic device works properly in its current configuration, more research must be done to prove that this genetic frame is useful to develop a whole cell bacterial reporter that works for many types of compounds. In order to do this, a new system of promoters must be developed and tested so they can be used instead of the pBAD family. It would also be useful to test this genetic frame using a different set of reporter molecules instead of the three fluorescent proteins used in our device.
A number of other iGEM teams from previous competitions have developed parts that could be useful to continue with this research. For example, the 2009 Cambridge University Team also developed a series of reporter molecules of different colors that could be used instead of the fluorescent proteins in our device.  Additionally, the Registry has a lot of promoter BioBricks that can be used instead of the pBAD family. However, these additional promoters must be modified via mutagenesis to produce weak and strong varieties as the British Columbia team did in 2009 in order to work with our genetic frame.  We encourage other teams that are interested in developing these “intelligent biosensors” to contribute and develop new biological parts that can be used to extend the uses of our construction and further validate it. We hope that the contributions we made with our project will prove"
Lethbridge_Entrepreneurs,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#comp media_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s market analysis showed diverse applications and projections for growth, with a two to three-year timeline to produce a marketable device. The first test runs of this device will occur this summer at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience in collaboration with neuroscience researcher Dr. Gerlinde Metz.
Ward said the team came up with the idea to develop the company and the new biomedical device by using the skills they learned through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) program.
“The internationally competitive program allows undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience in science,” Ward said.
“iGEM is run out of a student-operated lab provided by the department of Chemistry and Biochemistry here at the University of Lethbridge and coordinated by Dr. HJ Wieden. We have been encouraged at every turn by our professors and others to move this idea forward, especially by the people at Alberta Innovates -- Technology Futures (AITF) who promote entrepreneurial engagement from scientific innovation.”
Ward cited advisors Dr. Gerlinde Metz (Department of Neuroscience), Dr. HJ Wieden (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry), Dr. Roy Golsteyn (Department of Biological Sciences) and Michael Kelly (Erin Kelly’s father and Manager of Real Estate and Land Development, City of Lethbridge) as being particularly helpful as they refined their idea.
At an event held on Wednesday, June 12 in Lethbridge the Community Futures Lethbridge Region hosted an event that acknowledged the Synbiologica group for their win, and announced the additional winners of the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge.
Lethbridge-based Ladybug Arborists took first place, while Strathmore business Kindred Companions and Lifesavers Designated Driving (Lethbridge) shared the runner-up awards.

Our Vision
The world today is heading towards an energy crisis. This makes the need for novel ways to produce fuels in high yields a necessity. The main renewable source of energy we know of is the sun, and because of this our team choose to try to harvest this energy through the photosynthetic capability of cyano bacteria. Ethanol has been used as an energy source for decades and the means of using it are highly developed. The same is true for Butanol which holds many advantaged over ethanol in term of energy efficiency, safety of handling and ease of adaptability. If we could store the suns energy as alcohols, we could then use them in many different processes from powering your car to produce useful chemicals or just have a nice cyanobeer, which we do not officially recommend yet.

Week 5 - 30/07/18
Monday
In the morning we finished the presentation. At 12:30 presentation with CSynB. It went pretty well. Siwat's Science Communication framework was not completed and outputted (REDACTED FOR THE SAKE OF OUR AUDIENCES), in front of everyone ! Definetly an unforgettable presentation. Nice feedbacks from Danny O'Hare. Wet lab: we prepared a PCR gel, according to it colony 3 definetly has GFP but no SoxR. MATLAB is done, now it's time for COMSOL. Tomorrow we try to sort out the electrode architecture. For the team cohesion app, now it saves the inputs ad send them into an e-mail. WIKI is on its way.
Tuesday
Not a very productive day in the wet lab today to be honest.   Even though Thomas performed a lot of minipreps, we are still waiting for the electrodes to work so that we can do the electrode experiment in solution. Also we need to find the MazF gene, which is a toxin for the  biocontainment application.  SoxR knockout should arrive tomorrow, so we need to do the comptenent cell prep again.  Alberto finally went to the Italian Consulate to renew the passport.  Lidia, Josh and Yutong spoke with Marko regarding the promoter library construction and BASIC assembly. For the Oxford collab, we talked to Marko from Baldwin's lab. He's helping us, he gives us the sequences for the promoter architecture. We've blasted pSoxS to find other promoters from other organisms. We design the promoters, send them to Oxford and then we characterise them with Voltage and they with NO. We need to start thinking about what submitting as best new part (MazF ?), composite part (maybe the promoter architecture ?!) and the improved part (SoxR?). The dry lab team got a bunch of holes drilled in the electrode and they fit quite nicely. A concern is that the current through all the electrodes has to be same for the potentiostat. At the moment what is stopping us to set up a solution to Pyo/FeCN is just a power supply. Also we are using Robert Bradley's potentiostat, but he needs it... so maybe we should ask"

まずアドバイザーの方にどうしてライゲーションが失敗するのかを聞いてみた。すると以下の原因が考えられるとなった。
インサート、ベクターの濃度自体が薄すぎるのではないかという問題
そもそも抗生物質自体がうまく働いていないのではないか
制限酵素処理が完全にし切れていないのではないか
そこでエタノール沈殿をすることでベクターとGFPの濃度をあげることによりライゲーションの効率を上げることを画策した

Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Notebook#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," produced in this process is ODTD (12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al), however there are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans. Both of proteins used only degradates the polymer of the rubber, therefore, they don’t offer any harm to humans once we do not have this polymer constituting cell process. Our circuit uses inducible promoters (BBa_K91403; BBa_R0080; BBa_R0010), so if the trigger reactant isn’t present our genic circuit is off, not producing the ODTD molecule, which might be toxic to the environment.
Chassis
    According to the DSMZ database, Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans are from the risk group 1, and does not offer any disease on healthy adult humans. Additionally, the E. coli BL21, contains several mutations silenced, and does not compete in the environment. There have been no reports showing serious harm in humans. Therefore, this strain is classificated in Risk group 1, and it meets the requirements of the US NIH. For the Interlab study, we used E. Coli DH5-α. Both of them are also from risk group 1, presenting no serious threats.
Precautions taken to avoid unexpected release of the GMO
Bioreactors
    While scaling up our project, bioreactors will be used for rubber devulcanization and degradation of natural rubber. These acts as a physical containment for the developed bacteria and, therefore, minimize the risks of releasing it unexpectedly to the environment.Also, as these processes are being idealized to be performed in factories, only few people of the staff would have contact with the developed microorganism; and these would be specifically trained to minimize contamination - granting an even lower chance of the microorganism being released unexpectedly. Unfortunately, physical containment alone isn’t enough to ensure that the GMO’s won’t be released accidentally. Physical containment is normally enough to ensure that GMO’s won’t be released accidentally, however it’s not 100% efficient. Therefore, other precautions were also taken, as described below.
Kill Switch
    A kill switch mechanism designed to be activated when the bacteria leaves the bioreactor was included in our DNA circuit. For this purpose, our team has worked with a simplified Hok-Sok mechanism - a highly studied kill switch mechanism that is effective on most gram-negative bacteria, and even in some gram-positive"

ODE Representation
The methyl salicylate pathway contains the following reactions:
with:
PchA = Pyochelin A
PchB = Pyochelin B
BSMT1 = Benzoate/Salicylate carboxyl methyltransferase
SAM = S-adenosyl-L-methionine
SAH = Salicylate methyl ester
At first, our intention was to model the entire pathway from the implemented DNA sequence to the resulting production rate. This could be very useful to approximate the resulting production rate and to figure out the rate-limiting step. To achieve this we need a mathematical representation of all the relevant biological processes, including transcription rate, mRNA degradation rate, translation rate, protein degradation rate and enzyme kinetics.
We created a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to represent every step in our pathway: transcription, translation and the chemical activity of the protein.
mRNA flux:
See the formulary below for further information about the used terminology.
Comments:
The proteins pyochelin A (PchA) and pyochelin B (PchB) are extracted from the pchDCBA operon and are the structural proteins responsible for salicylate biosynthesis. Serion et al. (1995) describes that the expression of the pchA gene appears to depend on the transcription and translation of the upstream pchB gene in P. aeruginosa. They also state “Salicylate formation was demonstrated in an Escherichia coli entC mutant lacking isochorismate synthase when this strain expressed both pchBA genes, but not when it expressed pchB alone”. This is also confirmed by Gaille, Reimman and Haas (2003): “The pchA gene is strictly co-expressed with the upstream pchB gene; without pchB being present in cis no expression of pchA can be observed”. Finally Serion et al. (1995) reports that the pchB stop codon overlaps the presumed pchA start codon.
Therefore we conclude that transcription and translation of pchA and pchB is coupled and we decided to use only one gene (pchBAgene), and only one mRNA molecule (mpchbA) for both proteins (Pch"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP"

Synthetic Yeast Genome
Our iGEM team originated from participants in the Synthetic Yeast Genome Project, which is an ongoing effort to redesign and construct the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Many alternations to the genome have been made in the new design including: removal of transposable element, relocation of tRNA genes, removal of ""unnecessary genes"", and incorporation of site-specific recombination sites. More details about the project can be found on the Synthetic Yeast Genome Wiki
The team members on our team focus on the the parts of the project that invesgiates the role of genome stability in the yeast genome.
Genome Stabilization
tRNA Array
tRNA genes have been show to be hotspots for DNA instability due to several reasons:
Target of retrotransposon incorporation.
Transcribed heavily, which can lead to single strand breaks during DNA synthesis, when RNA polymerase III and DNA polymerase collide.
Homologous regions upstream of tRNA genes, due to retrotransposon insertions, can aid homologous recombination of chromosomal regions
Thus in the yeast 2.0 genome all tRNA genes will be moved to their own chromosome, so that their absence throughout the rest of the genome can be observed. All introns will also be removed from tDNA, as it is another goal of the project to observed the effect of a yeast genome with less introns. Duplicate genes will also be removed.
rox Recombination sites will be places between each tRNA gene, which will be used to observe if there is a preference for tRNA gene relative location and copy number

Peking,2015,Team:Peking#Project#CRISPR_-_-_TEXT.html," reconstituted by protein fragment-assisted complementation (PFAC) [7,8]. For the complementation-assisting partners, we chose rapamycin-binding domain (FRB) of human mTOR that binds with high affinity to FK-506-binding protein 12 (FKBP); rapamycin is able to induce the dimerization to form a FRB-rapamycin-FKBP complex (Figure 3a).  A pair of widely-used split firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase fragments (N-luc 416/C-luc 398) was then selected to construct N-luc-FRB and FKBP-C-luc fusion proteins; they are, therefore, subjected to rapamycin induced complementation [9]. Our results of PFAC assay on our split luciferase fragments confirmed that the luciferase activity are able to be successfully reconstituted in a rapamycin-dependent manner (Figure 3b).
Figure 3. Rapamycin-induced N-luc-FRB/FKBP-C-luc complementation. (a) The working mechanism of rapamycin induced dimerization. The interacting protein partners (FRB and FKBP) get closer and dimerize soon after rapamycin is added (40nM) [10], thus to reconstitute the enzymatic activity of luciferase. (b) The experimental data. Error bars denote s.d.; n=3.
The location of His-tag
Despite the fact that His-tag is widely used for protein purification, it is well-known that His-tag might have some considerable impact on protein structure. Hence, we first tested the activity of C-terminally and N-terminally His-tagged split luciferase-dCas9 fusion proteins to see whether the location of His-tag matters. We found that when the His-tag is attached to N-luc or C-luc, the activity of fusion protein would dramatically decrease (See working mechanism of PC reporter in Figure 2); this is probably due to the interruption of luciferase reconstitution by His-tag (Figure 4). When the His-tag is attached to dCas9, the enzymatic activity was reconstituted significantly. Therefore, we chose split luciferase-dCas9 fusion proteins with His-tagged dCas9 for the following study.

Human Practice
Introduction
        As we are ITU_MOBGAM team, beside the lab work we’ve decided to achieve to tell synthetic biology to target group of people who are less interested in scientific events through our human practice works. For this purpose, we have appeared in the press, arrenged meetings with other igem teams and targeted to make our name and our project. Moreover, we asked people the questions, “What is IGEM” and “ What is synthetic biology?”, made video for this and share it on the social media. So, we could widened our target people.
Bilim ve Gelecek the Magazine
        As human practice group our team thought it would be great to let Turkish scientists and professionals know what we are doing.  Thus we have spoken with Turkish science magazine called “Bilim ve Gelecek” (Science and Future) and they let us to send and article about general concept and the purposes of iGEM, Turkish teams and our teams recent status. Here is the link for our article;

BGIC_China,2016,Team:BGIC China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," are trying to build a re-programmable and open-sourcing systems, that simply every biologist can get use to it quickly.
I am so glad to be a participant in LIYSF 2016 Science Bazaar, where different, innovative and exciting ideas get opportunities to be spread and exchanged. I met a guy from University of Oxford who brought his group’s iGEM project to the bazaar, where we get a chance to communicate and know each other. Now we are friends on Facebook and we do talk synthetic biology a lot. There are also many other brilliant projects that not necessarily related to synthetic biology. One I remembered was about ‘sewage treatment’, the participants from Indonesia were trying to design an algae that had been modified to purify sewage. Another one is about ‘reinvented fans’. It is absolutely fabulous to see peers from 75 different countries bringing their projects, and some of them might be the ‘sleeping dragon’ that one day will wake up and change the world!
The BGIC Summer camp
Starting from late May, we, the BGIC, had set ﬁve summer camp sessions on Synthetic Biology, each of length one week during which the basis of Synthetic Biology was taught to high school students of moderate knowledge in this ﬁeld. Apart from theory, wet lab training was also in the session, including basic laboratory skills in terms of super clean bench operations and all the other basic techniques in a Synthetic Biology laboratory. During this process, the attenders of the camp were given a basic knowledge of Synthetic Biology as a whole, and were taught basic wet lab techniques. These invoked their interest in the subject and one of them, Michael Lu, out of outstanding performance, was invited into our team and contributed immensely afterwards.
Collaboration with Shenzhen University and Shenzhen Middle School
Joint hands with the Shenzhen Middle school, we had accomplished—— The Fab 12 Fair During the prestigious Fab 12 Fair in August 2016, we had the privilege of encountering an inspiring model, the Foldscope. This paper-built microscope has the cost below 1$ and has reasonable resolution as a light microscope. This inspired us in a ways that once our biological chip is into the market, we could propose a batch-selling with the fold scope and have users observe the results of the test papers through the foldscope. In this way, the unit cost of each piece of test paper may be reduced as we can reduce the size of the testing area.

[see results] In total, our mutant yeast, called NAKT, accumulated 2,4 mg/ml K+ from a media containing 19 mg/ml K+. This corresponds to a 12,4% uptake of K+ of total concentration.
Atsultr1;2, the name of the fourth channel, is a sulfate transporter, localized in the plasma membrane of root cells of A. thaliana and plays an important role regarding sulfate uptake. [9,10]
During our project we performed biobricks and sent them to the iGEM headquarter, so future teams working with plants can use our designed DNA in their projects.
We submitted genes encoding for the high affinity sulfate transporter AtSultr1;2 and for the genetically modified version of AtNHX1, which is named ATNHXS1.
AtNHX1 is a Na+/H+ antiporter, transporting Na+ inside the vacuole while pumping H+ out in the cytoplasm [11] . It mediates the import of not only Na+, but also K+ into the vacuole and with      that, probably contributes to the accumulation of cations significantly. [12,13]When AtNHX1 is knocked out in Arabidopsis thaliana the plant loses its ability to sequestrate sodium and thus      is more sensitive to salt stress [14,14].
Overexpression of AtNHX1 led to increased vacuolar Na+/H+ transport rate that was higher than the relative increase in AtNHX1 protein abundance and increased accumulation of sodium in the vacuole      of Arabidopsis thaliana. Through that the salt tolerance was increased, confirming AtNHX1 has an important role in salt stress response [12,13]. While overexpression of AtNHX1 increased its Na+/H+      transport rate, the still relatively low Vmax of this transporter is limiting the application in terms of fast hyperaccumulation of sodium in the vacuole [15]. AtNHX1 is built out of 9 transmembrane     helices and 3 hydrophobic regions that do not span the tonoplast membrane but are still associated to it. The N-terminus is facing the cytosol while the hydrophilic C-terminus domain is facing the      vacuolar lumen and moreover is involved in the regulation of the"

Ideas
05/03/2010:
We have created some models for how a reset mechanism could work in a bacteria, here are some sketches:
MelA is the gene that codes for a Tyrosinase, which makes melanin.
I is an inhibitor of the MelA gene.
MelA-K is a gene which codes for a protein that degrades melanin.
MelA-KD destroys/inhibits the MelA-K protein.
The idea is that a certain stimulus leads to inhibition of the MelA gene, so that no more additional melanin will be produced. Since the expression of the MelA-KD protein, which inactivates MelA-K (K for killer ;-) ), is coupled to the expression of MelA, the expression of this protein will also stop. Therefore the MelA-K protein will be functional and degrade the remaining melanin in the bacteria. This in turn leads to turning the black bacteria white (back to its natural color). Removing the inhibition will turn the bacteria black again (reset it).
The idea with this mechanism is to express the MelA gene via the activator, A, through our set-signal, which is symbolized by the square. (...)
04/27/2010:
We have narrowed our ideas down to the final five. The five candidates for our project are:
Creating distinct compartments in a bacteria.
A Stereoisomer sorting/converting bacteria.
Remote controlling a biological machine.
A reset switch for cells.
Bacteria that produce mechanical work.
A more detailed write up is following in the next few days.
04/19/2010:
The last 15 ideas are chosen, they were narrowed down from around 50 projects since the last meeting.

TetR is an inducer that binds to pTet promoter and thus, represses expression the downstream system. Supply of tetracycline or its analog aTc (anhydrotetracycline) is known to bind to tetR and invert the operation (inhibits expression of mRFP in this case).
After 18 hours, clones containing the plasmid (BBa_J23116-TetR-pTet-RFP) show a leaky basal expression of mRFP. We suppose that the promoter was too weak to express TetR in large quantity. Assembly of a stronger promoter could improve the system and lock the response to an ON/OFF response.
Besides, an experience was done to analyze the effect of the aTc inducer. Result show a visible induction of the red fluorescent protein expression by addition of aTC (60 ng/mL).

In addition, we have shown that our image analysis software Measurarty can analyze photos of the sensor chips taken by WatsOn and can effectively segment the image into pathogenic regions and non-pathogenic regions.
OD/F Device
In addition to our main project, we built an OD/F Device capable of measuring optical density and flourescence. It beats commercially available devices in cost and portability. It can be built with common, inexpensive and easily available parts. A construction manual is available on our wiki.
The device has been successfully tested with one of the target groups, high school students, in our collaboration with the NEAnderLab .
Interlab Study
Since we compete in the Measurement Track of this year's iGEM competition, one of our bronze medal criteria was to participate in the Measurement Interlab Study . Our team was able to measure optical density and fluorescence of E. coli cells containing the three specified genetic devices, and obtained high quality data supporting the hypotheses regarding different expression levels depending on plamid copy number and promoter strength.

NAD+ detection
For the design of molecular beacons different available tools may help you so that a correct functionality is ensured under defined assay conditions. All measurements were made in the NAD+ bioassay buffer .
Characterisation of molecular beacons
Preferentially, use a complementary oligonucleotide (target) as well as two enshortened oligonucleotides (split target) for characterising the molecular beacon in its closed and open state. In this way you can verify simultaneously the ineffectiveness of the split target to reach the molecular beacon`s open state.
Optimal wavelengths:
Determine the emission spectrum of your molecular beacon by initially using a literature value for the exctintion wavelength of the labeled fluorophore. For this add 10 µL of 1 µM molecular beacon in 200 µL NAD+ bioassay buffer , mix thoroughly and wait 2 min until measuring the fluorescence with a spectrofluorometer at an defined temperature (optimally 37 °C) .
Add 10 µL of 2 µM either target or split target and shake at least 6 min until measuring the fluorescence again (when equilibrium is reached).
Repeat the procedure to determine the extinction spectrum using the self-calculated optimal emission wavelength for your fluorophore/quencher combination. For further fluorescence measurements use the extinction wavelength for which the difference between the molecular beacons's closed state and the open state signals is maximal.
Thermal profile analysis:
Prepare a 30 µL reaction mix composed of NAD+ bioassay buffer and 1 µM molecular beacon. In a separate sample add 2 µM either target or split target.
Use a spectrofluorometric thermal cylcer to dertemine the fluorescence as a function of temperature. Start at 80 °C and decrease the temperature stepwise in 1 °C intervals holding each temperature for 1 min and measuring the fluorescence at the end of each step.

""iColi"" is an encyclopedia of E. coli made in iGEM. This application contains not only the details of gene recombination but also the list of genes and awards the teams won. Furthermore, it includes the explanation about each theme.
Nowadays most Japanese people don't know about synthetic biology and details of gene recombination, even though there are many genetically-modified crops in Japan, and they often criticize it with poor knowledge. Then we want to make this situation better.
This is why we create ""iColi"".
We think ""iColi"" will be one of ways to let Japanese people know what synthetic biology is. This app introduces the understandable characters that were presented in the past iGEM competition and ""Flower Fairy E.coli"", furthermore this app contains the description of each characters.
We already made it complete, and are preparing to release this app in ""App Store"" on November.
Education
We went to Hibiya high school and Horikawa high school, and then we gave a short introduction on synthetic biology and iGEM, including the attractive points of synthetic biology, the ways of changing living things by reconstructing their genes and activities of other undergraduate iGEM teams.
In Japan, most high school student was not able to learn about synthetic biology and details of gene combination due to a regular curriculum of high school. This is why we decided to let them know how to conduct the experience, what synthetic biology is, and what iGEM is.
Furthermore we met some eager junior high school students, so we added a brief explanation about biochemistry, especially genes, nucleotide, codon and the basic system of gene expression.
We used these slides in order to teach synthetic biology.
The 3rd international symposium on liberal arts and general education
We wrote an article about ""Japanese Attitude toward Genetic Engineering""
and presented it in the 2nd International Symposium on Liberal Arts and General Education which took place at Clock Tower Centennial Hall in Kyoto University, on November 23, 2011. Many people starve to death because they are unable to grow enough crops in their impoverished countries. Food shortage has become one of the most serious problems in the world. Some people expect that genetic engineering can solve this problem because genetically modified plants can grow more easily in barren land . However, some people worry that genetically modified foods may do harm to our health and the environment."

Team lookup
Who are team CLSB?
Team CLSB UK is an iGEM team from the United Kingdom on the High School track. They have 20 team members. Would you like to search for another team, search for a part or exit?
Protocols
And you can get a protocol by first asking the app to find some. Due to certain restrictions you can't ""one-shot"" the protocols command on Google Assistant (i.e. ""find ligation protocols""). However, this does work on Amazon Alexa.
Find protocols
Sure. What protocol are you looking for?
The app will then prompt you to tell it what protocol you want. For example, if you want a ligation protocol you'd just say
Ligation
Ok, I've found Ligation protocol. Ligation lets you take a strand of DNA that has compatible sticky ends and insert it into a vector. Would you like a step-by-step guide or to exit?
The app will then search the Protocat database and find you relevant protocols. It will then read out the summary for that protocol. You can begin the step-by-step guide for that protcol by saying
A step-by-step guide
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
The app will then proceed to read out the first step. Once you're ready, you can ask the app to move on to the next step. If you missed a step you can ask the app to repeat it, and if you've gone too far you can ask the app to go back.
Next
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Repeat
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Back
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
Where possible, the app will try to remember where you are in the protocol in case you accidentally quit the app.
If you want to add your own protocols simply add them to ProtoCat , a protocols database created by Michigan Software 's iGEM team. Once you’ve added protocols there, you'll be able to use them in the app within a couple of minutes.
Privacy
You can find out how we use data provided to the app in our privacy policy . We think it’s truly a gripping read.

Today we started O/N cultures of the following strains: SP44, SP45, SP46 and SP58. SP44-46 contains plasmids with CFP, yGFP and Cherry, and SP58 contains a plasmid with the markers CAM and KAN.
We also made a transformation using electroporation. We transformed plasmid pSLD3 into E.coli strain . pSLD3 is to be used as a recipient plasmid of markers and FPs. After the transformation, we made a serial dilution of the transformed strain and plated these. We have uploaded a transformation protocol in the research group folder- protocol folder.
iGEM the last 2 weeks - 21/06/10
So the last 2 weeks have been quite hectic and busy, and if you're wondering why there hasn't been an update its because alot of things keep coming up while working on the design.
The in-silico design is moving along well, though when every new step comes along we run into issues, just like today we realized that the UV system just might not work after all, long story short - because the excitation wavelength will interfere with the excitation wavelength of the red-light receptor. Solution: good old lov-tap will most likely come into the picture now.
In terms of the reporter genes, we were lucky enough to find Flemming back at CSM today, and so Maya and Juliet managed to get alot of good info from him about flourescence proteins which made us wiser in that area, although we also realized they arnt as straight forward to work with as initially thought, so we need to put in more work in that area as well.
We are set to get into the lab tomorrow to possibly start construction of the template plasmids with the flourescence proteins, that is of course if we have the FP's we want to work with and whether those have the appropriate degradation time.
That's about all for now, stay tuned for more exciting news in the days to come.
Maya, Anja, Malthe and Patrick's log - 08/06/10
We have finished the step-wise construction of our system, and have begun on the in-silico model.
We have uploaded the initial work from the in-silico model in a newly created folder in the research group called step-wise construction and in-silico model.

Cell disruption was performed by ultrasonic sound in both cases. The cell lysate was then dialyzed against 5 L of SA-buffer and subsequently applied to streptavidin affinity columns. After the application of the protein, the column was washed with SA-buffer until a base line was reached. Afterwards the protein was eluted using 5 mM biotin. During the first preparation 2-mercapto-ethanol was added after the chromatographic steps. In order to avoid oxidation of cysteine residues to disulphid-bridges, which is not desired for the cytosolic EreB protein, the preparative purification was carried out with buffers containing 5 mM of 2-mercapto-ethanol in all buffers. When comparing the size exclusion chromatograms, obtained from the analytical and the preparative purification, it can be stated that there is still a considerable aggregation peak near the void volume (Fig. B) of the column in the first attempt, which was nearly not the case for the preparative preparation (Fig. C). Therefore we would give the advise to use strictly reducing conditions while working with recombinant EreB. The finally resulting yields of the preparative purification have been determined by absorption measurement of the aromatic amino acids at 280. The total yield was determined to 25 mg of pure protein which is 2.1 mg/L of LB culture.
Kirby-Bauer Assay: Measuring remaining erythromycin on a pertri dish
Figure 2: Kirby-Bauer assay of recombinant EreB incubated with erythromycin
The Kirby-Bauer assay is an agar diffusion test, with which it is very easy to examine the decomposition activity of the enzyme. We also analyzed the decomposition activity of the recombinant EreB by LC-MS . The recombinant protein is incubated with the antibiotic and the reaction is stopped with methanol. To be sure that the enzyme is inhibited and the reaction does not go on, we additionally heated the reaction mixture (see table 2) after stopping for two minutes at 50°C and then shock froze the mixture in liquid nitrogen. The effect of methanol, heating and shock freezing on the bacterial strain and the substrate were checked before and have no influence.
Then bacteria from a quite dense liquid culture are plated on a LB agar plate without antibiotics under sterile conditions and spread with sterile cotton tip applicators. We used the bacterial strain Micrococcus luteus which was generously donated"
DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Inteins_-_-_TEXT.html," 818 entries of ribosomal head-to-tail cyclic peptides from 105 different species [1]. The peptides vary from 8 to 80 amino acids in length and in number of internal cysteine bridges that stabilizes the cyclic peptide [2]. Ribosomal cyclic peptides are potential drug candidates and their synthesis may be exploited to produce peptide drugs with increased stability or bioavailability. In one mechanism of cyclization (Figure 1), self-splicing proteins (inteins) bind and catalyze their own excision, while forming a peptide bond between the N-extein and C-extein. Numerous of inteins have been characterized, including split intein Npu DnaE from Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102 (Npu) (Figure 1) [3][4]. When the Npu DnaE intein catalyzes its own excisions, it leaves a six amino acid scar behind. The scar is called the extein. Npu DnaE has a native scar of “AEY/CFN”. This scar can in large parts be changed to other amino acids to better fit a potential synthetic peptide target [4].
 
Experimental Design and Methods
The BioBrick  BBa_K1362000  was added by Heidelberg to the iGEM registry in 2014. It contains Npu DnaE inteins surrounding a RFP selection marker, which can be cut out with restriction enzyme BsaI. Digestion of BBa_K1362000 with BsaI generates to different overhangs, thus making it possible to insert the coding sequence (CDS) for your protein of interest. The BioBrick was used to cyclize different proteins. To our knowledge, it was not used to cyclize short peptides.
We decided to try and cyclise a synthetic 10 amino acid peptide which has similar amino acid sequence to tyrocidine. In addition, we searched the cyclic peptide database for bioactive cyclic peptide, which contained part or the entire or part of the extein scar in its native sequence. We selected a hit for a cyclotides with 33 amino acids. The sequences for both native peptides along with the sequence chosen for cyclization experiments are shown in Table 1.
Table 1 Peptides selected for this study. Npu DnaE requires a cystine at position 1 in the extein[4]. For tyrocidine the native extein sequence was kept.

- Does your country have a way of removing bubble gum from the streets?
- What is your definition of GMO (genetically modified organism)?
Where most teams ask for the opinion of other iGEM teams, this team wants us to go and ask around for other people to answer the question. The guidelines for doing the survey are below. On the 26th of August we heard that we provided enough answers to earn the Bronze medal. We are really glad to hear that we gave the team enough input and we are curious to see what they did with the answers for the progress of their project.

At 47 C, the system gets activated faster because the linear regression has a steeper slope. This indicates that the system is being stressed and it produces its downstream product which is RFP in this case and DegP and other chaperones in the genomic DNA much faster in order to cope with periplasmic protein denaturation. Also, it seems that the system gets activated dramatically after 3 hours regardless of the temperature, this could indicate that the system peaks after 3 hours and the genomic CpxR produces enough downstream chaperones and proteases in order for the system to be able to cope with stress which allows the RFP reading to decrease at 4 hours time because the cell reaches homeostasis. This allows the cell to get rid of misfolded protein and other factors that might be contributing to stressing it out and causing the Cpx regulon to be activated. The cell then shows a rapid rise again because it is still under heat shock stress. But, if the cell was placed at 37 degrees, the cell would show a flatline pattern rather than an oscillating pattern.
Experiment 4: Characterization of the degP promoter's response to folding and misfolding proteins
Protocol
Arabinose inducible promoter (I0500) coupled with standard ribosome binding site (B0034) and the respective maltose binding protein were transformed into competent cells containing pDegP coupled with RFP generator (I13507). These cells were plated and incubated overnight. Colonies from each of the plates were selected and overnight cultures were prepared at 37 C. These 5 ml overnight cultures were then subcultured in 20 ml LB broth. These were shaken for 6-8 hours and aliquoted into 5 ml cultures and induced with varying levels of arabinose. This was incubated in the shaker for 12-14 hours and RFP output was measured using 555/632 nm.
This figure demonstrates that the DegP promoter activated with 15 different concentrations of arabinose. This diagram shows that the DegP promoter (K239000) is not particularly sensitive to misfolding proteins.
Discussion and conclusions
The figure shows that MalE and MalE31 express the DegP promoter in a similar fashion. This is slightly contradictory compared to the literature. The literature claims that the DegP promoter is upregulated in the case of protein misfolding, graph shown . Since MalE and MalE31"

To better understand microbial fuel cells, which is one of the applications of our project. We had an interview with Prof. Douglas Yung.  He is an assistant professor of the department of electronic engineering,  CUHK. Prof. Yung acquired his Ph.D. in Bioengineering from Caltech in 2008 and worked in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California as a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow focused on the sensor development microfluidics as well as bacterial spore viability. One of his current research interests is microbial fuel cell. Prof. Yung has provided us many valuable insights of microbial fuel cell and how to adapt this concept to real-life application. Microbial fuel cell is closely related to our project, it is one of the three applications of our project. We gained lots of knowledge from Prof. Yung on microbial fuel cell and asked for his advice on our project in which we regarded this as a valuable chance to review our project."

First a cell is transformed with a phagemid and infected with a helper phagmid. The helper phagemid provides the genes necessary for M13 phage production but because its packaging signal is disrupted while the phagemid contains a fully functional packaging signal, the phagemid is uptaken into the assembled phage at a higher rate. However, some phage will still package the helper phagemid. By isolating the phage and infecting a separate stock of cells (1 phage sample, 1 cell sample), the infected cells can be plated under selection to select for cells that were infected by cells containing the phagemid vs the helper phagemid. In this experiment, if the cells grow on chloramphenicol, then they were infected with phage having the pSB1C3-M13ori phagemid; however, cells that grow on kanamycin, were infected with cells having M13K07 helper phagemid. Because the phagemid has the functional packaging signal, it should be packaged more efficiently, and so we expect more colonies to grow on chloramphenicol than kanamycin.

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#ProjectTest KillingTest_-_-_TEXT.html," receptor that some Yersinia species have on the cell surface the probability for the colicin to hurt the producing bacteria is very low. A bigger problem could be that many bacteriocins are short lived in certain conditions and might denature or break before they are characterized.
Inhibition test
To be able to prove that our system is working we needed to test it on the actual Y. enterocolitica. Since Y. enterocolitica is a class two bacteria we had to do it in another lab. We managed to get in contact with Livsmedelsverket (the Swedish authority of food safety) and they allowed us to test our colicin Fy in one of their labs on one of their pathogenic strains of Y. enterocolitica.
To examine the inhibition of colicin Fy an overnight culture of bacteriocin producing bacteria in 200ml LB with no antibiotic was prepared. As negative control, DH5-alpha was grown under the same conditions. No antibiotic was added to ensure that the antibiotics would not affect the results. The cells were then lysed and the supernatant was collected according to protocol . The supernatant was added to a final concentration of 1%(v/v) in LB with 10^4 CFU/ml Y. enterocolitica added. The culture was put to grow in 37d C with 100rpm shaking. OD measurements were taken every hour,  but due to Y. enterocolitica ability to aggregate the results were inconclusive. Instead 100microL was plated on BHI agar plates after 0h, 2h, 4h and 24h. Immediately growth difference could be spotted and after 4 hours the results were very clear, fig. 4.  More figures of the plating can be found in the appendix.

The three remaining strains, S3, S4 and P1, were cultured for one week in plates and liquid media with these pieces of stained cotton, and for liquid culture one tube were left without microbes as a negative control. Unfortunately, after a week we cannot see noticeable change of color on cotton pieces. However, this is not the only experiment we carried out on fabric: we also left colored threads from denim in LB with strain S4 for two months. And after two months, the result is the following: color faded on these threads. Comparison with untreated threads can be seen in figure 4 . In conclusion, the process of indigo’s removal by microbes seems to be a long but effective process.

Bpul Indigo Digestion
At the beginning of the Indigo project we have used the BioBrick Bba_K863001 from the registry of the Standard Biological Parts. Later, our own version of bpul (Bba_K863007) was made in the collaboration with the Enzymes team. Our bpul gene is placed under T7 promoter, and it is codon optimized for expression in E.coli. After the translation, a His-tag attached to the C-terminus of Bpul protein allows simple purification.
All results shown in the figure 5 are made with our bpul gene expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The protein gel (figure 5B) is showing an over-expression of the bpul, after the induction with IPTG. When comparing uninduced bpul sample with the control sample (BL21(DE3)) we can notice leakiness of our promoter, which is probably due to great transcriptional strength of T7 polymerase.
In the later experiments, both the transformant BL21(DE3)-bpul, and the negative control BL21(DE3) have been induced with IPTG. The cell extracts of both strains were tested for the ability to degrade indigo carmine (figure 5C) and indigo (figure 5D). Additionally, 10µM acetosyringone (ACS) was added to the reaction mixture to facilitate the oxidation of the substrates. ACS is a known mediator of the laccases and it is often used and needed in"

1. Survey interactions with many teams.
We contacted with many other teams through our own survey. First was with IGEM Greece and their project is pANDORRA – Engineering and delivering modular RNAi-based logic circuits to treat colorectal cancer. In order to design a multi-pronged treatment approach for colorectal neoplasia, this team is engineering a novel anti-cancer E.coli agent, facilitating selective adhesion and cell density-dependent invasion into cancer cells, as the delivery module for our classifier circuit. In the future, they envision their system to be employed in a variety of pathological conditions generating reporter signals or protein outputs of therapeutic potential. In response to their survey, we provided our survey to them, which is about the increasing demand of gluten-free food and general introduction of our project, Insertion of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP- 4) to Intestinal Gut Microflora: Free from“Gluten-free”. Not only from Greece, igemusp(Brazil) team, British_Columbia IGEM team, UiOslo_Norway team, and Bordeaux also participated our survey for information about the trend of increasing gluten-intolerance.
2. Mentoring from KUAS_Korea
We were mentored by another College IGEM team, KUAS_Korea. KUAS_Korea is the team from Korea University in South Korea. They looked through our overall project and we learned basic method of PCR, gene cloning, etc. We basically first meet through face to face to generally inform our project, what we are mainly using as our own specific method and what we are suffering through the experiment. They introduced the new solution of our deficiency by showing some parts of their project to us and what they learn as members of synthetic biology association in their school. They also advised us about wiki management, experiment ethics, medal criteria, etc. We also talked about each other’s possible application of our project for general people and improved our parts based on discussion. By mentored from college team, we could get a lot of useful advices"
