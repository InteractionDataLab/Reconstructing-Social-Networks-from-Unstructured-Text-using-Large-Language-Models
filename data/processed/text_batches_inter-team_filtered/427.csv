Aim
To transform the plasmids containing C-terminally strep-tagged & N-terminally strep-tagged hydABC FeFe hydrogenase genes into wild type Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (WT), S. oneidensis with both hydrogenase genes knocked out (ΔHydABC,HyaABC) and S. oneidensis with the FeFe hydrogenase knocked out (∆HydABC). The pBAD vector was used as the previous experiments attempting to transform BioBricks into S. oneidensis failed (see BioBrick conjugation ).
Method
The tri-parental conjugation protocol was initially carried out, as S. oneidensis MR-1 are not susceptible to heat shock. We used strains of Escherichia coli containing the plasmids generated by this experiment; see here. This was attempted twice but yielded no results, so electroporation was used as an alternative method. The protocol was followed for the electroporation; see here . To check that the plasmid was in these strains, colonies were inoculated from each of the plates and then a Miniprep was performed according to the protocol. Agarose gel electrophoresis was run with the original hydABC C-terminally tagged and hydABC N-terminally tagged plasmids along with the Miniprep DNA. The DNA was also sent off for Sanger sequencing.
Results
Triparental conjugation was attempted twice, but each time no colonies of S. oneidensis were observed when plated out onto kanamycin selection plates for any of the combinations of plasmid and strain type. Electroporation was performed as another method to try to get both plasmids into the three different S. oneidensis strains (Wildtype MR-1, Double hydrogenase knock out ∆HydABC,HyaABC and FeFe hydrogenase knockout ∆hydABC. On the second attempt, results from the DNA sequencing confirmed that hydABC N-terminally SII tagged had been transformed into wild type S.oneidensis. This gave us a cell line of MR-1 containing an arabinose inducible hydABC gene to be used in following proof of concept experiments"

London iGEM Meet-up
On the 31st of July, Birbeck and UCL hosted an afternoon of talks and discussions with iGEM members from the Birbeck, UCL, London BIohackspace, Westminster and Kent teams. Followed by poster presentations, the goal of this event was to bring iGEMers together along with members of the academia to discuss collaborations and issues of relevance in the development of the projects.
Shuffle Festival
Shuffle Festival was a week long festival held in Mile End. The week-long festivities involve film, science, storytelling, performance art, architectural installations, walks, food, comedy and music.  Members from London Biohackspace had an opportunity to run a stall on July 26th at the Migration Pavilion.  We ran a “Beer Simulation Workshop” where we provided visitors with Vanilla, Lemon and Miraculin flavour.
2015 London iGEM Bootcamp
The UCL iGEM boot camp is a week long event designed to provide iGEM participants with a crash course in the skills necessary to compete in the iGEM competition. This years boot camp was attended by team members from University College London’s own 2015 undergraduate team along with team members from Birkbeck University and the community-run London Biohackspace laboratory. The camp primarily consisted of a number of technical workshops designed to help iGEM newcomers (and a few grizzled veterans) develop essential iGEM lab skills such as biobrick design and construction along with bacterial culturing and transformation techniques. Further workshops were also available on topics such as how computational modelling can lead to iGEM success, constructing your own spectrophotometer and how to build an award winning wiki (without having to stay up all night on wiki-freeze deadline day). Previous iGEM participants were on hand throughout the week to provide assistance as well as offer invaluable advice on how this years teams can excel in the iGEM competition (step 1:rob a bank). The week concluded with a mini-jamboree in which each team presented their chosen project and current progress to the rest of the group in a format similar to the iGEM giant jamboree held in Boston at the end of the competition.

East_Chapel_Hill,2017,Team:East Chapel Hill#Collaborations-Siyu_-_-_TEXT.html," biology becomes part of a living system and redefines life. Also talked about the scope of synthetic biology, what it can achieve, and the applications and goals of the field.
Connor McFadden, UNC - Chapel Hill : Discussed the formal definition of synthetic biology, and the subfields and components of contemporary synthetic biology.
Emma Miles, Duke iGEM : Discussed the ethical implications of synthetic biology related to its applications (human advancement), distribution (biofuel production), and procedure (status of living machines). Also illustrated the importance of bridging the disconnect which makes it hard for the public to accept synthetic biology projects due to lack of communication and education from the scientists in charge of implementation.
There were also many fun and lighthearted activities for all of us to partake in. For example, the Duke iGEM team conducted an interview asking us questions like “Why do you love science?”, “What is your favorite piece of lab equipment and why?”, “If you could say something to any microorganism what would it be?”, etc. We socialized over a dinner consisting of pasta and salad from Olive Garden, ice cream, and a movie to kick off the night.
Reddit Synthetic Biology Forum
Along with the iGEM teams of Duke and Gaston Day school, our team created a subreddit to initiate discussion about synthetic biology. Our team and the Duke and Gaston Day teams function as the moderators of the Reddit thread called r/iGEM_Exchange . Read more about our synthetic biology forum on our human practices page.
Building with Bio Revamp
At the Southeastern Mini Convention, we got the chance to discuss potential collaborations in the Human Practices division with Gaston Day School and Duke. Since Duke’s project relates to developing an accessible and easy to use test for Zika in its primary stages, we all thought it would be a good idea to collaborate with Duke and work on revamping the Building with Bio kit for Malaria since it was a little outdated and not pertinent to the more pressing issue at hand: the Zika virus. For those who are unfamiliar with Building with Biology, it is a company that develops innovative resources designed to engage the public with a wide array of activities relating to the STEM field. The kits are assembled by a team of science educators, researchers, and scientists who are passionate about bringing modern day topics related to science, technology, and their societal implications to the discussion table so that the public can have these important conversations. Building with Biology’s mission is very similar to the our Human Practice’s mission: which is to go beyond the laboratory and delve into the underlying issues of projects in"

Transformation for Expression:
The leftover miniprepped plasmid that was sent for sequencing and confirmed to contain the genes of choice were then loaded onto Millipore (type VSWP) drop dialysis film with 0.025 μm on ~40 uL of ultra-pure Milli-Q water for desalting over the course of one hour. 2 uL of dialyzed DNA along with 30 uL of electrocompetent BLR cells were transferred to Bio Rad 0.1 cm gap Gene Pulser cuvettes for electroporation and kept chilled. Electroporation was conducted with a Bio-Rad MicroPulser Electroporator set to pulse on the bacteria setting. After electroporation, the cells were immediately transferred to 200 L of TB and placed in a 37° incubator to recover for an hour. The cells were then added to LB agar plates with kanamycin and spread with ~10 sterile glass beads per plate. The beads were then dumped into 70% ethanol and the plates were allowed to dry in the incubator at 37 degrees for 30 minutes with the lid side up. The plates were then flipped lid side down and incubated at 37 degrees overnight.
Checking for colonies and glycerol stock for culture growth:
Colonies were seen on all of the plates and contained too many to count. Using a pipet tip, one colony from each of the plates were selected and mixed into 2 mL of TB with kanamycin for overnight growth. The cells, after ~16 hours had 2 mL of 50% glycerol stock solution added to achieve 4 mL total and were aliquoted out into 1.5 mL eppendorf microfuge tubes containing 1 mL of 25% glycerol cultures. These glycerol stock cells were kept in a -80 degree freezer until needed for expression growth cultures.
Cell growth for expression:
Using 50 mL falcon tubes, 25 mL of TB containing kanamycin were poured into each tube. Using the glycerol stock cells on ice, a pipet tip was used to obtain a fleck of frozen cultures and carefully mixed for each of the designated tubes. The cultures were shaken for ~24 hours at 300 rpm in 37 degrees.

UN Climate Change Conference
Summits like the UN Climate Change Conference are the wrong approach to problems such as antibiotic resistances, says Lars Fischer. Picture from the Intern Blog of American University.
International collaborations against antibiotic resistances are all well and good, but the UN Climate Change conference of all collaborations shows why coordination at the government level is the wrong approach, says Lars Fischer, editorial journalist at ""Spektrum Der Wissenschaft"". Not even a century ago, the discovery of antibiotics caused a decisive turn for the better in the millennia-long battle against infectious diseases. But while many already saw pathogenic agents eradicated and a golden age of medicine seemed within reach, we have now however reached an abyss: a dramatic relapse into a world looms ahead, where microorganisms are again rulers over life and death.
The threat emanating from the increasing antibiotic resistances is existential—for every one of us, as well as the countries and society itself. That the world community unites in a supranational board in order to face the latter, suggests itself. However, as alluring as the vision of an intergovernmental panel on antimicrobial resistance may be, as evoked by Mark Woolhouse and Jeremy Farrar (authors of the Nature article ""Policy: An intergovernmental panel on antimicrobial resistance"", published May 2014), this thought is gravely mistaken.

Colonies from the Lysogeny Broth (LB) transformation agar plate were streaked on MacConkey agar plates and left overnight at 37oC. They were then imaged with a fluorescence microscope to check for GFP expression (Fig 6). The LB agar plates were also viewed under a microscope with a GFP visualisation software to see whether the different nutrient agar plates affected promoter function (Fig 7).
Figure 6:  Microscopy fluorescence imaging of acrRA-gfp with and without RamA transcription factor on LB nutrient agar plates.
Figure 7: Microscopy fluorescence imaging for PacrRA-gfp with and without RamA transcription factor on MacConkey agar plates.
The results from the GFP fluorescent images in Figures 6A-D was unexpected, as when only PacrRa-gfp is present there are large amounts of GFP fluorescence (Fig 6B). And there doesn't seem to much difference in the presence of  pUniprom-ramA-HA (Fig 6B). However, when the cells containing PacrRA-gfp and pUniprom-ramA-HA were plated onto MacConkey (Fig 7A) there was a larger signal of GFP fluorescence compared to when the RamA transcription factor was not present (Fig 7D). Similar results were seen when cells were grown in LB and an anti-GFP western blot was carried out (Fig 8). GFP was observed even in the absence of RamA, it is difficult to tell if there is any difference in the amount of GFP being detected.
Figure 8: MG1655 cells harbouring pSB1C3-PacrRA-gfp and pUniprom-ramA wre grown overnight at 37oC. 1 ml of the overnight culture was pelleted and re-suspended in 100 ul Laemmli buffer and 15 ul samples were then separated by SDS PAGE (12% acrylamide) and transferred to PVDF membrane followed by probing with anti-GFP antibody.
In order to further understand the role of RamA we first wanted to determine that we were able to detect the expression of RamA-HA. In Fig 9 the RamA transcription factor containing its HA tag was not observed, this may be due to the amount of RamA being produced by the cells being rather low. So we repeated the experiment using the Rosetta E. coli strain which contains a viral T7 polymerase, activated by IPTG. In Fig 10 you can see successful blotting"

Dr. Wolbring suggested we should keep in mind the economic viability of our project. What is the reason we are doing this project? Is there something that is more effective and cheaper than our system for destroying and preventing biofilm formation? He said the teams don't really take these things into account and some other things about iGEM that I didn't really agree with because I feel iGEM is not meant for useful applications and a product that will sell. We're undergraduates, I don't think groundbreaking discoveries should be expected. Anyway, he did offer some help in suggesting some ways we can go beyond the paper (see Fahd's email).
For Second Life, I fixed up the eukaryotic cell today. I then met with Max Chatnoir, creator of genome island in order to show her my endoplasmic reticulum (the Second Life one not one in my body). I did this because I feel it is important to keep my contacts updated and also she was having trouble creating one herself. She was super impressed and I also sent pictures of the lab and synthetic kingdom. She is excited for the unveiling of our island. Then, she mentioned that we should join SciLands, a collection of science based islands that are grouped together in Second Life and Mandy took a look at the application and we thought this would be an excellent idea.
Tomorrow will consist of the ethics (or lab?) meeting and also the super secret announcement for Sonja. After that, I will most likely be continuing my work in the Synthetic Kingdom by brainstorming some more ideas for engineered cells.

Modelling report and plan of attack
We touched on that briefly today but had to put that on hold to discuss lab work. We’re planning to put together something that includes a description of what we’re planning to look at (Hill equation, static/dynamic behaviour, response time, population mean and range), why it’s useful and how we plan to collect the data to develop the model or quantify that aspect of characterisation.
Making the introduction less superficial
We all know that I’m making a lot of vague claims in the introduction (ie, why coordinated behaviour could be useful in degrading biofilms). These need to be substantiated by something specific and credible. I will address that as much as I can within the next few hours. Other areas of concern include a lacklustre description and comparison of the AHL and AI-2 signalling pathways that"

The primers corresponding to the new MaSp2 sequences with a valine added to the end came today. We conducted polymerase chain assembly to place the biobrick prefix/suffix and the BsaI restriction enzyme recognition sites with the designed sticky ends.
We used NEB’s Q5 PCR annealing temperature calculator to determine that an annealing temperature of 65 C was optimal. We also decided to test annealing at 61.4 C and 59 C. In addition, we planned to use the GC enhancer because our sequence is GC-rich. We prepared reactions as follows:

E. Highschool Observer
    < A letter from Byunguk Kang(the observer student) >
     Ever since I went to a science camp and met KAIST iGEM team there, I had a great interest in the field of synthetic biology, and registered for 'high school iGEM competition' this year. However, because our team was not able to get support from other laboratories nearby that we asked, our team could not complete our project and could not participate in the jamboree. I kept on researching, and finally sent an e-mail to professor Choi of Computational and Synthetic Biology Lab at Korea University, to have some research experiences. Thankfully, professor Choi and the faculty members of the laboratory provided me a great opportunity to serve as an intern during summer vacation to learn all the basic protocols and experiments on synthetic biology. While I received extensive training, professor Choi allowed me to join the ""Korea U Seoul"" iGEM team, as a high school observer. I summarized the basic project idea and presented at the lab meeting, and partly involved in PCR and assembly procedure of the project. Through such unique and beneficial experience, I can now design a workable device, (currently conducting personal biosensor research as first author) and get the big picture of how engineers and scientists realize their ideas. I am also willing to participate collegiate iGEM competition next year when I go tocollege. I thank everyone who has given me this great opportunity.

Their references for constructing and assaying the part were not clear, either. In addition, we found some mutations (substitution and deletion) in their part through analyzing the DNA sequence (Fig. 3-5-17).

Fig. 3-5-17.  Mutations found in OUC-China's phosphate sensor part
We found two mutations (substitution and deletion) in their part through analyzing the DNA sequence.
We assayed OUC-China's phosphate sensor part by the same method as that for our phoA promoter assay since we thought that the phoB promoter should also be repressed by high phosphate concentrations. According to previous reports, the regulation of the phoB promoter is similar to that of the phoA promoter (Fig. 3-5-2, Shinagawa et al., 1983). The result of this assay (Fig. 3-5-19, enlarged view in Fig. 3-5-20) shows clearly that their part did not respond to the increase in phosphate concentration compared to our part including the phoA promoter (Fig. 3-5-18). Therefore, we hypothesize that the mutations have something to do with the activity of the phoB promoter.
Thus, we conclude that we improved the phosphate sensor part. Our part can be useful not only for our project but also for various studies in synthetic biology.

5. Modeling
From our results above, we determined parameters for the induction mechanism. By fitting the results to the following Hill equation (Fig. 3-5-21), we identified the parameters for the induction mechanism. α denotes the maximum GFP expression rate in this construct. m denotes the phosphate concentration at which the GFP expression rate is half of α. β denotes the hill coefficient.  Those parameters (Fig. 3-5-22) can be used in future modeling. Plants are reported to be in phosphate starvation when its concentration is below 1 mM (Hoagland et al., 1950)."

IPTG-INDUCIBLE MODEL FOR CBD CIPA-BMP2 PROTEIN  EXPRESSION IN E. coli
Entry of IPTG into E. coli
Mimicking lactose, IPTG is a chemical widely used  in scientific research because it cannot be metabolized. IPGT induces the  expression of genes under the control of Plac promoter.
IPTG enters into E. coli cells in a concentration dependent manner. This  uptake is mediated by lactose permease and passive diffusion at low and high  concentrations respectively.2 The IPTG uptake through passive  diffusion can be described with the law of mass action expressing the balance  between IPTG concentration outside (IPTGext) and inside (IPTGint) of E. coli :
Eq 1.
The first term on the right side of Eq 1  represents the forward rate where kIPTGupt is the rate constant of IPTG uptake (0.92 min-1)3 while the second term has negative  sign because it represents the backward rate where kIPTGout is the rate constant of IPTG output (0.05 min-1).3 Because of [IPTG]ext = [IPTG]TOTAL - [IPTG]int, it can be replaced in equation 1 in order to have IPTGint as the unique independent variable:
Eq 2.
The LacI-IPTG interaction is assumed to be so  fast and when the IPTG concentration largely exceeds that of lacI. The LacI  active ([LacI]act), i.e that unbounded to IPTG, can be described  with the Hill repression function.4,2

Students from different labs working in physics, biophysics, and synthetic biology were present with their posters. The participation of interested people was really high. There were also do it yourself session and displays of different technologies so that the general people and students could try it themselves. A general quiz for everyone was also part of the program and at the end the winners of the quiz were awarded with gifts. There were also talks from renowned professors and researchers on different topics.  People showed great interest in our work and were willing to participate in our survey as well. The program took place from 11:00 am to 18:00 pm and was open and free for everyone.
Meeting with iGEM Team LMU & TU Munich 2016 (5th October 2017):
We met with some members from last year´s grand price winning team iGEM Munich 2016 and had a BBQ with them. We shared our experiences with iGEM and received some useful tips for the Jamboree.
European Practice Jamboree (7th October 2017)
This meetup was organized by team iGEM KU Leuven . They invited different teams from Europe with the idea of practicing the talk and the poster presentation before the final Jamboree. The event started out with a few words from the Vice Rector of Sciences and Technology from KU Leuven, Prof. Gerard Govers, followed by an informative guest lecture by Prof. Jos Vander Sloten. Each team then proceeded to give a short presentation followed by questions and feedback from the audience. The feedback was especially good for our team since we came to know what we were still missing. We also got an amazing and inspirational presentation by  the PI of team Leuven, Prof. Johan Swinnen about his phenomenal journey as a scientist and humanitarian. At the end we heard the poster presentations from all participating teams.

1.2 Improving the beads
1.2.1 Adding a Coating
1.2.2 Adding Nutrient Medium
We’re extremely proud of what we’ve accomplished this year on the wetlab side; first building and well characterising our BioBrick, but then also developing our novel bead approach to improving signal detection. However the project is still far from perfect, below are several things we would like to implement were we to take the project further.
Improving the system
Adding further promoters
The most obvious extension to the project is to add the ability to detect multiple nutrients. In terms of improving fertiliser use, it would make most sense to add phosphate and potassium detection, as together with nitrogen these make up the major components of fertiliser.
There are already promoters available in the parts registry that sense Phosphate (BBa_K116401 submitted by NYMU-Taipei).
What’s more, the wide variety of fluorescent proteins available in the parts registry makes it easy to add another signal, without requiring different detection technology. These additional signals would also be compatible with our ratio method of calibrating signals.
Increasing Signal Strength and Differences
As is clear from our results, we were able both to detect our signals, and"
TMMU-China,2017,Team:TMMU-China#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," soon as our project get mostly shaped, we discussed with SCU-WestChina about holding the Southwest Union meet-up of 2017. Together with the SCU-WestChina, SCU-China , UESTC-China and SICAU-China, we have an overall assessment of the safety and feasibility of our project and the latest trend of iGEM competition including the newly added judging terms, etc. What matters most was that all teams exchanged information and built a deeper relationship.  Particularly, SICAU-China and SCU-WestChina shared us with their experience of facing the problem that working on a very similar project with quite a few teams, and we finally decided to keep our project to see what can we achieve.
b.XJTLU-China
This year, we aimed to build a quorum sensing tool kit based on the Agr system from the Gram-positive bacteria-- Staphylococcus aureus, while XJTLU-China happens to working on a quite similar project. However, we had difficulties synthesizing the genes agrC and agrA in plasmids, and therefore, the experiments were not able to conduct. Fortunately, XJTLU-China had the similar construction and provided us with their group I Staphylococcus aureus’ s agrC and agrA genes.
3.Intergrated HP with researchers
CCiC Conference:
As the competition approaches, the Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) conference was hosted by Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (FAFU-China), in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams. This was a great opportunity to present our work and learn from the other 48 teams. It was nice to see that we did a good job in presentation and the audience was attracted by our project. The most important thing to us was that we harvested much useful advice from the judges, mentors and students. We made the best of the Panel Session and poster exhibition to establish collaborations with other teams. Interestingly, we were lucky to have deep conversations with Igem headquarter King L. CHOW and former iGEMer Zhang Haoqian, who encouraged us to go deeper in research and promote iGEM and synthetic biology research in our university. From the CCiC, we were aware of our current disadvantages in quantitative measurement and the overall logic, which laid a foundation for the later adjustments and improvements. More importantly, we made great acquaintance with many students and establish deep collaborations with teams with same interest, including ShanghaiTech University and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.

A. We do not distinguish them.
B. We strictly distinguish them.
C. Other situation
To protect people outside the lab, experiment waste and household waste should be distinguished strictly. About 15% people didn't distinguish them strictly. We also saw that some people throw the experiment wastes in the bucket containing household wastes. We do really well in our own lab and we think it's a good habit. The two kinds of wastes should be separated in the lab and they will be treated differently outside the lab.
Some labs distinguish experiment and household waste while some labs do not.
Q8. How do you store hazardous and poisonous chemicals in lab?
A. We store them in a special cabinet and cannot use them freely.
B. We store them in a special cabinet yet could use them freely.
C. We store them together with other chemicals.
D. Other situation
Most labs manage the poisonous chemicals strictly. Some labs manage all kinds of chemicals together. In fact, some hazardous chemicals need special management.
Some labs implement strict regulation on hazardous chemicals.
Q9. What kind of personal protective equipment do you usually use?
The things used the most are: lab coats, gloves, and masks. Some labs also use goggles. In fact, there are indeed some students do experiments without any protective equipment. They told us they only wear gloves when using EB. That's a very dangerous habit. This equipment can lower the possibility for people from being hurt by the organisms or the chemicals they deal with.
Some labs require students to use personal protective equipment and put up reminders in the lab.
Initiate a reform in Nankai University
Faculty members are holding a meeting on the topic of hazardous chemical management in response to our advice.
We sent our findings to the president, and he attached great importance to our report. He asked for more details about what we have seen in the laboratories and told us to wait for their response.
Several days later, we received an email from his assistant. She told us that they have held a meeting to rectify and reform dangerous factors in the laboratories. She told us that we helped a lot in this work and the teachers will do their best to strengthen the management of the labs.

Definition of „Artificial Cell“ and „Living Machine“ in Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is still a young field of science, which combines areas of engineering, chemistry, biotechnology, computer science and molecular biology. It can be defined by their objectives. This definition encompasses four points. One goal is to gain new scientific knowledge about the processes within cells by trying to build cells from the bottom up or the top down. Another goal is to open up new fields of possible applications for synthetic modified organisms for example in medicine. A key issue involves the creation of novel, non-naturally occurring organisms and structures, as well as modularization and standardization of repeatedly compassable components: BioBricks.
Before discussing the definitions of „artificial cell“ and „living machine“ it is crucial to define to what extend can ever be spoken about a creation of life in synthetic biology. The currently pursued research approaches in synthetic biology do not aspires the creation of life de novo. De novo can be explained from the Latin term “newly create, invent” (Pons). In connection with synthetic biology this implies the creation of new organisms without any foundation in already existing organisms. Up to this day researchers are working with organisms found in nature.
However, in the future scientists attempt to design and manufacture new biological systems, with no origin in nature (Boldt et al. 2009). Creating new life is consequently one main goal of synthetic biology.
There are three different approaches aiming at the goal: the DNA-based device construction, genome-driven cell engineering and protoc"

Again 14 colonies have grown on the plate, after incubating at 37°C over night. One can presume, that the newly prepared competent cells have taken up any plasmid providing chloramphenicol resistance (e.g. pSB1C3), makin them unuseful for our experiments. The uptake probably took place when inoculating the LB medium, one day befor the cells were prepared, because a sample of our old competent cells was used for the inoculation instead of a plated colony of e.coli- XL1-blue.

Then we use the same design as luciferase, both of which serve as the signal proteins(Fig.3). Expression and function verification experiments are carried out then. We used spectrophotometer to detect the intension of emission fluorescence of microtubule under different taxol treatment condition with excitation wavelength of 527 nm. The standard curve of taxol concentration and fluorescence intension can be measured later.

5. Extracting tubulin in vitro
Tubulins of animal origin has the ability of self-assembly under proper condition in vitro. When GTP and Mg2+ are added into near-neutral pH buffer PIPES, tubulin heterodimers can aggregate into microtubule automatically under room-temperature(or 37℃). This process can be reversed under lower temperature(usually 4℃ in experimental condition). It is the basis to extract and purify microtubule in vitro that tubulins can assemble or disaggregate automatically under different temperatures.
As a major member of cytoskeleton, microtubule plays an extremely important role in every organism. Researches focusing on microtubule are of great significance. Porcine brains contain abundant microtubule. As an inexpensive raw material which can be easily purchased, they are always used for microtubule extraction [16] Since microtubule is conservative in both animal and plant, the microtubules purified from animal tissues can also be used in plant science research.
To test the aggregation of microtubule effectively, we design the fusion proteins of tubulin subunit and fragments of signal proteins. However, whether"

I believe you sudy was published in 2015. Have you learned any new information regarding these health impacts? What is your opinion on controversial studies which show links between depreciating IQ scores amongst young children with consistent exposure to toxic levels of fluoride?
A: I think these potential health impacts are very important to address. Unfortunately, I cannot comment because of a lack of information.
Q: You claim that “there is no effective way to prevent fluorosis that is also cost-free”. Our aim is to turn our project into a bioreactor that can bioremediate fluoride as well as a biosensor that can detect excess levels of fluoride - all at a low cost. What do you think is the best way to make use of this mechanism, if successful? How do you suggest we can safely incorporate this in underdeveloped countries where over fluoridation is an issue?
A: A biological absorption system with an additional step for filtration seems like the best way to make use of the of the fluoride riboswitch. When I went to Ghana, water filtration companies were selling treated water in sealed sachets that people were buying for a couple cents. They used a reverse osmosis filter; and tests showed that the water they were selling had virtually no fluoride in it. You could adopt a similar model where you treat water at a plant and people come and fill up their jugs all at a low cost. That way everything is centralized and easier to control. Also, these water companies may be interested in using the cheaper method (fluoride riboswitch) rather than a reverse osmosis filter. The cheaper the production costs, the cheaper they can sell the water to the people!
Q: In conclusion, you state, “Steps forward in addressing the problem of fluorosis will need to include ongoing educational programs, beginning with the schools and health clinics, to help the residents understand fluorosis; for currently only 24% of the population in the study area understands that high fluoride drinking water is the cause of discolored and damaged teeth (data from this study)”. What sort of an educational program do you have in mind? - because this is something our team would be eager to work on creating. In other words, what is the best way to have everyone in the community understand the cause of fluorosis and have an incentive to address it?
A: When I first arrived, I found that most people"

Figure 3
The electronic circuit shown above picks up incoming light from the sfGFP at the photodiode and through several amplification and offset steps manipulates the light level into a useable readable signal. This signal is then compared to a threshold safe value and can illuminate a red or green LED to indicate if the water is DCM contaminated or not.

     Thus while we suffered from reconstructing parts for standard BioBricks, we eventually developed this new method. Since this is a common issue in iGEM experiments, its significance can be easily seen.
Method and protocols
Add XbaI at the 5’ region of the part and SpeI at the 3’ region by PCR.
Advantage : both prefix and suffix have 22bp in length, which is unfriendly for PCR: the matching region of the primer with the part should be no shorter than the unmatching tail, requiring at least 44bp in total. The Tm of the primer will be huge, especially when the parts’ matching region is also unfriendly. Thus it will be more feasible and efficient to add a 6bp tail rather than a 22bp tail.
Digest pSB1C3 and the PCR product with XbaI and SpeI enzyme. Follow the instruction of the enzyme protocol.
Treat the digested pSB1C3 with alkaline phosphatase, which can remove the phosphate group of the cohesive ends of the backbone. Follow the instruction of the enzyme protocol.
Explanation : As XbaI and SpeI are isocaudarners, this step is necessary to prevent the backbone from self-cyclizing without the part. Treat with alkaline phosphatase every time before use.(Optional: treat the digested part with polynucleotide kinase, assuring that the ends of the part have phosphate groups. Follow the instruction of the enzyme protocol. )
Ligate the digested part and the digested-treated backbone, and transform into E.coli.
Product confirmation: After plasmid extraction, use enzyme XbaI digest the plasmid, of use Xbal and SpeI to digest the plasmid.
Explanation : XbaI and SpeI are isocaudarners, so theoretically there is a 5 to 5 chance that the part is ligated head-to-feet in the backbone. Luckily, neither can XbaI or SpeI digest the wrong ligated plasmid. Therefore one enzyme digestion can tell you are right or wrong. (Xbal is cheaper than SpeI, so choose XbaI). If you also want to confirm the size of your part, use both Xbal and SpeI.
Electrophorese the digestion product, and confirm your plasmid.

Methods
Fluorometry
Triplicate of each sample were inoculated overnight in a deep-well 96 well plate. M9 minimal salt solution was used for the inoculation because it gives low background fluorescence.   1% and 2.5% (w/v) arabinose concentration was used for overnight induction. Samples were diluted around 10-fold the next day and regrown to mid-log phase (OD600=0.3 ~ 0.6). 200µl    of sample were drawn out from the deep-well plate and plated on a clear round bottom plate for measurement. For each sample, OD595 and Fluorescence was measured using    EnVision Multilabel Reader. The excitation wavelength was 485/14nm and the emission wavelength was 535/25nm. Conversion factor for OD595 to OD600 was obtained   by calculating the slope of the OD600 v.s. OD595 graph. The conversion factor, 1.24 was multiplied to OD595 reading to covert the measurements to   OD600. Background fluorescence was subtracted for each fluorescence measurement by making another standard Fluorescence v.s. OD600 graph. DH10B with    pSB3K3- BBa_E0240 was used to produce the standard curve. The corrected fluorescence was then divided by the corresponding    OD600. Finally the average and standard deviation were calculated.
PBAD Characterization
(Please note that the following data has been shown to be problematic because our new data do not match our old data. We will update the following information as soon as possible - HKUST iGEM 2015.23Jan2015)
Introduction
PBAD promoter is an arabinose inducible promoter. In nature, the promoter exist in the arabinose operon to regulate the transcription of araB, araA, and araD.    The arabinose operon or the ara operon encodes enzymes needed or the catabolism of arabinose to xylulose 5- phosphate which is an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway   . The Pc promoter which is adjacent to the PBAD promoter transcribes the araC gene in the opposite direction. AraC protein is responsible to repress the activity of   the PBAD promoter when arabinose is absent. Once arabinose is present,the AraC protein binds to the arabinose and dimerize. The dimerize form of AraC-arabinose can   activate the PBAD promoter (Schleif, 2010"

Discussion
As a final comment, we wanted to reflect on the principles standing behind any GMM related legislations: ensuring citizens’ safety. As any scientific field, synthetic biology makes enormous contributions to the development of a more sustainable future. iGEM teams alone have created numerous projects, thus helping solve environmental, medical and nutritional problems. When left unchecked, however, gene modification may interfere with natural biodiversity and lead to irreversible outcomes. Government’s laissez-faire approach to the field of synthetic biology is, therefore, hardly ever seen. Yet the crux of the matter seems to be finding the golden mean as banning GMOs altogether would not necessarily make the world a safer place.

In many of the test samples, growth in liquid culture was detected when the sender cells contained the messaging phagemid, regardless of whether the M13 ori was present or if the helper plasmid was present. Since the receiver cells were selected on the grounds of containing chloramphenicol resistance, transfer of the messaging phagemid was very likely due to conjugation between sender cells and receiver cells, rather than infection by the M13 bacteriophage. When the sender population contained a helper plasmid along with the messaging phagemid, the selection for receiver cells with chloramphenicol yielded much less growth. This could suggest that if M13 bacteriophage were being produced, it would slow the growth of the receiver cells. It is also likely that the message was transmitted via M13 bacteriophage but the results are inconclusive.
Monica Ortiz from the Endy Lab proposed the use of F+ receivers and senders, which may decrease chance of conjugation. The new design of the experiment would use the E. coli JM109 F+ strain as the sender population as well as the receiver population. The sender populations would have the same plasmids as was mentioned in the previous experiments but the receiver population would contain a GFP indicator in the pSB4A5 backbone so that receiver cells could be selected using ampicillin. Currently, the"

VI. CR2 Gag-Prot-RT Degradation Fragment Extraction for Mass Spectrometry
Purpose: To perform gel extraction of the putative degradation fragments of CR2 Gag-Prot-RT to send to Taplin for analysis via mass spectrometry in order to determine the cleavage sites of CR2 Gag-Prot-RT construct.
Attributions: Gel extraction was performed by Vishal Negi and Ryan Shontell.
Materials and Methods: A glass plate was sterilized with 70% ethanol and separate surgical blades were prepared for each band we excised from the gels. The desired SDS-PAGE gel was then placed on the glass plate and the band of interest was excised. The excised band was then placed into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and 1 mL of miliq H2O was added. The samples were then labeled and the caps were wrapped in parafilm. Bands were extracted from three separate gels. Gels were selected by Vishal Negi based on the resolution of the gel and intensity of the bands. The 90 kDa band likely corresponds to the full-sized CR2 Gag-Prot-RT. We believe that Band 2 ("

         As shown in the growth curves of E. coli with cadmium detecting device (figure                     2), the growth rate of E. coli BL21 is decline obviously after adding the concentration of Hg2+ from                     10-7M to 10-5M, indicating that this device can detect the mercury ions.
         As shown in the growth curves of E. coli with lead detecting device (figure                     3), the growth rate of E. coli BL21 is decline obviously after adding the concentration of Pb2+ from                     10-7M to 10-5M, indicating that this device can detect the lead ions.
         It was a pity that we found the OD600 of E. coli with did not decline after                     we added Cr6+ and Ni2+, which showed these two devices did not work as we expected. (figure 4 and figure                     5)
         The result not only showed us its effect to respond the metal ions of each                     device, but also showed us something inspiring. Compared with traditional reporters such as GFP, which                     needs about 3.5 hours for mature [7], our engineered bacteria can work and produce a clear phenomenon                     in about 30 minutes (lead detecting device), which showed its high efficiency.
         According to the result, we chose the three of them, mercury detecting device( BBa_K2360008 ),                     cadmium detecting device( BBa_K2360010 ) and lead detecting device( BBa_K2360011 ), which have obvious response                     to enter the next stage of the project.
Specificity
        Although we have chosen specifically transcriptional regulators, we want to                     verify that they can perform the same specifically in our system. So we verified the detecting devices                     specificity of mercury, cadmium and lead by adding Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, Cr6+, Ni2+ to their culture mediums.
         It was obvious that the E. coli with lead detecting device lysed after we added                     Pb2+, while other E. coli grew normally after adding Cd2+, Hg2+, Cr6+ and Ni2+. The result indicated                     that the lead detecting device has good specificity for specific metal ions. (Figure 6.)
         This result showed us that E. coli with mercury detecting device can merely                     lyse after we added Hg2+, and did not cause the same effect. Consequently, this device"

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project?
All iGEM team member attended lectures on lab safety. There was no special training for iGEM because all people already attended a special training on chemical and biological safety in the lab and a fire prevention course in previous practical courses.
Question IV
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?
One important thing is to keep genetically modified organism (GMOs) isolated form the environment. It is crucial to optimize all steps during the project to avoid the leaking of used organisms. Obeying the general safety standards has been effective in the past handling GMOs.
To augment safety, another approach lies in employing only such modified organisms that can be sustained in a controlled lab environment. The growth of such bacteria depends on a simple chemical supplement to the medium which is not present in the environment
In the case of our project that aims for being used to protect human skin, one needs ample experiments to guarantee environmental safety.

Coupling together Biological and In-Silico Chassis
Our Light-based communication interfaz, goes beyond the living organism communication process to enable the interfacing of living systems with informational systems such as computers, being this novel approach a bridge  between electronic and genetic engineering devices.
Since we want to emphasize the parallel logic with silicon-based systems, we created this short animation showing the similar rationales for a hybrid ""cyborg-ish"" system:
Light-based Controller system
The time has come to embrace possibilities with synthetic biology, being now possible to overcome the gap between electronics and organisms, shifting paradigms for information transfer between living and non-living systems becomes now a real possibility. We propose that a computer assembled to the proper electronic devices for light emission and detection, can be used  to control the gene expression of a bacterial chassis, interpreting the cellular information as the output of photons produced by the regulated bioluminescence reaction in response to the light input signal provided by the light emmitter device controlled by the computer.

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Modeling#UVR8_-_-_TEXT.html," of protective PABA for the average european caucasian after sun exposure.
Considerations
Using half-lives from in-vitro gels gives a rough figure of the timescale on which UVR8-TetRDBD dissociates. Calculating reaction parameters for UVR8 from first principles proved to be harder than expected: there are a number of consecutive chemical reactions involved in leading to a dissociated monomer, all of which we believe tend to occur on the same timescale. This clearly conflicts with an assumed 2-state model. As such, this would require an extensive photoinduction model, which is not possible at the moment, due to the exact number of reactions required not entirely known.
Another future improvement to be included will focus on improving the negative feedback part of the model. Currently this negative feedback from PABA is modelled with a Hill-like inhibition - in future this should be from first principles which will require more knowledge about how PABA UVB-absorption interferes with the receptor (UVR8) UV absorption. This might require a diffusion model of PABA when considering a layer model.

Ethical and Perceptual Issues
With Synthetic Bacterial Therapeutics
In order for synthetic biology to make valuable advances in medicine and biotechnology, progress must also be made on the bioethics front. Scientific progress solely for the sake of scientific progress is invaluable for increasing human knowledge, but as engineers, we must strive to make useful systems with the ultimate possibility of improving some aspect of life. This means that our engineered systems must comply with ethical and social norms. Although the development of new technologies in the laboratory is relatively independent of public opinion, the acceptance and integration of new technologies is largely dependent on public perception; a technology is useful only if it is used.
Scientific Risks
One of the biggest ethical concerns surrounding synthetic biology and genetically engineered bacteria centers on risk. Two major components of risk are biosafety, the impact of engineered organisms of human health and the environment and biosecurity, the potential for these engineered organisms to be used maliciously [1].
Biosafety
Almost all emerging biotechnologies carry an inherent risk to biosafety, especially at early and uncertain stages of development. This is especially true for synthetically engineered organisms.  Because the field is so nascent, many of the developments by synthetic biologists are cutting edge. Biologists are still studying and discovering new information about the basic rules governing biology. Many of the gene networks and biological mechanisms used by synthetic biologists are still being studied, with fundamental advancements being made every day. With information constantly changing as well as the inherently nondeterministic behavior of many biological systems, it's very difficult to rationally design engineered organisms that act exactly as anticipated. The Registry of Standard Biological Parts attempts to address the issue of uncertainty by classifying and characterizing modular biological components. However, biology is not modular; different proteins and genes interact with each other in still unknown ways.  While piece by piece assembly works extremely"

Conference of China iGEMer Committee(CCiC) and Meet up in Peking University
From August 14th to 15th, Conference of China iGEMer Committee (CCiC) was held in the School of Life Sciences, Peking University. 34 teams from all over China accepted our invitation, a markedly increase in the number as well as the kind of teams compared with the 1st CCIC held by HZAU, 2014 . More than 300 iGEMers have attended this year’s conference.
In the opening ceremony on August 14th, we invited two special guests, ZHANG Haoqian and LI Teng to give the keynote speech. Both of them are co-founders of BluePHA , an iGEM startup in China. More importantly, they are also the team leaders of Peking and Tsinghua iGEM 2010 team respectively. As predecessors in synthetic biology field, they shared their iGEM experiences, along with their opinions on the prospects of synthetic biology. Furthermore, they encouraged young scholars to study deeply in this area and fight for great achievements in the future.

CCIC Peking 2015 seek to establish a sustained platform for Chinese iGEM teams to communicate with each other.
With excellent and attractive presentation, all the teams get numerous responses from others, including suggestions on the thought of experiments, heated discussions on path design, and reflections on safety and application. All teams’posters were exhibited in the hall, to facilitate the idea exchange of participants in an open environment. In the tea break, team members could present their projects to other participants who had an interest, and this has aroused passionate discussions among them. Problems and solutions on experiments can be easily shared in front of a poster, with data and diagrams showed on it"

First UCSC collaboration meeting (over skype). Met to discuss potential routes of collaboration on the human practices frontier and for science. Due to strong overlap in our scope of work, we determined that we would be able to establish meaningful collaboration on the human practices frontier to help both teams. UCSC is also using Bacillus subtilis as an expression chassis, as is our team. We therefore planned to share materials, protocols, and experimental successes in the course of the summer to establish our collaboration.

Preliminary research was performed to identify non-sporulating, protease deficient, Bacillus subtilis strains for research use. Dr. Daniel Zeigler, from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center was contacted for more information on this. Dr. Zeigler recommended the following Bacillus strains, which we ended up using for our Bacillus studies.
B. subtilis K07 - BGSC Accession # 1A1134– Generated from the commonly used laboratory host PY79. This strain has all it's seven associated proteases knocked out and is free from antibiotic resistance or integrated plasmids. This strain does produce spores however.
B. subtilis PY79 - BGSC Accession # 1A747 - which is the wildtype strain of the K07 protease knockout. We are selecting this strain so we have a control for comparison.
B. subtilus spo0A3 - BGSC Accession # 1S1 - This strain comprises spo0A mutants, therefore they do not produce alkaline or neutral proteases (most abundant). They also do not sporulate. Wall-associated proteases are still present. This strain is the result of mutations in the Spo0A locus and have normal antibiotic sensitivities. Note that Spo0A have reduced genetic competence, so it may be advisable to use electroporation to transform them.

Part II: FAQ
Our adventure in Amsterdam made us realize how abstract our reflexion was. We decided then to deepen it in a more concrete way through this FAQ which was inspired by the very questions we were asked in The Netherlands.
Is it entirely impossible to patent an invention based on a public Part ?
First of all, we shall remind the patent granting requirements :
the novelty condition (i.e. the invention must be partially or totally new);
the non-obviousness condition (U.S. patent law) or the inventiveness condition (in European patent law);
the usefulness condition (U.S. patent law) or the industrial applicability condition (in European patent law).
Obviously, patenting public parts is impossible considering the first condition. However novel devices using public parts may be considered for protection through patents, depending on the degree of novelty carried by the device.
Could private actors like companies belong to and participate to a “synthetic biology commons” ?
Fact : companies can take part in a commons. Many companies (Small and Medium Enterprises as well as big companies) currently do make profits in the open source software industry. This opportunity is not confined to the software industry : the idea of an “open source biology” has also emerged. This movement, also referred to as “open access biology”, has appeared in bio-industries such as the pharmaceutical sector, in most cases to prevent other companies to patent their research. The SNP Consortium, founded in 1999, gathers 10 pharmaceutical companies which decided to release some of their data concerning the human genome in the public domain. A few other more recent examples, including Pfizer (2006), Novartis (2007) and Syngenta (2002), tend to show that sharing knowledge has become part of the economic strategies in biology (Henkel & Maurer, 2007).
Besides, such a sharing knowledge strategy allows companies to make good use of free resources, the validity of which has already been controlled by a (potentially) large community. Moreover, many business models may be designed (and have already been implemented to some extent), which are based on indirect profits, such as selling services for example.
More generally, the ability of a commons to create value mainly derives from its capacity to link together different kinds of actors (companies, scholars, hackers, etc.) pursuing different objectives : making profits, publishing, or more original motivations,"

Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Society#Questionnaire#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," shown in Graph 4.
Over 90% of respondents thought that iGEM did have an effect, and over 50% thought that the effect was significant. The reasons for this varied widely; the most popular included:
Research experience (often a decisive factor in whether or not the students subsequently pursued a career in academia) Developed lab skills (useful in their later career, and influential on their CV) Networking opportunities (many students are currently working as PhD students with their iGEM mentor as their supervisors, or in other iGEM labs which they got in contact with during the jamboree) Many students were inspired to work in synthetic biology later in their careers (see Graph 6 below) Students became more open-minded to working outside their specialist fields and with people from different disciplines (almost every respondent was new to synthetic biology when taking part)
Graph 5 also shows that 75% of respondents were performing research in academia at the time of completing the survey - participating in iGEM was commonly said to be a valuable experience that helped students to choose such a career path. Conversely, a couple of alumni also stated that their experience in iGEM helped them to decide not to go into research.
In addition, three alumni responding to our survey were co-founders of biotech startup companies (including Ginkgo Bioworks, www.diybio.org and Synbiota), all of which were related to synthetic biology, and cited participation in the iGEM competition as being crucial to their motivation for doing so.
We also asked more specifically about whether or not taking part in iGEM actually inspired further participation in synthetic biology (Graph 6), which is key to judging the success of the outreach aspect of iGEM.
Almost half of our respondents did place their work within the field of synthetic biology, which is a very promising statistic given that all but one were new to the field prior to participating in the competition. In addition, several non-biologists (e.g. engineers) switched into biological research in areas such as systems biology and bioinformatics which they did not term ‘synthetic biology’, but are arguably very closely related. Biology students now working in other biological fields have also stated that the lab skills learned during iGEM have been extremely useful in their current research.
A couple of notes to bear in mind - several of the respondents who stated that they were working in synthetic biology were studying PhDs in the field, and some are considering moving away from the field afterwards. It must also be considered that our sample could be quite biased, since iGEM alumni who enjoyed participating in i"

Description
a. The average transcription rate is about 50 nucleotide per second in E.coli. The transcription rate of each transcript is calculated according to their lengths.
b. The average translation rate is about 15 amino acids per second in E.coli. The translation rate of each protein is calculated according to their amino acid numbers.
c. The average half-life of mRNAs is set to 10 min. The degradation rate is calculated according to the half-life value.
d. The average half-life of proteins is set to 2 h. The degradation rate is calculated according to the half-life value.
e. There are no data about the degradation rate constant, kinetic parameters of hdnoR. Because hdnoR is homologous to TetR protein, so the parameters related to hdnoR is from the experiment data of TetR
f. We add SrrA tag to the end of GFP, so the degradation rate is 10 times faster than the normal condition.

We received new PCR primers for the dCas9 system and PCR Rescued them. We sent new Plasmid 1 colonies #1, #6, and #9 for sequencing and digested them with ClaI and SalI-HF for 10 hours (5 hour digestion with ClaI, 65 degrees C heat inactivation of ClaI, 5 hour digestion with SalI-HF). Ashlee ran the PCR products on a gel and 3/4 were successful. She digested dCas9 PCR with ClaI and XhoI restriction enzymes. She digested the backbones with phosphotase so they would not self-ligate, and ligated in the dCas9 system (16 hour ligation). Ashlee also used the new backbones to CBAR the old dCas9 PCR product, just to test whether our old dCas9 system was correct.

Plasmid with GFP(BBa_I13522) is resistant to AmpR and KanR and the other one with RFP (BBa_J04450) is resistant to AmpR and TetR. Both contain one restriction site for EcoRI and one for PstI. By just adding EcoRI we expected DNA to be linear whereas in tubes having both restriction enzymes we expected two pieces of DNA.
Add 1ul of loading buffer to each DNA sample to make the DNA heavier and centrifuge for one minute.
In the meantime, poor the agarose gel onto the tray, place the comb on the tray, and let the gel solidify.
After the centrifugation, place the DNA samples on ice
Prepare the lambda HindIII markers
Once the gel is ready, transfer the tray to the gel electrophoresis area
Fill with buffer

Start loading the lamba DNA ladder in Lane 1
Then load Lane 2 to 14
Finally load Lane 15 with the lamba DNA ladder
Set the voltage to 120 and run the gel electrophoresis
After 5mins, drop the voltage to 90V.
Because the DNA is negatively charged, this voltage moved the DNAs on the gel towards the positive side. We then looked at the DNAs on the gel by ultraviolet light.

Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#PS_-_-_TEXT.html," precipitated out polystyrene using a methanol wash, confirming that AIBN initiated polymerization of styrene to polystyrene works.
Conclusion
Polymerized Styrene
We successfully cloned all the genes for PAL, FDC, and UbiX into plasmids submitted as biobricks to the registry.  We purified our enzymes and confirmed the molecular weight on a SDS PAGE gel.  We tested PAL’s functionality in vitro, yielding quantitative information about the reaction velocity in the form of concentration curves that were used to determine reaction parameters. We used the Michaelis Menten equations to model our chemical pathway and make informed predictions about our specific enzymes and their influence on the overall pathway flux.  We used these predictions to design an operon of our genes that would yield the largest amount of styrene.  We used Gibson Assembly to create this operon in a plasmid.  We also refined procedures for extracting styrene as it is being produced bacterially and polymerize this styrene into polystyrene.
Some future work that could be done is in vivo testing of styrene production after transforming our operon containing plasmid into E. coli. Once styrene is identified, our extraction procedure would need to be carried out in order to isolate the styrene from the cell while maintaining non-toxic levels in the cell’s environment to allow the cells to continue producing styrene. Finally, our polymerization method would need to be applied to our isolated styrene and then our polystyrene would be ready for folding and property testing.
We showed that producing polystyrene from renewable sources using synthetic biology is possible!
Protocols
Device construction. Parts for this project were obtained from the 2015 Distribution Plates, ordered from the Registry, or synthesized by IDT. BioBricks assembly was used to construct the devices.
Transforming bacteria. Chemically competent DH5-alpha E. coli cells from New England Biolabs were used for all parts of this project. Plates containing successful transformants were stored at 4C.
Colony PCR. We often needed to verify the success of our transformations into E. coli. We performed PCRs on multiple colonies using the OneTaq polymerase from New England Biolabs.
Site Directed Mutagenesis. The native yeast sequence for FDC contains an SpeI restriction cut site at nucleotide position 999. We used Liu and Naismith’s technique for site-directed mutagenesis in order to change the codon to be compatible with BioBrick standards [3].

Team member selection
Every year after the giant jamboree or the regional final, the teams that had participated would then take the role of selecting qualified students to assemble the next year’s team. Due to the not-so-high cognition level of iGEM to Chinese high school students (first undergraduates), last year’s teams hosted an event to promote recognition of synthetic biology and the competition (on December 15th, 2017).
For the selection, a brief introduction of synthetic biology and iGEM was issued online through WeChat, and anyone interested in the competition could fill out an online form to apply. The primary purpose of the form was to testify the applicants’ enthusiasm and understanding on synthetic biology in case they establish an irrelevant project or give up mid-way. Upon collection of the application forms, previous team leaders sifted through the numerous forms and selected out the most earnest and qualified ones. The persons that have been selected out would face another round of interview to determine if their text were real.
In this way, it was made sure that the members selected had enough enthusiasm"

Historical praise to the frog as a martyr of science
The French historian of science Christine Blondel and physicist Bertrand Wolff wrote a historical praise to the frog on a popularization website devoted to the Ampere and the discovery of electricity.
This praise represent a kind of special attention that can developped concerning any model organism. Acknowledging the history of being is a way among others to recall our dependance on its existence, dependance requiring a special attention to its interests.
We present here a translation of their work :
The following sections are translated from Christine Blondel and Bertrand Wolff's historical praise to the frog .
"" The frog is kind-hearted…
Without it, would William Harvey discovered the blood flow? The cold-blooded animals like toads or frogs have a slow heart that is easier to analyze than mammals. It is by looking at them that Harvey made his first observations. In his work Motus Cordis, he assures that the blood is expulsed by the heart to the artery and goes by through the veins. “This is how I start to wonder if there was a circulatory move of the blood”. But, Harvey died before finding out what becomes to the blood between the arteries and the veins.
The lung devoted to Science…
Once again, we have to thank the frog for solving the enigma of the blood circulation. Observing under a microscope the lung of a frog, Marcello Malpighi noticed very thin blood vessels - the capillaries - that link the small arteries to the small veins.
In 1661, he wrote :
“Things are much easier to see with the frogs (…). The microscopic observation revealed things even more prodigious (…). I clearly saw that the blood got divided and circulated in tortuous vessels”
It is by crossing the lungs that the veins’ blood goes back to the arteries. But, to get this result, Malpighi admitted, even glorified himself:
“I have almost scarified the entire race of frogs, something that never happened before, even during the furious battle between rats and frogs described by Homer”.
… And sexual practices submit to scientists’ voyeurism.

Le gène de la protéine J est donc fusionné au niveau de l’extrémité 5’ avec le gène de la protéine de ciblage . La protéine qui en résulte, transcrite naturellement pendant la synthèse du vecteur cellulaire, est exprimée avec la même fréquence que la protéine native. De ce fait, lors de l’autoassemblage, le vecteur cellulaire possède la protéine de ciblage sur sa queue.
En fonction du type cellulaire cible, le ligand peut changer, mais l’emplacement reste le même. Le DVS est par conséquent modulable à de nombreuses pathologies.

L’internalisation du vecteur cellulaire et la libération du plasmide thérapeutique
Le ciblage du vecteur cellulaire est assuré par la protéine fixée sur la protéine J, en revanche pour l’internalisation et la sortie de l’endosome, la fixation à un ligand membranaire ne suffit pas. C’est pourquoi, le vecteur cellulaire possède une seconde protéine recombinée. Elle se trouve, cette fois-ci, sur une autre protéine, non de queue mais de tête, la protéine D.
Le bactériophage lambda sauvage possède à sa capside, la protéine D qui est chargée de stabiliser l’ensemble de la capside, comme vu précédemment. Etant exposée sur toute la surface externe de la capside, elle est une candidate idéale pour la fusion d’une protéine d’internalisation cellulaire.
La protéine D, lors de sa fixation à la capside, est organisée en trimère. Chaque monomère est distant de 5,1nm dans un trimère. La structure cristallographique de la protéine D sous sa forme trimérique montre que les extrémités, Nter et Cter, sont exposées à la surface de la capside et sont très proches les unes des autres.  Les deux extrémités Nter et Cter étant exposées à la surface de la capside mature, cela laisse le choix quant au placement de la protéine de fusion. Cependant des études menées en Nter"
Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Community_-_-_TEXT.html," it into a T or C increases sensitivity to differences in other bases upstream of the start codon. Cavener et al. (1991) on the other hand showed that yeast has a strong bias for A in this position. Because of this, protein-coding BioBricks would always require the direct fusion of a ribosome binding site upstream of the start codon in order for them to be usable within the context of the standard prefix and suffix. This, in turn, makes the use of non-BioBrick backbones difficult, as the promoters in these plasmids might already be suitable to clone a protein-coding sequence into them without any specific fusions. In addition, adaptation of E. coli biobricks for yeast, and variation in yeast ribosome binding sites, is made more difficult
Particularly with the DNA synthesis deal iGEM has had with IDT, and constantly lowering DNA synthesis costs, the importance of being able to obtain physical part copies from the registry is lower than ever before. For this reason, we find the requirements of the current assembly standard to be restrictive and limiting: assembling yeast biobricks with e.g. gBlock synthesis allows usage of the parts in much more suitable environments than the BioBricks context, which would require PCR modification.
Ultimately, we believe that the most important function of the parts registry is the sharing of information about different parts and their function, and increasing understanding of parts’ interaction to facilitate the predictable engineering of biological systems. This purpose is no longer served when the delivery of physical part copies becomes a priority and limitation in itself. The current requirements set limitations that prevent progression in the field of synthetic biology, as teams are discouraged from pushing into uncharted territory. Our team sees great potential in the use of yeast as a chassis in future projects, but current iGEM criteria set limitations to the convenience of its use.

Michigan,2017,Team:Michigan Software#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," lab. To address this, we have built a favorites system into ProtoCat, which allows users to signify a select set of ""favorite protocols"". Now, the PI only needs to update his favorites, and then when the students check the favorites section they'll find the new protocol.
Group Accounts
ProtoCat 3.0 enabled users have accounts, with which they can establish an identity in the ProtoCat community through uploading protocols, leaving comments, and rating other users' protocols. In ProtoCat 4.0, we've expanded these capabilities to include favorite protocols as well. However, what about organizations? Suppose we had the head of a lab who also works with a company? It would be difficult to separate the protocols just at the user level if the user simply favorites the protocols for his/her work; the distinction needs to be done at an organizational level. So, 'Group Accounts' were added to ProtoCat, allowing for favorite protocols at the lab (instead of individual researcher) level.
Improved Security
Security is important in any online domain; web security is especially important when dealing with sensitive information such as protocols. In addition, insecure websites can result in their users information being leaked. We have taken steps to ensure our site is safe and sescure, shown by our site receiving an A grade by SSL Lab's Server test, the results can be found at this link . These results are comparable to sites such as Google and Facebook . To get maximum security, we would need to disable encryption methods used by older browsers and disallow them from accessing ProtoCat; we opted for a wider audience at the cost of a marginal security increase.
Other Improvements
In addition to the above changes, we have also improved our searching service, our server infrastructure, as well as our internal team structure. ProtoCat now searches more fields when retrieving protocols, in order to make finding the relevant ones more effective. We have also improved our ProtoCat server, switching to a more scalable infrastructure. Lastly, we have adopted pair programming techniques in order to ensure that as our current members graduate and move on, that the knowledge of how ProtoCat works is not lost.

Our team also participated in a survey run by TU Munich and received a collaboration medal from their team (shown below). Check out their wiki .
Overview
As representatives of the iGEM and synthetic biology communities, our team aims to serve as a positive influence locally and globally. We recognize significant broad impacts of our 2012 iGEM research project, both for fundamental advances in synthetic biology research and also for potential therapeutic applications stemming from our novel technology. Furthermore, we aim to promote a wider understanding of the synthetic biology field within the local and global communities and have organized several outreach and educational programs to accomplish this goal. Finally, we understand the importance of collaboration within the scientific community as a means of progress and have thus worked closely with fellow iGEM teams to foster positive connections and provide valuable assistance on their research projects.
To promote understanding of synthetic biology, as a team we taught our favorite topics in synthetic biology to middle and high school students in the Boston area this year. We formulated plans for international iGEM outreach in Tel Aviv, and we are designing a course on synthetic biology lab techniques to teach at MIT in January. Lastly, we participated in a New England regional iGEM meet-up (NEGEM) with the Boston University, Wellesley and Stanford-Brown iGEM teams and have formally collaborated with fellow iGEM teams by testing their software.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Receptors_-_-_TEXT.html," an instable, highly excited intermediate under the consumption of energy. This high-energy intermediate then spontaneously falls back into a state of lower energy, emitting the energetical difference as visible light. While mainly being used as a folded, stabilizing element at the N-terminus for the construct containing the biotin acceptor peptide, the nanoluciferase could also be used for advanced binding studies via luciferase assays. [12]

Figure 5: Reaction scheme of the reaction catalyzed by the NanoLuc nanoluciferase. Taken from the [ https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/protocols/technical-manuals/101/nanoglo-luciferase-assay-system-protocol.pdf NanoGlo Assay Kit manual.
Luciferases have also found their way into biotechnological applications. [13] The simplistic concept of creating visible (and thus easily measurable) light makes luciferases ideal reporters for the expression of secretable proteins via a corresponding assay. This project also made use of a luciferase for the determination of expression levels of the BAP surface receptor while providing a stable and folded domain at the N-terminus, as well as having been used for the choice of signal peptide. The monomeric luciferase used in this project, the so-called ’NanoLuc™' [14] (due to terms of simplicity referred to as ’nanoluciferase’ in the following), can be fused to other proteins in order to make their expression visible and quantifiable. This engineered luciferase emits a steady, easily detectable glow when exposed to its substrate, while being only 19 kDa large and being brighter, more specific and steadier than other luciferases commonly found in nature. Using luciferases for the quantification of expression levels offers several advantages over fluorescent proteins, including higher sensitivity and smaller size.
CMV promoter
Last but not least, high expression levels of the receptor, so that a high avidity for the interaction may be reached. The CMV promoter (taken from the parts registry, BBa_K74709 ) therefore enables constitutively high expression of the receptor - and, in the case of the BAP-construct, the biotin ligase BirA.

Our overall project can be broken down into four sub-projects. These are characterized as the following: Mycelium Material & Habitat Development, Mycelium Glue Project, Mycelium Filter Project, and finally the Mission Architecture that ties everything together. Below are the descriptions corresponding to each subproject.
To view the Experiments and Methods that correspond to the Project Descriptions below, please see our Experiments page linked here.
Mycelium Material & Habitat Development
Mycelium is the vegetative structure of a fungus, and is analogous to the root system of most plants. It is able to branch out and fill in the gaps of various materials and substrates in the goal of gaining as much nutrients as possible. Because of its unique properties and its ability to grow into virtually any mold if there are sufficient nutrients, the use of mycelium has been on the rise. With the goal of creating Martian and Lunar habitats at a reduced cost, the following research has been framed with several off-planet considerations in mind. The optimal conditions for mycelia growth on various substrates were investigated; both for on and off planet applications.
Fungal species used
The primary species of fungus that has been used in the Stanford-Brown-RISD lab is Ganoderma lucidum, unless otherwise noted. G. lucidum was chosen as advised by PhD Candidate Rolando Perez, of the Drew Endy Lab at Stanford University. Perez noted that of the numerous species of fungus he has worked with, G. lucidum has by far produced the strongest mycelium materials, and grows at the quickest rate. Perez and his lab provided the Stanford-Brown-RISD Team with the initial G. lucidum plate of mycelia as well as a live fungal culture to initiate the team’s own mycelium production.
We also obtained wild type Aspergillus oryzae (Fungal Genetics Stock Collection, catalog number FGSC #A815) because of its ease of genetic engineering. This was also a result of our collaboration with the 2018 DTU i"

Description
Overview and Introduction
Microfluidics is a scientific field that exists at the intersection of the fields of engineering, physics, chemistry and biotechnology. It deals with the manipulation of microliter volumes of liquids which are processed on devices called microfluidic chips. As a result, microfluidics allows complex protocols and procedures to be performed on chips. There are a variety of different types of microfluidic chips in existence. For example, digital, paper and centrifugal microfluidic chips are all in use today. MARS focuses on continuous flow microfluidics fabricated from polycarbonate and PDMS.
Currently, members of the synthetic biology community are equally, if not more, occupied with running their experiments than thinking about new innovative ideas. The implementation of microfluidics devices are one of the possible solutions to this problem.  The main benefits of using microfluidics are that they are automated and efficient.  Since microfluidics devices operate on such a small scale each experiment can yield high throughput data, all while reducing the cost of expensive reagents.  Addtionally, they are run using programmable hardware, meaning researchers can acquire consistent data each time an experiment is run.  So these points bring about a very important question; Why are microfluidics not being utilized in every synthetic biology experiment?
Problem Statement
If a synthetic biologist would like to use microfluidics in their lab, they would follow the traditional design and manufacture workflow. This consists of three general stages divided into:
Design
Manufacture
Implementation
Designing, manufacturing and using a microfluidic device  requires significant knowledge investment in topics such as the basics of fluid dynamics and specialized software such Adobe Illustrator. If a synthetic biologist does not want to design their own chip, they can search through published literature. However, these devices are often highly specialized and not useful for the average synbio researcher. After either designing their own chip, or selecting a published microfluidic, they would begin the time consuming process of designing and modeling their chip  using Comsol. Once the design is finalized, they can move on to the manufacturing stage of the workflow. Most microfluidic fabrications methods, such as soft lithography, require"

The Purpose of ZJU-IGEM Team
    The initiative that we participate in the iGem competition is simple. Because it was a great pleasure when everybody with their creative imagination, come up with the distinctive ideas in the Brain-storm session and then stands at a unique position to understand and accomplish the project. Such unique pleasure may not be easily discovered when we were sitting in classroom learning the specific subjects or doing research in the lab. Because iGEM competition encourages the multi-discipline cooperation, it impels our team to summon team members from different discipline like biology, chemistry, mathematics, software, automation with their different perspectives. As scientists and researchers these days tends to work in the more and more specialized field which leads to isolation and estrangement. We realize that iGem competition could be a precious opportunity to set-up the cooperative relationship between all the young iGEMers. Moreover, it encourage us to jump out off the intrinsic perception set by our major to listen to others opinion, similar as perspective taking in scientific research. And innovative idea may be come up with during this alternatively position changing process. More importantly, iGEM competition provides us a unique experience to play crucial roles in the booming synthetic biology realm. Since this filed is still new and booming, we could play roles as questioners, operators, biobrick producers, biobrick end-users, policy makers and even judgers. This particular character of IGEM competition leads us to pay more attention not only in terms of mere scientific research, but also we need to set up a big picture of synthetic biology in our minds, we must consider the social implication of synthetic biology and particularly our project, and to dig it even deeper, we need to enquire the philosophical significance of them.
The Aim of Human Practice Project
    Synthetic biology has become a popular concept in recent years, it appears on the newspaper, magazines and other medias frequently. The reason why synthetic biology catches so many attentions from the public is that few other scientific concepts could match the simplicity and scope of this concept. Synthetic biology poses a brilliant example of giving the public a big picture so that"
The_Citadel-Charleston,2010,Team:The Citadel-Charleston#ProjectOverview_-_-_TEXT.html," our device to achieve the  desired result, population capping, and variation of which tuner is used will  yield different limits.  The higher the  PoPS requirement of the sensitivity tuner used, the larger a colony can grow  before the countermeasure (the production of a cell poison) is engaged.  Once the sensitivity tuner's activator is  synthesized, translation of the downstream regions of the circuit begins.  The poison gene CcdB (P1010) has been selected  to balance the increasing number of engineered cells due to replication.  Once the requirement set by the sensitivity  tuner has been met, cells begin to produce poison, preventing the colony's  growth.  Thus, the team can ensure a  strict limit to the amount of PYY3-36 produced.       
Successes and Failures
     The Citadel team has succeeded in  formulating a system for the expression and regulation of PYY3-36 in E.coli.  We have designed a  Biobrick part (K373000) that encodes the protein of interest.  This part has been been ordered synthesized,  and will be made available in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Due to time constraints and the natural  hurdles encountered by a group of undergraduate students and professors new to  biological engineering and the iGEM competition, The Citadel team has not yet  been able to characterize the Biobrick parts it has built.  We hope to continue this work in the future  or to inspire others to continue researching PYY3-36.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Application scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," screening uses a lighted tube with a camera to examine the rectum and sigmoid colon. With a small biopsy tool, samples of tissue can be collected for further examination. Patients need to empty their bowel completely for the screening and therefore patients cannot eat solid food for several days beforehand to ensure accurate results. This manner of screening is invasive for patients and thus not preferred if it is not necessary [5] . Thirdly, a colonoscopy can be executed to detect and immediately remove precancerous polyps. A thin, flexible tube with a camera is used to examine the colon (large intestines) and the lower part of the small intestines. The only difference with a sigmoidoscopy and the benefit of a colonoscopy is that it can inspect the whole colon instead of only a small part [6] . Even though the colonoscopy is currently the most accurate and used screening method, patients often need to be sedated and before the test they need to empty the colon which means no solid food and taking laxatives for several days.
Inflammatory diseases: Crohn’s disease and Colitis
In both Crohn’s disease and Colitis, inflammations occur along the gastro-intestinal tract. The causes for these diseases are still unclear; however, it seems that it is triggered by an oversensitive or damaged immune system. Therefore these diseases belong to the immune mediated diseases, which means the body isn’t attacking its own substances but it’s triggered by external factors. For both diseases, first a physical examination is performed to see whether patients have the corresponding symptoms, such as blood in the stool. Afterwards, lab tests are performed to check for signs of inflammations and infections, for example to check white blood cells or blood protein levels. Then the decisive method is a colonoscopy and CT scans from the abdomen [7] [8] . The disadvantage of diagnosing these inflammatory diseases is that there is no one single technique that gives a correct diagnosis, but the combination of multiple methods is needed for an accurate result.
Future application: COMBs
Seen the problems with the current diagnostic tools, an accurate, non-invasive and early detecting sensor is needed. This can be realized by finding the right biomarkers. Currently the medical world is in search for a detecting mechanism that can sense human hemoglobin in the intestines. Blood’s main component is hemoglobin; therefore it is a crucial biomarker for various abnormalities in the intestines, such as colon cancer, Crohn’s disease, etc. However, human hemoglobin is a biomarker for diverse irregularities in the intestines, whereby still follow-up research has to be"

To prove that the additional luxG gene can increase luminescence, we conducted experimental tests to compare the relative luminescence of the bacteria with each plasmid under a 0.1M concentration of arabinose, which we have determined from previous characterizations of part BBa_K325909 will result in the brightest light. The bacteria were grown in 37℃ overnight before being taken out and put into a 29℃ shaking incubator over the course of the measurements. Part BBa_K325909 is abbreviated 4L and Part BBa_K2836002 is abbreviated 2G.
As shown from the graphs above, when induced with 0.1M arabinose, part BBa_K2836002 consistently showed an higher level of relative luminescence when compared to part BBa_K325909 over the course of five hours, thus affirming the fact that the additional luxG gene does increase light production in bioluminescent bacteria.
