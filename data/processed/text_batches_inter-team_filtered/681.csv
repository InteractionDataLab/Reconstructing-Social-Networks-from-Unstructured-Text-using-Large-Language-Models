Featured Composite Part:
TetR-TetO-OmpA ( BBa_K2170141 ):
The experimental controle over the gene expression of a specific gene can be essential when you are working with microorganisms. This is the reason why we tested the BioBrick BBa_I739001 of ETHZ 2007 for functionality and added a tetracycline operator as well as an OmpA signal peptide, which imparts the SEC-dependent secretion of the downstream protein. The construct was tested using a testing device BBa_K2170053 whose secretion efficiency could be tested by NanoGlo assay.
Biotinylated receptor with BAP ( BBa_K2170000 )
Our BioBrick BBa_K2170000 contains an eucaryotic receptor construct with an biotin acceptor peptide, which, after expression in an eucaryotic cell, imparts the binding of streptavidin on the cell surface. This constucts makes it possible to link cells with a biotin binding protein and by this makes the printing of tissue without scaffold even possible.
Biotin binding receptor with eMA ( BBa_K2170001 )
Our BioBrick BBa_K2170001 contains an eucaryotic receptor construct with enhanced monomeric avidin, which, after expression in an eucaryotic cell, imparts the binding of biotin on the cell surface. This constucts makes it possible to link cells over a biotinylated protein linker and by this makes the printing of tissue without scaffold even possible.
Biotin binding receptor with scAvidin ( BBa_K2170002 )
Our BioBrick BBa_K2170002 contain an eucaryotic biotin binding receptor with the tetrameric biotin binding protein single chain avidin. As it's sibling BioBrick BBa_K2170001 it imparts the"
Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Daily Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," All samples sent using F1 and R2 primers. These primers anneal in the backbone and are thus non specific to any GFP. Transformed cells with original pFTV to create a cryo stock.
Wednesday, July 23, 2014
Ashlee and Emily presented to the teachers for the Center for the Science and the Schools early in the morning.  The presentation was an hour long and was great practice for the Giant Jamboree.  Videos and pictures can be found on the Human Practices page.  Only ligation products with the backbone #6 grew - sequencing results arrived and luckily #6 was the only correct plasmid. #1 and #9 both had point mutations. We picked 8 ligation colonies to be plasmid prepared and sent for sequencing tomorrow. #6 and #9 CBA colonies grew and we picked 3 colonies from #6, as it was the only correct backbone.
Made Cm plates.Created cryo stock of original pFTV cells.
Thursday, July 24, 2014
8 ligation colonies were plasmid prepared and sent for sequencing, along with three CBA colonies from plasmid #6. Met with Dr. Richard to discuss project updates, practice jamborees, and future deadlines for iGEM.
iGEM meeting to discuss all of the updates for our projects and to talk about potential practice jamborees with other schools. Observed colonies on plate with cells transformed using original pFTV. Brainstormed ideas for Science U presentation, Sam began developing a ""Central Dogma Relay Race"". Annealed oligos containing the dRBS. Inoculated cultures with cells from each streak of cells shown to display correct bands, in anticipation that sequencing results will show at least some of them are correct.
Friday, July 25, 2014
Ashlee and Emily left on vacations.
Cleaned up annealed oligos that cooled overnight. Analyzed sequencing results from Tuesday. G1.4 has no insert. G1.6 has common GFP, possibly with a point mutation. G2.1 has a definite mutation. G2.3 appears correct, has common GFP, but should sequence one more time. G3.1 and G3.3 have fast GFP, should be sequenced again. G4.1 has some garbled insert, G4.4 also has common GFP. G5.3 has no insert. G5.4 has slow insertion time GFP (correct. Should be sequenced again). All reactions with R2 primer failed. This primer anne"

List of ""broken"" parts
Lysis device
K098995 : 6 nt missing between RBS and the cI repressor possibly leading to a diminished expression (not tested.)
We are trying to insert the 6 nt and test the part again.
K112022 : Sequencing with VF primer did not work, digest shows unwanted pattern
K124014 : has several issues:
it’s not the holin 105 gene but it resembles part K124017
There are two AA exchange mutations in the holin 105 gene compared to the sequence submitted for K124017 .
The wrong prefix was used what will finally lead to a RBS-ATG distance of 8 instead of 6 nucleotides
The overall structure of the submitted sequence is likely the amplified original lysis gen cluster of the bacteriophage lambda without any modifications. We try to utilize it for our experiments, maybe we need to change the prefix, doing it by simply amplifying it with the correct prefix and re-clone it into pSB1C3
Light receptors
M30109 : The composite (red light receptor) is simply not what it should be.
Only the gene for chp8 is present in the plasmid, as already outlined in the experience page.
I15010 : should have been the original chp8 gen, but sequence is completely …
K360121 : the LOVTap (blue light receptor) and it derivatives were not send from the registry
They were kindly provided by Dr. Chris E. French (University of Edinburgh).
K360051 : CcaS (green light receptor) is not yet available from the registry.
We are trying to build the green light response cascade from the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genomic DNA.

Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to meet these people and talk over their fears and expectations and orientate our project accordingly. We conducted interviews with manufacturers and created surveys for both professionals and end-users. We also compared our visions of biotechnologies with those of fellow iGEMers from different continents. A very important point was to talk with experts about what we intended to do. Cerberus is a blend of chemistry and synthetic biology so these discussions were absolutely necessary for the project design. Last but not least, we created an ethical matrix to define how our project could impact society and the environment. Clearly, the IHP was not a subtask of the Cerberus Project but the main reason of its success.

INTERVIEWS
We first investigated how manufacturers that could potentially incorporate the Cerberus technology felt about our project. We chose two different companies: 1083, a jeans producer, and Prodhex, a bandage producer. Interestingly, they both highlighted some suspicions about biotechnologies, but these suspicions were secondary as long as biotechnologies can bring innovations, improve product sustainability or have a lesser impact on the environment. These were important aspects for us to take into consideration for the Cerberus project
OUR APPROACH
We chose to conduct interviews in order to discuss their work, our project and biotechnologies freely.
INTERVIEWS SYNTHESIS
1083 Interview
David Leromain, Innovation Manager, August 13th 2018
Presentation of the 1083 Company
1083 is a trademark of the company Novetex. It was founded in 2007 by a computer                                 manager who wanted to cange direction and focus on the sale of ecological clothing. The founder                                 wanted to create his own business. He chose jeans because of the universality of this garment                                 (beyond nationalities, religions, ages, etc). Jeans are also linked to French industry with                                 the original Nîmes canvas. 1083 then diversified by offering sneakers, bermudas, skirts and shorts.                                 The question of what was possible to do in France then arose. A first consideration was                                 the economy. Many companies in the textile industry use a large number of subcontractors,                                 which entails considerable additional costs. 1083 minimizes the number of intermediaries                                 (manufacturers, brand and reseller) by turning toward a traditional eco                                 responsible economic model, and French manufacturing.
Current operation
Jeans are complex products that are produced in several stages: cotton harvesting,                                 spinning, dyeing, weaving"

This is my second year as a science teacher at CCA, and I have taught biology, chemistry, and marine biology in the classroom for 8 years.  I love being a part of the Raven family and look forward to settling in further. My primary goal as a science teacher is for all students (no matter the subject) to expand their SCIENCE skills (scientific reading/writing, practical lab skills, observation, inference, etc) through the avenue of the subject at hand.  Anyone in this era of Google has the ability to look up pieces of biology or chemistry information easily on the internet, but many people are deficient in their ability to analyze the information and the credibility of scientific knowledge that they have access to on the web or in the news.  Secondarily, students will leave my mentorship with knowledge of the subject that will serve as a strong foundation for success in AP science courses, college courses, standardized science tests, or the workplace."

Collaborations with NJU_CHINA
In this year’s collaboration, NJU_china helped us to test the microRNA binding ability of miRNA binding sequences. They constructed a dual-luciferase miRNA target expression plasmid with their vector and our miRNA target sequences. Then they transfected the purified plasmids into cells and verify their functions.
In return, we performed nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to have a more precise determination of the quantity and size of secreted exosomes. Extracellular vesicles, as nanoparticles, can be automatically tracked and sized based on Brownian motion and the diffusion coefficient. We measured the Nanosight enabled quantification and size determination of the extracellular vesicles in our experiment. The result we got from nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) can help NJU_china ascertain the relationship between protein concentration and exosomes quantity. Their acknowledgement to our contribution can be found in their wiki pages ( https://2017.igem.org/Team:NJU-China/Collaborations ).

At the Giant Jamboree, we received a gold medal and an Interlab Study Award. We also won the Overgrad Best Parts Collection.
Background
Synthetic biology is the approach for creating innovative bio-molecular systems in a fast, reliable and systematic way. The overall aim is to enable the combination of known, well-characterised elements into novel constructs. The field is growing and has many applications as illustrated by the many tracks of the iGEM competition, currently counting 15 tracks in total. Being able to develop creative biological systems with new functions requires a large toolbox consisting of standardised methods and characterised parts. Implementing synthetic biology products in the real world requires both scientific and public acceptance of the constructs themselves as well as the methods used to create them.
At the 2014 DTU iGEM team we have worked dedicatedly on developing an easy, precise and reliable method for absolute measurement of the activity of one of the most essential bio-molecular parts: the genetic promoter. The most important piece of information when characterising promoters is their ability to initiate transcription under various conditions. To characterise a promoter, it is therefore necessary to assess its activity, i.e. the rate at which transcripts are produced. The preferred indicator of activity has so far been based on relative measurements of reporter proteins transcribed from different promoters, natural as well as synthetic. This method requires that an arbitrarily chosen promoter is used as reference, and as long as the relative activities remain the same it is impossible to determine whether a generally low or high level of transcription is observed.
Using absolute measurements of promoter activity, it would be possible to detect these variations, and it would allow indepently performed measurements, e.g. from different labs, to be compared much more easily.
In order to perform absolute measurements, a suitable unit of activity is required. Polymerases per Second (PoPS) is a measure of the number of RNA polymerases that pass a specific point on DNA per second. We have worked towards developing a method to measure promoter activity in PoPS. Achie"

Polynomial features
original logistic regression is limited to linear situation, however, our problem is a nonlinear one. Polynomial features can help to make the decision boundary more complex that can fit the training sample better.
(1)Feature extraction
BLAST output provides more than 10 parameters, but not all of them are important for similarity screening, such as sites and sequence length. At the same time, some of the parameters are closely related to each other, so the features used for training don’t need to contain all of them.
To select features with high information content, we used JS divergence(Jensen-Shannon divergence). JS divergence is a method to measure the similarity of two probability distributions.
Fig.3.Relationship between JS divergence and similarity
We divided the continuous numerical features into discrete segments, and the frequencies in which the different segments appear in the positive and negative samples were taken as the corresponding probabilities, and calculated the JS divergence. The greater the JS divergence of the feature, the greater the impact on the classification result, in other words, the more important the feature is. We arranged all features in descending order of JS divergence values. The result is as follow:
Table.2.JS divergence of BLAST parameters
Finally, according to the JS divergence order, the correlation between features and the specific requirements of screening, the following three parameters are selected:

SAFETY & PROTOCOLS
Project Overview:
Human practice issues motivated our project and have informed its design every step of the way. We realized early on that if we wanted to promote responsible chemical use, we had to go about the issue responsibly ourselves. This meant making a concerted effort to understand the complexities of the issue, learning from the past and present in developing a viable solution for the future, and assessing the implications of our proposed solution.
After identifying public awareness as an effective catalyst for change, we researched civic engagement initiatives and identified that successful civic engagement measures fostered a sense of individual and collective responsibility and provided a sense of agency that's grounded in reality. We were particularly inspired by Greg Neimeyer’s Black Cloud initiative, which effectively inspired a new cohort of environmental stewards at L.A.'s Manual Arts High School. As a result, we identified high school students as a potential audience and a lesson plan as a viable medium for promoting responsible chemical use. To instill a sense of agency, we wanted to engage students in a hands on activity; however, current methods of detection are not well suited for a classroom environment. GCMS has a cost prohibitive capital cost and even ELISAs at $7.50/sample begin to add up for a class of thirty students. What we needed was a tool that could rival current methods of detection in both sensitivity and cost. This need motivated our wetlab effort in developing a reliable and cost effective triclosan biosensor that could be used in conjunction with our lesson plan to raise awareness and accountability around triclosan use.
We then took a step back to assess the possible implications of our lesson plan. We harkened back to Bruce Hammock’s warning about playing into consumer fears and Arlene Blum’s sentiment about the futile cycle of replacing one toxic chemical with another. Cognizant of these two points, we developed an “antimicrobial awareness app” to extend our solution more broadly.
In summary, we realized that in order to effectively engage students in the dialogue regarding chemical use, we needed to develop a biosensor that students could use to monitor environmental levels of triclosan (nanomolar levels). Given school budget constraints we needed to drive the cost of our system (both capital cost and per sample) down. We needed a user friendly device. And lastly, we wanted to extend the scope of our solution to more than just one chemical and more than just students.
To achieve our goals, we pursued"

It is                         given by our experimental data that \(\theta\) is generally optimal between 0.05 and 0.1. Let                         \(b=\frac{K_a}{K_d}\), we can get the relationship:
$$[A]=C_1exp[-K_a(1-\theta)[M_0]t]+\frac{\theta}{b(1-\theta)}$$
In this way we can get the relationship between the residual concentration of the added antigen                         and the reaction time (4):
$$[A]=C_1exp[mt]+n\tag{4}$$
Thus, from the relationship we can predict the relationship between the residual antigen                         concentration and time, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b).

Combined with formula (2) inside the grayscale model content, we can obtain the following                         relationship (5), the relationship between antigen fixed time and gray value. As shown in Fig.                         3.

It can be concluded that the reaction can be stopped by 90% or 80% of the reaction, because it is                         uneconomical to continue the reaction. At the same time, for the initial antigen concentration                         change, the initial large reaction starts to be fast, while the initial value is small, the                         reaction rate starts to be small; at the same time, the optimum reaction time for the different                         concentrations of the added antigen is about the same, and has little relationship with the                         concentration. Finally, there is a clear relationship between the fixed time of the antigen and                         the gray value.

Again, the fluorescence levels observed for the POmpR-RFP reporter system on the low copy vector were distinctly lower than for the high copy vector.
All things considered, the OmpR-regulated promoter was found to exhibit leaky expression comparable to the expression levels mediated by the constitutive promoters. When cloned into a low copy vector, the leaky expression was reduced prominently. Thus, to obtain proper regulation of RelE expression by the OmpR-dependent promoter, a low copy vector is required.
Transposon Hotspot Formation in LacI-Regulated lambda pL Hybrid Promoter Reporter System
During cloning, formation of a transposon hotspot between the LacI-regulated lambda pL hybrid promoter and a reporter system was observed, making this promoter inapt for the dormancy system
To control the gene expression of RelB, the LacI-regulated lambda pL hybrid promoter, BBa_R0011 , was chosen. Due to a putative formation of a transposon hotspot between the promoter sequence and the GFP reporter, which is described further here, another inducible promoter was chosen to regulate the expression of RelB.
Induction and Subsequent Inhibition of the pBAD Promoter
Expression by the pBAD promoter can be regulated tightly by induction and subsequent inhibition.
The pBAD promoter holds great potential to regulate the expression of the relB gene in our system, as it is capable of both an induction and repression. The HKUST-Rice iGEM team from 2015 found that the pBAD promoter exhibits an almost all-or-none behaviour upon induction with arabinose when located on a high copy vector, but allows for gradual induction when cloned into a low copy vector. Thus, it was evident that this promoter on a high copy vector would be inappropriate for the regulation of RelB expression. Based on these findings, a low copy vector was used to investigate the ability to inhibit gene expression subsequent to induction of pBAD.
RelB expression was simulated by fluorescence microscopy using a pBAD-YFP reporter system, BBa_I6058 . For this purpose, an Olympus IX83 with a photometrics prime camera was used, set to an excitation at 470 nm, emission at 515-560 nm, and exposure time at 150 ms. Transformed E. coli MG1655 cells were cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and 30 µg/mL chloramphenicol, to avoid catabolite repression from glucose residues"

Cry for Mosquitoes: A New Way to Control Mosquitoes by Synthesis Biology
Abstract:   In 2016, we focused on to control mosquitoes. We cloned various Cry and Cyt toxin genes from LLP29, Bacillus thuringiensis strain. We also constructed Cry and Cyt toxin parts based on option optimization of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Meanwhile, we built toxin groups express device based on 2A peptide system. And we tested their toxicity to the larvae of various genus of mosquitoes under the safe lab environment. Considering the potential problems in the natural environment, BNU-China and ZJU-China helped us to build the growth and toxicity model to estimate the natural conditions. To introduce the practical knowledge about how to prevent and control mosquitoes, we designed a handbook covering this topic and sent it to Zambia to help local people who are trouble in mosquitoes. We are proud of our project! 
1.Introduction
Mosquitoes are one of the most harmful insects in the world because they bite animals and human and spread virus. How to control mosquitoes in an efficient, green and cheap way has been a worldwide problem. This year, FAFU-CHINA iGEM team decide to start with the food source to control the amount of mosquitoes.
According to preliminary researches about physiological characters of mosquitoes larvae.  They feed on algae, plankton, fungi and bacteria and other microorganisms. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt.) is a Gram-positive bacterium which commonly used as biological pesticide. Based on the previous research in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, LLP29 is a bacterial Bt. which isolated from the natural environment in Mountain Wuyi. LLP29 has been proved the specific and efficient toxicity to Mosquitoes larvae by bioassay. But the Bt. owns fatal weakness that they cannot live"

Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With"

In this view, according to Rollin, scientists have forgotten that there might be a duty to engage with the society, since ultimately the products of science tend to be shared within them and not exclusively with the scientific community. Rollin identifies three key components of this “scientific ideology” which make a lot easier to understand our current situation:
a) There is a “value free” science, influenced by the logical positivism mentioned above.
b) Part of this positivism has led to the reductionism we have experienced within the last years, neglecting social sciences and favoring chemical, physical and mathematical explanations.
c) While neglecting social sciences, we are neglecting historical and philosophical lessons that might shed light onto many of the ethical, legal, and social issues we face in sciences nowadays.
What we can do, and what we did
Our Human Practices approach this year wants to take into account these criticisms against the scientific community and its observed ideology. Our main goal is to produce a meaningful interaction with members of society, making an honest correspondence between them and us, in order to find the best way to create a significant and long-lasting interaction. We understand that the scientific community isn’t a detached part of society, but we also live in society and anything that is done within our labs might have an effect on society and therefore in us. We wanted to recuperate this bond with other people to address their concerns and expectations in a meaningful manner. We acknowledge and applaud previous attempts to integrate the social and ethical spheres of synthetic biology, as done a few years ago by the Paris team of 2009 . Their work has proven to be one of the most comprehensive discussions of the ethical and societal issues posed by Synthetic Biology within iGEM. Nevertheless, this bibliographical analysis of arguments and its subsequent discussion between scientists seems to us as an incomplete approach, albeit an excellent parting point. Who holds those beliefs and why? Are these the views of society? Are there any other concerns we should know about?
Science communication has proven to be a powerful tool to share breakthrough knowledge among the general public. We've found that conferences and visits to schools are the most common approaches to communicate science among iGEM teams. Previous iGEM teams from our University have shown that this model can and does help to achieve a change in public perception of scientific concepts, as proven as our fellow iGEMers from UNAM Genomics two years ago with their survey before and after their talk. But, what did our colleagues learnt about the most intimate fears, expectations and"

Collaboration
This year, we have carried out several collaborations with other iGEM teams. As a Health and Medicine team we have contacted the UCL iGEM team and had a quite interesting conversation about the difficulty and our experiences of presenting a Health and Medicine project, especially at safety and ethics section of the project. After asking questions about their aspects of safety&ethics, we mentioned our way to outgo these problems: With the creating of a platform, called as Virtual Hospital, where we can be more imaginary and feel like our projects can be applied to today's medical approaches. (Visit P&P to learn more about the Virtual Hospital). The UCL iGEM team accepted this suggestion and mentioned, that they want to join our virtual hospital.
Also we mentored the AUC Turkey iGEM High School team this year and guided them during their experiments to increase their possibility of achieving their set goals.

The
University of Pavia
was founded in 1361 and it is indeed one of the most ancient universities in Europe. About 22.000 students follow the courses in Pavia at the 9 departments: economics, pharmacy, law, engineering, humanities, medicine, music, sciences and politics.
Pavia is famous for the colleges, which are a quite unique feature of this university city. Merit-based colleges are: the Ghislieri College, the Borromeo College, the Nuovo College and the Santa Caterina College, while pubblic colleges belongs to the EDiSU. We have fun with sport events and all colleges have their own traditions.
Selected students in Pavia can take classes also at the IUSS (Institute for Advanced Studies), shaped according to the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa model, reunites all the colleges of the Pavia Study System.
Moreover our university has a rich historical background in sciences, for example:
Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729–1799) biologist. He performed the first artificial insemination, he studied the digestion, the spontaneous generation and the movement of bats in complete darkness.
Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) professor of physics. He invented the so-called voltaic pile (an early electric battery).
Antonio Scarpa (1752–1832) physician and expert of anatomy. His head is preserved in formaline in the museum of the university.
Camillo Golgi (1843–1926) scientist and physician. He got the Nobel prize for the ""black reaction"" (to stain neurons) in 1906 and he discovered the Golgi apparatus of the cells!!!
Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza (1922-) population genetist. He studies human migrations through genetics, combining linguistic, cultural and archaeological data. Now he lives in Stanford.

IUSS-Pavia, the Institute for Advanced Study of Pavia, is the last step of a long lasting higher education process started on 825 when King Lotharius appointed Pavia, the ancient capital of the Lombard kingdom, as the site for higher education of his kingdom.  This process went through the foundation in 1361 by Emperor Charles IV of the Studium Generale later on named University of Pavia.  The first Colleges for university students were established"

Figure 12. Biosynthetic AND gate’s Plasmid 1. Upon induction with IPTG, the gene cI is transcribed but the Lock3c (biobrick) traps the RBS avoiding the expression of cI. cI will induce the expression of GFP in the plasmid 2.
Due to the lack of information on siRNA, the enormous advantage and information of riboregulators and the previous works of Isaacs F. 2004 , Berkeley iGEM 2006 , Caltech iGEM 2007 and Peking iGEM 2007 , the riboregulator approach were selected. The construction of the plasmids is shown in figures 12 and 13.

At these motifs, synonymous codon substitutions were made to eliminate oxidation-prone nucleotide sequences and replace them with ones with a lower mutation risk. For this sequence, our algorithm could eliminate 65% of poly-guanine motifs and an overall reduction in oxidizable guanines.
For UV-irradiation, an optimized GFP was constructed for resistance against UV. To generate this GFP variant with enhanced mutation resistance, we made synonymous codon substitutions to the commonly used E1010 RFP sequence in the registry. The algorithm removed sites that, upon UV irradiation, could possible form pyrimidine dimers, including CT, TT, CC, and TC base pairs. With these two applicable constructs optimized to be resistant to both irradiation and oxidation, the lacZ gene was optimized for both irradiation and oxidation using same procedures with the algorithm developed. There were constructs for minimum number of mutations and maximum number of mutations compared to the standard lacZ in the registry."

Néerlandais: Nier sensing – Naar een bacteriële biosensor ontwikkeld voor het opsporen van vroege stadia van nieraandoeningen
     Chronisch nierfalen, gekenmerkt door veranderingen in functie  en structuur van de nier, treft miljoenen mensen wereldwijd en de meesten van hen zijn zich er niet van bewust. Een gebrek aan symptomen in vroege stadia van de ziekte leidt tot late diagnose wanneer patienten al dialyse of zelfs transplantatie nodig hebben. Momenteel wordt chronisch nierfalen gediagnostiseerd door het creatine niveau in het bloed te meten wat alleen meetbaar is in late stadia van nierfalen en gevoelig is voor factoren als dieet, geslacht, herkomst, leeftijd en spiermassa. We bespreken de ontwikkeling van een biosensor die nierfalen in vroege stadia kan diagnostiseren door de biomarker Cytostatin C te identiceren. Met een biosensor aan het oppervlak van de cel als detector en een quorum-sensing system als transductie en reactive mechanism hebben wij een genetisch circuit ontwikkeld dat een drempelwaarde vast kan stellen om te discrimineren tussen concentraties van Cytostatine C. Wij voorzien dat een snel, simpel en betrouwbaar gereedschap wordt voor screening en diagnose van nierfalen. (Translated by Groningen team )

Will only have time for one Gibson tomorrow, but will maybe be able to have the backbone by Saturday. pSB1C3 (not pSB1K3, because that's actually not available, pSB3K3 (for which we don't have primers) or pSB1K3.m1 (which we have in the backbone kit but for which I can't find sequence data) are available) was PCR'ed at 66, 68, 70, and 72 degrees with iLOV FWD and REV primers for 50 seconds of elongation.
Screen Shot 2016-07-14 at 8.14.28 PM.png
Was going to PCR Blh + RBS but am not going to for two reasons. 1) The current RBS 2 REV primer won't work since there's only 7 bp's of overlap between RBS 2 REV and the Blh I just amplified. That's a denaturation temp of 3 degrees Celcius. And 2) There's already > 20 bps of overlap between the Blh region and the PR + RBS region. A picture of this area, with the Blh REV (lime green), PR FWD (teal), and PR+RBS2 FWD (gray) primers marked is to the left. The lime green and gray region of overlap is the current homology, which isn't too bad.

Normally, when it comes to risk assessment it is more fatal to accept a technology or new substance which leads to undesired consequences than to accept a false hypothesis into a scientific theory.
The Precautionary Principle
This is called “The Precautionary Principle”, which has many different definitions but in essence it means: if an activity has potential harms by a certain degree, precautionary measures should be taken even if the likelihood of the harms occurring have not been scientifically confirmed. Other definitions could be: “Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation” Principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development or “When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause-and-effect relationships are not fully established scientifically” Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle . One study shows that one bacteria, which produces the bacteriocin leugudin, outcouncours the MRSA in vitro, which are great results, but from these results we do not just treat MRSA patients with the outcouncouring bacteria because we do not know the possible consequences of that action. It could potentially lead to even greater infection or problems for the patient or society.
This leads to the conclusion that even though the essence of the Precautionary Principle is intuitive for most, the precise definition and the influence of the principle is still debated.
The Precautionary Principle can be defined by three parts: The Meta-Precautionary Principle, the “Tripod” and Proportionality STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. . The combination of these is what makes the Precautionary Principle a good tool for decision-making. The Meta-Precautionary Principle places restrictions on which types of decision-rules should be applied. The decision-rules in question are not to allow inaction because of scientific uncertainty - one should never be paralyzed by a lack of knowledge when facing serious threats STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. . The “Tripod” part is actually three parts in itself: The epistemological condition, the damage condition and the remedy or action that are recommended CARTER, J. A. & PETERSON, M. 2015.

Granzyme B (GzmB) activity is elevated during inflammation, which can lead to excess cleavage of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in human tissue. Aside from causing damage to healthy tissues, this also exacerbates chronic inflammatory conditions, which keeps producing more GzmB and creates a vicious cycle. Our project aims to selectively inhibit GzmB in the ECM in order to prevent damage during chronic inflammation. Since we do not have the means of working with GzmB and directly testing its interactions in human test subjects, we predicted these interactions using mathematical models and data from the literature.
The Hill equation is used to model the interaction between a ligand and its binding partner, a macromolecule/enzyme – in our case, how well a GzmB inhibitor binds to GzmB. It is a function of free ligand concentration, and it returns the fraction of macromolecules that are bound. Two constants are involved in this equation: the dissociation"
Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," these reasons, we believe that SMX occurrence in an aquatic environment is one of the key drivers of pharmaceutical pollution in the Baltic Sea. It poses an implicit and imminent threat to the regional ecosystem as WWTPs are, in their current state, unable to sufficiently remove SMX from the wastewater.
Existing Solutions
To remove pharmaceuticals from the wastewater, advanced (tertiary) treatment procedures need to be implemented in WWTPs. Several ready-to-implement technologies have been developed in the past for treating pharmaceutical residues, but each one of them bears some restrictions that prevent its broad adoption and implementation in WWTPs.
To the extent of our knowledge, there is only one WWTP in the Baltic Sea region employing advanced treatment methods to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater, and it is located in Linköping, Sweden.
The most preeminent methods for treating pharmaceuticals in wastewater are displayed and briefly described in Table 1 and Table 2 .
Note that the emerging solution pCure in Table 2, which was developed by Pharem Biotech, is a solution designed to be implemented in the topmost upstream level, which is the level of the toilet and not in the WWTP [19].
Table 1. Existing solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals [19].
Table 2. Emerging solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals [20].
Note also that one common system including ultrafiltration (or micro-filtration) in conjunction with a biological wastewater treatment (activated sludge) process is called Membrane Bioreactor (MBR), and it is not displayed separately as it is represented in Table 1 by the ultrafiltration method.
Combinations of the existing solutions can be implemented in WWTPs, either integrated into the primary treatment stages or as an extra stage of treatment. With this tactic WWTPs try to leverage the main advantages from different solutions, achieving sufficient removal rates of pharmaceuticals. As Sofia Andersson from Henriksdal WWTP disclosed: “With Ozonation, there is a risk of receiving compounds you do not want, but Linköping WWTP has moving Biofilm Membrane Bioreactor (MB-MBR) carriers implemented after the Ozonation” (Study visit S Andersson 10 Jul 2018). However, as it is logical to assume, this approach leads to an increased treatment cost as well.
Overall, the two most easily accessible and realistic solutions for the removal of pharmaceuticals are Ozonation and Activated Carbon (GAC & PAC).  On the one hand, the by-products produced after the redox reaction catalyzed by ozone (O3) have"
Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Modelling Diary_-_-_TEXT.html," - 02/08
The big project this week involved researching trajectory/collision functions to simulate particles bouncing off the walls of the tube. (A big thankyou to this website for teaching us trigonometry). This involved some intense vector calculus - starting with the 2D system before moving on to 3D. Many hours were spent in front of a white board drawing numerous diagrams (and slugs)!
Obviously this wouldn’t be a modelling diary entry without mentioning optimisations:
The coordinate storage structure was altered to have columns adjacent to each complex coordinate column. This allowed us to denote status and record the identity of each toehold and RNA trigger.
We almost fixed the plotting function but for a few cases which resulted in extra lines being plotted. Plotting was based on conditional statements that exploited the addition columns and their information introduced in the new points structure.
The plan for the coming weeks will be to explore the numerical output, start to split down functions and implement bouncing in 3D and parameter scanning.
Week 03/08 - 09/08
Monday was spent getting GitHub to work so that we could use version control. It was setup successfully on Todd’s laptop but Dan’s required more work. Now that is good to go we can both edit the same script and upload it in a secure location. It will also keep track of the changes we've made and allow use to revert back to earlier versions.
The modelling diary, action plan and meeting notes were looked through and any missing information added, bringing these documents up to date!
Week 10/08 - 16/08
Todd was away but started to write about the simulation for the modelling wiki. Dan continued to work on the data structures used for recording the coordinates and smoothing out the bugs with it in preparation for adding in the bouncing from the edges of the tube later on in the week. Integration of this bouncing code would lead to many a problem and was carried over into the next week.
The data structuring included modifying the coordinates array so that a timestep (row) could accommodate two points rather than one (the point before contact with the boundary and the point of contact on the boundary). This was fiddly and some of the inflexible conditional statements elsewhere needed to be changed.
A modelling introduction was also written up for the wiki (finally!)
We also lost Amy to America this week, we know life will be that much harder without her :(
Week 17/08 - 23/08
This week was cut short by the absence of the Wiki team on Thursday and Friday. Regardless, the focus shifted onto writing for the wiki as Monday"

Introduction
Nitrate is toxic to fish or shrimp in water. When nitrate reaches a certain concentration level, it will be a harsh condition for aquatic animal. In order to maintain good quality of water, concentration of nitrate should be taken more seriously. Previously, BCCS Bristol 2010 have constructed BBa_K381001, a nitrate sensing GFP composite. We want to take advantage of it and refine the characterization of nitrate sensing. Especially to fit aquaculture condition, we focus on the range of 0 to 100 ppm.
Description
Part: BBa_K381001 was first designed by Katharine Coyte from team BCCS-Bristol in iGEM 2010. It is a nitrate reporter, PyeaR - GFP composite. The team BCCS-Bristol only tested the biobrick’s sensitivity at a higher concentration, but the Nitrate level of         aquatic water usually won’t reach 1 mM. Therefore, we carry out experiment by testing the fluorescence intensity with ppm level of potassium nitrate, which is much lower than all the teams before. The results are shown below.
Figure 1. The fluorescence intensity of different nitrate concentration taken the logarithm at 8, 12 and 24 hours.
It shows that the biobrick BBa_K381001 has nice sensitivity not just in high nitrate concentration, but low as well. Many teams had done improvements of K381001, but our team brings out the most beautiful data. And we also take X axis logarithm, which         can make our data become linear. Not only easier to read, but also more meaningful.
The data are shown as below.

To verify our stepwise experiments, pPCR , cPCR , and Fast Digest , we used gel electrophoresis. A successful transformation were confirmed by a colony PCR with specially designed primers for each gene. The results were confirmed according to the theoretical expected length of the gene.
If satisfied with the results, plasmid purification were made from ON cultures from the respective cPCR templates.
Bacteriocins
Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptide compounds that effect through adhesion to specific receptors. These are present on the external surface of the target bacteria, where they induce metabolic changes by pore formation. The bacteriocins were selected according to the three listed criteria:
They elicited an effect on pathogens, most frequent detected in open wounds, causing wound infection.
They targeted the cell wall of the target bacteria in order to work when fused with silk.
They were non-lethal to E.coli, in order to use E.coli as the producing strain.
Strains that produce bacteriocins, which target the respective bacteria present in open wounds, were examined. Genes encoding the bacteriocins were found and codon optimized, in order to create a BioBr"

Uppsala 2018 is on a mission for the future of iGEM
In iGEM Uppsala we are worried about the future of iGEM members wellbeing and have seen multiple cases of burnouts. This is something that has to be changed to make iGEM sustainable for the future. To combat this problem we have hosted an event with iGEM Stockholm and Lund which shed light on the growing problem of burnouts and how to prevent them. To further spread the knowledge we have published a booklet about it! The booklet is a summary of useful guidelines and techniques to prevent team members from burn outs. It also speaks about the current situation in iGEM which we have summarised after performing an international survey with answers from current team members and previous team members all over the world.

Introduction
In the field of Synthetic Biology mathematical models based on bioinformatic methods are mainly used in order to describe the systems behavior of the involved synthetic constructs. To conduct the orchestra of these parts systems biologists try out different modeling approaches for example analytical or stochastic modeling depending on the underlying system. The introduced parameters  in these models are naturally fitted to experimental data acquired in vivo [1] . But the interests in synthetic biology will not only be concerned about systems of existing parts, the focus of research in systems biology will rather  be in the design of totally rational assembled constructs not described in nature so far. For that purpose we need models which predict and optimize the properties of these in silico designed constructs.
In order to enable this modeling approach it is useful to define a part as a basic biological function encoded as genetic material ( listen to Drew Endy, President of the BioBricks Foundation ). Starting from this abstract concept we propose to devide up the ""parental"" part into smaller functional units which we define  “subparts” that exhibit their own biological function. However, this function can only be exerted if all subparts are exactly assembled together in the “parental” part. If all system related parameters for every subpart are known, one will be able to model the characteristics of the ""parental"" part.
In this work we propose a model which describes the rational design of a certain promoter of interest. Furthermore, the model is able to predict the functional outcome of the created sequence and it can be used to improve the input sequence, both based on fuzzy logic modeling ( HEART"

XJTLU-CHINA,2017,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," gene. X is the concentration of nisin which is needed to activate the promoter pnisA, to this extent, k1 equals to the concentration of nisin when the rate of reaction is up to half of Vmax. K2, which is controlled by another regulatory factor, is the concentration of phosphorylated AgrA when the rate of reaction is up to half of Vmax.
By assuming that 0.25 μM of AIP molecules is present in the intestine, we run the MATLAB script to check whether AIP molecules can successfully activate the promoter P2 by binding to AgrC and phosphorylating AgrA. We used a reporter protein sfGFP to show the activation of the sensing device. If there is an apparent increase of sfGFP concentration, the sensing device can be considered as being activated. The results are shown below.
Fig 1.    State values of AgrA, Cbind, AgrC, Cp, Api and sfGFP.
Fig 2.    Individual display of 9 variables
As it is shown in the Figure 1 and 2, the concentration of sfGFP is enough high after several hours. Therefore, we made a conclusion that the amount of AIP molecules can activate the promoter P2 to transcribe the genes downstream.
To verify whether the cross-inhibition （introduced in the description section）can result in a decrease in AIP and             virulence factor in Staphylococcus aureus, we hijacked the modeling of the sensing device into the quorum sensing system. By             assuming the concentration of AIPs decreases to 0.1 μM by the cross-inhibition of another type of AIPs, we run             the MATLAB script again to check whether there is any change in sfGFP production.
Fig 3.    State values of 9 variables.
Fig 4.    Individual display  of 9 variables.
Discussion
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the concentration of sfGFP is extremely low when compared with the case of 0. 25 μM             AIPs. Therefore, the amount of AIP molecules can dramatically affect the P2 promoter to express the downstream             genes. Based on the result of sfGFP expression, we can also make a conclusion that in the case of the quorum             sensing of Staphylococcus aureus, their signal transduction of AIPs can be cross-inhibited by a different type of AIPs.             As a result, AIPs and virulence factors cannot be further produced.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html,"binant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system"

Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some"
SUSTC-Shenzhen-B,2012,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-B#algorithm.3_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulation of the Energy Change to Form RNA/DNA duplex
Now there are thermodynamic parameters (based on nearest neighborhood energy rules) [5]for us to calculate the free energy change of RNA:DNA formation. For example, if the sequence is 5’ TTTTCATTGTTA 3’, then the energy change is :
rUUUUCAUUGUUA = initiation energy + rUU +rUU + rUU + rUC + rCA +rAU + rUU + rUG + rGU + rUU + rUA
3.Calculation of Score[4]
Score  = deltaG( stemloop ) – [deltaG( spacer ) + deltaG(proximal part)] – 0.5 * deltaG( distal part ) – 0.01 * deltaG( extra part )
Here the 2 to 5 terms are calculated according to RNA/DNA duplex thermodynamic parameters.

Shanghaitech,2017,Team:Shanghaitech#Library_-_-_TEXT.html,"ti.. Generally, Cry proteins are believed to exert toxicity by interacting with the proteins on the brush border membrane and then insert into the membrane which takes multiple steps. At the beginning in mosquitoes' gut, the crystalline inclusions are cleaved at the disulfide bond to release the Cry pre-toxin. Then the soluble proteins are activated by being cleaved again by intestinal protease. When toxins reach to the brush border membrane microvilli, they bind to the proteins, or known as receptors on the membrane. The binding process takes two step. Firstly, the monomeric Cry toxin binds to cadherin, resulting in the formation of pre-pore oligomer ，Then the oligomer binds to a GPI-anchored APN or ALP. Secondly, the previous binding induces the oligomer insertion into the lipid rafts membrane. A formation of ion permeable pore is followed by the insertion which allows small molecules to pass through the membrane. The membrane potential inevitably changes greatly, causing the swelling of cell and finally breaking down. When the cell lysis reaches to a certain degree, the midgut necrosis and epithelial denaturation follow. Then, the alkaline hypertonic inclusions in midgut enters into hemocoel and the pH of haemolymph rises causing paralysis of larvae and finally death. To increase the express level in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii, we synthesis Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii codon optimized Cyt1. Meanwhile, we added 2A peptide sequence at the end of 5’ According to the published paper and the result of Swiss-model, there is no effect to the toxicity of Cry or Cyt. Users can use infusion technology to link the express vector to express toxins

Cry10Aa is cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis BRC-LLP29. It shows specific toxicity to Culex and Aedes by bioassay. The Cry protein is consisted of three functional domains. Domain I is a seven α-helices bundle. It can insert itself into a membrane by using its hydrophobic helices α4 and α5 to insert into the phospholipid bilayer. The pore formation occurs on its α3 helix. Domain II and domain III are two β-sheets which are involved in the receptor interactions. Domain II contains extremely variable loops, which are the binding site of the receptor. Domain"

Pictures were acquired on fluorescents microscope with 100x lens. Both GFP and RFP filters was used. To get the clear difference between periplasm and cytoplasm 2 pictures with each filter was taken; one with short exposure time and one with long. The short exposure time was subtracted from the long and finally the GFP and RFP pictures were merged to get RFP as a cytoplasmic contrast to the periplasmic GFP.

Marburg_SYNMIKRO,2012,Team:Marburg SYNMIKRO#Happening_-_-_TEXT.html," German iGEM teams organized the Synthetic Biology Day. Our team participated and presented an information desk on the central Elisabeth-Blochmann-Platz in Marburg. Many people visited our desk where we explained the ideas of synthetic biology, talked about the iGEM competition and explained our project “The Recombinator”. To support our information we prepared a flyer on our project and distributed booklets on about biotechnology and a flyer from the Marburg Center for Synthetic Microbiology ( SYNMIKRO ). We also offered a quiz with basic questions on synthetic biology.
""Biotechnology 2020+"" in Berlin
In 2010 the German Ministry of Education and Research ( BMBF ) has started a strategy process “Biotechnology 2020+”. This initiative promotes the collaboration of natural scientists with engineers in research and development of innovative products and technological processes.  The 3rd Annual Congress of “Biotechnology 2020+” was held in Berlin on June 28, 2012. About 200 experts from science, politics and industry as well as representatives from 11 German iGEM teams were invited to this meeting. The program for the day included speeches, panel discussions and workshops. Two exhibition areas, one presenting the current projects of German biotech research companies, and the second one showing the iGEM-posters, offered an ideal opportunity for the exchange of innovative ideas. The iGEM - participants met for the first time to discuss their projects and their implementation. In a closed session it was discussed how the iGEM competition could contribute to the social acceptance of Synthetic Biology. It was decided to organise a Germany-wide iGEM information day (Synthetic Biology Day) to bring citizens and students closer to the issues of Biotechnology, Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition. To facilitate communication the iGEM Germany group on facebook was founded. This group serves the iGEM participants as a platform for exchange of the information and ideas. Biotechnology 2020+

We tried to make petri dish cultures with liquid media of wheat straw, grass and potato dextrose.
We made VSuTB (no agar) and tried to make a small scale growth curve.
Week 5 June 6 – June 12
We decided to narrow our scope and focus on perfecting the growth of Neurospora on grass clippings and wheat straw. We felt that grass clippings represented the household application and wheat straw represented a large-scale/ industrial application.
We created a wheat straw experiment varying the size of wheat straw added and in a separate experiment, the amount of water added to wheat straw. We also compared additives.
We created a grass experiment comparing dried grass to freshly cut grass.
We made our first race tube out of a 25mL disposable pipette.
Week 6 June 13 –June 19
We tried to make another growth curve from Vogel`s minimal media.
We made a wheat straw scale up in 100mL from the most successful results from the previous week.
We set up a dried grass small scale experiment varying size, water, and additives.

Kayla attended the ISMOS-3  conference in Calgary.
Week 7 June 20 – 26
We miniprepped pCSN44 for the growth team.
We acquired long glass tubes to act as our race tubes.
We filled them with VSuTB and inoculated them with fresh conidia. We marked growth along the tube every 24 hours.
We made tubes of Wheat Straw and VTB and tubes of Grass Clippings and VTB. We inoculated the tubes and monitored growth of the tubes every 24 hours.  We also noticed that it was difficult to see growth in the clear VSuTB so we made two tubes of VSuTB, one with food colouring in it and one without. We tested growth and found the hyphal extension rates to be comparable.
Week 8 June 27 – July 3
We attempted to make a scale up using wheat straw. We continued to monitor and record growth if our race tubes.
Week 9 July 4 – 10
We set up new race tubes to test if the carbon source being used was actually from the wheat straw and grass clipping. We made the following tubes up: VSuTB, wheat straw +VTB, wheat straw + fertilizer + salt solution, grass +VTB, grass + fertilizer + salt solution.
We also attempted to extract the Neurospora from the race tube by boiling the"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," prepared the samples for Sanger sequencing and sent them out to Sequetech. In the meantime of waiting for results, we made more liquid stocks of our samples. We received the results and found out that we had successfully removed loxP in sequence alignment. We conducted a trial of yeast mediated cloning as well and incubated them over the weekend.
New platings for all 5 transformant population showed successful growth, although colonies were still too clustered to be isolated. We also discovered that our final homologous arm primers had not been ordered, and so attempted to isolate our gene inserts using some restriction sites that were near the binding site of our designed primers. These transformations were unsuccessful, though we were able to produce a glycerol stock of E. coli containing our pOPPY_GFP(1) plasmid.
Our second attempt to transform E.coli with a yeast-derived plasmid (pXRL2 + 5 pathway genes) involved the use of electroporation. Results are visible in the more detailed section.

This week, our team started preparing for the Giant Jamboree by creating our presentation slides. With this being the first full week of school, attendance in lab has been spotty. We are all still trying to get back in the routine of school work while also juggling iGEM tasks!
After receiving the lox-ura-lox from IDT, we began our KLD reactions. We ran our KLD reaction with our new clean D17 in the PCR machine. Using the product, we plated the mix on a high copy plate and let it incubate overnight. The next day, we confirmed its growth and began preparation for colony PCR.
We also attempted to transform our pXRl2 gibson with our desired genes and perform PCR on p450. Both failed.
Since we were successful in making a colony that contained the Psb1C3 backbone with the electrocompetent E. coli,  we did another double digest, ligation, and transformation with the genes 3BH and Delta7. We also did another restriction digest to confirm if the P450scc plasmid that was miniprepped was correct, and we did not get the bands we expected. We had bands at 2.8kb and 1.2kb when we expected bands at 3.2kb and 800bp. Since we were not getting our BioBricks, we consulted one of our PI"

Parents meeting
After we met with Dr. Friend and after exposure to the long road ahead it was important for us to share with our parents and to commit ourselves to the process. We told the parents about the competition and what it requires of us to do, at first, some parents thought it was far-fetched and unrealistic, when they arrived for a meeting with the teachers and the school principal and were exposed to the process from the mouths of the leaders of the process, they internalized the idea, understood it was possible and gave us their blessings.
Brainstorming, meeting with a group of IGEM looking for project ideas
General idea was found - A kit to identify food allergens. Meeting with students' parents, exposure to IGEM Group's and the general idea.

Dividing into groups
Since we are a large Team (22 students) and time is short and a lot has to be done, we divided the Team into groups in accordance with the tasks. In fact, all five teams worked hard and were dependent on each other to get the complete product.
Set up the team site and divided into organized work groups: writing, documentation, logistics, laboratory and presentation:

failure mode
In the experimental process, especially in the early period of the experimental process, we encountered some failures. To let you easier to consult and avoid these kinds of failures in your experiment, we list the failures we have experienced below.
1. About the experimental apparatus
We mainly use microplate reader  for data acquisition. When we using microplate reader, we should set some obbligato parameters, such as “excitation wavelength”, “emission wavelength”, and the like. It is necessary to set up correct parameters to have some reliable data.
2. “co-transformation” or “transformation one by one” ?
As far as we know, no one has tried to transfer miRNA into the bacteria before, which is completely a new developing direction. We attempt to transfer miRNA with plasmid together by using thermal stimulation method in to the bacteria, but with little or no effect (Fig. 1).
Through summarizing the result of the experiment and drawing the support from the mathematical model, we found that when miRNA has an initial concentration within the bacteria, the concentration of miRNA decrease rapidly with the rapid growth of bacteria, and at the beginning of the period, the decline is fastest. It is believed that the effective concentration of miRNA has a “window period”, and if it works, it will only be effective at the beginning. By analyzing the data from the pre-experiment (PROOF OF FUNCTIONAL CONCEPT Fig. 2b), we could know that even normal expression of GFP cannot reach a high level of expression at the outset, instead after experience a period of “lag phase” the amount of GFP expression will increase. We believe that the lag phase, the plasmid concentration in the bacteria, the level of gene transcription on the plasmid and the expression of the bacteria themselves are in a very low state, making us miss the observation of miRNA effect during the “window period”, and after that the expression level of GFP will rise, but at that time, the concentration of miRNA almost cannot play any inhibitory effect. Therefore, we have the next problem-solving goal: to expend the “window period” of miRNA or to elevate the expression level of GFP earlier. The “window period” of miRNA is determined by the initial concentration"

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Achievements#Experimental Results_-_-_TEXT.html," RNA level gives results comparable to using reporter proteins, at least for promoters of moderate strength. It could be theorised that using Spinach as a reporter allows characterisation of stronger promoters than using protein reporters, as Spinach does not need to be translated, and therefore stresses the cell considerably less.
Calculating promoter activity
See our modeling page , for the derivations of the following calculations. In the following we conduct these PoPS calculation for the J23101 promotor. With the use of our developed calculator , PoPS values can easily be calculated from fluorescence signal.
To determine the autofluorescence, fluorescence signal and biomass was measured for a strain containing a Spinach2.1 gene with no promoter. The cell autofluorescence per OD was determined to be 0.5.
From our generated Spinach2.1-DFHBI-1T standard curve we know that the slope of the concentration vs. fluorescence graph is 1.00 µM-1 with an intercept of 0.78.
For the J23101 promoter we measured a fluorescence signal of 7.6 at OD600 6.3. By using the autofluorescence per OD, the background on this measurement was subtracted.
Fluorescencereal = 7.6 - 6.3*0.5 = 4.4
The remaining fluorescence is the Spinach-specific fluorescence, which can be used to calculate the concentration of Spinach-DFHBI complex.
[SpinachDFHBI] = 3.7 µM
The total Spinach concentration is found by dividing with the fraction of Spinach that is correctly folded. The folding fraction of Spinach has by Strack et al. been demonstrated to be around 60%. However this is at 37 °C, and since we observed that RNA folding is temperature-dependent, this folding fraction could be higher in reality. In the following we use a folding fraction of 60%.
[Spinach] = 6.1 µM
To determine the cell concentration the CFU/L is approximated from the OD600:
CFU ≈ OD*10<12
The number of Spinach molecules per cell is calculated by use of Avogados Constant and the cell density in CFU/L:
Spinach/cell =584357 spinach molecules per cell
The production rate of Spinach is hereafter found by multiplying with growth rate plus degradation rate.  We have found the growth rate to be 0.0002 s-1 and the degradation rate to be 0.0002 s-1.

The gel showed a strong signal at 630 bp for two colonies of T7-1 but none for T7-13. Unfortunately, this is the same promoter as the one amplified by Alina two months ago, so we can't use it to run an interesting experiment.
Monday, October 24 2011
Vincent mini-prepped the liquid culture from the successful T71-Lysis-K1 plasimd identified by PCR the previous day. He then transformed that DNA into BL21 cells and plated the transformant.
Since the primers used on Sunday would miss half of the inserts (the blunt-end strategy implies that using primers on the insert and on the vector will miss half of the potentially good plasmids), we chose to switch to different primers: the 816_R and 30_F which amplify on the lysis cassette.
With these primers, Vincent ran a colony PCR on 10 colonies per plate for the 2, 3, 4, and 6 plates (2,3,4, and 6 refers to the T7 promoter type). He used the same protocol as on Sunday. The resulting gel shows that 3 out of the 4 T7 variants show an amplification on some colony:

Nadine and Douglas came in and mini-prepped liquid cultures prepared the previous day by Nadine.
Vincent transformed the resulting DNA into BL21 cells.

ULB-Brussels,2009,Team:ULB-Brussels#Project#Perspectives_-_-_TEXT.html," cultures producing recombinant proteins or DNA. As plasmid-free cells grow faster than plasmid-carrying cells, the yield and the production reproducibility of recombinant molecules are significantly lowered in the absence of plasmid selection by the appropriate antibiotic.
To overcome the plasmid instability, many antibiotic resistance genes are used as selectable markers in fermentation processes. Antibiotics are expensive and they pose safety problems: they contaminate the production product. (23) (24) The Belgian company Delphi Genetics has developed a strategy called StabyTM system which relies on the use of poison-antidote genes.
The StabyTM system is based on the poison-antidote ccd module. Poison-antidote modules are found in natural plasmid in which they serve to the plasmid maintenance. The CcdB protein (poison) is cytotoxic and poisons DNA-gyrase complexes. Expression of this gene in the absence of its cognate ccdA antidote leads the death of the bacteria. The product of the ccdA gene (antidote) antagonizes this toxic activity by forming a poison-antidote protein complex. If a plasmid carrying the ccd module is lost at cell division, the plasmid-free bacteria contain poison and antidote proteins in their cytoplasm. Since the antidote is unstable and degraded by a host protease, the poison will be free and able to poison DNA-gyrase complexes. This will lead eventually to cell death.
In theStabyTM system,the antidote gene (ccdA) is introduced in the plasmid DNA under the control of a weak constitutive promoter: the mob gene promoter, which originates from a broad host range plasmid (pBHR1). On the other hand, the toxic gene (ccdB) is introduced in the E. coli chromosome of the bacteria. Expression of the poison gene is under the control of a promoter strongly repressed in the presence of the plasmid. Practically, 100 % of the bacteria will carry the vector. If they lose the vector, they will not obtain a growth advantage, but will die. Upon induction, all the bacteria will start producing the recombinant protein. It will lead to higher yields of the recombinant protein and less background caused by unwanted proteins. Therefore, higher plasmid stability means higher protein of interest production.
StabyTM system from Delphi Genetics
We think it could be relevant to implement this antibiotic free expression strategy in our project. This is the reason why we designed"

Wild type and ∆crcB were grown directly next to each other at varying levels of fluoride. As described in literature, ∆crcB should not grow when exposed to fluoride levels over 500µM. Unexpectedly, ∆crcB did grow on high levels of fluoride when placed on the same plates as wild type E. coli. Without wild type E. coli, no growth of ∆crcB was seen on 1mM and 2mM fluoride.
In order to figure out the cause of the unexpected growth, we reached out to Dr. Randy Stockbridge at University of Michigan for possible explanations. Dr. Stockbridge informed us of Fluoride’s dependability of pH. A low pH environment is necessary for Fluoride to enter cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the wild type altered the pH of the agar to a more basic level, facilitating the growth of ∆crcB.
To confirm our hypothesis, we prepared similar set of plates, but with phenol red, a pH indicator, for visual confirmation.
Phenol red appears red at basic pH and turns yellow at acidic pH. In the absence of a buffer, wild type has a visibly basic pH. Therefore, once the entire plate became basic, ∆crcB showed fair amount of growth. On previous days, ∆crcB grew only at red areas (low pH).
To further confirm our results, we prepared the same plates with a MES buffer, which kept the agar at a 6.5 pH, which is slightly acidic.
Upon the addition of the buffer, the alteration of pH was significantly delayed, so F was able to enter the membrane of ∆crcB, allowing the strain to grow.
CHOP (Chloramphenicol Operon) and ∆crcB (E. coli without Fluoride Channel) were added to 50µ chloramphenicol plates and observed over the course of 4 days.
The plates had increasing concentrations of F with CHOP and ∆crcB to determine the level of fluoride that leads to the greatest growth of CHOP.
∆crcB was part of the control and did not grow because it does not have the fluoride channel to pump out the F.
As observed, there is most growth of CHOP on 100μM of F, suggesting maximum growth of CHOP at 100μM of F.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

After construction, we conducted a stress analysis to make sure, that the calculations and estimations were right.
FEM stress analysis: red areas indicate high stresses and blue ones low stresses. This helps to optimize complex structures. The bending is displayed exaggeratedly.
We constructed an absolutely new syringe pump, but here is a list of the main differences to the other project:
A half-section of the cable channel
The frame's design is unusual for mechanical loads like this. We want our bending moment to be as small as possible, thus we should keep all forces on levers as small as possible. Even though the forces occuring in our system are relatively small, we could save some material by structural optimization.
We wanted the syringe pump to look more appealing, that's why we made significant changes to the design.

In gene cloning experiments, we found in many clones that there’s always one mutation at the same position on the synthesized DNA sequence of AOX1 gene. We guessed it may be caused by the process of IDT DNA synthesis. Because the length of AOX gene is near 2kb, we thought it could be possible to make errors for bigger DNA. Fortunately, the sequence of AOX2 gene is correct and corresponding to the sequence on the NCBI genomics database. Therefore, AOX2 gene was used in the following experiment and studied in our project.
To see the final synthesized DNA sequences on pSB1C3, please go to the link and find data from AOX1 and AOX2.

Taking advantage of this competence-specific mechanism, it is now able to produce the S. pneumoniae sensing device of high specificity by incorporating this system into E. coli.
iGEM 2014 Hong_Kong_HKUST Team has cloned σx from S. pneumoniae strain NCTC7465 and characterized its ability to initiate transcription of two downstream promoters with different lengths: PcelA ( BBa_K1379000 ) and PcomFA ( BBa_K1379001 ), which have the consensus Com-Box sequence. Though much information about the promoters is readily available nowadays, its characterization of promoter activity, specificity, sequence, as well as the biomolecular mechanism can be greatly enhanced with further investigations and experiments. Hence, we were interested in reproducing this gene circuit with all the associated genes and promoters to be combined into a single transcriptional unit. Despite the suggested susceptibility to leakage and other factors that may hinder or interrupt the mechanism, researches have reported that the pathway was highly specific to certain environmental conditions and stress, suggesting minimal or no leakage in the entire process.
PcelA and PcomFA promoters have high specificity to σx for activation, so genes downstream the promoters will be translated only if σx is present. Hence, by using fluorescence protein as a reporting mechanism, this σx, PcelA and PcomFA promoters system could be further utilized as a specific reporter device in E. coli DH10B strain that could be used by iGEM communities.
σx and ComW mechanism
Figure 2. σx - comW Interaction Diagram
σx and ComW protein are both produced by a constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 , which continuously expresses σx required for PcelA and PcomFA promoters induction, and ComW protein is required for σx stabilization. ComW protein acts as a barrier that protects σx from being degraded by ClpXP degradation enzyme, hence it increases the production of σx. The increase in σx production will increase the expression of green fluorescence protein by PcelA and PcomFA promoters.
To complete the story of competence regulation mechanism from S. Pneumoniae, we would also like to integrate another positive factor involved in competence regulation which was later found out to be ComW. Prof. Morrison's lab released another research paper on the identification of a new component in the regulation of genetic transformation in S. Pneumoniae. The gene comW (SP0018) was found to be       regulated by the qu"
