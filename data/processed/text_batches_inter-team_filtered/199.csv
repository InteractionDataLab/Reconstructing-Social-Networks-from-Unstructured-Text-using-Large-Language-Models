Friday 20th July
Meeting - Modelling. Joanne, Aurelija and Yanika (one of our advisors) had a meeting with our supervisor Darren Nesbeth about our progress on different modules. We decided on having a rough draft of four models by the 1st of August. Our supervisor advised us to organise a meeting with Dr Dalby regarding the degradation module. Having a deadline will make us get our draft of the models done and then we will be able to build up on those.
Sponsorship. Bethan contacted Mendeley about a sponsorship package they offered us.
Saturday 21st July
Poster. We are really excited! Today Carina, Aurelija and Bethan finished our first poster which summarises our project. As the poster is dedicated to Munich conference (to which six of us are going) we concentrated only on experimental and modelling plans.  (photo with us and poster).
Sunday 22nd July
Presentation - Munich. Aurelija and Joanne finished the presentation for the LMU modelling meetup organised for the coming week. The aim is to organise a collaboration between the Munich iGEM team.
Reflections
This week has been a huge relief for the lab team, who had been growing increasingly concerned over the delay caused by the competency of our cells. However, now that we have found a protocol and a cell line that works, we are much relieved and keen to begin construction. Next week, we will be making up for the lost time, and driving the construction of our biobricks. While we have been delayed, we are still confident that all our aims are achievable, and we are looking forward to making progress. We also made a lot of progress with the content for the wiki - but this has not been published yet. This includes writing up a more comprehensive account of our research plans, and the designs for a more attractive and user-friendly homepage. Furthermore, the six of us that will be visiting Munich for the CAS conference in Synthetic Biology have been preparing all week to develop a collaboration with Munich, which has been very successful. Altogether, there has been a lot of pressure on this week but we have achieved all our aims.
Fail of the Week - Reinvigoration of Cell Line
Success of the Week - Original cell line proven more competent than we expected

Streak Plate of Constitutive Promoters
As instructed by Kara, I made a streak plate with all 5 Constitutive Promoters on it.
Accidentally made the plate by stamping it instead of actually streaking it. It looks kinda funny.
Along with the streak plate, I also made cultures of of CB008 SAG1 and CB008 ECM18, along with two negative cultures of CB008. Cultures of the Contitutive Promoters were made also.
All cultures made with SD-Complete. (for Flow)

Introduction
New Strategy
First Steps
Introducton
The synthetic biology community in Lithuania is just starting to grow and we are concerned about society’s attitude towards it. Therefore, we seek to foster scientific culture and enlighten society about the benefits that new technologies can bring. We are passionate about establishing a dialogue between scientific community and general public, which in our belief is one of the factors for scientific progress.
In 2016 Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team have set up an association “Synthetic Biology Organization” (“Sintetinės biologijos organizacija”) - SinBio - to spread knowledge about synthetic biology and educate society about its benefits. SinBio is a non-profit organization having its own governmental bodies - the board and the president (currently our team leader Laurynas Karpus) - and uniting students that are eager to contribute to the development of synthetic biology in Lithuania. For some time, the SinBio activity was slowing down but this year we have decided to revamp it in order to accelerate the growth of the synthetic biology community here in Lithuania.
Below is the new synthetic biology logo we have created this year as a symbol of the revamped organization strategy:
We believe that a public without general knowledge in synthetic biology will not be able to make informed decisions or effectively contribute to political and ethical debates in areas such as GMO or other synthetic biology topics. That said, we believe that SinBio can be one of the factors helping to drive the knowledge and engage people. However, up until now SinBio hasn’t had a clear vision on how to fulfill this task, so this year we developed a 5 year strategy with which we have set ourselves long and short term goals.
The new strategy of Synthetic Biology Organisation
After discussing our ambitions and what we would like to achieve as an organisation, we clarified SinBio vision:
A society that is enthusiastic about synthetic biology, is confident"

But collecting the steady states under different initial input light condition in the kinetic modeling, we can get the relation between the intensity of the input light and the amount of fluorescence.
The result agrees with the result in Tao's work .

Let a new collaboration begin!
Sunday, September 21th
After discovering the awesome video of the Edinburgh team on Twitter, we wanted to know more about their project. As it is clear that the three quorum sensing systems we consider are crosstalking, finding a team focused on the development on communication ways between bacteria was really interesting for us. Their topic is metabolic wiring.
We had a Skype meeting with them this week to discuss about possible opportunities of collaboration. Given the stages of our experiments, we decided that a theoretical collaboration would be more plausible. Next step will be to talk about the models and design a set-up that could fit our two projects.

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

The first terms of $u$ and $v$ indicate logistically increasing of $u$ and $v$. Alpha and beta are max growth rates of $u$ and $v$, respectively. $b$ indicates decreasing effect caused by $u$ and $v$ scramble for nutrition and we assumed the effects against $u$ and $v$ are same.
This is the model based on [1]. The second term in the equation for $u$ indicates death of $u$.
We defined the Hill coefficient as 1 because we simplified the Hill coefficient of pLux expression level against AHL, modeled by ETH Zurich 2014, in order to simply model. 4th equation is term of death caused by colicin. We assumed this term is simply in proportion to the concentration of colicin.
Death rates of E. coli caused by AHL and colicin are in proportion to the concentration of E. coli because E. coli dies with a certain probability regardless to its concentration.
$a$ and $c$ increase proportionally to both concentrations of $u$ and $v$ ach and are degraded proportionally to its concentration.
We simplified the equation by deleting ${\lambda}_a, {\lambda}_c, b$. We could nondimensionalize $x$ and $t$ but we didn’t because we wanted to leave the scale of time and location. Variables with hat are new ones. We regarded we nondimensionalized $x$ and $t$ by multiply them by 1. Parameters ${\alpha}, {\beta}, {\gamma}, {\mu}, {\du}, {\dc}, {\da} and {\delta}$ don’t change after nondimentionalized because they’re only depending on $x$ and $t$

For our project, we would have to think of the solutions to some questions: What concentration of phosphate comes out of the waste water? How quickly can our bacteria reduce this concentration of phosphate?
*Interview was conducted by Owen and Adam*
Interview with Jonathan Abra - Knowledge Transfer Network 19/07/2017
Dr. Andy Balmer helped us in contacting Jonathan Abra, the Knowledge Transfer Manager with responsibility for water and wastewater at Innovate UK, the UK government’s innovation agency. We wanted to confirm the things we learned from our interview with Dr. Duncan Thomas and throughout our discussion, we realized that there were indeed a lot of things that coincide with our previous findings. However, we also learned that there were new challenges to existing methods that we were not aware of. One of the important things that we learned is that the government is trying to push water companies to be more innovative and that there may be a role for synthetic biology in the water industry.
Key points from our discussion can be seen below:
1. UK water regulation is regulated in a non-competitive environment. There are three regulators:
a. Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) , which is responsible in overseeing drinking water
b. Environment Agency (EA) , which is responsible in looking at water in the environment
c. Ofwat , which is responsible in determining the amount of money that water companies can charge their customers
2. Ofwat is the main regulator that water companies have to address to. Ofwat regulates the water industry through a periodic review process every 5 years. As part of this review, water companies have to produce a business plan to cover the following 5 years. This business plan is now evaluated on 3 criterias: value for money, innovation and ambition.
3. Until now, it has been very difficult to get any novel new technology into the UK water industry and water companies have not been innovative in the past years. The target of success for water companies is to avoid getting punished by Ofwat and therefore, they are simply ‘ticking boxes’ and only doing what is necessary. This is no longer acceptable and there is now an incentive set by the government to push water companies to be more innovative (not only in technology but also in different ways of working i.e. different business models). If water companies do not demonstrate innovation, the government is going to punish them financially.
4. There is another new change which called to total expenditure (Totex) by Ofwat. In the past, water companies could spend lots of capital on building new treatment works and new"

Increasing the CO2 fixation rate
After verifying that the expression system is working as intended in Synechocystis, we will replace the fluorescent protein gene with one that is predicted to increase the rate of carbon fixation in the organism. The way we will idenfity this gene is by use of metabolic modelling. Once a candidate gene has been detected, it will be cloned and transformed into Synechocystis.
One candiate gene is glucose oxidase, which is not originally present in Synechocystis. This gene encodes the enzyme Glucose Oxidase, which essentially reduces the oxygen concentration inside the cell. RuBisCO, the CO2 fixating enzyme in photosynthetic organisms, has a high affinity for binding O2, which can interfere with CO2 binding. Reducing O2 concentrations could therefore lead to an increased rate of CO2 fixation in Synechocystis.

MALDI-TOF
Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization – Time of flight (MALDI-TOF) is a procedure to analyze large biomolecules by their mass.
Our MALDI-TOF device
Before measurement, the analyte is co-crystallized on a metal plate within a solid matrix. 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) are most commonly used.
Desorption of the analyte is taken by a laser beam, commonly with a wavelength of 337 nm. The matrix absorbs the laser light and the upper layer explosively vaporizes, ejecting both, matrix and analyte molecules. In addition to this vaporization, the laser beam also leads to an ionization of the analytes. The mass analysis is performed by the TOF (time of flight)-analysator. The evaporated ions are accelerated in an electric field. Typical acceleration voltages for this are 10-30 kV. The velocity of an ion depends on its mass and the charge. An ion detector converts the incoming ions into an electrical signal. The advantage of this method is the rapid analysis of a relatively large mass range.
The MALDI-TOF analysis was performed with the ultrafleXtreme™ by Bruker Daltonics.
We used the MALDI-TOF Analysis to characterize the following BioBricks:

Challenge
One of the major experimental limitations of our design was the reliance on using genetically modified E. coli cells as the method of detection due to the relative difficulty and inefficiency of storing them such that the cells remain viable. As described, a polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix was used to immobilize the E. coli cells which, to maintain cell viability, had to be stored at refrigeration temperature. Even then, in our tests, the cells lost viability after a couple of days. This problem led to the necessity of finding a different organism that would be better suited to shuttling our genetic construct for a longer period of time under a wider range of conditions.
Solution
One of our advisors, James Provan , suggested using the bacteria Bacillus subtilis due to its ability to form endospores which are extremely resilient under a vast range of conditions such as high temperatures and lack of nutrients (Tan and Ramamurthi, 2013) [1] . As the decision to use an alternative organism to E.coli was made approximately half-way through our project, there was not sufficient time to completely redesign our genetic construct such that it could be expressed in Bacillus subtilis. Because of this, a new experiment had to be thought off to show that the bacteria could be used for our purposes. One of our supervisors, Sean Colloms , got in contact with a researcher from Newcastle University, Richard Daniel , who kindly sent us a sample of Bacillus subtilis cells that had been genetically modified such that they became blue-green when exposed to the sugar X-Gal. The proposed experiment involved sporulating these cells and then reanimating them"
DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," biological research that combines science and engineering. Synthetic Biology is about modification of organisms by engineering them to perform new and innovative tasks. An analogy, both conceptualizing the goal and methods of synthetic biology, is computer engineering hierarchy, were  every constituent part is embedded in a more complex system that provides its context. Starting in the bottom of the hierarchy with transistors, capacitors, and resistors; second the engineered logic gates performing binary computations and finally the more complex integrated circuits.
This is equivalent to how synthetic biology works. In synthetic biology standardized parts such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites are used as the basic components. The device layer regulates physical processes by the constructed biochemical reactions. The parts can be assembled into modules in order to assemble more complex pathways, having similarity with the integrated circuits. Connection of pathways and their integration into host cells allow researchers to extend or modify the behaviour of cells in a programmatic fashion (2).
The world calls for a better Assembly System
The Registry of Standard Biological Parts and iGEM make use of the Standard Assembly of BioBricks formulated by Tom Knight.   The BioBrick Standard Assembly makes use of the restriction recognition sites of the four restriction enzymes EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI. The BioBricks are flanked by a prefix and a suffix containing the restriction recognition sites EcoRI, XbaI, and SpeI, PstI, respectively. To ensure a correct assembly the BioBricks cannot contain any of these four restriction recognition sites. This means that if any of these four restriction recognition sites are present, they will have to be eliminated by alterations like site-directed mutagenesis, which can be time consuming and laborious. In developing new BioBricks from natural sources and higher organism such as eukaryotes the illegal restriction sites can be a problem. Furthermore, when assembling BioBricks with the Standard Assembly System scars between the Biobricks are introduced, this can be a problem for the construction of fusion proteins. Additionally, the BioBrick Assembly Standard has the drawback that only two BioBricks can be assembled at a time (3).
All in all, the iGEM competition and the fast growing field of synthetic biology calls for a simpler, faster and more efficient assembly system that is easily applied to both bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells.

Wenn Ethikseminar bzw. Workshop zum Thema Ethik in ""Wissenschaft/Biomedizin/...(andere interessante Themen)"" dann wäre das ganze über die Junior-GMB finanzierbar (Flyer, Getränke usw.)
Möglicher Termin: Vor der Klausurzeit, damit alle Zeit haben, viele da sind und somit viele Teilnehmen kommen könnten.
Alternative wäre Umfrage über Gentechnik/synthetische Biologie:
Umfrage von Parteien beantworten zu lassen
Umfrage direkt von Politikern beantworten lassen (ohne Pressesprecher)
Umfrage von ""Menschen auf der Straße""
Vernetzung der iGEM-Teams: Bochum, Darmstadt und andere Team innerhalb von Deutschland (der Einfachhalt halber...) sollen vernetzt werden, um die Rahmenbedingungen des iGEM-Wettbewerbs zu erfüllen.
Softwareteam - Entwicklung einer Applikation für Android-basierte Systeme um so die Protokollierung und den generellen Laboralltag zu vereinfachen (Puffer berechnen, Archivieren von Proben, Arbeitsprotokolle abrufen usw.)

- annealing temperature (Tm) is of 58 - 65 C. Forward and reverse primers of the Tm value difference should not exceed 4 degrees, otherwise the amplification effect is not ideal. Note that the evaluation of Tm values should be based on primer 3 (gene specificity), rather than on the whole primer. If Tm is too low, we can appropriately extend the part of primer with gene specificity until Tm reaches 58 - 65 degrees C. - do not contain successive identical nucleotides. The last 5 nucleotides of each primer '3' should not contain more than 2 guanine (G) or cytosine (C).

Project Description
Creating ‘The E.ncapsulator’: in situ manufacture and oral delivery of biopharmaceuticals
A major, yet unsolved, challenge in the pharmaceutical industry involves overcoming the harsh acidic environment of the stomach in order to deliver proteins to the gut. This year the Imperial College iGEM team has decided to tackle this problem by developing an innovative, self-contained drug fabrication and delivery system. In The E.ncapsulator, Escherichia coli will be engineered not only to efficiently manufacture important biopharmaceuticals, but also to coat and protect protein based drugs until release in the small intestine.
Furthermore, in order to create E.ncapsulator tablets for oral delivery, there has been much focus on designing and engineering a number of modules for implementation in E.coli. The modularity that is central to our project will be evident in the areas of protein drug production, self-encapsulation and genome deletion. Utilising the E.coli bacterium, we are creating a re-usable chassis that will allow the development of a range of biopharmaceuticals to be delivered to the gut. The E.ncapsulator is therefore intended as an elegant solution to, not one, but a range of human ailments and conditions, which cannot currently be successfully treated by oral drugs.
The first module involves engineering E.coli to synthesise the protein drug of interest to sufficient quantities. Once accomplished, activation of module two initiates the encapsulation phase, in which E.coli coats itself in a protective layer of colanic acid to form The E.ncapsulator. This protective capsule is what shields the biopharmaceutical against the harsh acidic environment of the stomach. The third module, genome deletion, is composed of a ‘suicide trigger’ mechanism that destroys the genetic material of the bacteria. Finally, once in the small intestine, the capsule will be naturally degraded by enzymes present, thereby releasing the designed biopharmaceutical to the gut micro biota where it can carry out its intended function.
The self-encapsulation of a synthetic biology chassis is new to iGEM and represents a completely novel and innovative approach to biopharmaceutical design, manufacture and delivery. Throughout the project we have followed an engineering approach that incorporates modular design, detailed modelling and simulation as well as systematic integration. Using such an approach, we are hopeful that The E.ncapsulator will be coming soon to a Pharmacy near you!

Team:USTC Software/projectIntro
From 2010.igem.org
Overall Project
The ultimate goal of USTC_Software 2010 team is to promote synthetic biology throughout the world. To attract more people who do not have biology background to be interested in this area, we plan to develop a modeling-and-simulation game specially designed for synthetic biology. Users are taught to learn the basic knowledge in the area via constructing their genetic circuits as input to our software and try to understand the system behavior as output. This is the basic functional module. We also plan to develop a rating system to grade users' design for given tasks, and a more friendly game interface that can fill the process of input with joy and ease. Though more functions are expected, we focus on the basic module, modeling-and-simulation, at the first stage of our project.
In practice, many CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as guides. However, they all need users to provide details of the system network, such as the activation and repression of transcription and translation reactions in genetic regulatory network. It is so difficult for even professionals to construct a detailed network of a complex system depending only on their minds. In this sense, modeling through CAD tools will not reduce the work of modeling: users are actually required to model manually and input their model in details.
However, since our software is developed for non-biological background users, it is unrealistic to expect them to model their design manually. To solve this problem, the USTC_Software 2010 team attempts to take synthetic biology modeling one step further by introducing new methods for automatic modeling of biological systems. Just as the word automation implies, users are only required to submit their assembling of parts, and the generation of biological model is automatically done by our program. Being the first-ever team trying to develop a synthetic biology automatic modeling tool, we focus on genetic regulatory network for the first year and develop our software tool, iGaME, which will assist the design of genetic function modules for biological systems in synthetic biology. We believe this will greatly relieve users from handling complex interactions of species in biological system.
Many novel and revolutionary concepts are proposed during our development. The first is our Chain-Node model for complex structure with multiple chains bound together. It is necessary for automation since behaviors of species (such as how it react with other species) must be determined by their structures instead of their names:"
Toronto,2018,Team:Toronto#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\big(y(t)\mu(t)\big) = h(t)\mu(t)$$
 
Integrate, divide by μ(t) ⟹ y(t).
Assumptions
The biomass separates into clumps that can be approximated by spheres.
Buoyant force is constant.
Cell motility and in-plane motion (motion perpendicular to the vertical axis) is negligible. This effectively reduces our system to one dimension.
The Model
Stokes-Einstein, gravitational force near the surface of the earth Fg = mg (g ≈ 9.81 ms − 2), Newton’s second law lets us write:
$$\label{Fnet}     F_{net} = F_g + F_B + F_D \implies m\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} = -mg + F_B - 6\pi \eta R v$$
Equation 6.
Rearrange...
$$\label{theODE}     \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{6\pi \eta R}{m}v = \big(\frac{F_B}{m} - g\big)$$
Equation 7.
Simplify notation with $$\alpha := \frac{6\pi \eta R}{m}$$ and $$\beta := \big(\frac{F_B}{m} - g\big)$$ we have:
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} + \alpha v = \beta$$
Equation 8.
Observe the model is now in the form of equation [5] .
3.3 Analytic Solution
Now to get a solution we can directly apply the integrating factor method as described in the Concepts sections.
 
The integrating factor is:
$$\begin{equation}\label{mu}       \mu(t) = \mathrm{e}^{\alpha t}     \end{equation}$$
Equation 9.
Multiplying both sides we have:
$$\label{integrate}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\big(v\mathrm{e}^{\alpha t} \big) = \beta \mathrm{e}^{\alpha t}$$
Equation 10.
Now we integrate, divide by integrating factor, and impose an initial condition of v(t = 0) = 0 ms − 1 (not moving initially):

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#shadow#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," consumes significantly less land, water, and other resources [1].
But that’s not all. From sucrose derived from sugarcane in Brazil to glucose extracted from corn in the USA, the demand for sugar sources in biomanufacturing competes with demands for animal feeds and human consumption [2]. Additionally, sugarcane farming takes a substantial toll on the environment, fuelling deforestation, soil degradation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss [3].
Our team realized that we needed to ensure that our bioproduction method is itself eco-friendly and sustainable. We thus turned to lignocellulosic waste. It is the underutilized, non-edible portion of plants found in empty fruit bunches, the major biomass byproduct of the palm oil industry [4]. This is incinerated in abundant quantities in plantations all over Indonesia, the largest palm oil producer in the world, contributing to air pollution and haze [4] which plague her neighbours, including Singapore.
All these burning issues can be alleviated if we can feed lignocellulosic waste to our bacteria. However, there is a major hurdle. Xylose and glucose are the major constituents of lignocellulose, and economically feasible bioconversion requires one to use both sugars at the same time. Unfortunately, this is hindered by carbon catabolite repression (CCR), a regulatory mechanism where expression of genes necessary for the utilization of secondary carbon sources is suppressed by the presence of a preferred substrate, which is often glucose (Figure 2a and b) [5].
Figure 2. Relieving carbon catabolite repression of xylose.
a, Xylose activates the xylose regulatory operon protein, XylR. However, the presence of glucose inhibits the activation of cAMP receptor protein, CRP. Without the activated CRP, XylR is unable to bind to its binding site at the operator, and RNA polymerase, RNAP, cannot bind to the promoter and transcription does not take place.
b, In the absence of glucose, CRP is activated and forms a complex with XylR. This complex binds to the bidirectional operator at the respective binding sites of the proteins, facilitating the binding of RNAP and transcription of the xylose metabolic genes, XylA and XylB, and the transport genes, XylF, XylG, and XylH.
c, The mutant XylR* is able to bind to the operator without the need to form a complex with CRP, hence transcription takes place even in the presence of glucose.
Recently, CCR"

Policy
As part of our project development, we researched the different regulations and directives that could be applied to our project, as a Recombinant Live Biotherapeutic Product (LBP), and despite our best efforts, we were surprised over the lack of information covering this topic. This made us realise that we would not be able to gather and map all the regulations related to our project on our own.
For this reason, we decided to get in contact with Erik Forsse, a senior adviser (specialist) at the Director’s Office at Karolinska Institutet, who works with investigations, analyses and the processing of in-coming public consultations. He explained that the current regulations for a project like ours does not exist, and inspire us to create a policy of our own.
Even with the support and knowledge that Erik had provided us, we understood that we needed to contact someone working with more in-depth knowledge about regulations. We contacted Katarina Mercer, Senior Advisor for Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs at Scandinavian Development Services. She, once again, confirmed that there are no available regulations for our project. Katarina supported us in how we could develop our own policy by guiding us through similar cases and by providing us an insight in product development and what strategies we could use.
Additionally, we reached out to the Medical Products Agency (Swedish: Läkemedelsverket), the government agency in Sweden responsible for regulation and surveillance of the development, manufacturing and sales of medicinal drugs, medical devices and cosmetics. We talked to Åsa Kumlin Howell, international coordinator at the medical products agency, and she stated.
“This has been shown to be a hard question to answer, and after some research I haven't been able to find any legislation that regulates live biotherapeutic bacteria.”
From these meetings we were able to determine our strategy for the policy we were aiming to create. The first part of the policy is an introduction to all current regulations regarding GMOs, live biother"

If we allow it initiates new replication                             process (release its OriC), it would initiate many OriC to recovery itself, but the previous                             model didn’t describe this phenomenon, so we define a new parameter “d” to make supplement.

If oriC is blocked longer than Tr1, we have several analysis: The constraint condition of recovering                             to normal: $\dfrac{lnV-lnV_{std}}{\mu}-N\dfrac{ln2}{\mu}-k(\dfrac{ln2}{\mu}-d) <0$ K means the number of replication forks, d means minimum folk formation interval, N means                                     the number of replication forks exist in the bacteria. The above formula is transformed, so that it can be solved directly: $k>\dfrac{lnV-lnV_{std}-Nln2}{ln2-\mu d}$ Because k is an integer, the formula add. so it’s better for computer calculation $k=\lceil\dfrac{lnV-lnV_{std}-Nln2}{ln2-\mu d}\rceil$ We get the mean of k, the dividing time for the bacteria to recover to normal is: N+k Finally calculate the time for bacteria to recover from abnormal to normal after oriC is                                     released. $T_{r2}=T_{C}+T_{D}+d(k-1)$ It is worth notice that when the number of bacterial liabilities is less than 2, the minimum                                     interval between two bifurcation must be less than ln2 / u, otherwise the bacteria will                                     be dragged down by the new debt on the way of repayment and will not return to normal.

Peking,2013,Team:Peking#Project#Plugins_-_-_TEXT.html," could successfully respond to benzyl alcohols without perturbing its response to benzoates. The detection limit of benzyl alcohol was around 3 uM. Through Adaptor XylB, typical aromatic alcohols are also included in the detection profile of our biosensor toolkit.
NahF
NahF is a 50.8 KDa protein functioning as salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase to transform salicylaldehyde into salicylic acid (salicylate) using NAD+ (Fig. 9). It is encoded in the naphthalene degradation plasmid from Pseudomonas putida, in which the oxidation of naphthalene has been extensively investigated. Plasmid pDTG1, NAH7 and pND6-1 identified in different P. putida strains all act to degrade naphthalene and share high identity in amino acid sequences [11] .
NahF from plasmid NAH7 is most widely studied. It has a wide range of substrates (including salicylaldehyde, 5-chloro-salicylaldehyde, 3-nitro-benzaldehyde, 2-methoxy-benzaldehyde etc.) and its activity can be further enhanced 40.3% in the presence of Fe2+ [12] . The wide range of substrates makes it an appropriate candidate to be an Adaptor since many aldehydes can be transformed to the corresponding acids that can be detected by NahR (for salicylates) or XylS (for benzoates).
NahF has been expressed in E.coli and its ability to catalyze the reaction in vitro and in vivo has been verified [13-14] . However, its reaction efficiency when expressed in E.coli was only about 3% of that when expressd in P. putida, possibly due to the difference of regulation in these two bacteria [13] . Therefore, it is necessary to fine-tune the expression level of NahF in E.coli. We built a library of constitutive promoters for tuning the expression of NahF, and NahR biosensor was used to detect the possible salicylates transformed from salicylaldehydes (Fig. 10).
The performance of NahF Adaptor was tested following protocol similar to that of XylC. Bacteria carrying NahF enzyme was cultured overnight in LB medium at 37 °C  and then diluted 100 fold into Minimal M9 medium, growed for 12 hours at 30 °"

* NOTE: The volume depends on the concentration of the sample.
Make sure to keep the QR-code and note down what sample it is affiliated with. Deliver the tubes for sequencing to the manufacturer and await results.
Results are evaluated in silico by aligning expected sequences with obtained sequences and calculating the match percentage.
Serum DNA Extraction
This protocol is an adaptation of the original QIAGEN QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit protocol .
Important points before starting
All centrifugation steps are carried out at room temperature (15–25°C).
Use carrier DNA if the sample contains <10,000 genome equivalents (see page 17).
200 μl of whole blood yields 3–12 μg of DNA. Preparation of buffy coat (see page 18) is recommended if a higher yield is required.

100 mg of DCD-1L is recovered from per kg of input, resulting in 4518 euros. The approximate range, however, will be 3500-4500 euros for 100 mg of DCD-1L. Hence we have brought down the cost of DCD-1L production 10 times lower using synthetic biology technique as compared to chemical synthesis. Costs will go down with larger batch sizes and a continuous fermentation process.
Our cost of the product needs to be estimated yet based on final packaging and formulations used. Below, there is a rough estimation of the monthly product costs for the customer. Note! The estimation below does not take into account possible preservatives and exfoliating agents, which will also be added in the final product.

We aren’t getting RFP right now … what’s wrong? a. We need to determine what primers were used to amplify the HapR and Qrr4 out of cholera b. What is the difference between pIG78 A and pIG78 B? There are two plasmids that are the same? We hope to KNOW the answers to these questions by Thursday 2.     Clone CI behind Qrr4 promoter; determine where in plasmid and order primers order primers 3.     Clone CRO behind HapR promoter DONE by Mid-May 4.     Modify tails of phage (after C1 and CRO steps complete) DONE by summer 5.     If possible, use selectable marker on phage to purify many E. Coli that have prophage incorporated into the genome. So these are the steps we set out, we need to discuss with Dr. Grose where we should be the C1 and CRO genes, because the plasmid is already very full. Personally, I need to understand the plasmid we’re using, the Lambda repression circuit, and the Lambda tail proteins better.

KK 4/8/2013 The other cholera-subgroup is successfully growing biofilm. They have found that cholera biofilm grows best in a salty solution (their best imitation of seawater) at 37 C. Today we set up a quick experiment to see how our pIG78d+ E.Coli would respond to the presence of cholera. Using a cholera sample that was NOT growing much biofilm (the sample had been grown in normal LB at 30 C), we set up 5 test tubes. 1. 4 mL plain LB 2. 4 mL plain LB + 500 microL V.Cholerae solution 3. 4 mL plain LB + pIG78D DH5alpha E.Coli 4. 4 mL plain LB + 100 microL V.

Only if four single HheC compose as a tetramer can it catalyze dehalogenation. Measuring the activity of HheC in chimeric protein, DhaA+P2A+HheC is an ideal way to detect the effect of P2A peptide. The purified enzyme, HheC and DhaA+P2A+HheC chimeric protein was isolated by AKTA FPLC. Using 1,3-DCP as substrate, HheC specific activity was 6.72(U/mg) and the fusion protein specific activity is 5.28(U/mg). It indicates that the 2A peptide is an excellent linker to compose the two enzymes function together.
FIG.6 lane7 and lane8 are blank control; lane1 and lane3 are DhaA and HheC. In the lane5 and lane6, HheC and DhaA bands can’t be found, a part of DhaA+P2A+HheC are solved, P2A peptide sequence can’t cleave DhaA and HheC. In the sediment, there are also inclusion protein.

Colorimetric method is a way of detecting the concentration of Cl-(refer to protocol). The solved chimeric protein DhaA+P2A+HheC could degrade 1,3-DCP and TCP. The inclusion protein doesn’t have any activity.
Polycistronic co-expression system constructed
In polycistronic co-expression system, the quantity of HheC was less than DhaA and LinB is less than LinA(FIG.9). Because the gene is further from promoter, the expression is less. That is why we want to utilize 2A peptide in prokaryotic system.
FIG.9 (a) In the lane5 and lane6, LinA and LinB are expressed, according to the bands, the quantity of LinB is less than LinA. (b) In the lane1 and lane2, there are both bands of DhaA  and  HheC, the quantity of DhaA is more than HheC.

For the above 3 figures, the first 3 subfigures are the results of 3 kinds of miRNA in the sample’s whole saliva, and the last 4 subfigures are the results of 4 kinds of miRNA in the sample’s saliva supernatant. The results are not satisfying. We assume that it is because the dataset collected is not large enough.
Application of different kinds of classifiers
Fisher Linear Discriminant:
Logistic Regression and SVM with linear kernel:
Logistic Regression and SVM are 2 kinds of commonly used classifiers which belong to the domain of machine learning. For this problem, considering the scale of the dataset and the number of features (see Machine Learning Lecture 12 on Coursera), it is most appropriate to use SVM with Gaussian kernel. This method was tried and the outcome was good. However, we decide not to choose this method. The reason is that Gaussian kernel or other more complex kernels transform the original features to another set of features, which is difficult to realize in in vivo biological systems, and the parameters obtained are hard to be transformed back to those of miRNA concentration.
Tuning the Parameters:
Considering randomness, regularization is added to the model and the parameter needs to be chosen. Take logistic regression for whole saliva as an example. The regularization parameter is lambda, and the following routine is applied:
Step 1: Set up a vector lambdas of the parameter lambda, each element of which is a value to be tested. To start with, the vector was [0.0001; 0.0003; 0.001; 0.003; 0.01; 0.03; 0.1; 0.3; 1; 3; 10].
Step 2: Set up a k * kk zero matrix called Evaluation, to take down the time that one particular value of lambda has satisfied the criteria which will be discussed later. k is the length of the vector lambdas, while kk is the time that an evaluation for the whole vector is implemented.
Step 3: The evaluation procedure is a triple loop. The outer loop is from 1 to kk; the middle loop is from 1 to 100 (This number can be modified); the inner loop is from 1 to k. We take one outer loop as an example. For one middle loop, we randomly split the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set consists of 31 positive examples and 15 negative examples, while the test set 8 and 4. Then we go into the inner loop, which"

Application of Thermodynamic Model of Cooperative Repression
To recap the derivation from the previous section, the key equation for thermodynamic model of cooperative repression is:
Figure 1. Recap of Thermodynamic Model
In this section, the above model will be explored; specifically, the relationship between the red-colored terms will be studied. First, the relationship between Pbound and the number of Freg's will show the effect of changing number of binding sites on level of gene expression. Then, the relationship between Pbound and KSrd (Dissociation constant of repressor bound to DNA) will show the effect of changing binding strengths of repressors on level of gene expression.

Figure 2. Pbound vs. Number of Freg's
As highlighted in the equation shown above, the relationship between Pbound and the number of Freg's was studied. The variables and their values used are summarized below.
Figure 3. Meaning and Value of Variables Used
First, the basal level of Pbound was calculated using Freg = 1 (no Transcription Factors). Then, the Pbound values for the three cases--1 binding site, 3 binding sites, and 5 binding sites--were calculated for repressor level"

Biobrick Primers for Universal Transcriptional and Translational Regulation
Ribosomal Binding Site Insertion
Purpose
The RBS primer is a standard primer that can be used for site directed mutagenesis in all linearized backbones available from the iGEM database.
such and such and such and such and such and such and such
Background
Most BioBrick parts require a Ribosomal Binding Site to express the protein. This has proven problematic as the RBS is very small and hard to insert using 3A Assembly. We believe the creation of an oligo primer with this RBS may be easier to place the RBS in front of the protein that is needed to be expressed. An easy oligo primer that could be used in PCR extension and then placed into a vector backbone would save time and frustration as to whether the part had been inserted.
such and such
Design
The format of this primer needs the BioBrick formatted prefix with an additional strong Ribosomal binding site within it. The prefix of the standard BioBrick was analyzed and the primer was found to be able to be inserted after the XbaI site and still have the scar intact between the part and the RBS site. The RBS sites chosen were selected from the Anderson RBS library degenerate sequence and a library was created with that degenerate sequence via the Salis Lab at Penn State University, optimized for E. coli 16s.
Promoter Sequence Insertion
Purpose
The Promoter primer is a standard primer that can be used for site directed mutagenesis in all linearized backbones available from the iGEM database and the Anderson RBS sites from the Anderson RBS library.
Background
Most BioBrick parts require a Promoter to express the protein. This has proven problematic as the promoter is very small and hard to insert using 3A Assembly. We believe the creation of an oligo primer with this promoter may be easier to place the promoter in front of the RBS site that is needed to be expressed.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C"
Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," 2015, about 7 in 10 adults suffer the problem of being overweight or even being obese, and it is predicted that this problem will become apparent in more adults in the near future. One of the major factors that leads to obesity is “sugar”, which is found in beverages, desserts, and almost any kind of food. Thus, it is quite difficult not to absorb an excessive amount of sugar in our daily lives. In the hopes of preventing our bodies from absorbing too much glucose, our team aims to engineer bacteria that absorbs glucose more efficiently. Our team constructed active glucose transporters on the membrane of E.coli, enabling the glucose uptake to become faster than intestine cells. On the other hand, our team has designed a suicide circuit ensuring the bacteria won’t absorb all the sugar so that the body can get an adequate amount of sugar.

Contemporary Salon
To understand what doubt people will react when seeing our product and to increase the extent of public acceptance, we invited The Mingdao Voice, an outstanding club for thinking and discussing. We introduced our project to them during the club time in the hope of getting inspiring feedback. 
 
 
The Mingdao Voice is a club organized by students themselves in Mingdao High School. Students there follow social issue with interest and hold lots of lectures, sharing thoughts with audiences. Quite unique this club is. 
 
This is the first time Mingdao iGEM jumps out of the field of science and collaborate with the elite in humanities and social science. The way they think against the holistic issue and the speech hitting the nail on the head made us realize more about the further influence our product will bring to the world if released. 
The followings are what we discussed with The Mingdao Voice :
Research has indicated that there will be a subtle decline in weight by reducing sugar intake in daily diet. The study lasted for about 8 months. The average decline on weight is about 1.7 bounds. Participants who consumed more sugar gain not much weight than those didn’t. 
“There is also evidence that the longer the study, the more striking the effect.” said researcher Jim Mann, DM, PhD, professor of human nutrition and medicine at the University of Otago.

Facilitate the Synthesis
We have agreed upon the fact that the rate of bacterial production is dependent upon the rate of synthesis and efflux, while all other cellular parameters are kept the same. Therefore, after choosing lmrA initially as the transporter, we start out to seek ways for overproducing surfactin.  At first, we wanted to use CRISPRa(a for activation) to target the surfactin synthase operon. Doing so is relatively easy theoretically since we only need to express the dCas9-VP64 fusion protein and the guide RNA with an appropriate target sequence to achieve upregulation. However, we discussed with the team from Peking University and realized that CRISPRa may be cumbersome for Bacillus subtilis - even a basal level expression of the system can be a burden. And if we choose CRISPRa, we would have to spend lots of time to tweak it, making the plan less desirable.
Other plans such as overexpressing certain transcriptional factors proved to be unviable because of the pleiotropism of those genes, which means that the overexpression is bound to disturb other parts of cellular metabolism. Finally, we found sfp, encoding a 4’-phosphopantetheinyl transferase, that could specifically boost surfactin production by overriding a limiting step in surfactin synthesis: the transfer of the 4-phosphopantetheinyl moiety of coenzyme A to a serine residue in the peptidyl carrier protein(PCP) domain, allowing further “elongation” of the nonribosomal polypeptide surfactin. (More detail is discussed in the description part.)  Later, we also modeled the PCP activation process to gain more insight into the effect of sfp.
Export the Product
The next step was to find a suitable way to export the newly synthesized surfactin from our engineered Bacillus subtilis. We first investigated the feasibility of using lmrA to export surfactin. Though we didn’t find any experimental data of lmrA exporting sfp, we did find papers describing lmrA’s affinity to similar drug molecules. We also did an in silico modeling to check if lmrA does form a binding pocket for surfactin so that the efflux process is possible theoretically. To make our project more feasible, we also found a secondary option that involves overexpressing YerP. This protein is a lipopeptide transporter-dependent on proton motive"

MagneGST Protein Purification
Preparation of Cells:
Bacterial cultures can be grown in tubes or flasks. Grow the culture containing the appropriate GST-fusion protein (GST-spycatcher) to an O.D.600 between 0.4 and 0.6, then induce protein expression. For IPTG induction, add IPTG till final concentration of 0.4mM-1mM and incubate at 37℃ for 3 h or at 16℃ overnight. Depending upon the expression system, other methods of induction and growth conditions can be used. Induction conditions often require optimization. For 1ml bacterial cultures, pellet cells by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 3 min and carefully remove the supernatant. For culture volumes larger than 1 ml, pellet the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 20 min. Carefully remove the supernatant. The cell pellet can be frozen at –20℃ or–70℃ for long-term storage, or the cells can be lysed immediately.
Cell Lysis:
1. Prepare cell pellets from bacterial culture. Remove all growth medium. Recommended: Freeze the cell pellets at –20℃ (15–20 min is usually sufficient) or on dry ice for 5–10 min. Freezing cell pellets will increase efficiency of cell lysis of certain strains, such as the BL21 series of strains, or when cultures are grown to a high density. For cultures of O.D.600 >2, more lysis buffer will be required.
2.Resuspend the pellet in MagneGST Cell Lysis Reagent at room temperature (20–25℃) by pipetting or gentle mixing. (for 500 ml of bacteria culture, use 10 ml of MagneGST Cell Lysis Reagent)
3.Incubate the cell suspension at room temperature for 20–30 min on a rotating platform or shaker and then sonicate for 1 min.
Particle Equilibration:
1. Thoroughly resuspend the MagneGST particles by inverting the bottle to obtain a uniform suspension.
2. Pipet 100 μl of MagneGST particles into a 1.5 ml tube.
3. Place the tube in the magnetic stand, and allow the MagneGST particles to be captured by the magnet.
4. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.

The chemotaxis mechanism in E. coli can be illstustrated as following:
When absence of chemical, there is no molecule binds to chemorecptor, cheW, an intracellular protein, is associated with cheA and cheA will autophosphorylate itself and capture phosphate group from ATP. Later, phosphate will be transferred to cheY and the phosphorylated cheY associates with the flagellar motors making flagellum rotates clockwise. In general, bacteria tumble in the absence of chemical.
When presence of chemicals, cheA is free from cheW interation, and cheZ will efficiently remove phosphate group from cheY. Those dephosphorylated cheY cannot bind with flagellar motors, and consequently, flagellar rotats counter-clock which can be observed as bacteria swim directly. In some special situation, cheR will methylates chemoreceptors to remain the disasscoation between cheA and cheW. Then, bacteria will still swim without tumbles.
Genetically Engineered Chemotaxis Bacteria
Because of lack of natural chemoceptor for antibiotics, we need to construct a genetic circuit specifically to sensing antibiotics, and according to the mechanism of chemotaxis, we need to overexpress cheZ to improve its phosphorlation capability on cheY. The model is illstruated as following:
Adhesion Module
What Material we Implement?-Theoratical Analysis
In order to produce slight deformation of polymer membrane, we need to find a proper membrane to form this phenomenon. According to our modeling, see more in Modeling-Determination of Polyer Membrane Candidate , pressure caused by adhesive membrane is about 10^-4 Pa. Consequently, the wavelength of laser about 650nm is able to detect um-scale deformation and considering cm sqaured film, we need the Young's Modulus of membrane is smaller than 1GPa.
The Young's Modulus of polyproylane is about 1.5Gpa, so it is selected as our candidate polymer membrane.
How to Achieve Stable Adhesion?
Bacterial adhereing to polymer membrane is one of the most important part in CACCI.In order to make bacteria binding tightly, chemically covalent bind of bacteria with polymer membrane maybe promising.
So we decided to implement the parts from 2014 iGEM TU_Eindhoven, and the whole system including these parts:

2. The hypothesis on the relationship between NcrB concentration and the copy number of the recombinant vector.
Since each of the recombinant vector contains only one copy of the target gene, we can assume that the vectors have the same ability of expressing NcrB. Furthermore, it’s reasonable to assume that the final concentration of NcrB is proportional to the copy number of the recombinant vector.
3. The hypothesis on the concentration of NcrB during the process in which Ni and pncrA bind with NcrB competitively
There are three subtypes of NcrB in the cell: the free state NcrB, the NcrB binding with pncrA and the NcrB binding with Ni2+. We assume that the concentration of total NcrB is not influenced by the expression of NcrB gene or its degradation process, because the speed of these two processes is relatively low compared with the competitively binding process. More importantly, based on this hypothesis, we can further assume that the concentration of free state NcrB remains constant during the process of competitive binding. This is because the kinetics feature of the process is similar to enzymatic reactions.

Targeting a Deadly Toxin
Explosions in the population of cyanobacteria can produce toxic algal blooms. Microcystin-LR the most potent and common algal bloom toxin, binds Protein Phosphatase 1. The average cyanobacteria infested lake in America contains over 1000 times the Microcystin safe drinking water limit set by the World Health Organisation.
Concerned by a harmful algal bloom in the local community, we used synthetic biology to target the toxin. We exploited the mechanism of Microcystin's toxicity to develop our Mop; by expressing Protein Phosphatase 1 we can mop up Microcystin. The interaction was also the basis for developing a biological Detector. To deploy our Detector and to consider the root causes of algal blooms we created the electronic Moptopus. It sits on a lake and monitors conditions relevant to cyanobacterial growth to help predict future blooms.
Mop
Mopping up a toxin (microcystin) by engineering a bacterium to produce the human PP1 protein, the protein to which microcystin binds.
Detector
Detecting microcystin by manipulation of the E. coli osmoregulator EnvZ.
Moptopus
An electronic sensing device that provides a platform for toxin detection. It relates a range of environmental conditions to algal bloom formation and toxicity.

Clostridium dTox
It's not so difficile
What is C. difficile infection?
Clostridium difficile infection is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in the Western World and is a big problem in hospitals and care-facilities.

What is the problem?
A consequence of antibiotic misuse and the capability of bacteria to readily evolve has allowed antibiotic resistance to become a worldwide major dilemma.

What are we going to do?
The goal of our project is to engineer a phage which will infect C. difficile and express genetic constructs designed to suppress toxin production.

NPU-China,2018,Team:NPU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," set up a positive example for us to create a single-chromosome genome of                         Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae, inspiring us to challenge the impossible of life and strive to create new life.
3.Bigger Picture of Mitochondrial Research：
We contacted Professor Gu Zhenglong, who has long been working on mitochondrial research. Prof.                         Gu                         systematically                         introduced the biological and genetic background of mitochondria, through which we have learned                         about                         the                         important                         effects of mitochondria in cellular aerobic respiration, cancer and multi-gene regulation.                         Today,                         mitochondrial gene                         editing still remains a difficult task, and choosing to re-deliver through the entire genome                         may be                         a                         possible way                         that leads to the discovery of something new. [5]
4.Bigger Picture of Gene (Genome) Synthesis Technology：
Through the communication with Dr. Jiang [2] and the speech by Dr. Dai [4], we learned a lot                         about                         the                         artificial                         life, which was preliminarily a work that only God can achieve. Plus, we also accessed the                         classic                         cases                         where                         small-scale viral genes were synthesized to large-scale Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes.
We learned about OGAB gene synthesis technology from the speech by Professor Akihiko Kondo [1],                         the                         gene                         synthesis                         technology from TACG BioTech system [7], the answer to the ""source of artificial life"" from                         TSINGKE                         BioTech. [3],                         and the commercial application mode of gene synthesis technology from GENERAL BIOSYSTEMS [6]
Furthermore, we have gained a new perspective on DNA and life in the course of DNA Time Capsule                         activity.                         [10]
These exchanges and activities portrayed for us the complete “Bigger Pictures” that are                             directly                             or                             indirectly                             related to our project, which has greatly expanded our vision of the project and imparted                             us                             with                             substantially                             important knowledge and left valuable spiritual wealth to us.
Absolutely, what we have harvested from these HP activities is not merely confined to the                             exploration                             of “Bigger                             Picture”, benefitting us even more in the following four aspects:
Objective:
Recommendations from Dr. Jiang on the preferential selection of relatively small mitochondrial                         genomes                         [2]                         and Prof.                         Gu's introduction of the importance of mitochondria in life activities in eukaryotes and the                         difficulty                         of                         genetic                         editing [5], as well as other professionals' assessment of our project made us clear about the                         objective of                         our                         project this"

A 3D surface of that graph was obtained and a slice of the graph are shown below:
While in some amounts of inducer concentrations, the system seems tunable, it is not nearly as robust as the model predicts. Thus, we turned to our toxin/antitoxin system as a new approach to tuning communities of cells.

miRNAs function as posttranscriptional regulators which have distinguished features compared to transcriptional regulators, intervening late in gene expression process, with the capability to counteract variation from the upstream processes (Margaret et al., 2012). Research shows that while conducting experiment on an incoherent feedforward motif in mammalian cells, posttranscriptional regulation results in superior adaptation behavior, higher absolute expression levels and lower intrinsic fluctuations (Bleris et al., 2011). miRNAs can serve as buffers against variation during gene expression; transient increases in transcription factor activity would propagate to increases in target miRNA transcription while would be counteracted by increased miRNA and vice versa. Therefore, under the miRNA posttranscriptional regulation, protein output can be uncoupled from fluctuations in transcription factor concentration or activity (Margaret et al., 2012). miRNAs also possess good stability which, consistent with theoretical constraints, meets the need for enough molecules of a regulator to achieve a small reduction in the noise of a target gene (Lestas et al., 2010).
Experimental Characterization
We took advantage of another fluorescent protein(mkate ) as reference gene, which has no influence in our design. Published literature generally supports the view that in transient transfections, fluorescence depends linearly on the copy number of transfected plasmids (Tseng et al, 1997; Pollard et al, 1998;Cohenet al,2009; Schwakeet al, 2010). While strictly speaking, this reporter level also depends on many other potentially fluctuating parameters such as global synthesis and degradation rates(Leonidas Bleris et al,2011),it is more legitimately use the normalized quotient to instead of the value of EYFP.
Apparently, the output of circuit C is lower than circuit B .Having the negative feedback compared with circuit B, the expression of EYFP in circuit A is strongest. Then we analysed the output of constructed designs varies with the DNA copy number. Facing with the difficulty of counting the copy number directly, we employed the reference gene to reflect .We think the copy number is high when the expression intensity of mkate is strong. One hundred thousand positive Hela cells was collected to obtain the relationship between EYFP and make.
From the figure 2, we learned with the increase of the expression intensity of makte, the specific valve of EYFP and mkate decreases. In another word, the circuit A’s output reaches saturation fast with the increase of copy number. We came to a conclusion circuit"
