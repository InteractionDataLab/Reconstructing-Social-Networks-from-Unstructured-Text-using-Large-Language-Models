BABS_UNSW_Australia,2015,Team:BABS UNSW Australia#project#containment_-_-_TEXT.html," horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between bacteria. If a bacteria receives the pHlow plasmid (either by conjugation or uptake of the naked plasmid) but not the antitoxin plasmid the expression of the Tse2 will lead to cell death. This will prevent the spread of the pHlow system to other bacterial populations.
Design
There are several design considerations involved in the Toxin-antitoxin system, with the main being the naturally availability of alternative inducers. While IPTG does not occur naturally and is a much more potent inducer of the IPTG promoter, lactose can also induce expression.  If lactose is present in the external environment (and the bacteria are able to take it up) Tsi2 could be expressed, leading to recombinant bacteria surviving outside of a controlled laboratory environment. Using a more tightly regulated inducible promoter, or a purely artificial promoter could further ensure that no recombinant bacteria could escape from the laboratory.
On top of this, a new containment system would have to be found if the bacteria were living in mammalian cells.

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," designed such that the base pair edit on the starting repeat target sequence enables the gRNA to recognize the following repeat in the target sequence, and so on. By converting the upcoming portion of recording DNA to a binding site for the gRNA to recognize and make a new mutation, this process is repeated sequentially. The DOMINO system used Sanger sequencing coupled with an algorithm called Sequalizer (Sequence Equalizer) to determine position-specific mutation frequencies[5].
While both systems are able to record the strength of a stimulus, recording capability is limited to logging an average concentration of stimuli over a period of time. In order to obtain a timeline of events, sampling at multiple time points is required.
CUTSCENE: A Molecular Movie Camera
Our system, termed CUTSCENE, builds upon these foundations by designing a method of true chronological event recording. Rather than just obtaining a snapshot of the average amount of stimuli in a system over time, we wanted to record the dynamics in the system, enabling temporal resolution of stimuli.
CUTSCENE consists of E. coli containing high-copy recording plasmids and a low-copy writing plasmid. A recording plasmid can be thought of like a roll of unexposed film, with each frame being the equivalent to a short, repeating sequence of DNA. The writing plasmid contains our base editor along with two gRNAs. These gRNAs are controlled by separate inducible promoters. The first inducer controls the production of gRNA #1 and sets the cell into recording mode. This sgRNA directs the base editor to move along the DNA repeats, making mutations at a timed rate and constantly shifting which frame is in front of our base editor and available to record. The presence of a stimulus activates the promoter for sgRNA #2. Expression of this sgRNA directs the base editor to mark the current frame with a unique mutation and stops the recording process for that specific plasmid (the other plasmids continue recording). Once the recording process is complete, the DNA film can be developed through the use of Sanger sequencing or restriction enzyme digestion.
This system allows for noninvasive, real-time monitoring of analytes in a system. We use bacteria as our chassis organism, which provides the benefit of functioning in a variety of environments. As this system is limited only by the promoters that can be used to induce the second sgRNA, a variety of signals can be recorded, making the system a universal diagnostic tool. Some useful signals that can be measured include certain cytokines, pH, and pollutants. These could be utilized in diagnosing diseases such as cancers and peptic"

Feedback
We got a lot of questions form the students which shows their interests in our short talk. Even in the break time, we are still surrounded by the students, and the communication didn’t stop until the teacher of next class come.
The teachers showed highly attention about iGEM, and invited us to talk more in his office. We even started to talk about the possible ways of building the first ever iGEM team in KGHS. You can definitely looking forwards for the upcoming years.
Of course our ultimate goal is to inspire them to build a iGEM team, yet it might takes some time. Nevertheless we have tried our best to shared them our experience and introduction of iGEM. Maybe they can't understand all the technical details yet, but             we hope to buried a seed deep in their heart, irrigate with courage towards difficult task. Perhaps one day, they will rise as the prettiest flowers in the world, no matter in iGEM or other area.
After all, what really matters is the right way to do things, the right attitude toward knowledge and challenge. Those are things that irreplaceable.

This is our school second time participating in iGEM competition. If the members in first iGEM NCKU Tainan team is the seed, we want to be the root that makes iGEM NCKU Tai-nan can grow bigger and stronger. The first step of our long-term planning is           to officially es-tablish an after school club, and the first activities of this first ever after-school club is the 2017 NCKU Club Festival.
2017 NCKU Club Festival is on 2017/03/02-2017/03/03, the main goal is giving the students           in NCKU a chance to discover all the various clubs and find “the one”. This year has more than 100 clubs joined the festival.
On the other hand, it is a very good chance for us to promote iGEM and recruit new blood. What’s more? At that           time we haven't decided our topic yet, there is three candidate pro-jects that we want to do. All of them are meaningful and we just could not decide which one to choose. Therefore, we turned the dilemma to the students,"

Northeastern_Boston,2015,Team:Northeastern Boston#Open Source_-_-_TEXT.html," Substances Act does not prohibit drug-synthesizing microbes.
One hope is that synbio can be self-regulating. The same advances that will expose us to new forms of danger will also allow us to respond to them quickly.  The 2014 Ebola outbreak revealed just how spotty our rapid response protocol is, as current methods still took months to produce a viable vaccine. Similar issues exacerbated the H1N1 pandemic just 5 years earlier. Traditional vaccine production has a turnover time of approximately four months.  In 2009, Swine Flu took over 150,000 lives as vaccine stockpiles were emptied. Large scale outbreaks or engineered pathogens could easily render us defenseless. Fortunately, more efficient production methods are on the rise.  Transgenic plants can form products in a matter of weeks with no drop in quality. Engineered platforms such as microalgae have the potential to perform the lion’s share of the world’s vaccine production. However, it is critical that the development and standardization of these methods begins now.
Altogether, synbio is left unchecked by governmental policy, allowing it to thrive free from federal interference, but also opening the door for misuse and abuse. The field, along with its associated dangers, is still nebulous, yet will quickly permeate many aspects of life. The time is now, though, for us to ask ourselves, “Should we?”
Open Source Biology
David Adams considers the implications of open source biology
Many analogies have been drawn between biology and computing. DNA itself is a type of code which is read and processed to create the proteins that make up all living organisms. Theoretically, the logic used by programmers to build computers could be used in biological applications, albeit a different medium. The international genetically engineered competition (iGEM) is based around the creation and usage of standardized biobricks. These bricks allow bioengineers to apply logic to the design of genetically modified organisms. New bricks and the techniques needed to implement these parts are constantly being developed. As this continues, another association with computing is becoming apparent. That is the idea of open-source access.
In the software industry, open-source refers to functioning code that can be used freely by individuals. This freedom also gives the public free reign to modify the source code for their own purpose. A sense of community often develops around popular open-source software. Members of that community may test the code for bugs or security vulnerabilities. When these issues arise they can quickly be shared and fixed. This “peer review” creates a more robust program, often performing better than standard commercial software. In the field"

Short Summary
Our sophisticated software suite is composed of two connected modules for the analysis of unnatural base pairs in a specified target sequence: M.A.X and iCG. Oxford Nanopore sequencing data is processed by iCG to identify unnatural base pairs in a given target sequence. As an orthogonal method, our Mutational Analysis Xplorer (M.A.X) utilizes a customized database to find a suitable set of restriction enzymes for our enzyme based detection system. In addition, M.A.X represents a low-cost alternative for the analysis of mutations at a specific position, allowing all iGEM teams to conduct research on unnatural base pairs. Both modules form a powerful software suite, which is extremely helpful for research on unnatural base pairs. Examples are the analysis of mutation frequencies and fidelity of semi-synthetic DNA replication. We postulate that our suite is also applicable for the study of DNA modifications and epigenetics.
Nanopore Sequencing of DNA Containing Unnatural Bases

Introduction
Our understanding of the world is based on our senses, including vision, hearing, touch, olfactory and etc.. People with disability in sensing understand the world in a differently way.
Hearing loss, also known as hearing impairment, is a worldwide problem. There are more than 360 million hearing-impaired people around the world, accounting for 5% of the world’s total population. [1] Hearing loss causes inconvenience to people, for which hearing-impaired people lead a hard life comparing to normal hearing people when fitting into the society, suffering from problems like unemployment and etc..
This year, inspired by the status of hearing loss issues all over the world, we designed audio-genetics system with the hope of making progress in fundamental research on hearing mechanisms. Our Human Practice was naturally focused on the propagation of works we did and promotion of public concern about hearing-impaired people.
Education of synthetic biology
To enhance the public awareness about natural science and synthetic biology, we prepared lectures for people from different works of life.
1. Pupils & middle school students in rural areas in China
In summer 2016, our team members went to remote areas in Gansu and Sichuan Province in China for volunteer works. They taught primary and middle school students with synthetic biology in an imaginative and creative way. As a feedback, they drew pictures about what synthetic biology is in their mind.

Talk with Dr. Lutter about the applicability of our research within the medical field
To get a better overview of what the medical field would think of our research, we talked to Dr. Rene Lutter (is doing research at the Academic Medical Center (AMC), University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands into the functioning of granuloma in tuberculosis amongst others by analyzing  breath-condensate).
After we explained our project to this doctor he became very enthusiastic about the many possibilities one can do with it. Of course plenty more research is needed before one can actually use this in the medical field, but the beginning of our project will probably lead up to a new detection method in the medical field in the future. He gave a couple of examples that would be improved with this new detection method, those are listed below.
Intensive care
There are people coming to the intensive care with an unknown infection which can be deadly if not treated on time. Now a days doctors first need a sample of the infection, let the bacteria grow and identify it, and treat the patient with the right medicine. This whole process cost a lot of time, which some patients do not have unfortunately. If we would have a broad platform of detection many different gaseous compounds, the diagnosing of the unknown infections would be a lot faster and more people would cured.
Resistant TB
There are several types of resistant TB, which means that the medicine will not cure the TB from the patient. A patient gets resistant TB either from taking their medication wrong or directly from another resistant TB patient. Diagnosing if a patient has resistant TB takes approximately 2 months. With the upcoming technology one would be able to detect different compounds of a resistant TB, and one would find out quickly if someone is suffering from a"

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C"

Sequencing the genetic information of these phages has allowed us to construct multiple peptide suggestions that may bind to our nematodes’ surface proteins.  This would allow the biosensor to aggregate at the detection sites and create a stronger signal.
In our project, phage display has been used in a whole new way. Performing phage display on a whole organism is an unconventional and unpublished procedure. By creating a working protocol for the purpose of finding a specific binder for strongyles we have applied this Nobel-prize winning method in a new way

3 - Reporter System
After receiving the results from either the transcriptomics or the phage display, they need to be combined with a reported to get a functioning diagnostic tool (Worm Buster).  We have adapted and troubleshot the expression of a fluorescent chromoprotein, UnaG, to be able to detect our worms in both the intestines and in feces. This would enable a relatively simple and quantitative way for ranchers to detect the worms of interest, using a cheap UV lamp, a dark room, and a camera!
In order to make this a viable reporter system, we wanted to make sure the original biobrick part was functional.  We show how we tweaked this part in order to study if it works properly so that it could be potentially used in future studies.

4. Modelling
Economic Modelling
A good model is a great tool to study the simplified behaviour of a real world problem. Often it can be more a practical, time, and cost efficient way to study the model of the real world system. We aim to showing the economic impact of strongyles and anthelmintic resistance through this study.
Modeling Optimal Time Between Treatments
To make sure the unnecessary use of anthelmintics is minimized we have created a model that compares regular and optimal usage of anthelmintics. When referring to the optimal use of anthelmintics, this means that the horse only receives treatment when the amount of parasites exceeds a certain threshold. Our model calculates given the initial amount of worms on the pasture and in the horse. Ideally, the information could be used with the worm buster to get a better overall result of our project. Our solution will not only be able to tell how large the treatments should"

Tuebingen,2016,Team:Tuebingen#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," a flux variability analysis (FVA) of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1. The inferred model yielded only noisy, numerically zero, fluxes, which did not allow for conclusions. In contrast, the manually generated model of another Lacobacillus allowed sound knock-out testing. The top candidates were the phosphoglucomutase, the G6P-isomerase, and the G6P-dehydogenase. The latter two reactions were in our experiments.
After assessing the results with the biochemists of our group, we conclude that the FVA was biologically reasonable. This is even more so, because the knock-out candidates used in the experiments were verified by the FVA. As a consequence, we suggested to test a knock-out of the phosphoglucomutase. These promising initial results should be experimentally validated in follow-up studies. The simulation allowed the wet-lab group to reduce serendipities, and saved numerous try and error runs.
In our simulations, we were unable to prevent \(\alpha\)-G6P metabolism from taking place, because the metabolism is connected to more fluxes than the \(\beta\) isomer (nine compared to just two). Therefore, a small reflection upon the projects intend is needed: We intend to synthesise a model organism for fructose intolerance. Such an organism is unable to acquire energy (ATP) from G6P, which we want to achieve by reducing G6P metabolism while increasing F6P metabolism. A more precise question would have been to test if the atoms of G6P could be integrated in F6P of the glycolysis pathway. The analysis for that question would involve a system with detailed description of cell compartments and a more sophisticated objective function. However, the complexity of such an analysis could easily be extended to a significantly larger study. Therefore, we cannot give a definite answer within the scope of an iGem project! But still, our simpler analysis suggest that our project is plausible to be achieved.

BBa_K1934000 : RFP with Cellulose Binding Domains (CBDs)
To verify the efficacy of the CBDs for binding to the cellulose, we created this composite part in which the coding sequences for two different CBDs were fused respectively upstream and downstream of the coding sequence for RFP.
BBa_K1934030 : Streptavidin with CBD-CipA (Cellulosomal scaffolding protein A)
In order to test another type of CBDs, we created this composite part which presents the coding sequence of streptavidin followed by the coding sequence of CBD-CipA (Cellulosomal scaffolding protein A) protein. As CBD-CipA shows a better interaction with cellulose, this part is an improvement of the streptavidin with classical CBDs (BBa_K1499004) . We have submitted this part to the “Best new composite part” special prize.
Characterization of pTAC promoter
pTAC is a promoter that we used in our different composite parts (eg for surproduction of proteins). As it’s induced by IPTG, by linking a reporter gene downstream of pTAC, the two following parts allowed us to characterize the promoter's responsiveness to IPTG, to quantify the promoter leakage and thus to improve the basic part containing the pTAC promoter sequence (BBa_K864400) .

The strongest band corresponds to J04500 with about 200-300pb of overhang due to the offset locations of the VF2 and VR2 primer sites. This band is of predicted size, further confirming the part's attributes. Worrying, however, are the extra bands seen at around 2000; these bands are present in both ligations, and as such are unlikey to be contamination. It is possible these bands are the VF2/VR primers adhering to terminators and such in the plasmid, as seen here: [ [1] ]
It is currently unknown as to the nature of the failure in the previous PCR reaction, but it likely due to a methodological error, or failure of the usual protocol used, which uses whole cells inserted into the reaction.

The absence of colony growth indicated a low transformation efficiency, so commercial cells were used in future experiments instead of homemade competent cells.

Gibson assembly transformations into commercial cells
Following multiple unsuccessful Gibson assembly attempts, the gBlocks and backbone were amplified by PCR using Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase. Gel extraction was performed using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Four Gibson assemblies using combinations of these amplified, gel extracted and original un- amplified gBlocks were set up (Table 4, Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7). These were then used to transform commercial DH5α cells competent cells. As a result, 30 to 60 colonies per transformation plate grew (Figure 13).
Figure 13. Colonies from transformed cells with Gibson assemblies 1-4 using different volumes of gBlocks.
As primers had been designed for detection of the operon from transformants, colony PCR was conducted on 5 of the colonies from the plates 1-4 using Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase to amplify the 5 kb band corresponding to the full length of the operon. No bands were observed following agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products (Figure 14).
Figure 14. Colony PCR of colonies from transformed cells using the primers for the beginning and end of the operon.
No bands were observed that corresponded to the 5 kb operon, possibly due to inherent difficulties commonly associated with the amplification of large PCR products. Based on this, colony PCR was not utilised in the future for the detection of the operon. As an alternative, plasmids would be extracted from the colonies obtained in future transformations. These would be analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis performed to visualise the plasmid. 45 colonies of DH5α transformants were inoculated in LB medium containing chloramphenicol and those cultures were used to carry out plasmid extractions that were later run on an agarose gel (Figure 15 and Figure 16). Two colonies from plate 4 (Figure 13) showed a promising 7 kb band corresponding to the expected size"

Taiwan in recent years has also set up seven research centers of science and technology, and some universities also specifically recruit graduate students in science and technology, science and technology enterprises specializing in the recruitment of legal and technical director. At the same time, many countries are also strengthening the research and legislation of science and technology. Science and technology legislation, scientific research and specialized personnel training has become a global boom.
China also adopted the Popularization of science and technology in People's Republic of China in 2002, which shows that China is also attaching importance to the popularization of science and technology law. It has established a new mechanism from the angle of legislation and social promotion. It has also formed an atmosphere of popularization.
In my opinion, there is still a long way to go for the promotion of science and technology law, in which scientific research and technology development institutions, institutions of higher learning should become the main force of propaganda, such as through popular science activities, popular science publicity , held lectures and other measures to further expand the public understanding of science and technology work and support.
3. What legal developments have been made so far? What are the existing deficiencies, and if there any suggestion for Legislation in China?
So far, in the Constitution, civil law, administrative law, criminal law and other traditional jurisdictions had establish a large number of technical and legal norms in the legislation, but also carried out special legislation in the field of science and technology. Its main legal system can be divided into several aspects, such as scientific and technological progress law, science and technology contract system, scientific and technological achievement right protection and so on.
With the development of the times, China's science and technology legislation also need to improve. Such as legal gaps, some legislation is too principled and lack of operability, and some regulations are ineffective, many laws and regulations are issued in different departments in the process of reform, and therefore there are contradictory and repeated too much. Therefore, China's scientific and technological legal system construction should also continue to strengthen and perfect.
My proposal for this is: Our country should further speed up the process of scientific and technological legislation, targeted and complementary legal gaps, and further refine the relevant implementation details, make scientific and technological legislation more systematic, standardized, and adapt to the times.
4. Whether the genetically modified bacteria can be applied to human disease treatment？If so, what are the legal considerations?
With the advances in modern DNA manipulation technology, humans can modify bacterial DNA, thus affecting human health. Many bacteria have been modified to syn"
Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Pace_-_-_TEXT.html," activate gene III expression. In the simple case of evolving a transcription factor as depicted in Figure 1, gene III would simply be expressed from the promoter (“pTarget”) the transcription factor should be optimized for.
PACE employs a custom bioreactor setup and complex flow controls to achieve continuous in vivo directed evolution of the phage gene pool (Figure 2). The PACE setup comprises four major compartments: medium tank, turbidostat, lagoon and waste tank. The turbidostat thereby which contain “fresh” E. coli host cells (transformed with AP and MP) cultivated at constant cell density and in the absence of arabinose, so that the toxic MP-encoded genes are not expressed. The “lagoon” is the compartment in which the actual evolution takes place, i.e. where the phages infect the host cells and propagate, provided the encoded POI activates gene III on the AP. In addition, the medium in the lagoon is supplemented by arabinose via a corresponding inducer supply line. The lagoon is thereby kept under constant flux (typically ~1 lagoon volume per hour), i.e. fresh host cells are introduced from the turbidostat the identical volume is simultaneously going to the waste line. Thereby, phages which are inefficiently propagating (i.e. due to low fitness of their encoded POI) are washed out, while highly propagating (i.e. fit) variants take over the gene pool and further evolve.
Figure 2: Simplified schematics of in vivo evolution with PACE.
This aforementioned in vivo evolution setup has several advantages as compared to alternative directed evolution methods:
Due to the small phage size, their fast generation time and high mutation rates during replication, large and diverse gene pools can be generated to efficiently sample the space of possible, beneficial mutations
A GOI’s fitness is evaluated in many different host cells due to its fast transfer between cells via the phage intermediate, thereby decoupling evolution form a particular host cell context
These key features enable render PACE a powerful tool for directed evolution in various application contexts. PACE has, for instance, been successfully applied for re-directing T7 polymerase target promoter specificity

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the"

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices#OpenScience_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM proposed a reach-through license agreement as a better alternative. The University of Ottawa iGEM team documented their struggle with licensing in the submission of a part that originated from an external supplier (University of Oxford iGEM Team, 2014; Kidisyuk, 2015).  While Borgman’s (2015) assertion of openness facilitating data creation is thus demonstrated within the iGEM competition, limitations on sharing are also evidence when economic motivations for creating or withholding data exist.
Claiming property rights over synthetic biology has raised concerns for the developing field.  A “very real” prospect exists that patents with broad claims, applicable to technologies that are ‘’foundational” or “essential” to the science, may place profound barriers on early-stage researchers, requiring use of patented information at prohibitive cost which then impedes innovation  (Baldwin et al., 2012).  Narrow patenting in synthetic biology, similarly, could also establish financial obstacles to invention when they cluster into ‘patent thickets’ or ‘anti-commons’  (Baldwin et al., 2012). As parties pursue financial returns for their work through patenting at the end of research, or alternatively as they navigate what is available to use within budget at the beginning of research, the application of property rights policies to data in synthetic biology are shown to be pulled by competing interests.  Further creation of data is dependent on striking a balance between being open, or in other words, maintaining a culture of data reuse and accessibility, and the sustainability of such activity (Borgman, 2015).
Finally, no form of validating research data seems to exist in iGEM.  For example, after the University of Waterloo was awarded for their wiki website, they found errors. The team “tried to fix many of them out of good conscience”(“An iGEM Critique”, n.d.) but eventually failed to fix all of the errors, and focused their time on preparing for the next iGEM competition which was just a couple of months away. Furthermore, iGEM does not prioritize validating data with it being highly unlikely that “teams or judges are going to check the validity of…data thoroughly enough during or after the Jamboree to notice mistakes, let alone correct them” (“An iGEM Critique”, n.d.).
A solution to the problem of validity may involve having teams validate each other’s data by either reproducing the entire research or just the data collected or the observations. This can easily be done by embedding this in the criteria for the gold medal standard."

● Collaborate with TAS, using biofilm to replace flotation chemicals
Overview
The research purpose of whole project is using red light to induce Saccharomyces cerevisiae to secret out xylanase, glucanase and lipase. Using light can preserve more paper fiber. The light induce system was originally built by the 2012 iGEM TU Munich team. Although optogenetics has benefits in our project, one of the disadvantages is it will decrease the amount of protein expression. However the pros outweigh the cons, that is why we are using this system. Also, we made an improvement on this biobrick to counter this protein amount decreasing challenge.
Furthermore, We put manufactory process into lab and use our material to make reprocessed paper. The step-by-step process of paper recycling includes pulping, deinking, floating and pressing. In our process, we move deinking in the very beginning of our process. Instead of using chemical agent to deink, we spray yeast directly on the paper and use light to start the enzyme secretion.
Our Approach
We hope to make a medium that have a deinking ability to demonstrate. We select three enzymes which is xylanase, lipase and glucanase to work with. We assembled these codons with different selection vectors. With different selection vectors, we can transform our construct into yeast and using selection plate to select the success transformed yeast. These yeasts will grow into big volume and use alpha factor to induce our enzyme.
Experimental Design
We first aimed to build up three construct to do the later transform. The first construct is the light induce system which contain two fusion protein and using constitutive TEF promoter. The first protein is PIF3 domain fuse to Gal4 activation domain, the second protein is PhyB domain fuse to Gal4 DNA binding domain. The system we are using is based on the known red light–induced binding of the plant photoreceptor phytochrome to the protein PIF3 and the reversal of this binding by far-red light. By the switch of red light and far red light we can control our enzymes on and off.
The second construct contains xylanase and glucanase. These two enzymes are both triggered by STE12 promoter and working in different directions. STE12 is a promoter which can start working by alpha factor induction.
The third construct contains STE12 protein and lipase. STE12 protein has a Gal1 promoter in front of it and it will start working by two light fusion protein recruit together. Lipase has a STE12 promoter in front. STE12 system is original"

How is oil extracted from Oil Sands?
Oil Extraction
Unlike traditional crude oil production, oil sands are first extracted using surface mining which transports the sands to sites where the sand is crushed, mixed with water, and sent via pipeline to a separating facility. There sand is settled out and a bitumen slurry sent via pipeline to an upgrading facility. At the upgrading facility, bitumen is further separated by centrifuging the slurry mixed again with water and naptha diluent. In the final stage of extraction, the bitumen is sent to a coker where it is heated, releasing hydrocarbon gas, and naptha. Such a  water and mechanically heavy process present unique environmental challenges.

Figure 4. SDS-PAGE gel and a protein ladder.From left to right: first well is a protein ladder, second well is protein expressed from the au54 plasmid, third well contains sialidase expressed from the biobrick.
Hypothesis 2: Endo-β-galactosidase can be successfully expressed in E. coli
We designed our endo-β-galactosidase (EBG) biobrick (BBa_K2235010) by modifying the sequence of professor Li (Ashida, 2002). The sequence received did not contain a His6-tag, which was added to the sequence for later IMAC purification steps. The biobrick containing T7 promoter-RBS-EBG was cloned into an iGEM compatible plasmid backbone (pSB1C3). To confirm successful cloning, we double digested plasmids from five different colonies (figure 5). For each colony, two bands could be observed. One at ~1400 bp, corresponding to the size of EBG, and one at ~2000 bp, corresponding to the size of the plasmid backbone.
Figure 5. Agarose gel. From left to right: DNA ladder, empty well, the next five are digested BBa_K2235010 plasmids.
After confirming that the cloning worked, the biobrick plasmid (BBa_K2235010) was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and expression was induced at multiple combinations of OD600 and IPTG concentrations. SDS-PAGE results from one of the successful expressions (at OD600 of 0.4 and an IPTG concentration of 0.5 mM) show the expression of EBG, a 47 kDa protein (figure 6). The band on lane three is believed to be EBG.

Hypothesis 3: Sialidase can be secreted using HylA secretion system in E. coli
By carrying out the experiments above we demonstrated successful cloning and expression of both of our mucus degrading enzymes: sialidase and EBG. The next step was to secrete the enzymes, using an already existing biobrick for HylA E.coli secretion system (BBa_K1166002) from the iGEM 2017 distribution kit"

Nematode parasites cost the agricultural industry lots of money and grief each year due to the many consequences they cause. The economic burden of these parasites is forecasted to increase, since these worms are rapidly gaining resistance to most drugs used to combat them. There are currently no easy methods for the diagnosis of these small strongyles. Our vision has been to apply synthetic biology to the untouched field of veterinary diagnostics by developing a better tool for detection, thus decreasing the growth of resistance among small strongyles. While working towards the goal of creating a reprogramed smart bacteria (nicknamed the worm buster) to detect and report the presence of the small strongyles, we discovered new useful applications of existing techniques along the way. This has made our vision about the worm buster more realistic, which in the future will provide the tools necessary to help farmers make a decisions whether to treat their animals or not.
Our work has laid the foundation for our idea to someday potentially come to fruition. Our novel applications of cutting edge techniques such as phage display and transcriptomics using third generation sequencing provide groundwork for further expansions in the field of veterinary diagnostics.
The Targets
Small Strongyles or Cyathostominae are among the most common equine parasites, with more than 52 species in their family [2]. The infectious stage of small strongyles is when they’ve developed into larvae while still lurking in the grass. While horses graze, they consume the worms and the small strongyles continue to develop in the horses’ intestines, forming cysts in the intestinal wall [1]. When further evolved, these small strongyles can burst out from their cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [1, 8].
Figure 1: Small strongyles.
Symptoms
The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal"

Three colonies grown after the overnight incubation at 43°C (step 5 of integration protocol) were analyzed for each plate. These 12 clones were called: MC-GFP-A,B,C , MC-RFP-A,B,C , MG-GFP-A,B,C and MG-RFP-A,B,C.
Validation of the loss of BBa_J72008: all the picked colonies did not grow in Amp (50 ug/ml) media, thus validating that <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo> Amp-resistant helper had been actually cured from the cells. However, one of these 12 clones (MG-GFP-A) also failed to grow in Cm (12.5 ug/ml) liquid media, probably because of a mistake in its inoculation. We decided not to consider this clone and to continue with 11 clones.
Validation of the actual integration site: colony PCR was performed for all the 11 clones, using MC1061 and MG1655 without integrants as negative controls. Primer pairs P1/P2 and P3/P4 were used to validate the presence of the integrative vector in the Phi80 genomic locus, while the primer pair P2/P3 was used to validate the presence of multiple tandem integrants (see Fig.1 in Materials and Methods).

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," Think.Eat.Save.event at Martin Place on Monday July 25th. Across the country, more than 22,000 meals made from “waste” food were given away in a bid to raise awareness. The event involved multiple guest speakers, including representatives from sponsors including Woolworths and from top chefs including Neil Perry and Matt Moran, and there was encouragement to fundraise and support the food saving movement.
We were able to engage with a wide range of people, especially from the corporate world, to chat about how our project was also going to play a crucial role in minimising specifically produce wastage. We even spoke to OzHarvest volunteers about how we could further become involved, which led to Claudia attending a volunteer induction day to become a fully fledged OzHarvest volunteer! You can read more about the day here.
This was a chance to engage with the community in a very different way. We were able to give our time to promote their message, whilst spreading our message about the potential benefits of synthetic biology too. Discussions that were had with OzHarvest volunteers were also very influential on the design of the final biosensor. To find out more, and read how we used this information, click here.
USYD article
One of our team members, Liam, was featured in an article published by the Faculty of Science at The University of Sydney, which gave us the opportunity to spread the iGEM message on another platform. This article was published on the Faculty’s website.
Social Media
Sydney iGEM 2016 engaged with people all over the world, and particularly with other iGEM teams, through our multiple social media channels. We had an Instagram account with 91 followers (at time of writing), and a Facebook page with a following of 111 people (at time of writing) where we regularly posted pictures and updates of our project, as well as the occasional blooper when an experiment didn’t quite go to plan! Social media was a valuable outreach tool as it allowed us to share more specific details of experiments we conducted and of upcoming outreach events at which we would be presenting, such that those who were interested in our project were more informed. It also allowed us to reach a much wider audience.
Microbe Card Game Project
One of our team members set out to design a card game that stylised various bacteria as little monsters. The card game was intended to be both educational and fun, introducing some of the more common bacteria that are involved in food and health to the wider community. To keep things simple, the game was going to have standard “top trumps” style rules"

It is also proven that transcription of the normal DAHP synthase gene will be inhibited when phenylalanine is present in the medium, so only the mutated form will be produced (Adhja & Gottesman, 1984). The unmutated version (P150 and L175) of DAHP synthase is shown in the upper two figures, with the inhibitor phenylalanine in the binding pocket on the right. Below it is shown that the two mutations, P150L and L175D, clearly occupy the binding pocket and thereby sterically hinder the binding of phenylalanine.
The unmutated DAHP synthase shows a clear Phe binding pocket between residues 150 and 175.
Phe binds in the binding pocket between proline and leucine.
Leucine and asparagine sidechains fill up the Phe binding pocket.
The binding of Phe is sterically hindered by Leu150 and Asn175.
Characterisation
We characterised the MeS BioBrick by means of a smell test as well as characterising this brick with Headspace GC , GC-MS analysis of MeS in ethyl acetate extracts and SDS PAGE analysis .
Smell test
To functionally test our Methyl salicylate production brick ( BBa_K1060003 ), we prepared 68 microcentrifuge tubes with E.coli expressing the MeS construct to conduct a blind smell test. This experiment consisted of 4 sets, different in incubation time and temperature. The first set was grown at room temperature for 24 hours, the second was incubated at 37ºC for 24 hours, the third was grown at 37ºC for 8 hours and the last set was grown at room temperature for 8 hours. In each set, we inoculated our brick BBa_K1060003 with IPTG, IPTG + salicylate (concentration range from 0.01mM to 1mM), and IPTG + chorismate (concentration range from 0.01mM to 1mM), the same for MIT 2006 brick BBa_J45700 . In addition, the same combinations of additives were introduced in parallel for our negative controls (non-MeS producing E. Coli).
We asked 11 people to participate in this blind test and calculated the"

Slovenia,2016,Team:Slovenia#Mechanosensing#Gas vesicles_-_-_TEXT.html," (
3.3.1.
A). A heterogeneous mixture of microbubbles in the range from 5 to 100 µm in size were generated by this procedure (
3.3.1.
B). Microbubbles are most effective in the size range corresponding to the resonance frequency of the ultrasound. However, care has to be taken in the applied energy to prevent cavitation, that can sonoporate cell membranes.
Application of microbubbles to cells expressing mechanosensitive channel MscS significantly improved calcium influx after mechanical                                     stimulation using low-power ultrasound wave (450 Vpp) (
3.3.2.
). The same experimental setup was used a previusly described in ultrasound stimulation of mechanosensitive channels .
Ultrasound response of cells is amplified by the use of lipid microbubbles.
(A) Presentation of the ultrasound stimulation sequence and (B) signal parameters used for the stimulation.                                                 (C, D) Lipid microbubbles strongly enhanced response of cells expressing MscS channels. HEK293 cells expressing MscS channels were stimulated                                                 with ultrasound for 10 s and calcium influx was recorded in real time (D) using a confocal microscope. For comparison cells without ectopic MscS                                                 were used. Fluo-4 (D, green line) and Fura Red dyes (D, red line) were used for ratiometric calcium imaging. (D) Ratio (blue line) was calculated                                                 from fluorescence intensities of Fura Red and Fluo-4 using CaPTURE.
However, there are some drawbacks related to the use of lipid microbubbles, as their delivery requires injection into the selected tissue. Additionally lifetime of lipid microbubbles is limited in the tissue to tens of minutes and they need to be prepared freshly at least once a week.
  Gas vesicles
To overcome the described drawback we thought of alternative options. One idea that initially looked too crazy to work was to use genetically encoded gas vesicles                                     that are produced in bacteria. Bacterial gas vesicles have been used as contrasting agents for ultrasonography in animals
Shapiro2014
. This demonstrated                                     that ultrasound can have effect on gas vesicles. However adding bacterial gas vesicles instead of microbubbles would not solve the problem. The best solution would be                                     if the gas vesicles could be produced in the functional form in mammalian cells. Several iGEM teams have previously used gas vesicles expressed in bacteria,                                  ( Melbourne 2007 , Groningen 2009 , UCL2012 , Glasgow2014 ) where typically a large gene cluster had to be"

BBa_K598010 performed in the Tecan as expected. With increasing concentrations of theophylline and arabinose, the fluorescence of the cells increased. Also, the addition of arabinose to wells containing liquid cultures of BBa_K750000 only showed a short spike in fluorescence that died out after about 2 hours due to the LVA degradation tag, and the addition of theophylline had no significant effect. Some of our primers have finally arrived, so we were able to start amplifying some of the parts we need for our construct that will be assembled through Golden Gate Assembly. So far we have started working on amplifying and adding BsaI restriction sites to the two TAL repressors, the GFP with an LVA tag and terminator from BBa_K750000 and the pSB1C3 backbone. We also took a soil sample to send to the University of Edinburgh for their project.
7/30/13
We ran a gel in the morning to test our Golden Gate PCR reactions. Two of the five reactions seemed to show the correct band sizes. We believe the failure of the three other reactions may be due to the low melting temperature (55º C). We decided to run the PCR reaction again with the melting temperature at 70º and 80º for the three unsuccessful runs. We also helped the Imperial College iGEM team by sequencing a construct"

As iGEM teams are from different countries which may have different regulations for biosaftey. So on the one hand, it's necessary to collect information and make standard biosafety rules for basic synthetic biology experiments. On the other hand, our simple biosafety handbook cannot be suitable for all teams. But we believe our work must be useful for many iGEM teams and other researchers.
Regulation Summary
The creature differs from each other due to the patterns of gene expression,because most genes differ in their level of the cell cycle.The activity of genes is also keyed to the functions of the cell;The expression of the protein can influence the whole cell.The main role in gene regulation is the level of transcription,either through signals originating within the cell itself or in response to external conditions.Many gene products are needed only on ocassion ,and transcription can be regulated in an on-off manner that enables such products to ve present only when external conditions demand them .Five main control points for gene expression include:
Transcriptional regulation of the synthesis of RNA transcrips by controling initiation or termination.
RNA processing or regulation through RNA splicing or alternative patterns of splicing.
Translational control of polypeptide synthesis.
Stability of mRNA,because mRNAs that persist in the cell have longer-lasting effects than those that are degraded rapidly.
Posttranslational control,which includes a great variety of mechanisms that affect enzyme activity, activation,stability, and so on.
DNA rearrangements,in which gene expression changes depending on the position of DNA sequencs in the genome.
The regulatory systems of prokayotes and eukaryotes differ from each other in many details.Because the project in the iGEM 's platforms  are mostly prokayotes,we just focus on the prokayotes' gene regulation.Prokayotes are generally free-living unicellular organisms that grow and divice indefinitely as long as environmental conditions are suitable and the supply of nutrients is adequate.Their regulatory systems are often geared to provide  the maximum growth rate in a particular environment .In contrast ,the cells in a developing muticellular organism modulate their growth rate as they undergo dramatic,coordinated differentiation in morphology and metabolism.In  an adult animal,growth and division of most cell types has ceased,and each type of cell needs to maintain its identity through time.
Synthetic biology is a brand new field of biological research which combines science and engineering"

Validated Part/Contribution –  We created the part BBa_K2449004 , containing a cellobiose phosphorylase, Cep94A. This enzyme enables Escherichia coli to survive on cellobiose, which we validated by growth experiments. The data obtained in these experiments are presented in the Demonstration & Results section .
Collaboration – We have collaborated with several teams throughout our project by taking part in discussions, meetups, and answering questionnaires - we even hosted our first meetup for our fellow Danish iGEM teams. You can read all about this in the Credits section .
Human Practices – Our philosopher, historian, and biologist have discussed the ethical and educational aspects of our project in great detail. In extension to their work, we have been working extensively with education and public engagement .
Gold Medal Requirements
Integrated Human Practices – For the development and implementation of the device, we reached out to and remained in contact with city planners from our hometown throughout our project. This regarded advice and conversations on anything from the possible design, value, safety, use, placement, and plastic type of our device. The ideas generated from these conversations, were integrated in our overall project. Last but not least, we focused on demonstrating this process on our wiki in order to inspire future iGEM teams.
Model Your Project –  Through extensive modelling , we have learned that it is possible to regulate bacterial dormancy. However, the modelling showed that it would be inadequate to only regulate the toxin RelE, as this would make the bacteria unable to exit dormancy. To regulate dormancy properly, would also require tight regulation of the antitoxin RelB. This information was used to shape the entire approach of the light-dependent dormancy system.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," toolboxes of MoClo (Weber et al. 2011) , Loop Assembly (Pollak et al. 2018) and the PhytoBrick system already use a common set of fusion sites. We decided to adapt these fusion sites for all parts that build the transcription unit (Promoter,
RBS
,
CDS
, Terminator, Tags). Fusion sites for parts that are novel to our system (Connectors, Oris, Resistance cassettes) had to be newly designed by us because these parts did not exist in the other toolboxes.
We applied the following design principles to obtain optimal fusion sites. Firstly, the newly designed fusion sites must neither be identical to already existing fusion sites nor be palindromic to prevent assembly in a wrong order. Secondly, the fusion sites should not consist of bases that represent a portion of the recognition sequence of a restriction enzyme. If, for example, a fusion site with the sequence GGTC was used, and the sequence of the downstream part starts with TC, a BsaI recognition site would be reconstituted. So all fusion sites that would result in a partial recognition sequence of either BsaI, BsmBI or any of the enzymes that are used in the Biobrick cloning, are excluded. Lastly, the remaining candidates were sorted according to their GC content and the fusion sites with the highest GC content were chosen.
To make design of new parts as simple as possible, we created a collection of overhangs that can be copied from table 1 and pasted to the sequence specific part of a primer to create new LVL0 parts. These primers contain the cut sites for integration into the part entry vector as well as the predefined fusion sites that are required for correctly assembling LVL1 plasmids. In some cases these overhangs contain additional bases that will be discussed in the following chapter.

Yuwei Han
Hi, I am Yuwei, a year four student in XJTLU biological science. I am sure iGEM is the most exciting and challenging competition I’ve ever experienced. Before iGEM, I also had internships in other institutes. Thus, I am responsible for the experiment parts. For me, the iGEM competition is a big opportunity for me to make a breakthrough of myself. It is not only about a great deal of new knowledge, technique and experience I can get from the experiment. Moreover, it gives me a chance to actually participate in the generation of an innovation, from the development of a new idea to finally give rise to the final production of an item.
Jiongjian Li
Hello, I’ m Jiongjian Li, a third year student major in Biology of XJTLU. This is my first year to join iGEM and it is a great honor to join this competition. The best thing in this world is thinking about new idea. That is what I do in this team. Also, I am willing to work with other teammates to achieve our goals.
Tiange Li
Hi I’m Tiange Li (Mag) and this is my first tour of iGEM. I believe it would be one of the most extraordinary things happened in my year 3 biology study. When there is a chance to make an effort on a self-designed experiment, everything taught in lectures becomes vivid and the discoveries made before just sound more exciting. I like the idea of genetic circuit and fortunately this is what we are heading for. Up to now what I’ve done most are literature review, I fresh myself when reading research articles. Thanks for my teammates' help; I now do it more efficiently. I really enjoy the time spending with them, sharing information and taking a walk from the lab. So...just hope we can finally make it!

Tuesday
More PCR, more gels for Tom as he tries to get the correct fragments... He also grew up some overnight cultures with sfGFP-ampR plasmids and will miniprep so we now have more positive control templates.
Wednesday
Emmy did some reorganising and relabelling of all the tubes we've got as there are now too many tubes of DNA fragments for Ratiometrica and lux-mOrage! Tom did some more gel extractions and miniprepped the sfGFP-ampR out of the O/N cultures so now we have positive control again.
LUX-MORANGE PLAN OF ATTACK:
1) 2 x Two-piece Gibson to join the quarters of vector backbone together, and the mOrange and the other half of the vector (re-attempted with correct size fragment)
2a) PCR out each half (Touch-down PCR done... there is severe mispriming and the bands that we want is very very faint, not visible even on some lanes of the triplicates...)
2b) At the same time, attempt a 4-piece Gibson (done, will know tomorrow)
3) Two-piece Gibson the two halves
RATIOMETRICA PLAN OF ATTACK:
1) 2 x Two-piece Gibson to join each of the smaller fragments to the adjacent half of the vector backbone. (re-attempted one of the reactions with correct size fragment)
2a) PCR out each half (only one half came out last Friday, the other half is still not coming out even with the size correction and touch-down)
2b) At the same time, attempt a three-piece Gibson with the half from last Friday, and the two other fragments that are refusing to come out from Gibson (done, will know tomorrow)
3) Two-piece Gibson the two halves
Thursday
Tom re-PCRed a quarter of the vector backbone for Ratiometrica, because we suspect that the size of it from previous PCR was a bit dodgy. Unfortunately there seems to be something wrong with the mastermix- no bands and positive control didn't work. Not to worry- we will try again tomorrow as usual.
Nothing's grown on the plates from last night- not even if the positive control. It might've been a problem with the Gibson protocol. We also tried to carry out gel electrophoresis directly with the Gibson products from yesterday night, unfortunately there are no bands. It might be because there were too little DNA, or"

Ethics
Legislation and public opinion on GMOs in Finland
Finnish legislation towards genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is strict, similar to the rest of the European Union. In Finland, the Gene Technology Act regulates the use of GMOs and promotes the safe use and development of gene technology along with ethical practices and consideration of the precautionary principle (Geenitekniikan lautakunta). The precautionary principle is a concept used in risk management and according to it, if an action is suspected to be harmful for the public or the environment and there is no scientific agreement on the matter, then the burden of proof that it is not harmful lies on the party which is carrying out the suspected action.
The Gene Technology Act is based on the EU Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC, which concern the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment and the contained used of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs), respectively. It also includes genetically modified plants and animals for contained use. The Gene Technology Act is supplemented by Government Decrees and Decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. (Geenitekniikan lautakunta)
As it is impossible to predict the cascade of consequences resulting from GMOs being released into the environment, caution in this respect is well-advised. The organisms themselves could undergo genetic changes and outstep their intended role, or have unexpected effects and interactions with the ecosystem. In addition, the genetic material of decomposed GMOs could be taken up by other organisms, leading to even more possibilities for unwanted consequences.
There are many measures that can be employed to improve the security of genetically modified organisms, though public opinion remains biased against GMOs. Public opinion is also one reason why we chose to work with yeast, as opposed to e.g. the bacterium Escherichia coli. In large part, negative attitudes towards GMOs can stem from connotations of certain words, as well as the perception of strangeness in the daily lives of people. We reasoned that by working with baker’s yeast (common name for Saccharomyces cerevisiae), an organism familiar to most people with neutral if not positive connotations, our work would feel more approachable to and less detached from people’s everyday lives.
With our project, we hope to improve the understanding about synthetic biology and GMOs. We want to improve the public perception of GMOs this way, and through removing negative biases and public image, stir up conversation about steering legislation into a direction where it is informed by reason,"
Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," we had to inform him and all other working groups about the major processes of our project including the start of every next step.  Next up was contacting Prof. Dr. Stehle who helped in purificating our proteins. As the protein is potentially toxic this was one of the most important aspects.  We held a presentation in front of Prof. Dr. Stehle and Dr. Georg Zocher who coached our work and Dr. Christoph Schall who is the biosafety officer of their working group. Together we concluded that the knockout criteria had to be that we should be able to proof by sequencing our protein construct that it had the intended mutations and DNA sequence. Only after validation through our sequencing results we were allowed to transfer our construct in E.coli and express and purify our protein.
The Teammembers
To carry out our project successfully we had an introductory seminar about protein purification held by Dr. Frank Essman. According to him we always have to keep in mind that we are working with a highly toxic protein hence the necessity to apply the highest safety measures in our laboratory work. Of course every lab-team member got a general lab-safety seminar. Additionally we had some group discussion to make sure that everyone works as careful with our botox as if it was still toxic.
To sum up the three most important points you have to keep in mind when working with toxic substances are the following:  - First, stay in contact with iGEM so you can consider their advice and guidelines. - Second, clarify everything with your university so that your work takes place under the right circumstances. - And last but not least make sure that all members of the team work with the right mindset and carry out their tasks carefully - with the potentially high risk in the back of their heads.
Public Engagement
We started this years Human Practices work with the goal in mind to significantly increase our outreach to the public. By being as present on social media as never before in our iGEM history and documenting and sharing our development and progress on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter along the way we were able to reach iGEM Teams all over the world informing them about our project, iGEM and synthetic biology in general.
The local “Ract!” festival with visitor numbers close to 30,000 was a great first opportunity to implement our goal which we realised by having an informational stand and an additional parcour that was highly frequented by people of all ages. Our public debate in collaboration with our universities debating club Streitkultur e.V. about the topic of gene editing on embryos also turned out to be a huge success due to a"

        We mentored a new team SCUT-FSE-CHINA. We shared with them                     the experience of how to form an iGEM team, and guided them in the rules, timelines and precautions of                     the competition. Besides, we mentored them how to standardize the genes. In return, they assisted us the design of modeling and help us write some parts of code of the MATLAB.

SYSU-Software
        We met SYSU-Software in April on a meet-up meeting among                     teams in Southern China. This year we use the Mer-merr bi-direction promoter to sense mercury (Hg) in                     the environment. If the concentration of Hg transcend a threshold, Hg can repress the repressor of cds                     of SRRz protein, which will lead to the expression of SRRz protein. Cells lysis process could be detected                     because the release of the beta-galactosidase which is not able to spread cross the cell membrane at                     a normal situation will trigger the chromogenic reaction of oNPG whose tube will turn yellow. Since we                     were not aware of whether the design could work and the approximate range of expression level of the                     SRRz gene before the experiment, we reached out for them to do a simulation for their genetic circuits.
Solution & Results
        They built a model for our project using the same algorithm                     that utilized in their software simulation section. The following is the circuit we designed for our                     project redrawn by their design platform.
        For a preciser measurement of the expression of their                     gene, SRRz gene, we used GFP as a reporter in this case alternatively. Their model simulated the concentration                     of the GFP expressed in our system. The mathematic formula and parameters' and the results are as follows:
        The simulation result is as follow:

Actually, to know if $CV$ is defined or not when $\lambda=\mu$ is not really interesting because we want to have an idea of what will be the behaviour of $CV$ if $\lambda$ is so much close to $\mu$ that, biologically, they seem to be equal. It will be the same idea in the following part.
We remind that the function $\exp:x\rightarrow e^x$ is indefinitely differentiable, i.e. $\exp\in\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ so it admits a Taylor expansion in the neighbourhood of $0$ -in particular- : $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ and for $t$ sufficiently near to $0$, \[ \begin{"

Event I. Exchange team members with LZU-China
    July 25-August 1
    BIT Team's member Zhou Xiaoyu visited LZU's lab, helping them design and construct IκB-GFP fusion fragments.
    From July 27 to August 5, our team exchanged one team member with Lanzhou University iGEM team in order to help and communicate with each other. During the time, BIT team's member Zhou Xiaoyu designed and constructed IκB-GFP fusion fragments with LZU-China members in Lanzhou University and satisfied the teachers and team members.
    August 4-11
    LZU-China Team member Li Xiaomeng was invited to interchange with the BIT iGEM 2013 Team. And help us to characterized and constructed a part of Cr sensor.
Event II. Communication between Beijing Institute of Technology and Peking University iGEM teams
    On June 30th, 2013, the team of BIT visited Peking University to communicate with the team of Peking University about the upcoming iGEM. During the meetingthe two teams had a heated discussion over their topics and exchanged their ideas on how to tackle the problems. Both of the teams gained a lot from communicating with each other. 
First, under the leadership of a student from Peking University, we went to the seminar room where the two teams described their projects in detail. During the dialogue, both sides put forward some questions and cast doubt on the practicability of the other’s project. In the process of questioning and answering, we not only broadened our horizons, but also learned more knowledge. What is more, we knew how to improve our own projects. In the end, the team of Peking University expressed appreciation of our project. We hope the two teams will have outstanding performances in the competition. After all, even though Peking University iGEM team is our competitor, it is also our cooperator from whom we can learn much.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"as9 system is that a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence must be present in the target DNA directly upstream of the 20 bp targeted region. While pyogenes dCas9 has a short and relatively frequent PAM of NGG (N = any nucleotide), aureus dCas9 has a PAM of NNGRRT (R = A or G) that is more specific and therefore less frequent.
When presented with a finite target DNA sequence, it can be tricky to find binding sites for aureus and pyogenes dCas9s that are in the desired orientation and have roughly the desired interspace binding region. To expedite this process, our team designed a computer software in which you can input the desired interspace region range, the desired orientation, and the specific PAM sequences for the dCas9 derivatives that are being used. The software then returns a set of all possible binding site combinations.
It is important to note that given the two 20 base pair target regions, plus the two PAM sequences necessary in the target sequence, there is an absolute minimum target DNA strand length of roughly 50 base pairs. At this length, however, the probability of finding the two PAMs in a desired orientation is slim. We designed a model to determine how many base pairs on average are required to have a 95% chance of the fragment being targetable. Our model can be found here
.
sgRNA linear fragment design
Our team received aureus and pyogenes sgRNA constructs from Dr. Marie La Russa, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Qi’s lab. After modifying the variable 20 base pair regions in these sgRNA sequences on Benchling in order to target the GFP plasmid, we added bacterial promoters and terminators for both constructs and then ordered the DNA fragments from IDT.
Fig. 6 - sgRNA constructs.
The terminators L3S1P21 and L3S1P22 are derivatives of the Trrnb and were obtained from Chelsea Hu’s recent research on bacterial terminators [7]. Promoters J23100 and J23119 were taken from the Anderson promoter collection on the iGEM Registry [8].
Applications
Cerberus DNA Detection’s strength lies in its versatility. Via a simplified PCR with Agilent’s QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis procedure [9], the variable regions in the sgRNA sequences can be easily swapped out to bind the dCas9s to any targetable DNA fragment.

Figure 2, Bar Chart:
The bar chart displays the numbers of participants that did evaluate the respective media (screensaver and forum). Whilst both media were evaluated by about 60% of BOINC ‘veterans’, new users preferably reviewed the screensaver (80%) and about 55% did not rank the forum at all.
3. Direct feedback and quotes
Comments and feedback on software and infrastructure:
""Need checkpoints!"": This statement was supported by additional 7 participants of the survey and also a major issue for discussion on the forum. Checkpoints are a feature strongly demanded by many BOINC veterans which is also represented in the review of the calculations (figure 1, (4) and will be implemented as soon as possible.
""Don't want or need a screensaver."": A statement supported by 2 users in total that are both supporters of additional BOINC projects. Some BOINC-enthusiasts that focus on collecting BOINC points might not be interested in the information spread via the screensaver.
""Forum spam was a VERY noticeable problem at first, but since the changes have been implemented as requested by various users I have not seen any spam in the forums."": It is important to quickly respond to requests by members of the community. The BOINC community is very communicative and eager to solve problems in coordination with developers. Several measures including the requirement for posters to have at least earned a few BOINC points with calculations, detecting and deleting spammers and active moderation of the forum solved the problem of spam effectively.
""Credit rate is poor compared to many other projects."" Three users supported the claim that the points earned for computations for the iGEM@home project are low in comparison to other projects. The users proposed a dynamic point and award system (badges) for long-term motivation of BOINC crunchers.
""You should ensure that the server does not run out of tasks very often."" Many users directly contacted us and asked for more tasks to calculate and commented that BOINC projects should not run out of tasks easily. We hope that due to the introduction of iGEM@home to the community, the servers will not run out of tasks easily during the summer.
Communication with the team and the overall organisation of the project was praised by many users:
""Great Project. Of course needs some time to get running, but definitely something worth supporting!""
""Very well done for a first BOINC project.""
""I wish every project were this organized & committed.""
""Feedback from the project administrators is excellent! Keep up the great work!!!!!""

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM teams. We advise iGEM headquarters to make a page with interesting tools in order to make those tools more accessible.
We have also analysed what the influence was of collaborations between iGEM teams and external parties. Based on the survey it appears that about 40% of the teams stated in the survey that they collaborated with external parties. Multiple of those teams have worked with other iGEM teams, experts in a research field or public organizations to improve either their own project or to help or educate other parties. For example, 30% of the teams interacted with policy makers. They had  conversations, debates and/or gave advise to policy makers. One of the responders indicated that the government currently even is changing the law because of the iGEM team. Eventually, multiple teams indicated they would not have been able to get certain results or do specific activities without the help of those external parties.
Finally, we have asked the responders on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is not at all and 5 is really large, how valuable participation in the iGEM competition was for them (Figure 1). For most of the students that filled out the survey, the iGEM project helped them to become better researchers and to develop skills outside the lab such as the communication with external parties and fundraising. Furthermore, multiple students experienced working that in a team with students from different backgrounds was very educational. They have noticed that the methods and ways of thinking can be very different. Sometimes this can result in frictions, but in most cases it helps to improve you project. Therefore, we believe that it is wise for supervisors to make a team of students from different background. We have experienced ourselves that this actually contributes to the results of your project.  In conclusion, it appears that beside the scientific importance, iGEM contributes also the development of students and advisers.
Figure 1: Answer distribution to the question: On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is not at all and 5 is really large, how valuable was your participation in the iGEM competition for yourself?
The analysis has shown that iGEM can significantly contribute to the general education about synthetic biology. It also has shown the potential benefits of collaborations. However, it appeared that most of the teams did not collaborate with external parties. We think this is regrettable. Fortunately, iGEM headquarters agreed with us on this point and collaboration between teams has become a hard requirement to win a silver medal since this year therefore. Finally, it shows that we can conclude that beside the scientific importance, iG"

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#testing#project#wetlab#2_-_-_TEXT.html," the absence of MtrC, MtrBC complexes are not detected in a mtrA deletion background 7. Moreover, while isolated MtrA and MtrC can complex, it appears that MtrB is further needed in order for MtrAC interactions to be stable [7]. This indicates that in vivo, there is likely a requirement for association of MtrA and B, followed by association with MtrC for efficient electron transfer.      MtrB is also integral to the correct localization of MtrC, MtrA, and OmcA to their respective positions along the Mtr respiratory pathway. In a mtrB deletion background, MtrA is unable to localize to the OM [7]; similarly, significant amounts of OmcA and MtrC have been shown to mislocalize to the CM in mtrB deletion strains [9].      Of the b-barrel mtrB paralogs that exist in the Shewanella genome, mtrB has been shown to be the most functional in Fe(III) citrate reduction. Coursolle and Gralnick, 2012, recently looked at different combinations of PECs, b-barrel, and OMC paralogs using a DMtr/DmtrB/mtrE strain. Of the functional iron-reducing modules examined, MtrA/MtrB/MtrC showed the highest Fe(III) citrate reduction levels followed by MtrA/MtrB/MtrF . Combinations with MtrE, a MtrB paralog, were also able to reduce Fe(III) citrate, albeit at a lower rate, while neither DmsF nor S04359 produced functional iron citrate reducing modules [1]. This combined with the integral role of MtrB in positioning of PEC and OMCs along the Mtr respiratory pathway makes it an ideal target for our reporter systems.

“Biotechnology has not yet achieved its full potential by any means, in my opinion. Research has been able to solve a great many of the world’s problems and intensive work is still being done on them. By taking part in the iGEM competition I hope to participate in this research, on a small scale, and develop a new biological system which our project then realises. The laboratory work also offers me the unique opportunity to discover new techniques for scientific work, on a high level, and to further develop my own abilities in many areas.

Il faut donc, comme l’a dit Lluis Mir, « que cela reste la vision des scientifiques et de la société, et pas des marchés ».

Réfléchir à propos de la propriété intellectuelle de notre projet. Nous voulions en effet que notre traitement puisse être accessible et au plus bas prix. Dans cette optique, nous nous sommes interrogé sur la mise en open source ou en breveter au moins une partie ? La première option permettrait à n’importe quel société de le développer et de l’améliorer, mais une entreprise privée pourrait alors en breveter une version plus aboutie et imposer les prix qui lui profitent le plus. Par ailleurs, Willy Rozenbaum nous a confirmé que le développement clinique serait alors très difficile à financer : « si vous arrivez à convaincre un industriel de passer au préclinique, il faudra déjà avoir protégé votre modèle puisque sinon, vous ne trouverez pas d’industriel qui fera le développement ».

For iGEM this year, we are working on our project, “Increasing Bacterial Isopropanol Resistance through Bioengineering”. We are developing a way to increase isopropanol production by increasing its resistance to E. coli, the bacteria we chose. By increasing isopropanol production, we can create more alternative energy sources for the world to use.
 
Our iGEM team has participated in many community outreach services. Over the summer, we held a Southeastern iGEM team conference at our school where we practiced presenting our projects. The Duke and East Chapel Hill iGEM teams joined us. Recently, our group set up stands at the Schiele to teach the community, especially younger students, about bioengineering. At the Schiele, we made DNA necklaces out of wheat germ so that we could show younger kids what DNA looks like.

There were fairly sharp bands underneath the band we expected. Additionally, the expected 1.4 kb band was not visible for samples 80 and 81, although they were successfully grown on plates. Sample 85 had no bands, not even primers.
Since 80 and 81 grew on our plates yesterday, we continued with our plan of re-plating our original transformations, especially since the chemically transformed cells do have the appropriate isothermal assembly product to insert. We re-plated all the transformations on the LB+spec plates made today, and will leave them overnight in the 37* incubator. We also made cultures from the colonies on plates 78-82 to mini-prep tomorrow.
Rerunning of PCR products (ultramers and isothermal assembly)
In addition, we decided to see if the streaking was possibly caused by the gel instead of a PCR problem, and so we ran three of our products in a 1% agarose gel instead of an E-gel, with the results below.
Products ran in an agarose gel.  Note that wells 78-80 on the left side of the gel are empty due to sample mysteriously floating out of the well.

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice"

Purdue,2017,Team:Purdue#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," in miniprep protocol. Completed slides for meeting with PI about analysis of lung model methods. Met with graduate student advisor, Stephen Miloro, to obtain advice about project. Had meeting with Dr. Rickus and Dr. Solomon in which lung modeling method was selected for team: Decellularization/Recellularization. Improved upon my literature search based on Stephen’s comments in preparation for my writeup of my literature review due next week for SURF.
Kevin: Finished benzene growth inhibition protocol. Double checked literature for validation that universal promoter requires a sigma-70 sigma factor. Created slides for advisor meeting. Began research on ways to analyze enzyme nahK which produces carbon dioxide including possibly using an Octet Red analysis system.
Vi Ka: Received advice during weekly meeting regarding alterations to current protocol for the benzene transport assay. Started looking into further human practice related literature/information on benzene and its effect on the general populace.
Friday, 6/2 Day 9
Andrew: All parts for reactions in the metabolic pathway were entered into the Python script.  Changing and unchanging concentration options for the model were added.  Research was conducted on how to incorporate flux balance analysis into the model.  More graphing features were included in the figures produced by the model.  PCR was performed on all the gBlocks received.
Archana: Contacted Dr. Cooper regarding GSMS. Reached out to Monsanto and Cook Biotech regarding funding and mentorship. Updated budget. Contacted VWR regarding pipet tips.
Caleigh: Organized personnel and protocols for cloning. Continued working on drafting survey.
Katie: Performed a peer review of Wiki contributions. Edited literature search document according to Stephen’s notes and completed SURF modules. Created graphic for wiki on lung model selection.
Kevin: Started the day by trying to calibrate pipettes that could potentially be used in later experiments and assays to find that our balances were not calibrated. Contacted Colleen Riley for tips on calibration. Contacted Dr. Rickus about use of the Octet-Red. Tried to find substrates that could be purchased so as to test our enzymes. Contacted Dr. Ma about using his lab’s Octet-Red machine and learned that it cannot be used to analyze catalytic enzymes. Made agar with LB broth and poured plates. Worked on universal promoter wiki page.
Vi Ka: Continued literature review on correlation between benzene and patients who fall ill/get sick. Created master mix of G-block at 1pg/ng, and DNA primers at 10mM; these were used for the following PCR protocol.

UVR8-TetRDBD/LovTAP
In order to account for varying light intensity ratios, we employ a second photoreceptor to ""calibrate"" for light intensity. This prevents spurious activation of the downstream protection system. As UVR8-TetRDBD is our engineered protein that we wish to employ for UVB detection, we combine it with LovTAP in the form of a decoder. For this, we define a set of conditions beforehand and devise a model to differentiate between these light sources. The designed circuit includes a number of reporter genes for debugging. Once the circuit has been shown to work as a whole, pabAB is placed under control of the central operon regulated by UVR8 and LacI, as is depicted here .

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."
