Thanks a lot to Wisam Zureik for recording and processing the video material!
Along our journey we were fortunate to meet a great number of interesting as well as dedicated people belonging to various fields, companies and societies.  Out of all people we met, the ""Makers"" from several Hackerspaces who demonstrated their work at the MakerFaire in Hannover, fascinated us the most. Their creativity and commitment for DIY Biology inspired us to take a deeper look into the DIY community or, to be more precise, the Community Labs Scene.
Established in America - New to Europe
Fascinated by DIY Hardware
Across the USA, you will find a wide spread of Community Labs. These open labs allow thousands of people to experience and get an understanding of biology. Furthermore, they provide an open platform that promotes discussions about life sciences. In contrast, there is only a tiny number of Community Labs in Europe, which are only scarcely connected.
We therefore started to contact and connect Community Labs in Europe. Due to their polarizing and educating character, the introduction of synthetic biology into the Community Lab Scene could have a huge impact on society. In cooperation with the Community Labs we met, we already reached a broad variety of open minded people of all ages. By helping and learning from each other we can bring the spirit of iGEM to everyone. Join us in exploring the exeptional world of Community Labs.

Development Process
The developmentof a flowchart of our process and procedures supports the initial overview of our project. Furthermore, this overview is a major requirement to successful upscale our idea and bring it into actual use for researchers and diagnosticians all over the world. Therefore, we talked to several experts ( Prof. Dr. Karl Friehs (fermentation technology), Prof Dr. Thomas Noll (cell culture technology), Dr. Joe Max Risse (fermentation technology) and Dr. Martin Schleef (Plasmid Factory) in large scale production within biotechnology. Results from these discussions were transferred to our procedures to reach a bigger scale. One major issue was identified easily: the whole process would be too complex. Therefore, the two central processes of generating of the Evobody encoding sequence and the final production of the Evobody itself are presented in separate flowcharts to present our unique system of in vivo mutagenesis and selection. Our starting point is the main procedure that gives an overview. This makes up the skeleton of our project. It describes the steps that are necessary to get an Evobody sequence and how to continue after the production"

Due to the DIY and open-sourced nature of TERRA, we believed that TERRA could be adopted by DIY bio labs to streamline their workflows and increase the accessibility of microfluidics. To learn more about the greater DIY bio space and the obstacles they face in regards to adopting microfluidics, we reached out to BosLab and Cap City Biohackers, which are DIY bio labs located in Boston and Columbus respectively.
Our discussion with BosLab gave our team insight to the obstacles inhibiting widespread adoption of microfluidics. While many scientists are aware of microfluidics and its
potential advantages, the lack of standardization and useful demonstrations have left scientists skeptical to adopting a microfluidic platform. For example, past microfluidic workshops at BosLab did not effectively demonstrate and explain how to utilize microfluidics for general scientists.
Because of this gap in communication, we realized that the user’s experience with TERRA is essential for its adoption for both DIY bio labs and synthetic biologists. To support users, we created extensive documentation on how to assemble and use TERRA, accompanied with descriptions, pictures, and videos. In addition, we designed the UI under the assumption that users are not microfluidics experts to ensure that scientists in a variety of fields can use TERRA.
Cap City Biohackers gave us a different perspective of the greater DIY bio space because, unlike BosLab, they are newer and currently in the process of setting up their center. We learned the general process of how labs
acquire second-hand equipment and the wide range of resources and equipment DIY bio labs have. Because TERRA is DIY and open-sourced, it was important for us to know potential manufacturing and assembly constraints of DIY bio labs. In addition, we learned different experimental applications Cap City Biohackers had in mind for both TERRA and microfluidics in general, such as small-scale fed batch experiments and automated molecular cloning. Due to a wide array of potential applications, we designed TERRA to be application-agnostic as opposed to a device for specific microfluidic experiments. To handle a wide variety of potential applications, we included flush functionality for sterility and the TERRA Adapter.

We were also staff members that assisted NCTU_Formosa during the event. Three of our members did the presentation. Nonetheless, we have altered our project slightly, and details should be released on giant jamboree.
Education
We introduced our project and iGEM competition to the juniors and sophomores in our school. Some of them gave us positive feedback.

Before printing, plate 500 µL of calcium chloride (0.1M) on the LB agar plate using standard plating technique to enable formation of a hydrogel. If further cell growth is desired, keep the plates at room temperature. At 37 degrees the alginate dries out within 24 hours.

Experimental approach on how to 3D print bacteria
When we started our first experiments on 3D printing bacteria, it became quite obvious we would need something to support our cells:
Printing RFP expressing cells in LB medium in the shape of a circle worked, but gravity and surface properties were working against us making the line almost 1 cm thick.
Sodium alginate is commonly used in biology to create a hydrogel by using calcium chloride and can be redissolved again by complexing the calcium ions and replacing them again with sodium ions. This hydrogel is both viscous enough to be immobile, while at the same time provides optimal living conditions for the bacteria.
Therefore we decided to disperse our bacteria in a solution of sodium alginate which would form a stable hydrogel during the printing process.
Our initial idea was to simultaneously extrude the bioink containing sodium alginate and the bacterial cells from one needle and the calcium chloride solution from another needle which is in direct contact with the first one. The idea was to directly jellify the alginate when leaving the needle, thus creating a cylinder with a thickness of the needle’s inner diameter. However, at low flow rates droplet and thus bead formation was unavoidable and high flow rates resulted only in dissatisfactory results (low control).
Since the mechanical setup additionally posed some difficulties, we tried a different approach: direct extrusion of the sodium alginate solution into a larger volume of dissolved calcium chloride. The flaws of this setup quickly became obvious: instead of extruding a cylinder, the hydrogel was mostly sticking to the needle and clogging was inevitable at low flow rates. Finally, the hydrogel was floating around freely in the liquid thus the required spatial precision for 3D printing was impossible to achieve in such a setup.
We concluded that we would need something to which the hydrogel could attach, something that would keep bacterial cells alive and in the best case could also be used as a calcium ion source for the gel formation. We found such a material in LB agar to which we added calcium chloride at a concentration of 0.1M"

1. Hold the 5th iGEM Central China Regional Conference
From July 10th to 11th, 2018, the iGEM HUST-China team successfully held the 5th iGEM Central China Regional Conference. The event aimed at promoting the understanding of each team in their competition projects, improving the project content, and giving opportunities for communication and mutual learning between different teams. The teams invited to participate in the conference were the 2018 iGEM team HZAU-China, NCTU-Formosa, WHU-China, NCHU and HUST-China. At the meeting on July 11th, each team will make a 20-minute English presentation time to introduce the project content and current progress of their competition projects, while other teams listened cand raised questions and shared their opinions. Each team presented a number of constructive issues related to project feasibility, safety, experimental protocols, modeling methods, economic costs and application prospects. During the period, delegates also had a lively and in-depth discussion on some of these issues. Many of the questions and suggestions raised in the conference have effectively pointed out the possible disappointments of the project and provided feasible solutions to these problems. We exchanged thoughts and built a sincere friendship in this meeting which laid a foundation for the communication and cooperation. Besides, we helped WHU-China and HZAU-China to cryodesiccate the samples with 96-well plates and send them to Nanjing together when we were submitting the parts.
2. Participating in CCIC
The CCiC Conference is an academic conference launched by Chinese iGEMers. Its purpose is to promote the development of synthetic biology in China. In the 5th CCiC, our team worked as an organizer in the initial preparation of CCiC. During the meeting, we invited professors major in synthetic biology to communicate with iGEMers. We listened to lectures from top scholars in synthetic biology and gained a clearer understanding of the meaning of synthetic biology and its practical applications. In addition, we also introduced our project to other iG"

Looked at Papers Potential :  Found a paper that did deterministic modeling . The paper looks at the autophosphorylation of LuxN ... using as a model for something similar like (LuxPQ) ??? Solution is very complex . If this model will be used---- need to find a simpler way to solve using matlab
More deterministic stuff : Quantitative analysis of protein- protein interactions
Sensitivity amplification in Phosphorylation-Dephosphorylation cycle
Dead End :
Design and sigmalling mechanism of light regulated histidine Kinases
Biological pathway kinetic rate constants are scale invariants

Shenzhen-SFLS
This year we made a long-term collaboration with SSTi-SZGD. We helped them to build a team and figure out how to participate in this competition, including team management, details of competition, and experiment protocols. In return, they helped us test enzyme activity of CA and plot standard curves using two different methods.
You can see the results here.
In summer，we shared our laboratories with a high school iGEM team SMS-Shenzhen for they could not get into their campus during summer vacation. Furthermore, we also gave them some directions on experiments, involving transformation, ultrasonication and so on. Reciprocally, they helped us with regulating lab and data processing. We also helped team Shenzhen-SFLS with project model.
Bit
We were invited to BIT campus for a deep bilateral communication and we interchanged not only the designs of our projects but also our experience on the iGEM competition, which was of great help in improving our project. BIT-China was invited to alpha test for our website Corridor, making their efforts in establish a platform of all iGEMers. We assisted them in setting up their wiki.
SCU-WestChina
Before CCiC, we exchanged our experience and knowlodge of Bacillus subtilis on how to incubate those bacteria. We interchanged our protocols with SCU-WestChina, and helped them with transformations.
NCTU_Formosa
We invited NCTU_Formosa to be a member of Corridor, and also got invited by them to use their Parabase, a software aiming at predicting potential antifungal peptides, searching validated antifungal peptides, and finding the relationship between fungal pathogen, their host species and target peptides. We hope that Parabase can be a useful tool in synthetic biology."

Advantages:
Well-established, many available chemicals and equipment
Convenient, self-operating and low-maintenance due to closed system nature
Disadvantages:
Formation of toxic sludge from precipitate, which is environmentally and economically costly to remove
Requires extra flocculation/coagulation due to precipitation
Each metal has a distinct pH for optimum precipitation
Corrosive chemicals increases safety concerns
Ion exchange: reversible chemical reaction where ions from water or wastewater solution are exchanged for similarly charged ions attached to a stationary solid particle that are usually inorganic zeolites or resins.
Reverse osmosis: effective molecular filter to remove dissolved solutes through a membrane
Advantages:
Reduces concentration of all ionic contaminants, not just the heavy metal in question
Can be scaled up easily
Disadvantages:
Expensive
Requires high pressure
Too sensitive to operating conditions
Phytoremediation: use of plants to remediate heavy metals in contaminated soil, sludge, water etc.
Microbial remediation: use of microorganisms to degrade hazardous contaminants
nixA
The transport protein being utilized for this project is nixA from Helicobacter pylori.  This protein resembles many eukaryotic integral membrane proteins and represents a high-affinity nickel transport system when expressed in E. coli.[10] The nixA gene has been introduced into E. coli previously to sequester Ni2+ from water at 4 times the level of wild type cells.[11] We hope to improve upon this system by combining the nixA gene with a different metallothionein than previously used, utilizing a different regulatory system, and creating modular genetic parts.

Cristina wisely decided not to send anything to sequence before holiday, we were not sure about the goodness of my samples; it would be better to make new overnight cultures on Tuesday and screen them once returned to work in the lab on next week. And this is what I did, fortunately.
In the meantime on Monday our friend Damiano came back to the lab to help me in measuring the H2S concentration produced by my bacteria with his portable gas-chromatography. We had excellent results: empty cells did not produce H2S as expected while cells with CysDes produced a concentration of about 18ppm. This is a good result, because we demonstrated that my construct works but it does not produce a concentration too high of H2S that could be dangerous. Excellent!
I’ve characterized co-transformations.
I’ve done a few tests on marble pieces.
With Ross, I’ve started building an acid rain simulator which should be able to reproduce the process of black crust formation.
In this week we tested the terminators’ behaviour with Ptac. The results were quite surprising: although the terminator efficiency calculated with Venus’ raw peaks seems similar to that found with T7 promoter, the stabilizing effect on Cherry was considerably lower.
This discover was really puzzling for us: it seemed that the stabilizing effect depends on the polymerase used and we had no idea how to explain this phenomena. Maybe this is due to the polymerase processivity or quickness??
Also Sheref was surprised with this result, and he proposed us to try an in vitro reaction in the absence of ribonucleases, to see if this effect is due to these enzymes.
We planned to do that next week with the help of Fabio Chizzolini in the Mansy Lab.

For the average consumer of science information, it can be really misleading to level of the discoveries made the how quickly science actually progresses. It’s not the news agencies fault for wanting to report a possible emerging cure for a current problem plaguing humanity, but there needs to be a better delivery of the information such that the general public can understand the research, be excited by it, but not leave them disappointed that it may be five to ten years away.
To accomplish this task, we set out to interview some of the key people in the outreach of scientific research at UBC and key stakeholders related to the topic of our project learn the best ways to convey scientific research and key methods for making scientific research more understandable.
The Importance of Science Communication
How to Effectively Communicate Science
Common Mistakes in Science Communication
An Example: CRISPR Gene Editing Articles
On February 15th, 2013, an article was published in Science magazine about a new way of editing genes very precisely. We will compare and contrast the original article, with the press release following it, as well as articles aimed at the general public.
The original article (DOI 10.1126/science.1231143) contains many difficult words, such that only someone studying biology would understand the specifics. The main idea of the article can be understood from the abstract.
Functional elucidation of causal genetic variants and elements requires precise genome editing technologies. The type II prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas adaptive immune system has been shown to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. We engineered two different type II CRISPR/Cas systems and demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and mouse cells. Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology.

Our project and the iGEM in general generated very positive feedback and intrigued many people around the world. It was with pleasure that we answered their questions!
SCIENCE EDUCATION: MICROBIOWORLD
Overview
Games are a fantastic support in education. That is why iGEM Toulouse 2017 developed a card game to explain molecular and synthetic biology in a gripping and funny way. This game was named Microbioworld. Unlike most games presented at iGEM, it is not based on combining cards like « Happy Families » or « Uno ». Its structure and gameplay is closer to « Magic: the Gathering » which allows plenty of unexpected combinations. We, iGEM Toulouse 2018, were very excited about the power of this game as an educational tool and we decided to carry on its development through two main axes: improvement of the cards and distribution of the game.
Improvement of the cards
In this game, each player is a microorganism whose aim is either to be the first to develop into a large colony, or to eliminate all other competitors. For that, the player can choose between division or action at each of its turn. Example of actions could be changing the growth medium to a more favorable one, attacking the others with a phage invasion or protecting itself by acquiring plasmids with resistance markers (as long as it does not already have a plasmid with the same origin of replication, of course). In the initial game version, some of the actions weren't really based on real scientific concepts. The game also needed rebalancing the power of some cards to be improved. We therefore reworked it to create Microbioworld2. This required a lot of games between us and with professionals in the game business. This is how we participated in the “Grimoire” game event in Toulouse. We also met Jackson Moore, an official « Magic The Gathering » judge who kindly shared his knowledge and experience with us. Additionally, we used the game at most of the events and education activities we participated in.
This year, we renewed our collaboration with Vincent Hoffmann and Julien Hypolite for the illustrations. Their work is just fantastic !
Distribution of the game
All the people who played with us were amazed with the game's significance and educational power. This was especially true for people who knew about microbiology since they were able to perceive how smart the game play is and how accurate the mechanisms used in the game are from"

Add 30ml of pre-cooled CaCl2- MgCl2 per 50ml of initial liquid medium to resuspend bacteria cell pellet. Centrifuge at 4℃, 4100rpm for 10 minutes. Discard supernatant then place the tube upside down to make sure trace liquid medium runs out. Add 2ml of pre-cooled CaCl2 per 50ml of initial liquid medium to resuspend bacteria cell pellet. Transfer to EP tubes (50ul every tube) and store at -80℃.
7. Transformation of E. coli
Example Protocol: Standard heat-shock transformation of chemically competent bacteria.
Take competent cells out of -80°C and thaw on ice (approximately 20-30min). Take agar plates (containing the appropriate antibiotic) out of 4°C to warm up to room temperature or place in 37°C incubator. Mix 1 to 5μl of DNA (usually 10pg to 100ng) into 20-50μL of competent cells in a microcentrifuge or falcon tube. GENTLY mix by flicking the bottom of the tube with your finger a few times. Note: Transformation efficiencies will be approximately 10-fold lower for ligation of inserts to vectors than for an intact control plasmid. Place the competent cell/DNA mixture on ice for 20-30min. Heat shock each transformation tube by placing the bottom 1/2 to 2/3 of the tube into a 42°C water bath for 30-60 seconds (45sec is usually ideal, but this varies depending on the competent cells you are using). Put the tubes back on ice for 2 min. Add 250-500μl LB or SOC media (without antibiotic) and grow in 37°C shaking incubator for 45min. Note: This outgrowth step allows the bacteria time to generate the antibiotic resistance proteins encoded on the plasmid backbone so that they will be able to grow once plated on the antibiotic containing agar plate. This step is not critical for Ampicillin resistance but is much more important for other antibiotic resistances. Plate some or all of the transformation onto a 10cm LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic. Note: We recommend that you plate 50μL on one plate and the rest on a second plate. This gives the best chance of getting single colonies, while allowing you to recover all transformants. Incubate plates at 37°C overnight.

Week 3 (13.7.2015 - 19.7.2015)
Sequencing results of week 1 were evaluated. For all gBlocks, except for esaRv2 correct constructs were found.
Plasmid preparations of the correct gBlocks were digested and inserts of the correct size were cut out of the analyzing gel and purified.
New ligations of esaR and esaRv2 with pJET 1.2 were performed and transformed into E.coli TOP 10. Transformants were streaked out again. After plasmid isolation they were again digested to check for the correct size of the inserts. Plasmid preparations containing the correct size were sent for sequencing. All of the obtained sequences showed mutations or deletions (Fig. 1).
Figure 1 Part of a sequencing result of EsaRv2. The sequence contains a deletion at position 618. As the mutation is in the coding region of the
gene the corresponding sequence could not be used for further work.
Thus the experiment was repeated.
pPIC9 was digested with BglII to cut out the E.coli origin of replication as well as the Amp-resistance marker. The linearized vector was further dephosphorylated and purified.
OE-PCR of bla_p15A was performed. As the first attempts resulted in some unspecific bands on the analyzing gel (Fig. 2), the PCR was repeated with more restrictive conditions. Even though an unspecific band remained, a band of the correct size (~2 kb)"

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HansJonas_-_-_TEXT.html,"icians choose to be responsible for the wellbeing of the community. They are responsible for the continuity and the identity of the state, during their nomination, but also after that. The primary responsibility of people concerns other people. The overlapping features of these two examples are the emotional identification with the object of responsibility on the one hand, and the incorporation of the whole being of the object.
In the interviews held with our iGEM team members, we tried to explore how student-scientist think about this concept. We asked them whether they feel responsible for their contribution to a biobrick, which is of great importance for their own bacterium, but which can be abused by others, e.g. by placing this biobrick in another bacterium. In a phenomenological analysis of the concept of responsibility, Jonas emphasizes the eternal aspect of responsibility. According to Jonas, it is not ethically possible to say for example: the iGEM competition is over, so is my responsibility for the work I have done. Another aspect of responsibility is its non-reciprocal character. It is not correct to say: I only feel responsible if the other person feels responsible for me. This turns ethics into self-interest. Which although it will not be lacking as driving force of our behavior, should not be regarded as the sole incentive for ethics. Other aspects of responsibility are that it is juridical nor contractual. The appeal to responsibility comes from nature itself, so the responsibility is established horizontally, not vertically. It is nature in its temporality and frailty. In the next section, we will see how this new concept of responsibility is difficult to apply in a practical setting.
In the footsteps of the great German philosopher Immanuel Kant, Jonas formulates a new categorical imperative. Categorical means that it applies to all humans, regardless of their desires and interests. One can distinguish categorical from hypothetical. Hypothetical means that the imperative is binding under certain circumstances only. Hypothetical imperatives are therefore not universal. Jonas is looking for a compelling imperative for all humans, that is both categorical, and non-anthropocentric, i.e. its ethical concern is far wider than only one’s fellow human being. Jonas formulates it this way: “Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life”; or expressed negatively “Act so that the effects of your action are not destructive of the future possibility of such life.” (PV p.36).1 When we compare this new categorical imperative with the categorical imperative of Kant (Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should"

Jilin_China,2018,Team:Jilin China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,".1. When OD was close to 0.6, we added IPTG at 1:1000 to induce protein expression at 16-20°C overnight. We lysed and centrifuged the four groups of bacteria to get supernatant protein mixture. Then we placed the supernatant of cECFP and nECFP mixture at 4 ℃ and 20℃ to induce ECFP fussion. We measured the fluoresence of these 4 types of ECFP.
Figure 1. 4 represnets the sample in 4℃ and 20 represents the sample in 20℃. They are the mixture of nECFP and cECFP. Blank is the average of individual cECFP and nECFP.
As the results show, the fluorescence density of nECFP and cECFP mixture is higher than blank, which has significant difference between two groups according to statistic analysis (P<0.05).
They also helped us to do some verification work. We designed and constructed hundreds of RNA-based thermosensors this year. We need to measure and get their melting temperature. Temperature dependence of global factors such as the fluorescence parameters of GFP or the activity of RNA polymerase may contribute to the individual thermosensor measurement. They should, however, affect all thermosensors in a similar fashion. Therefore, we focus on the relative difference in the thermosensor activities and we need a positive control to normalize the effects of different temperatures. So we designed two positive control (called NPC, MPC) with no thermosensor sequence to make it less sensitive to temperature. In order to ensure the accuracy of our experimental results, Fudan-CHINA helped us characterize and verify the sfGFP expression of our positive control at different temperatures.
Figure 2. Fluorescence expression of positive control at different temperatures. The figure’s horizontal axis represents the temperature range (28℃ to 42℃), and the vertical axis represents fluorescence intensity of sfGFP. The red line is the sfGFP expression curve of NPC at 8th hours, the purple line is sfGFP expression curve of NPC at 6th hours, the blue line is sfGFP expression curve of MPC at 8th hours and the organe line is sfGFP expression curve of MPC at 6th hours.
It can be seen from the results that the sfGFP expression of our positive control changes approximately linearly with increasing temperature. This is consistent with our own measurement. The results are vital to us because we need to use this positive control when"
SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Shen encouraged us, but he also pointed out some problems we need to take care of. Among those problems, microorganism colonization was what mentioned by Professor Shen as the most challengeable one, which usually influences the final cure effect. He suggested us to search more references to choice a suitable strain if we do want to develop a curable intestinal flora. Therefore, to solve the colonization problem, we made many effort, including choosing probiotics E. coli Nissle 1917 as the chassis, designing deficient strain and complementary plasmid to enforce the colonization ability, and we also use animal experiment to test whether the bacteria colonized as we expected.
In conclusion, attending the 2016 Chengdu International Conference of Gastroenterology is beneficial for optimizing our project.
2. Project Presentation for the 1st Time
On 22nd February 2017, After the rudiment of this project was determined, we invited our 6 instructors, professors from the State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, Sichuan University, to give us some advice to our project. The professors are doing researches in different fields and we believe they can offer more diversified suggestions to our project. We made a presentation to introduce the whole design of our project to them. At that time our project contained 4 systems, which were related, progressive and all linked to the same theme, using reconstructive probiotics to cure metabolic diseases. The diseases we aimed to cure were phenylketonuria (PKU) and gout. The four systems were all related to reconstructive intestinal flora, but worked in different places, including gut, dialysis tube human being’s blood and artificial blood vessel.
After we introduced our project, professors asked many questions and had a fierce discussion with us. They mainly queried the safety and effectiveness of our project, especially the fourth part in which we planed to inject the remolded bacteria into a artificial blood vessel near the hepatic portal vein. They thought the immune reaction will do harm to the human body a lot. Their worry let us be more aware of the possible risk which our project contained, and let us thought twice before we made the final decision.
After this reply, we carefully collated and analyzed our instructors’ suggestion. Finally, we deleted the last two parts and started to focus on using reconstructive intestinal flora and dialysis devices to cure hyperuricemia and gout.

Human Practices
Investigating the most basic theories of biology is not only important to laboratory research, but applies to students as well. Through the distribution of a molecular biology animation and the presentation of our research to high school students, the Penn State iGEM team has reached out to the community with its foundational research.

State College High School Presentation
Questioning the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology takes a foundational approach to the most strongly-held beliefs in the field. As we designed our projects, the Penn State team realized that this research applied not only to current researchers, but to those who were just beginning to learn the basic theories that govern life as we know it. High school students are taught to the Central Dogma, and  accept it as true without a second thought. Showing them another side of molecular biology would provide an interesting counterpoint to their book-taught knowledge.
The Penn State iGEM team visited a local high school and presented our designs and project objectives to a high school biology class. We began the seminar with a preview of the Basics of Molecular Biology animation compiled during the summer. Afterward, we presented our individual projects, stressing the importance of investigating outliers in a scientific field. The students were attentive, engaged, and asked excellent questions. Though the Penn State team may have introduced a shameless plug for the iGEM high school division, the experience was enlightening for both parties.
Animation and Prezi Distribution
A cartoon animation of the basics of synthetic and molecular biology was developed and produced by one of our team members, Kevin Thyne. The Blender animation has been uploaded to YouTube, along with three Prezi animations describing the individual project designs and results. Both the animation and the Prezis are publically available, and all were shown at the State College High School presentation

YSB 1.0 Conference
Introduction
In the early morning of the 12th of July, the BareCillus team traveled south to the University College London for the first Young Synthetic Biologists Conference, aimed specifically at iGEM teams from all competitions (Undergraduate, High-school, Post-graduate etc). The conference was attended by 16 teams all in all, and was spread across two days, consisting of presentations, workshops and poster demonstrations.  The weekend was to prove an incredible early iGEM experience, providing the whole team with the chance to practice presentation skills, as well as gaining invaluable feedback on the project ideas and poster. It also provided an opportunity to test out the Modelling Workshop that has been developed as part of a scheme to interest and involve people in Synthetic Biology.
Presentation
As part of the weekend, the team gave a presentation on their project aims, constructs and models. Below is a downloadable copy of the slides of the presentation being given by Isabelle McLaren, Rob McKiernan, Vincent Leonardo and Matthew Law.
A downloadable version can be found here .
Poster
Another part of the weekend provided teams a space to hang a poster detailing points of their projects. Other teams were then encouraged to place postit notes on the posters giving opinions, questions and requests for collaboration.
Below is a lower-resolution image of the poster taken to UCL by the team.

75% of participants were interested with synthetic biology field      for academic purposes.
Browsing the Registry of Standard Parts
56% of participants think that it is not easy to search      for the parts in Registry of Standard Parts. Many comments      indicate a need for a better search engine and more flexible keyword      search options, especially excepting aliases. Also many are longing      for recognizable parts names, which will ease searching with keyword.
Partnership with Google and enforcing standardized parts names     are suggested
As a global organization iGEM can offer the Parts Registry in     different languages and more illustrations describing how the system     works.
Content of Registry of Standard Parts
57% of participants agree that the number of parts registered      in the Registry of Standard Parts is not enough for their projects.
55% of participants think that there are enough and      useful parts distributed in iGEM Plates that we can use in our projects.
Even though most agree the number of parts in the registry is impressive,     still they find it limited when it comes to design different devices     for diverse applications especially in different species other than     E. Coli. Participants believe that if there are more functional standardized     parts, especially protein coding sequences and promoter-RBS , they can     design devices according to the needs of the community instead of designing     what can simply be assembled into a device.
Encouraging development of vectors and standards for new species     and new standardized parts in different research areas is suggested.
Enforcing submission of right DNA sequences and working conditions     for each part is suggested.
Few recommend expanding iGEM into a collaborative effort rather     than an undergraduate tournament, which will increase the number and     the diversity of the parts designed and submitted all throughout the     year.
Submission to the Parts Registry
52% of participants said that they have not encountered      difficulties during submitting parts. Even though participants      are satisfied with the web interface of the registry, most complains      about the pSB1C3 as the new standard plasmid to submit DNA.
71% of participants are like minded with our team's      opinion, which is that The nomenclature of part IDs such as construct,      device, composite parts, protein generator, is confusing as there      is no consensus on how to use them correctly.
Terminology and categorization used on iGEM’s Parts Registry should     be re-described and correct use of terminology should be enforced during     the submission process.
75% of participants agree that different, specified      submission interfaces should be designed for contructs, promoter,      RBS, CDS and terminals is needed during"

Description
Butyrate plays multiple critical roles in shaping host immune responses and is involved in the amelioration of colonic disease pathologies. Formation of short chain fatty acids occurs through anaerobic fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon by specific gut microbiota. Of these metabolites, butyrate is known to beneficially regulate the adaptive immune response. Colonic butyrate ameliorates animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Butyrate can also prevent growth and induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells while paradoxically causing normal intestinal epithelium to proliferate, something few pharmacotherapies are able to do.
Our chassis strain for this project is Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. It is the only probiotic recommended by the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization to be used as an alternative treatment for ulcerative colitis. It has also been used by several iGEM teams whose focus was an engineered probiotic for biomedical application due to its low immunogenicity and high receptiveness to genetic engineering. The wild-type bacterium does not naturally produce significant levels of butyrate; this is a property we wish to engineer. The overall goal of our project is to overproduce butyrate in a chassis that could not produce this metabolite before. We were inspired by METU HS ANKARA 2016, Toulouse 2015, and NRP UAE Norwich 2015 in their attempts to produce butyrate with biobricks. Ultimately, none of these teams made a redox balanced and optimized butyrate pathway.  We believe that optimizing the flow of carbon is the key to success which greatly influenced our project design.
To optimize butyrate production we planned to insert the correct pathway into E. coli Nissle and use gene deletions to get rid of offshoot pathways that direct carbon flow away from the endpoint. Metabolic engineering was initially intended to help those suffering from diseases of the gut, but The Ferminator is not limited to fighting off biological villains! Beyond the scope of therapeutics"

The MRSA bacteria can be killed by use of antibiotics, but an ordinary family should also take precautions. “Wash your hands, do not sneeze on people, and just be clever about bacteria and how it spreads” - quote Hans Jørn Kolmos.
What is the biggest cause to MRSA?
It is hard to isolate a single source that contributes to the development of MRSA, but we know it is a combination of the farming industry and antibiotic distribution.
The media has a tendency to  blame the pigs for MRSA. It is actually estimated that only 40% of all pigs are carriers.
What antibiotics are used to treat MRSA:CC398, MRSA:USA300 and VISA(Vancomycin-intermediate-S. Aureus)?
Tough question, but Vancomycin can treat both the MRSA:CC398 and MRSA:USA300.
Can you see any potential in our project?
It could be a part of a treatment, but it could also be nice to test the bacteriocins on gram-negative bacteria. Bacteriocins could also be used for oral treatment, eg. in the nose, were MRSA is normally found on carriers.
Interviewing plastic companies
14 plastic companies responded to our questions. Each company was asked the following:
Do you have any specific attitudes towards sustainability?
Would you want to work with plastic which have been produced by bacteria?
Do you know the plastic PHA, or poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)?
If the price of biodegradable plastic was considerably lower than it is as its present), would you then as a company have any interest in this? (it cost 4 times as much to produce at the moment
Would you be able to incorporate such a product in your business?

Agstrup Plast ApS:
“It would be a great advantage for us if we could offer production with a bio-material as well. This will give more options for our customers and a more environmental friendly image. However, it will still be the customer's’ decision and the choice will also depend on requirements such as sustainability.”

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
One major task for every iGEM team is the creation of a wiki describing their project. For this reason the MIT is hosting a MediaWiki and every iGEM participant is allowed to create wiki pages on this server. The great advantage of this setup is that no team has to run their own server for hosting their wiki. On the other hand, team members are not allowed to change any MediaWiki settings, such as changing the skin of the wiki or installing extensions. For our collaboration we want to make the creation of a wiki easier for every team. Therefore we will show how to create a team wiki that is easy to use and can still be customized as desired. Furthermore, we will also explain how to use this wiki even if somebody else of your team created the wiki. After running through this tutorial, the team will have a basic framework that can be enhanced later on. The tutorial will be divided into two parts:
Part I describes how to create and setup a team wiki at the first place. This part should be read by members in charge of the layout and design of the wiki and will require basic computer skills. An understanding of HTML and CSS will also be very helpful.
Part II focuses on the everyday usage"

Abstract
When we talk about internal clock, we actually refer to the circadian rhythm of higher animals and plants. Sensing the cycling environmental factors (light and temperature, etc.), circadian clock allows organism to behave accordingly and reguarly. This year, we develop a plug-in for microbes, a system that can build up an internal clock for microbes and guide them to live regularly as well as to work efficiently. Also, we could insert this system into dangerous strains and endue life span, they are doomed to die before causing any biohazard. Flip units based on recombinase system are introduced in our system. One flip unit is able to calculate a specific period of time, while several flip units form one time cycle. So, when we combine several time cycles together, a timer is constructed. Different flip unit assemblies creat distinctive time cycles, forms different kinds of timers. We believe this system will be of great significance to biological devices with time-related concepts.
Background
Meanings of Timer in Microbes
It is well known that the internal clock is of great significance to human life. The time rhythm let people work and rest regularly, which keeps us healthy and energetic. However, in microbes, especially prokaryotic organism, we could hardly find a strain with rhythm.
Actually, adding rhythm into microbes is a meaningful thing, by which would provide us a brand new technology platform or control system. This year, we hope to construct a rhythm device with time limit. As follows, we will use 3 simple hypothetical cases to illustrate its future application potentials.
a. Industry application of microbial rhythm
When it comes to microbial industry, we often find restrictive reaction space and strict operations necessary, since in the current industrial production, without autonomic consciousness, microorganisms could only behave under stress. So, if we want to express several proteins in turn, this limit determines that we have to add a new inducer once in a while to initiate the expression of a new gene. However, once microbes have autonomic rhythm and the concept of time, any operation with timing demands could be done in a autonomic way. We could make bacteria express proteins in chronological order, or realize certain behaviors by periodic expression, and then, apply to industrial mass production.
b. Advantages of adding microbes rhythm"

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the disease is more meaningful than individual cases.
A2: Nowadays, treating Inflammatory intestinal diseases is still a difficult problem over the whole world, mainly in terms of poor response to drug therapy for some patients, recurrence after treatment and serious adverse reactions after a long-term drug therapy. Of course, some patients still have to undergo an operation because of the bowel obstruction, intestinal perforation, intestinal fistula, hemorrhoea, etc. And some patients die from various complications.
Q: We hope to understand the common methods of treating intestinal diseases, especially the inflammatory intestinal diseases
A: Now the methods of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases mainly include drug therapy (5-aminosalicylic acid, hormone, immunization drug, antibiotics, biologics), operative treatment, stool transplantation, stem cell transplantation and leukocyte elution adsorption treatment.
Q: Now the cure rate of inflammatory intestinal diseases, especially chronic diseases and severe diseases, is still low. We hope to know the disadvantage of current methods and techniques of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases, from the perspective of a clinical doctor.
A1: Treatment is mainly based on the drug therapy, because 5-ASA preparation has poor tolerance and glucocorticoid has several side effects (hypertension, hyperglycaemia, osteoporosis, etc.). Chinese people have a case of a certain proportion of metabolic enzyme deficiency that may cause the bone marrow depression. And biologics has a high risk of infection and may exists the probability of drug resistance.
A2: Disadvantage of current methods and techniques of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases is mainly about: 1. lack of effective drugs for all patients, even if the biological agents which is researched and developed in recent years and whose efficacy is only about 50%. 2. There are concerns about the drug for long term use existing serious adverse reactions. 3. Some drugs have problems with secondary failure. 4. Expenses.
Q: The leading edge of biological sciences is about the direction of the intestinal ecosystem. However, there is a big gap between the theoretical research and practice. So what’s your opinion about this current situation?
A1: Intestinal micro ecosystem (intestinal flora) is a hot topic in recent years. Actually, inflammatory intestinal disease is a pathogenesis with genetic background, which involves environment, immunity and infection.
Maybe it is not because of a certain bacteria, instead, because of the change of the proportion of some bacteria or the change of metabolites. These factors can initiate or accelerate diseases, but they are not the determinants.

Freiburg,2015,Team:Freiburg#Project#Cellfree Expression_-_-_TEXT.html," the reaction with additional components over time, thus enabling higher expression.
There are several ways of performing a cell-free reaction. In batch reactions, transcription and translation are carried out in one reaction vessel containing all the necessary components. Due to factors like fast depletion of energy supply, degradation of components (e.g. nucleotides), and decreasing concentrations of free Mg2+-ions, the reaction in the batch system usually reaches a plateau after about 1-2 hours 1) .
In dialysis mode, the cell-free transcription and translation reaction is carried out in a small reaction chamber that is separated by a dialysis membrane from a 10-20x larger reservoir containing low molecular weight reagents. The reservoir supplies the reaction chamber with ions, energy substrates, nucleotides and amino acids. In turn, the low molecular weight by-products are efficiently diluted via the membrane from the reaction chamber into the reservoir. This setup will drive the reaction longer (usually 20-24 hrs) and results in higher levels of produced protein 1) .
Design of the DNA Template
In general, it is possible to use RNA, plasmids, or linear templates (e.g. PCR products). In all cases, the structural design of the DNA or RNA is of high importance for the yield and quality of the protein produced. In bacterial 5'-UTRs optimization can be achieved by placing a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence at an optimal distance, typically eight nucleotides, from the AUG start codon. The SD sequence interacts with the 3'-end of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that is part of the small ribosomal (30S) subunit, to facilitate initiation. Furthermore, the integration of an A/U-rich enhancer sequence further upstream allows the SD sequence to interact more effectively with the rRNA.  Another attempt in this context is the use of different tags to enhance expression, as reported by Haberstock et al (2012). 6) This design was used for our DNA templates for cell-free expression of antigens.
In eukaryotes, the Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) is a highly structured element found within viral mRNA that is able to induce eukaryotic initiation. This solves the problem of ineffective capping, which presents a major restriction of high production. For example, the IRES of the Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV) showed the ability to increase expression substantially across several species 7) .

In subsequent CFPS-test, run-off cell extract from 06/03 was used. We tested the impact of RNase inhibitor, high amount of Mg-glutamate (12 mM) and high amount of K-glutamate (140 mM) on the reaction with T7p-RBS-sfGFP (BBa_I746909). Additionally, a T7p-UTR-RBS-sfGFP plasmid from a mini-prep plasmid isolation (06/15) was tested without any change to other components when compared to 06/10. All reactions were performed in duplicate.
Reaction conditions and volumes were the same as on 06/10. One negative control without DNA-template was used with 80 mM K-glutamate and 4 mM Mg-glutamate added. To compare relative fluorescent units, an sfGFP-containing cell lysate and a purified GFP with 6xHis-tag (kindly provided by Lukas) was employed.

Week 6: July 1-3
Monday:
Today, we clarified the direction of our project. While we were originally planning to do a web application, we decided to emphasize our efforts on a Surface application. We discovered through the past couple of weeks that it was very difficult to get the robustness that we wanted out of a web application, and although that would be more accessible, the programming challenges associated with a web application would take more time than what we had. With that in mind, we still decided to keep a web application, but with less functionality compared to our Surface application. We briefly went back to the drawing board to draw out what the backend should look like as well as redesigning our user interface to take advantage of the Surface's touch screen capabilities.
Tuesday:
Today, we revisited drag and drop! After working on this project in JavaScript, jQuery and Angular JS, we are now tackling the problem in C# for the Surface. We made some final decisions on our user interface and created another paper prototype that is essentially a second draft of what we envision our final product will look like.
Wednesday:
Today, we worked on drag and drop more - we finally got it to work over the long weekend, which was really exciting! Looking ahead, we started to plan for more elements of our user interface to have more functionality, such as having multiple panels update when one is changed. However, before that, I'm off to enjoy the July 4th fireworks in Boston, for which I'm really excited!
Week 7: July 8-12
Monday:
Today, we continued working on the user interface - we worked on data binding to have multiple panels after one panel is updated. We looked at past code to come up with something that could work, and in the meanwhile, the rest of our team worked on the shutters for our design to enable users to see multiple views at once. From a research perspective, this is what we're interested in: how does viewing multiple panels better users' understanding of data? We'll keep developing our product, as we need to have a functional prototype by Wednesday to present to the BU team.
What our interface looks like!

Today, we were able to get the data binding to work! We learned our lesson: hard coding can be a bad idea, as it creates issues that we can't detect! We databound the objects that we were dropping into the tree panel so that there was a"

Then we transferred the cellophane layers with the regenerated moss onto Knop medium agar plates containing 25 µg/ml G418 antibiotic for two weeks. The official protocol schedules a two week release period followed by another selection period to ensure stabile transormation, but we didn´t have that much time and went with a single round of selection. We plated only half of our transformed protoplasts. The other half was left in the 6-well-plates where 2 ml of selection medium were added to the 2 ml of regeneration medium from the transormation, with G418 diluted 1:8000.
Homogenization
The moss in liquid culture in Erlenmeyer flasks has to be homogenized weekly to disintegrate the protonema filaments. The process is carried out on a laminar flow bench to prevent contamination. Before homogenization, we let the moss settle and decanted the supernatant medium. We used an Ultra Turrax at 19.000 rpm. The duration depends on the density of the culture. The homgenized moss is distributed into several previously autoclaved flasks to achieve a lower density. Fresh medium is added to the new flasks and autoclaved air-filters are integrated into their lids.

Background
Foot odor and tinea pedis (athlete's foot) are such common foot diseases. Foot odor can always cause embarrassing trouble in public areas. And tinea pedis (athlete's foot) makes patient’s foot itching, scaling, and redness. A lot of people in Sichuan Province of China suffer from this, which is consistent with our human practice survey result.
Two problems are hard to treat because the diseases are caused by microorganisms. Foot odor is due to the metabolism result of microbiome on foot surface, acetic acid and isovaleric acid contribute most. Tinea pedis is a fungus infection disease, most commonly caused by Trichophyton rubrum, a fungi species originated from Southeast Asia (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1091684-overview). However, even though ointment has been developed to inhibit the growth of microorganisms living on our feet, the continuous inhibition ability is not good as expected. The shoes always provide perfect warm and mild environment for microorganisms to hide and revive at proper time on skin.
So SCU-China 2016 design an innovative insole “Comfootable” to deal with it. Two engineered strains E. coli, strain ”Rihanna” and strain “Drake” are living in the insole, to help us to achieve our goal: to inhibit the growth of microorganisms and remove the odor.
Engeneered E.coli Strain

You can stand on my umbrella to ANTI microorganisms.
Antimicrobial peptide CecropinXJ is synthesizing in “Rih……...anna” anytime. When your foot is on the insole, the temperature of your foot induces the temperature sensitive promoter to drive the expression of self-kill gene hokD to lyse the “Rihanna” to release CecropinXJ.

Future Work
Ideally, our project would have been a successful proof of concept for light-based cell-to-cell signaling.  Unfortunately, we were unable to create a sender cell which produced light with a great enough intensity to activate the receiver cell.  Optimization of the light output is necessary for our system to prove useful.  The Lux Biobrick was created by the Cambridge team for the 2010 iGEM Competition and emits light with the correct wavelength to activate our receiver cell.  The light output from Lux-transformed bacteria might create the necessary intensity of light output for the sender cell.  If successful, the Lux-based bacterial sender cell coupled with our mammalian receiver cell would be an example of inter-kingdom signaling.  Inter-kingdom signaling would increase the possibilities of sender and receiver cells and create a better chance of creating a robust system.  A light based inter-kingdom signaling system would enable researchers to reproduce the complex mechanism of inter-kingdom signaling that is responsible for infectious disease transmission and also important in ecology, plant biology, and food safety.  Furthermore, researchers could create systems in which cells from different kingdoms that were never before able to communicate would be capable of signaling to each other and novel multi-cellular systems could be developed to solve medical and environmental problems.  Due to time constraints, we were not able to go this direction.
Applications
Light-based cell-to-cell signaling has enormous applications in a wide span of research.  Small molecule signaling fails when barriers in the body such as the gastrointestinal tract or the blood brain barrier are involved.  A signaling system based on luminescence would be able to achieve signaling across barriers.  The orthogonality of our light-based cell signaling system is crucial.  The receiver cells would be specifically engineered to respond to blue light from the sender cell, making the system highly selective.  Many cells have similar surface or membrane proteins that often result in off-target effects in other signaling mechanisms.  Another advantage with our system is that light propagation is almost instantaneous, inevitably making the signaling faster than a small molecule signaling mechanism,"

Collaborations
Collaboration between teams has been an important part of our project. Indeed, the data sharing and the joint work are not only necessary in this competition but more generally in the scientific field.  So, we were lucky to collaborate with different teams around the world. We have discussed about our projects and about collaborative work on common themes. The exchanges and discussions were mostly done during meetings, through e-mail and skype session.
Collaboration with Evry-Paris Saclay Team
We invited Evry-Paris Saclay iGEM team to join us to share with the pupils their knowledge, their lab skills and their vision of iGEM experience. Thus, we collaborated with two members of their team. Rose attended the practical class with us (1st session). She was very patient with the pupils and helped us in the long process preparation of the material and solutions on the day of the class. Yanis was here for the 2nd session (Interpretation of results, introduction to synthetic biology, Presentation of iGEM competition and our projects, overview of biology at university). He has an actual pedagogical talent and the pupils immediately appreciated him. This was a great illustration for the kids that scientific research is based on collaboration and team work.  We also collaborated on another side of the Human Practices: law. We met Evry team’s jurist, Maxime de la Fouchardière and we had the opportunity to ask our question and learn a lot about intellectual property and legal issues. He gave us an extensive view on the legal process regarding the authorization of use for human drugs and cattle oriented therapeutics. finally he gaved us insight on the legal issues regarding the use of GMO in Europe and the potential consquences of the widespread of one of these organism in the wild.  Thank you very much Evry-Paris Saclay, we really had a smashing time working with you.

The reaction was stopped by vigorous mixing and centrifugation (5 min) to separate phases. The upper phase (solvent phase) was taken and put into a pasteur pipette which contained glass wool with Na2SO4 (to dry the solvent phase). Since the amount of pentane seemed to be insufficient (no solvent reached the GC glass container), the next two extractions were done with 1 ml of pentane each. Afterwards the combined extracts were reduced to approximately 300 µl under a stream of nitrogen.
3 replicates of negative control (reaction batch without enzyme) and enzymatic reaction batch were done.
The pentane extracts were analyzed with gas chromatography- mass spectrometry to identify the enzymatically formed products. An aliquot of each sample (0.5 µl) was injected into ""5890 Series II GC"" coupled to a ""Finnigan Mat 55 S MS"".
Preparation of yeast cultures for large scale expression (1l) 1
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the preparation of three 30ml yeast cultures (in selective SC-U 2% glucose medium), based on yeast clones transformed with pTUM104 vectors, each containing one of the three genes CaXMT1, CaMXMT1 and CaDXMT1 for having enough crude extract for further analysis.
Operational sequence:
If possible, a single colony which had grown on selective SC-U 2%glucose agar plates was used for inoculation of the 30ml liquid medium. If the density of the colonies was to high, a small amount (pipett dip) was taken.  The generated cell suspensions were incubated at 30°C over night.

Outlook
Our strategy to infect and kill bacteria with bacteriophages by conjugation, keeping the killer strain immune to such infection, in our opinion worked very well.  We could show that our modified λ phage can be passed from the killer strain onto a recipient strain by conjugation. Using a λ phage which undergoes solely the lytic phase (since it lacks the cI) we showed that the killer strain is immune to infection thanks to the high levels of the cI protein, expressed from our construct BBa_K150004. Furthermore, we could show that the oriT we used can transport the plasmid on which is found in a very fast and efficient way, even between different strains. If the λ phage we genetically modified were able to lyse cells, we would have successfully completed our project!
The conjugation system may allow a broader application of our system in terms of species, since the RP-plasmids are broad host range plasmids and can therefore transfer genetic information to a variety of gram negative and gram positive bacteria. There is also evidence for conjugative transfer between bacteria and yeast cells [17] . If one could use this system to transfer genetic information into eukaryotic cells, this could be an application to cure plant diseases or even human diseases by injecting for example antisense RNA to silence viral replication or oncogenes.

Once we developed the device, we took it to a farm to see if it was, indeed, simple to use. We visited Paul Oosthoek, who confirmed that the steps in the protocol can be followed easily. He also affirmed that the test can be implemented within current regulations on his farm. Furthermore, he said that our do it yourself toolbox has potential as farmers are willing to invest time in detecting resistance"

In analogy to electronic circuit, the construction of a programmable cell can be divided into input, engineered gene network, output three modules. The components of each module can be reassembled for the diversify clinical treatments.
Based on this idea, our team designed a gene circuit model and apply it into a certain gene circuit. When putting the circuit into bacteria, the bacterium soldiers formed. Our gene circuit contains four parts：sensor, responder, switch, and lysis. The components of the circuit can be disassembled and assembled.
During our brain storm, the gene circuit ""Plug and Play"" designed by Kobayashi et al. helped us to find the design strategy for constructing the programmable bacteria. The gene circuits of detecting and killing MRSA from iGEM Team TU-Delft 2013 and LMU 2014 also gave us revelation. Also, we used the M13 phage delivery system designed by iGEM Team Paris Bettencourt 2013 as our responder. Finally, we created a gene circuit which can combat with the multidrug-resistant bacteria.
Figure 1. The modular structure of a simple programmable cell.
Figure 2. The four component parts of the programmable cell.
In this model, we aimed to construct a programmable cell which can sense particularly biological signals, and later lyse itself for releasing the responder and controlling its population level.
The sensor part can sense the signaling molecules. The responder represents the gene which can kill the drug-resistant pathogens itself or combined with antibiotics. The toggle switch is used to control the expression of the lysis gene. When the switch is in the ""ON"" state, the expression of the lysis is repressed. When the switch is in the ""OFF"" state, the repression of the lysis will be counteracted.
According to our circuit, we choose the LuxI/LuxR system as our sensor part. The toggle switch contains lac"

Polycistronic expression plasmid of Mdh, Hps, Phi and Xpk controlled by Anderson Promoter 19 (J23119), Ribosome binding site B0034 and Terminator B0015
K1585350
This plasmid is targeting glgX in the E. coli genome by expressing a single guide RNA (sgRNA) for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. It contains a repair template that disrupts the beginning of the glgX coding sequence and introduces a sequence with multiple stop codons.
Usage and Biology
The construct is part of a two-plasmid knockout system published by Jiang et al . This part, the pTargetT, contains the sgRNA to target the glgX coding sequence. Additionally, the construct consists of a repair template with two 400 bp homology arms for homology-directed repair. To succesfully knock out the glgX, you need a second plasmid, pCas. It contains the pCas gene as well as a temperature-sensitive repA101ts ori. To increase recombination efficiency in E. coli, it also expresses lambda-Red genes behind an inducible arabinose-promoter.  Upon induction with IPTG, a sgRNA is transcribed to cut the pMB1 ori of the pTargetT.
After cloning both the targeting plasmid and the pCas plasmid in BL21 Gold (DE3) and inducing with arabinose, the Cas9 gene is expressed. Guided by the sgRNA, it cleaves the double strand at the beginning of the glgX gene. The succesful genome editing could be verified by sequencing.
Genomic region and sequencing chromatograms of BL21 Gold (DE3) ΔglgX
The sequencing results show that the ""IGEM AACHEN MULTISTOP"" sequence disrupts the gene. This insert contains a stop codon in each possible frame. The picture demonstrates the functionality of BBa_K1585350.

The European Experience
During this year's edition of iGEM, the team Évry has had the opportunity to co-organize a big European meet-up, with iGEM IONIS, and to attend to a regional Ile-de-France meet-up celebrated in Paris, organized by iGEM Pasteur and iGEM Paris Saclay.
The European Experience
On the 2nd and 3rd of July, our iGEM team coorganized the European Experience with iGEM IONIS team. This event allowed to gather more than 150 iGEMers with about 30 teams coming from 11 different countries in all Europe. All the teams were able to present their projecs, as well as share ideas and explore new possibilities for collaborations. We have dedicated a webpage to it here .
Ile de France meet-up
The 6th of August, we attended the Ile de France Meet-up. This fantastic meeting was performed at the Pasteur Institute and organized by iGEM Pasteur and iGEM Paris Saclay. Several Teams including ours presented their project in front of general public and judges, who gave feedback on it. Demonstration of a Drone was performed and garden picnic allowed to tighten the link between iGEMers in the Parisian area.

OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," we conducted qPCR towards corresponding protein in or-der for a further validation of MINI system’s strong expression on a post-transcriptional level.
We also expend the application range of this system by contact with other teams and test it in different yeast strains and experimental environment, which can also be an important part of our collaboration. the MINI system has a high performance ratio in driving gene expression. The obvious advantage of the MINI system is to provide a simple model for studying promoter mutations and promoter modifications.
Circuit construction
We synthesized minip, minit, cyc1p, cyc1t and built four circuit with Gibson assembly by arranging them in different orders. The plasmids were then imported into yeast EBY100.
Fig 3.1 The plasmid map of our circuit.
Fig 3.2
Function verify
We characterize the strength of the MINI system by detecting the fluorescence intensity of the yeCitrine. We measured the growth curves of four strains containing different expression systems, and measured the intensity of excitation and emission of yeCitrine, respectively 502nm and 532nm.
For convenience, we named the “Pmini-yECitrine-Tcyc1-mStrawberry-Tcyc1” as “mc”, “Pmini-yECitrine-Tmini-mStrawberry-Tcyc1” as “mm”, “Pcyc1-yECitrine-Tcyc1-mStrawberry-Tcyc1” as “cc” and “Pcyc1-yECitrine-Tmini-mStrawberry-Tcyc1” as “cm” hereafter.
Fig 3.3 The strength of the MINI system.
The fluorescence intensity is: mm> cm> mc> cc, in which mm circuit has the highest expression, proving our successful construction of MINI system. To draw a conclusion, the system has a strong expression, but a very short nucleotide sequence. In this ex-ample, the combination of weak promoter + strong terminator is better than that of strong promoter + weak terminator.
With the help of the other two teams, we completed the repeated testing of the MINI system. The time of the test data is the late logarithmic phase of yeast growth. The yeast strains we used with NJU-China were Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY 100. The yeast strain used in TJU China was Synthetic yeast synX.

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Efflux pumps have been reported for every group of antibiotic, causing a significant challenge in combating bacterial infection.[1]
Bacteria may also enzymatically inactivate an antibiotic, rendering it harmless. Gram-negative bacteria commonly have β-lactamases in the periplasm which hydrolyze the antibiotic to cleave C-N bond in the ring structure. Sensitivity to β-lactams antibiotics has been partially regained by combining the β-lactam antibiotic with a β-lactamase inhibitor such as clavulanic acid or sulbactam. Unfortunately some bacteria have already become resistant to this method as well. An additional technique bacteria use to combat antibiotics is to modify them with the addition of a chemical group. Phosphorylation, adenylation, and acetylation of a hydroxyl or amino group may be sufficient to interfere with the activity of the antibiotic. This is the primary form of aminoglycoside resistance which would otherwise act to prevent protein synthesis. Similarly acetylation of chloramphenicol and streptogramin render these antibiotics ineffective. Tetracyclines can also be inactivated by an oxidation reaction.[1]
Another strategy to resist antibiotics is the altering or defending the target of the antibiotic usually by mutations that change the antibiotic’s target or by chemically altering the target with the addition of chemical groups. β-lactams are also sensitive to this form of resistance when mutations cause the binding specificity of the penicillin binding proteins to change. Even resistance to vancomycin which targets the D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptides at the ends of the muropeptides of peptidoglycan has emerged. The resistance takes the form of changing the D-Ala-D-Ala substrate to D-Ala-D-lactate which still allows the essential crosslinking of the peptidoglycan while remaining unaffected by the antibiotic. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) has three different enzyme mutations to accomplish this. The first enzyme is a lactate dehydrogenase to synthesize D-lactate from pyruvate. The second synthesizes D-Ala-D-lactate from the components D-Ala and D-lactate. The third selectively cleaves D-Ala-D-Ala leaving only the D-Ala-D-lactate which is not susceptible to antibiotic action. Macrolides, streptogramins, and lincosamides can be inhibited by methylation of the A2058 adenine in the 23S rRNA. This modification prevents the antibiotic from"

rSuicide (Glucose repressive system) : Pcar-PhlF-T-Pr-GFP-Lysis-NucA/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230017]
 
Experiment & Result
Glucose responsive suppressor system
In the assay for repressor system, the data in Fig. 2 gave the similar results as team Glasgow did in 2015, in which the strong activity of the repressible promoter was significantly repressed in the presence of PhlF repressor.
Furthermore, we modified the expression of PhlF under the glucose responsive promoter (Pcar-PhlF-T-Pr-GFP/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230012]). And the E. coli carrying this plasmid cultured in LB broth overnight was transferred to  M9 minimal media with decreasing concentrations of glucose. The result in Fig 3 clearly indicated that the GFP activity driven by the repressible promoter was gradually increased in response to the loss of glucose to 1.88 folds compared to the initial GFP activity at the beginning culture in M9 media, suggesting that the level of expression of PhlF was positively corresponding to the concentration of glucose.
Glucose responsive suppressor suicide circuit
As you can see in Fig 2., the OD value in response to the decreasing concentration of glucose was gradually reduced to 1.89 much less than average 2.71 in control group without suicide gene expression, implying that the suicide proteins killed the cells in the loss of glucose in the environment. Moreover, when the bacteria were grown in M9 media with 0.5mM glucose for 4 hours, the survival rate was decreased to 34% compared to 56% of bacteria without suicide genes (Fig. 3). And the cell numbers were reduced to 671 compared to 1120 of bacteria without suicide genes. Both data confirmed that this suicide device works well and indicated that killing process began when glucose in the media was running out.
Discussion
The device of glucose responsive repressor system works in our study very well in response to increasing concentrations of glucose which controls the level of expression of PhlF repressors through glucose responsive promoter.
The suicide circuit connected the combination of repressor system and glucose responsive promoter were successfully demonstrated in response to the presence of glucose in the environment. We not only confirmed the data of iGEM previous work but also improve the existing parts by extending the function and application of biobricks.

Vanderbilt,2014,Team:Vanderbilt#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," wrote up the protocol, and had preformed it prior to any group-phase work for the purposes of troubleshooting and predicting where issues may come up. The president or wetware director also assisted the group manager by being present during all experiments for answering questions, preparing materials, and troubleshooting.
Each group first planted seeds under the appropriate soil, humidity, and temperature conditions at the Vanderbilt Greenhouse. Once the majority of these grew into saplings with green leaves, samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in preparation for a genomic DNA extraction. After the extractions, nanodrop concentration readings and agarose gels confirmed the presence of high molecular weight genomic DNA. Groups then ran a PCR on their genomic DNA with primers specific to their synthase gene. More gels were run to check for the presence of PCR product. At this point, the semester was coming to an end, so groups were disbanded before most managed to isolate their synthase gene. Over the summer, the president and wetware director continued troubleshooting those genes which were not amplifying and eventually got each to the point where consistent PCR product bands were produced.
Once we had clear banding patterns, it became clear that the number of introns in each of our genes (a variable which was unknown since most of the plants we worked with have not had their genomes sequenced) was too great for cloning and expression to be practical. Therefore, as soon as the fall semester began, we shifted strategy to isolating RNA from our plants. This RNA could be converted to cDNA by reverse transcription, which would eliminate the issue with introns we were having. Several of our greenhouse plants were no longer available, so we reduced the number of target terpenes we were focusing on. After extracting RNA and running an RT-PCR, several samples produced bands that corresponded roughly to where the synthase gene should be. These were gel extracted. Because almost every synthase gene had restriction sites in them that prevented them from being RFC10 compatible, we ligated the genes in pUC19 for site directed mutagenesis. After that, a second processing step would have been necessary to add the correct restriction sites to each gene to allow them to be integrated into pSB1C3 as a biobrick. To ensure the part submission deadline would be met, we synthesized a codon-optimized santalene synthase gene in order to skip these RFC10 processing steps, even though we had already successfully reverse transcribed cDNA of the santalene synthase gene.
In the spring concurrent to work by the terpene groups, work began on plasmid construction. This"

Guiding HS students towards future participation
After our lectures, we decided to guide students from The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University to participate in the coming iGEM HS in 2013. On August 28th, our several team members once again went to The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University and had a talk with Ms Shen Jinghong, the Associate Principal of the school, and two other teachers who are interested in iGEM. We also took lots of photos recording the scene of discussion.

According to our great job in propagating the concept of iGEM HS division one and a half month before, their students are motivated to take part in the iGEM competition, fulfilling their utmost potential. We discussed in details about the total number of students participated, the schedule, and what we are able to do in supporting them. They were thankful for our efforts and began to consider subsequent issues.

In the process, they have made a great progress in learning primary knowledge and frontiers of Synthetic Biology, as well as in the elementary experiment manipulation. We have also taken lots of photos recording their study process.

Going back to human pathogenity. In the beginning we were saying, not a lot of people know [about] chlamydia. It is not a well known STD. Do you think awareness in germany should be higher?
Prof. Sachse:
Yeah, definitely. There is still room for improvement, the awareness could be higher. There have been efforts to raise awareness in the last few years and I think to a certain degree these efforts have succeeded, but compared to other countries and in the first place I would like to mention Scandinavia, the awareness in Germany is not high enough.
Daniel C.:
[What is] your opinion about our project?
Prof. Sachse:
Having understood some of the details and the principle of your approach i would like to encourage you to follow your project because it is a new approach and of course risk is involved. [...] It's a promising approach. To me the central advantage is that your principle involves a great advantage of using directly the sample material. This is a great advantage of course in field setting, where you don't have laboratory infrastructure. But if this works it can be used in real diagnostic laboratories because it has a potential to be more economical and more rapid. The time consumption of your essay is extremely low and this is a very promising approach.
Kai:
We talked about species specificity. [...] Could you talk about what impact our diagnostic [method] would have?
Prof. Sachse:
Well, any rapid test will have an impact and will be welcomed, will be used by potential users, be it in established diagnostic laboratories or be it in the field. So if you manage to produce a test that is rapid and is sensitive enough with a limitation in specificity, which has to be declared, so people will know how to use your test and will also know the limitation, which as you said is not so important in certain settings and will be important for other applications but you have to declare this openly. Your main assets will be the simplicity, rapidity and sensitivity.
Daniel C.:
What has a higher prevalence? Chlamydial infections in animals or in humans?
Prof. Sachse:
Perhaps there are more animals infected but there is not a demand for the diagnosis to be done. [For a human diagnostic] test there will be money [...] but the animal owners or the production units of animals are under economic pressure and they will only do diagnosis when it is absolutely necessary. When it's vital for them. This was our problem too when I was head of the national reference laboratory. Advocating the importance of the infection is one thing but once the owners of the"

The fluorescence-measurement chamber could finally distinguish between active and inactive bacteria and we worked on comparing the data received from the reactor setup to measurements with a spectrophotometer.  An important step for collaborations was the skype conference with the iGEM team of Chennai, India, where we talked about M9 media and its implications for bacteria cultivation when using the alkaline-induced alx-promoter.

After many oePCRs to make Gibson-cloning more efficient, we unboxed our HiFi-Assembly Kit sponsored by NEB to perform said Gibson-cloning. Special thanks to NEB for providing great chemically competent E.coli DH5α cells. Not having to make competent cells ourselves saved a lot of time. E.coli DH5α grew really well on our LB-agar plates. To make sure that only E.coli cells with our plasmid can survive on the agar-plates, we added chloramphenicol. And actually we got many clones, which needed to be tested. This very “enjoyable” pipetting work was shifted to the following week.  In the meantime, we tried our first demonstration of the robot in the arena using the temperature-sensitive bacteria we had received.

This week was extremely intriguing, we examined our transformation-plates from Gibson-cloning for positive clones. For this purpose, a colonyPCR was carried out. This sounds like lots of pipetting work and it definitely is. Our main actor in this PCR-reaction is the DreamTaq-polymerase, but also many other ingredients need to be added for a successful PCR, like dNTPs, primers, the templates to test, and, of course, the polymerase-buffer to ensure that the polymerase feels comfortable during amplifying the DNA. And behold---we got positive clones in the form of bands in the right size on agarose gel! These positive clones were cultivated over night and the plasmid DNA was isolated by Miniprep. Finally, the"

Introduction
  
    In 2003, the first attempt to make a synthetic biology a discipline that everyone can share about it was made. After the appearance of the first BioBrick(tm), the concept about standardization had been widely accepted. And it is a trend in synthetic biology now.
    Thanks to the standardization, biologists have developed many useful tools with the help of the standardized parts, the BioBricks. These BioBricks really contribute a lot to the research field. And they make it easier for researchers to communicate with each other under the same technical standards. Due to the convenience of BioBricks, thousands of BioBricks have been created and introduced during these years. Thus the database containing these BioBricks is getting larger and larger.
    But here comes the problem. Since every one can share their BioBricks, sometimes the information of the BioBricks are incomplet when they submit. So it becomes hard for users to search for a BioBrick that they want. Although there is an RFC, RFC 52 already, but we are not satisfied. Because the description of it is too general, the database of the BioBricks is still a mess. So we want to create a new RFC to replace RFC 52.
    We want to establish an RFC to describe the minimum information for a qualified BioBrick. We listed the minimum information a BioBrick should have, and gave a short description for each of them. Especially, we want to qualify the classification of BioBricks. All the BioBricks should be organized, so that users can search for it easily.

Real world conditions to us is defined as the human body. How will our biobricks interact under real conditions? Will our biobrick survive in the human body? Will they interact or affect other processes in the body? How can we then ensure that the result of this exploration can feed back onto the design of our devices to make them safer and"

There is also                         a heavy chain antibody naturally deleted light chain, only two heavy chains, each heavy chain                         has three domains, including a variable domain, so this antibody (natural) has a heavy chain                         variable region Fragments (Fig. 1B), and found that such antibodies are abundant in some                         camelids, such as llamas, glamas, alpacas, llamas, and the like. Comparing hcIgG and Ig-NAR, it                         is not difficult to find that both antibodies use the variable region domain of the heavy chain                         N-terminus to specifically bind antigen, and the crystal structure of this part presents a flat                         shape resembling a football (Fig.2), approximately 2.5 nm in diameter and 4.2 nm in height.                         Antibodies of this size at the nanometer level are called Nanobodies (Nanobody, Nb), and now                         Nanobodies are commonly referred to as immunoglobulins of this hcIgG heavy chain variable region                         domain in camelids.[1]

Fig.2 The crystal structure of nanobody
In vivo catalysis
Because nanobodies can be expressed in prokaryotic expression and have strong stability, we used                         nanobodies instead of traditional antibodies for experiments. However, since the anisotropy of                         the nano-antibody molecules is not obvious, the ability to cause changes in the arrangement of                         liquid crystal molecules is limited. Therefore, we need to perform long-chain modification on                         Nanobodies to increase their ability to respond to liquid crystals.
Fig.3 Nanobody recognition beta 2 microglobulin
Here we use a two-plasmid system: insert the Formylglycine-Generating Enzyme(FGE) gene into one                         plasmid; insert the Nanobody gene and the aldehyde-based precursor tag into the other                         plasmid.
Fig.4 FGE specifically recognizes amino acid sequences and catalyzes                                     the process of specific sites
At the same time, FGE can specifically recognize this tag, which in turn catalyzes the oxidation                         of cysteine to the aldehyde group. Thus co-expression of these two plasmids"

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Law&Patents_-_-_TEXT.html," the instructors, who are scientists themselves, to realize the impact of the specific projects on society. They are not trained specialists in the other aspects, therefore it is hard for them to take a step back and think about the impact on society. It’s also a challenge as research funding is highly competitive. The scientists have to focus on high quality research and publish their results in high impact journals. Moreover there are also no economic incentives or rewards for taking up their societal responsibility.
The big question that arises is “How could ethical, societal, legal aspects be integrated formally into the system and day-to-day scientific activities?” There was consensus in our meeting that it must be stimulated by the leading professors and prominent scientists of the universities who must also realize that it is in their own interest to have a good connection with the society and must act as role models encouraging other research groups. However, since professors search for people who are really good at fundamental research, its not easy for them to realize upfront the economic benefits they could have from such an interdisciplinary approach. Though not impossible, this is very difficult as it would a fundamental change to the system of universities and research labs, it is in a sense dependent on the goodwill of role models and their proactive initiatives.
It was interesting to learn that in Europe: the Netherlands, UK and some Scandinavian countries are really taking a lead on this. For example in the ‘Center for Society and Genomics’ scientists and social scientists work together. There are projects where researchers team up with an ethicist, who questions the actions and possible outcome of the research. It’s instrumental that research group leaders take the lead in making this happen.
If a group leader, in contrast, states that a researcher cannot spend any minute on these non-essential activities, then obviously this is not going to work. Therefore it’s important that the educated societies and the professional representatives of a community take the lead in making this happen on an individual basis.
It is very interesting to look at the biomedical field in which the scientific society takes a lead. Another counter-intuitive way is that publishers ask for a certain declaration. For example biomedical publishers always ask for a statement ‘if the research has been conducted in line with certain ethics criteria’ so that patients are being properly informed about the consequences.
In the case of synthetic biology it’s a bit abstract and difficult, but one could think of indirect ways in which the mentality can be changed. It’s necessary that scientists can see that it is in their own interest to adhere to these issues. For example, it would be good to make it impossible to publish in high-impact journals without adequate proof that they considered certain"

Two teams conducted a debate on whether changes in epigenetic modification                 can determine tumorigenesis at the China Pharmaceutical University Conference Center:
Positive side: CPU _CHINA
Attitude: changes in epigenetic modifications can determine tumorigenesis
Negative side: NJU-CHINA
Attitude: changes in epigenetic modifications can not determine tumorigenesis
The two sides hold different arguments, and even cited frontier knowledge of self-argument and deduction                 to express their views. Also, two teams were a lot of gains during the debate, as well as developed a further                 exchange on the issue of respective topics.

Proof  of  Concept
In order to verify the whole regulation pathway step by step, we divided it into several parts, including the following concepts:
Intracellular glutamate can inhibit the gltC expression;
GltC can activate the promoter PgltAB;
LacI can inhibit the promoter Pgrac;
High glutamate concentration can improve tetA expression.
At last we successively verified the first and the fourth concepts, based on which we achieved the final goal–– control population quality through non-genetic cell-to-cell variation.
According to previous research, B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 is a glutamic acid- independent poly-γ-glutamate (γ-PGA)-producing strain which was isolated from traditional fermented food. Its gltAB gene encodes the glutamate synthase. The increasing intracellular glutamate concentration has a negative effect on the expression of gltAB via modulating GltC activity.
As a result, the transcription of gltC should be inhibited while intercellular glutamate concentration increasing. We verified this concept by transformed our PopQC system pHT01-mCherry-LacI-PgltAB-Pgrac-TetA-GFPint into B. amyloliquefaciens LL3. Then we measured its intracellular glutamate concentration and transcriptional level of gltC under different concentration of glutamate in fermentation medium. The results proved our assumption to be correct.

The intracellular glutamate concentration of LL3 with PgltAB-GFP in plateau stage. *Significantly different (P < 0.05) by Student's t-test. b. The relative expression level of gltC in plateau stage.

Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data.

As we further investigated the ways to obtain bioethanol, we came across the concept of energy generations.
Energy Production Approaches
There are three energy generations that are currently in use: first, second, and third. These generations can be thought of as three different approaches to obtain energy, more specifically bioenergy.
The first generation energy evokes concerns in terms of the debate “food vs fuel”; since it is obtained from food crops such as corn, sugarcane, sugar beet and etc. (Aro, 2016).
On the other hand, the second-generation production uses non-edible lignocellulosic biomass, such as rice husks, wheat straws and so on, creating no such controversy as the first generation. In addition, production with second-generation energy requires less cultivation, fertilizers, and pesticides when compared to the first generation (Aro, 2016; EIA, 2017d).
Third generation biofuels are from algae cultures. Algae biofuels are common, provide a good alternative to fossil fuels and thought of as long-term energy sources (Hannon et al., 2014). However, this technology has many challenges; such as the need for strain identification and improvement, before it can compete in the fuel market (Hannon et al., 2014).
Microalgae, on the other hand, are photosynthetic organisms that also create contrast in this market (Brennan et al., 2010). Although they can provide an enormous amount of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates in a short period of time, they are fragile and have numerous needs; from the percentage of the nutrients in their environment to the amount of sunlight they receive (Brennan et al., 2010). Moreover, another disadvantage is that algae, in newly introduced environments, are observed to act invasively; altering ecosystems, reducing biodiversity and causing overall economic losses (Demirbas, 2010).
In the light of our studies, we decided to improve second-generation bioethanol production where it can confidently compete with petroleum and other fossil fuels.
What are the Problems with Second Generation Bioethanol Production?

Question:Was the pHT254 vector linearized?
Experiment: Vector pHT254 was digested with the restriction enzymes XbaI and XmaI to linearize it before the Gibson Assembly. The process for this can be seen in the protocol section.
Results:To make the Gibson Assembly functional, the vector needs to be linearized. This is done by making a restriction digestion of the vector by using XbaI and XmaI (Fig. 22).
Figure 22: Digestion analysis of pHT254 cut with the restriction enzymes XmaI and XbaI.
The digestion analysis shows we got a band between 7.5 kb and 8.0 kb that correspond to our vector. This band can both be seen when the vector was cut with one of or both of the restriction enzymes (Fig. 22). This means that the vector is being cut. No smaller fragment is being seen as such, which is expected because  the fragment that is cut out when both restriction enzymes are used are so small it cannot be visualized on the agarose gel.  As it can be seen on Figure 22, a fragment around 1.0 kb is seen (at the very bottom of Fig. 22). This is a unidentified fragment, but it might be some uncut vector. When the vector is not cut it can be coiled so it mimics a smaller size when it is loaded on a gel. However, we hypothesize that the fragment that seen around 3.5 kb is the uncut fragment, because it has disappeared in the samples that have been cut with the restriction enzymes. Taken together, these data shows that it was possible to digest the vector with the two restriction enzymes, thereby making it ready for Gibson Assembly.

Question:Did Gibson Assembly work?
Experiment:After all the genes were amplified so they all had homologous sites, as described in Biosynthetic Make-up (https://2016.igem.org/Team:UNIK_Copenhagen/Biosyntetic_Make_Up), Gibson Assembly was carried out according to the manufactures protocol. Each of the constructs (LPE, GFP, PCT-YFP, PhaA-CFP and PhaB-RFP-Terminator) were added in an Eppendorf tube, each with an amount of maximum 1pmol, and 2X Gibson MasterMix was added to the Eppendorf tube and the samples were incubated at 50 degrees for two hours. Then the samples"
