His-EGII = 0.66 mg/mL
We decided to assume the amount of units in our purified elution fraction will be comparable to the purchased enzyme, and therefore diluted the purchased enzyme tenfold to approximate the His-EGII concentration. We tested undiluted His-EGII, 1:1000 and 1:10.000 dilutions. The samples were measured after 1 hour and overnight incubation, and both gave the following result:
Row A to D contain R, BR, C and PC, respectively. Lanes 1 to 6 contain EG 1:10, His-EGII, His-EGII 1:1000, His-EGII 1:10.000, cellulase blend, negative control, respectively.
We see that the positive control worked on all substrates. The purchased EG enzyme however did not show much activity. Our undiluted EGII showed activity on all substrates except for unprocessed ReCell

On the other hand, a high portion of cells do have the construct integrated into their genome.

Figure 10: Fluorescence microscopy images of HEK293 cells during the process of stable integration and subsequent selection. Red fluorescence stems from the C-terminal mRuby3 of the receptor construct.
For the traceablitiy of receptor expression, we supplied all of our receptor constructs with means for detection via fluorescence (mRuby, epitope tags) and/or luciferase assays. mRuby is hereby located on the C-terminus at the cytosolic end of our transmembrane receptors. Cells that express and fold the protein properly should thus give a signal of 605 nm (red) when exited at around 558 nm. [21] We tested our contructs three diffrent cell types: HEK293T adherent cells that were stably transfected, HEK293E suspension cells that were semi-stably transfected and N2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, that we transiently transfected.
As you can see on the images the signal developed over time. In the beginning, before selection, the protein was visible in little dots and therefore seemed to be localized more in subcellular organelles than in the membrane.  During selection via hygromycin B, most of the cells died, leaving some resistant cells behind which over time grew to bigger foci consisting of stably transfected cells only (see Figure 10). For the BAP-receptor, hardly any fluorescence was detectable - neither in the semi-stable nor in the stable transfection approach. in the latter case, cells still proliferated in the presence of hygromycin B and formed foci, which would confirm successful chromosomal intergration (as already shown via PCR), hinting at some problem on the level of transcription, translation or protein maturation.
After two weeks of selection on hygromycin B, the foci were harvested and expanded. The cells seemed to recover quickly, and moreover the red dots nearly disappeared leaving only the membrane of the scA"

We had a long conversation about the whole iGEM competition, and we shared many stories about our team, which was an amusing meet-up.
The 6th iGEM Asia-Parcific Conference
In summer, we attended The 6th iGEM Asia-Parcific Conference hosted by NCHU Taichung. The conference included official presentations along with Q&A and a poster session, which not only serves as a drill for the coming jamboree, but also inspires us with new ideas and valuable advice we can make good use of.Taking an active part in the conference, we shared our ideas and studies in synthetic biology and made a great deal new friends with different backgrounds. We sincerely acknowledge NCHU Taichung for their warm services and we gained a lot through the conference."
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html," All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
To the end of assessing the protective effect of the TDPs, all four proteins were tested as buffer excipients (in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 g/L) for the enzyme Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) in an enzymatic activity assay based on that described by ( Boothby et al. 2017 ).
Figure 28: LDH activity after drying and subsequent rehydration for the different TDPs.
As depicted in Figure 28, the LDH activity is least preserved at the lowest TDP concentration for all TDPs and a maximum of activity preserved for the highest concentrations we assessed, with the exception of CAHS 94205, though the error bars should be considered. This indicates that the higher the protein concentration in the solution, the better the activity is preserved; and thus, the better the protection of the enzyme. Such a trend was also observed in our model and by Boothby et. al. 2017 , hence substantiating the validity of our results.
Furthermore, the preserved enzymatic activity at the highest concentration studied (1 mg/mL), did not differ significantly among the four proteins. It is however notable that, unlike the rest of the proteins, CAHS 106094 did not show a significant preservation of activity at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL and yielded a much lower preservation at a concentration of 0.5 g/L in comparison to the other TDPs.
In view of the previous results, we adapted the LDH assay previously carried out to test the protective capability of CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 for 18 days and thus evaluate their use for long-term storage at room temperature. Samples similar to those of the previous procedure were prepared and stored dried at room temperature for different amounts of time before their resuspension and measurement.
Figure 29: LDH activity after freeze-drying and drying with TDPs. LDH activity after freeze-drying (FD)/ drying with different concentrations for CAHS 94205 (a) and SAHS 33020 (b) and rehydrating as a function of time. Experiments were performed at room temperature.
As shown in Figure 29, LDH maintains its activity when stored dried with the cytosolic and secretory TDPs, while its activity was not preserved when freeze-dried or dried in the absence of TDPs. Furthermore, it can be seen in Figure 29 that for TDP concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL only SAHS 33020 could maintain"

Greatest Accomplishment: Move continents three times and remain sane.
As Chemist and Synthetic Biologist I am stoked about joining the first iGEM team at MSU, after just starting up my new group here in January. In the lab, we are cracking pathways to complex natural products and plant pharmaceuticals, which allows the biosynthetic production in biotech hosts. We hold a range of patents and have an industrial collaboration for the engineering of microbial production of drugs and precursors using glucose as starting material only.

Greatest Accomplishment: In a reality TV show Triple Crown, I won Survivor, Dancing with the Stars, and Cupcake Wars – all in the same year!
Danny’s Plant Research Laboratory recently designed a strain of cyanobacteria that can export a significant fraction of the carbon it fixes (up to 85%) as sucrose. This approach is promising as a potential alternative to land-based crops for sugar production - this level of productivity could exceed sugar output from sugarcane or corn if it could be scaled. Ongoing projects in the lab aim to contribute broadly in the areas of alternative energy development, understanding mixed microbial communities, and photosynthetic metabolism.

Fluorescence was measured in the Tecan Safire 2 for 12 hours
Conditions: Conditions are listed in assay 25
Results: The data shows that the T7 and T7 2.5 are the fastest RNA polymerase according to their ATP consumption and the increasing signal of Malachite Green Aptamer in the Assay. The T3 RNA Polymerase is slower than both T7 RNA Polymerase, but it is still active after 500 min. The Sp6 has a higher Malachite Green Aptamer fluorescence while having a small ATP consumption in comparison to the T3 RNA polymerase. The E. coli RNA polymerase shows no activity.

Over the same time period, we expected a greater quantity of IAA to be detected when employing the scaffolded enzymes.
Salkowski Assay
The Salkowski assay is a colourimetric assay that detects IAA in solution. This simple assay was therefore useful to compare IAA production by unscaffolded veruses Assemblase-scaffolded IaaM and IaaH enzymes. We first performed the Salkowski assay on standards prepared from commercially available IAA. The 2011 Imperial College London iGEM team described a method for conducting a Salkowski assay on IAA, we have expanded their method.

Measure 40 mL of MQ H2O into a 100 mL shot bottle with stirrer bar.
Using a pipette, slowly transfer 60mL of H2SO4 (95%) into a 100 mL measuring cylinder, ensuring the solution does not heat up excessively.
Weigh 0.45 g of anhydrous FeCl3.
Add to acid solution with stirring until fully dissolved.
Label and place in a dark corrosives-safe cabinet.
Preparation of 100 mL 3 mM stock IAA:
Weigh 52.6 mg IAA and dissolve in 5 mL absolute ethanol.
Add 5 mL of the IAA ethanol solution to 95 mL H2O.
Dilute 1 in 10 for use in the reaction.
Reaction (Non cell based analysis):
Add Salkowski Reagent to sample at a ratio of 2:1
Store in a dark corrosives-safe cupboard for 30 minutes.
Measure at OD530nm.
Reaction (Cell based analysis):
Centrifuge cell suspensions intended for analysis for 5 minutes on maximum speed.
Analyse the supernatant as per ‘Non cell based analysis’ protocol.
Remove all of the supernatant from the pellet
Add 1mL of Salkowski reagent to the pellet, then store in a dark, corrosives-safe cupboard for 30 minutes
Measure at OD530nm.
Salkowski Assay Results
We generated a standard curve using the assay, with an R2 of 0.99. Thus we were confident in our ability to detect IAA (Figures 2 and 3). The 300 µl value was removed to generate the standard curve due to the concentration being beyond the detection limit of this assay"

Experiment 2
Procedure
The anaerobic experiment is performed in a sealed bottle, where two polarographic electrodes that will measure nitric oxide and nitrous oxide are carefully attached to the lid. The electrodes are connected to a sensor to measure the different concentrations. The bottle is placed to a magnetic stirrer on 270 rpm and 37oC.
There is one control flask, as well, containing only DM medium which will be spiked with NO2- (as will be done for the experimental flasks).
Additionally, we will measure the response of only anaerobic E. coli biomass without any NO2- added, and the same for anaerobic P. aeruginosa.  This will be done in the experimental flasks prior to spiking with  NO2-.
There will be 2 experimental flasks:
E. coli, to which spikes of NO2- will be added.
P. aeruginosa, to which spikes of NO2- will be added.
In addition to the continuous gas measurements, we take samples to measure the concentration of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate at the beginning and end of each spike.
The response time of the cells to spikes of NO2- is expected to be on the order of minutes, and we will run the experiment until the solution has reached saturation with NO2-.
EQUIPMENT NEEDED
1 400 mL bottle with a lid that the electrodes can be fastened air tightly to
1 magnetic stirrer
1 NO probe for NO measuring
1 N2O probe for N2O measuring
Syringes with long needles and small needles
Syringe filters with pore size 0.2μm

Ultimaker Representative
After a visit to the company Ultimaker (see: Report ) we were inspired by the experts working there. This advice drove us to think about a simpler, more efficient idea. We thought to build our own printer with a toy construction set: The K’NEX. Thus, we started building a 3D printer that fits our needs. By forming a structure from rods and linkers, and connecting them to gears, motors and some transmission chains, we finished our first version. The mechanism could print circular shapes, holding a needle fixed while moving the platform on which the ink was extruded.
In order to let the bacteria ink come out of the needle, the K’NEX printer was coupled to a syringe pump. The syringe pump is able to extrude the bacteria ink with an adjustable speed. The adjustability of the speed proved to be essential: if the extrusion speed is too high, the printed line becomes non-continuous. If the printing speed is too low, the printed line becomes too broad. Our challenge is therefore to make the perfect combination of the speed of the printhead with the speed of the syringe pump to get an optimal printing result.
Biolinker - Specifications
This first printer version was good for initial testing, but of course our goal is to make a printer which can print in all three dimensions! We therefore started building our K’NEX printer 2.0, also known as the BIOLINKER. For this version, we required a considerable amount of K’NEX pieces. But instead of buying them, we were lucky enough to find many enthusiasts that were willing to donate their toys for Science!
We started building the X and Y dimensions. By utilizing motors to rotate a gear mechanism that drives a belt for X and Y axes individually, we could move the printing needle in either of these dimensions. Afterwards, we added the Z axis by using a similar gear mechanism to move the platform on which extrusion is done. Moreover, each axis movement has two speed settings characterized further down in the page. We added this by switching the transmission on either a larger or a smaller gear, much like the mechanism found in a bike. Our final design was finished!
After testing and optimizing this design, we decided that it is good enough to make it our final version! You can see in fast forward how the printer can be built in less than one hour, if all steps are known and pieces available.
So we had our prototype, but was it any good? In order to find that out, we contacted the iGEM team"

Note: I left on 8/24 evening for my summer break and nothing seemed to work. But a few days later I heard that (thanks to Traci and Evan!) the induced fluorescence from these devices could be detected using the FACS machine. Maybe the produced fluorescence was simply too sensitive and therefore could not be seen under the UV light. I put the characterization for my inducible genetic devices and I plan on submitting these parts to Parts Registry. Check out our iGEM wiki page for more information! Anyway, it's been a great summer. Thanks for reading my lab notebook! - Alberto

Summary
Several devices that contain pBad promoter, AraC gene, and various fluorescent protein gene were ligated
The transformed ligation succeeded in producing numerous colonies on the plate
Some backbones possibly self-ligated
From analyzing the transformed plates, it appeared that the transformed plates for I0500_E0240 and I0500_E0430 devices were filled with colonies. In contrast, the colonies that grew on the transformed plates for I13458-equipped devices were very sparse. Nobody knew for sure if this represented an inherent problem with the part itself and whether this would affect the subsequent steps (restriction digest, ligation, etc). Some overnight cultures were then prepared using these transformed colonies so that restriction mapping could be done.

The catalyzation by 2-HAD needs without a metal ion cofactor while other HAD enzymes need, and that a water nucleophile attacks the Asp C=O in the hydrolysis partial reaction[15].
2-HADs are classified into three kinds based on substrate specificities, including L-2-haloacid dehalogenase, D-2-haloacid dehalogenase and DL-2-haloacid dehalogenase[17]. There are two reaction mechanisms proposed for L-2-haloacid dehalogenase. For the first reaction mechanism in Fig. N-A, a carboxylate group of the enzyme attacks the α-carbon atom of the substrate to release the halogen atom to form an ester intermediate. After that, the ester intermediate is hydrolyzed to produce D-2-hydroxyalkanoic acid and regenerate the enzyme. As for the second mechanism, a water molecule directly attacks the substrate to expel the halogen atom in the single step in Figure 2 below[17].
Figure 2. HAD Mechanism. Modified from[17]
Since numerous haloacid dehalogenases isolated from various bacteria species, the potential of bacteria using HAD           to do bioremediation and utilize these compounds as its carbon source increases.
Laccase
The laccase we adopt in this system is from a symbiotic fungus of termite ( Odontotermes formosanus), Termitomyces T984, which was isolated from fecal material and responsible for lignin degradation where laccase           plays a crucial role.
The laccase are a kind of peroxidase that has great oxidation ability and has potential to degrade organic compound           such as diesel, pesticide, antibiotics, PCBs, dioxins etc. In former research, the laccase we use has shown
which can attack the ring structure on the dioxin and turn it into some products that can enter lower metabolic pathway           of bacteria. (Mathew2013, Jiang2016, Zhang2012)
Circuit
We use constitutive Anderson promoter J23100 and strong RBS B0034 to express our genes as a polygene (polycistronic)           circuit. Since the total length of our genes is short enough (less than 5000) we can"

Publication
We decided to publish our knowledge on our wiki in full size to enable the construction of a biosensor to protect oneself. We did not restrict or delayed publication, because we found the critical knowledge about how to obtain or synthesize the date rape drugs already published by several easily assessable webpages.
Answers to proposed questions for biosecurity risk assessment implementation
General biosecurity risk assessment:
Do you work with any sequences or toxins of plant/animal origin, that might be a threat to health of humanity or environment?
→ No.
Do you work with any S3/4 organism’s sequences or toxins or does your work contain any sequences or proteins specifically produced/contained in these organisms?
→ No.
Do you provide any knowledge of constructing, manipulating or influencing these agents or toxins?
→ No.
Do your experiments meet any of these criteria or provide knowledge about the conduction of these experiments? If yes, which?
“Enhances the harmful consequences of the agent or toxin
Disrupts immunity or the effectiveness of an immunization against the agent or toxin without clinical or agricultural justification
Confers to the agent or toxin resistance to clinically or agriculturally useful prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against that agent or toxin or facilitates their ability to evade detection methodologies
Increases the stability, transmissibility, or the ability to disseminate the agent or toxin
Alters the host range or tropism of the agent or toxin
Enhances the susceptibility of a host population to the agent or toxin
Generates or reconstitutes an eradicated or extinct agent or toxin listed above”
→ No.

A Vernier micrometer was used to measure the thickness of the film.
Mechanical testing
Just as with the fibers, strips of the fiber were mounted onto cardstock frames with 10mm gauge lengths. The mounted strips were then loaded into the Instron for testing.
Results for Recombinant Silk Films
Unfortunately, as of 18 September 2015, we haven't gotten around to assaying the mechanical properties of our silk films yet. Any updates and data obtained after the wiki freeze (18 September 2015) will be uploaded to our team's OpenWetWare page . Please note that any and all data hosted on that page is ineligible for consideration by the iGEM wiki judges.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing"

As the bands are relatively strong in comparison to the native proteins, which form the other bands in the gel, it can be assumed that the SH2 fusion proteins were expressed correctly.
However, the bands which can be seen in all the samples that should contain the HA4 Evobody or one of its mutants( BBa_K2082222 , BBa_K2082223 and BBa_K2082224 ) alone show no extraordinary expression, which lead to the assumtion that HA4 might not be expressed in the samples. To further prove that the HA4 Evobody was, after all, expressed, a western blot was done afterwards.
Western Blot
By blotting a previosly prepared SDS gel similar to the one explained before but missing the SH2 samples, a western blot was done with an anti-myc antibody as the primary antibody and an anti-mouse antibody with a horsereddish peroxidase fused to it as the secondary antibody. The primary antibody was chosen because the HA4 Evobody and its mutants contain a myc-tag as a linker between the HA4 binding protein and the RpoZ. The secondary antibody has been chosen because the primary antibody was a mouse derived antibody.
Figure 2. Western blot for expression control: Result of a western blot with samples from left to right: marker, HA4 Evobody wild type, HA4 Y87A mutant Evobody, HA4 R38A mutant Evobody, HA4 R38A E52A, SH2:cI+HA4 Evobody
It can be seen in Figure 2 that all samples blotted show a band at an approximate weight of 22 kDa. As the primary antibody used in the western blot should only bind to a myc-tag, it can be assumed that the bands visible verify the correct expression of the HA4 Evobody and its mutants in the samples.
BLItz
To confirm that the anti-myc antibody binds correctly to the HA4 Evobody, a bio-layer interferometry was performed with a BLItz system by Forté Bio .
Figure 3. BLItz results of immobilized HA4 with anti-myc antibody: Result of a bio-layer interferometry of HA4 with anti-myc antibody on Amine reactive 2nd generation biosensor.
The HA4 Evobody was immobilized on an amine reactive 2nd generation biosensor by Forté Bio. As the secondary supplement, the anti-myc antibody previously used in the western blot was used. As it can be seen in"
EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Our Project#Reporter Systems#plasmid_-_-_TEXT.html," structure is illustrated below.
First reporter - J61002 Ptet-RFP
The first step of assembly was to make a J61002 backbone, containing pTet and RFP. We took the J61002 plasmid from the registry, containing ampicillin resistance, RFP and a ColE1 replication origin (medium copy number). By PCR, we then added the pTet promoter in front of RFP. Finally, the pTet-RFP and the backbone (plasmid without RFP) were assembled using the Gibson method . This was our first successful Gibson assembly.

Details of the parts assembled:
J61002 backbone: from Arkin lab ""J61002""
Terminator B0014: from the Registry ""B0014"" (sequence copied into our plasmids)
Ptet promoter: B0040 from the Registry ""B0040"" (sequence copied into our plasmids)
RBS: B0034 from the Registry ""B0034"" (sequence copied into our plasmids)
RFP gene: sequence from J61002 plasmid ""J61002""
The product of this assembly is the J61002-pTet-RFP 'backbone' plasmid. It contains an ampicillin resistance gene, a middle copy-number p15A origin, as well as RFP repressed by Ptet. You can access the complete sequence of the plasmid here . This plasmid is used as a template for the second step of assembly, in which the LacI inverter and reporter genes are introduced.
This plasmid is used in our  first readout system, both with the wild-type TetR and with mutants. For the results of this readout system, please refer to this page.
Second reporter - J61002 Plac-RFP
The second step is to add the RFP reporter gene under Plac promoter in the J61002 backbone. Let's run through the elements one by one. We need:
The backbone, containing the replication origin and Ampicillin resistance
a pLac promoter...
...that represses expression of a RFP reporter gene
The backbone is copied from the previously-assembled J61002-pTet-RFP. RFP"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#InformedDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," the broader implications which our E. coli monitoring tool could have in the livestock industry. We learned that approximately one-third of E. coli O157 illness is due to contaminated beef and another third from contaminated produce. The final third of human infections stem from E. coli in the broader environment, from sources such as contamination of water and exposure of children who touch livestock carrying the bacteria.  We realized that our tool could be used to provide a visual indicator of E. coli shedding, and could have far-reaching implications. With such feedback, our tool could be leveraged with other management strategies to decrease E. coli levels across cattle populations.
From our dialogue with key players at in stage of the beef-processing industry, we were able to not only gain validation that our project was needed and worthwhile, but also able to implement multiple design considerations into our final product. We hope that this will result in the design and construction of a meaningful and relevant system where we can use synthetic biology to solve a very serious problem worldwide.

A further  problem is the influx of the pathway precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). We used OptKnock analysis to design yeast strains with optimized FPP production. With this analysis we got hints that growing the yeast cells on a fatty acid medium might be a simple alternative to  knocking out the desired genes.
Violacein
Working on a project is a process of well planned steps. It starts with an idea and theoretical research to create a design. When finally demonstrating the mechanism of the project it is important to point out the benefits with a suitable application.
Synthetic biology offers countless numbers of new opportunities, especially in the field of metabolic engineering. To testify some main parts of our artico project, we decided to relocate a metabolic pathway into yeast peroxisomes. There are several reasons why this approach fits perfectly as a proof for our concept.
Based on described of advantages of violacein this pathway was chosen. Violacein is naturally produced in numerous bacterial strains, most popular in the gram-negative Chromobacterium violaceum . It is related to biofilm production and shows typical activities of a secondary metabolite (Seong Yeol Choi et al., 2015).
Figure 8.1 The synthesis of Violacein requires five enzymes encoded by the VioABCDE operon. VioA, a flavin-dependent L-tryptophan oxidase and VioB, a heme protein, work in combination to oxidize and dimerize L-tryptophan to an IPA imine dimer. Hydrogen peroxide is released as a by-product of the VioA reaction. Next step by VioE is the rearrangement of the IPA imine dimer to protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, which can non-enzymatically oxidize to prodeoxyviolacein or, by VioC via deoxyviolaceinic acid, oxidize to pink deoxyviolacein. The flavin-dependent oxygenases VioC and VioD require interaction with the oxidized form of flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (uniprot, uniprot) . The two enzymes act sequentially: first, VioD hydroxylates protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, leading to protoviolaceinic acid. Second, VioC creates the oxindole at the 2-position of one indole"

The BAITswitch
The Bioorthoginal Auxin Induceable Trigger Switch
Overview
This summer, the iGEM team of Nevada came up with a new strategy for rapid-response, protein degradation in yeast cells through our Bioorthoginal Auxin Inducible Trigger Switch (or BAITSwitch). Under biological conditions, protein degradation is a very slow process which can take anywhere from several hours to days to months! Some of these proteins are causing disease while accumulating. To combat this issue, our system is similar to that of a light switch, where a response is seen immediately after a trigger is toggled.                              This year we attempted to select a specifically-labeled protein for immediate degradation via the bioorthoginal auxin-inducible-degron (AID) System ( Nishimura et al.2009 ). This Auxin system has been published and used by previous iGEM teams, but has never been combined with its parallel system, jasmonic acid, in non-plant cells. However, before we could start our journey we needed to understand some very unique characteristics about Protein Degradation.
Understanding the Perfect Model
Typical Protein Degradation Rates
How Protein Degradation Works
The BAITSwitch
How a Lightbulb Works
An easy way to explain our system is to imagine a light switch: a source of instantaneous change. A room can go from dark to light instantly by flipping the switch. Similarly, a protein can go from existing and causing havoc to being destroyed by “flipping the switch,” or adding auxin. Our research causes this change as fast as biologically possible
Understanding the Perfect Model
As seen in the graph to the right, a lightswitch is the perfect model from the fact that there is an imediate response (creation of light) after a trigger is activated (ie. flicking on the light switch). With 0 being representation of no light in a room and 1 being the room filled with light over the time span of a couple seconds.

BBa_K314100
The 2015 WashU iGEM conducted a series of induction experiments to determine the validity of part K314100. The results obtained suggest that the part isn’t subject to inducer concentrations. The part either fluoresced at a constant, high level or didn’t fluoresce at all when tested.
The team transformed the part into DH10B twice. The colonies of the first transformation looked like this:
The cells largely appeared red. The WashU iGEM team then conducted an induction experiment to test how the cells fluoresced at different concentrations of aTc. The team pipetted cell culture into different aTc concentrations serially diluted across 8 wells. Results from this induction experiment are shown below.
While the part had a 1.3x increase between the lowest and highest inducer concentrations, the fluorescence increase was not uniform across all concentrations; fluorescence decreased at certain concentrations when it should’ve been increased.
The team proceeded with a second transformation to test the part even further. Colonies from that transformation are shown below.
Cells were largely colorless, with few red colored colonies to be found. Using the same procedure from the first experiment, the team ran a second induction experiment on these colonies to observe whether red fluorescence increased with aTc concentration. The results from that experiment are shown below.
The colonies exhibited no remarkable fluorescence regardless of the aTc concentration. At this point in time, the team hypothesized that the colonies from the first transformation were simply different than the colonies from the second transformation, perhaps as a result of homologous recombination. The team decided to run a third induction experiment, with the same protocol used in the previous two experiments, to determine the validity behind this assertion. Two colonies were picked from the first transformation; one colony was picked from the second transformation. The results from this experiment are shown below.
Values for each colony are consistent with what was obtained in their respective experiments. While the team didn’t sequence the parts in each colony, it suspects that two separate strains had been produced, in which the part had been mutated in some manner. Regardless, the team holds little confidence in the effectiveness of this part.

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," we had settled on a project, so the main focus was showing the event and bringing the audience along in the activities that took place during the tutorial.

Kulturnatten (Culture Night)
'Københavns Kulturnat’ is an annual event held all over Copenhagen. It gathers people and allows them to experience many of the things that Copenhagen has to offer. Our team was lucky enough to be offered to participate at the Tycho Brahe Planetarium along with the UCPH team with whom we had at that point collaborated to write a report on Mars colonization .
You can read the report here.
Our two teams decided to extend our collaboration while still representing our individual teams’ projects at the event. For example, we brought samples of our building material for display, engaged the younger audience by letting them create their “Mars habitat” (by shaping buildings out of clay) while we encouraged the remaining visitors to let us know their opinions on some of the issues that we have discussed in our collaboration report. We had set up a questionnaire with only “yes”, “no”, and “don’t know” options to five questions on Mars colonization related to the report. The difficulty of answering a question so briefly really allowed us to talk to the visitors about the issues as much as possible. The answers to the questionnaires can be found as pie charts.
We found that people were generally for going to Mars, but as our conversations revealed, there was a lot more nuance to the subject. Something that came up a lot was the argumentation of traveling to Mars. Many of the arguments presented in the second part of the report were echoed by the visitors, especially whether we could justify spending our resources on colonizing Mars instead of fixing the problems at home. There were many different takes on this dilemma, which suggests it is a valuable issue to continue working on, especially elucidate the finer nuances. The overall question of “Should humanity colonize Mars” worked as a visual poll that could be followed throughout the night with only “yes” and “no” as possible answers. This had about twice as many respondents compared to the questionnaire:

Cyanobacteria
The search for a suitable chassis on which to build the PowerCell project turned up several promising contenders: algae are very efficient solar powerhouses, and E. coli has been engineered to express rubisco and perform a rudimentary form of carbon sequestration, among others.  After carefully weighing our options, we hit upon cyanobacteria, commonly (and slightly inaccurately) called blue-green algae.
Cyanobacteria proliferate in bodies of water and are an important primary producer in the Earth ecosystem
Bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen are part of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle (photo courtesy the EPA)
Anabaena 7120
To host PowerCell, we chose a diazotropic cyanobacterium, Anabaena 7120. Anabaena 7120 has several characteristics that make it a good choice of host - most importantly its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful forms.
Anabaena 7120 is a filamentous bacterium capable of both photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation. Light micrograph of one of our Anabaena, 630x bright field
Nitrogen and Oxygen
Anaebaena is a diazotroph, or “N2 eater.”  The organism has evolved a nitrogenase which is capable of overcoming the triple covalent bond between the two nitrogen atoms, although the reaction is oxygen-sensitive and can only take place in an anaerobic environment.
"
Wash_U,2009,Team:Wash U#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," the opportunity to click a radio button to flag the part to incite inquiry and further review by other users (*flagging the part requires a text entry explanation for why that part is being tagged*).
Upon completion of the text entry, the user will then be able to submit the review and have it be immediately visible on that part’s review page.  The next step is then the quality control of the reviews themselves.
For this, we recommend simple “thumbs-up,” “thumbs-down” buttons alongside each review that other users can select when reading through the review pages.  Ordering of the reviews can then prioritized based on the reviews that receive the most “thumbs-up!”  This also allows a clout based incentive system for users to write quality reviews, as the users with the “most-helpful” reviews can become “Top-Reviewers,” an attributed that can be noted on that users personal wiki and lab wiki.
Obviously, this will not be enough incentive to initially drive user-participation in the review process, which is why we believe all iGEM teams should be required to submit reviews for the biobricks they use over the course of the competition.  An incentive can then also be attached to this by awarding a prize for the teams that submitted the most beneficial biobrick reviews to the registry.
Though technical hurdles will need to be overcome in order to implement the aforementioned system, the benefit to the user-base will greatly outweigh the cost of development.
Conclusion
Our proposed change to the current system will not seem entirely unfamiliar to most web users, as variations to this type of review system can be seen on many online shopping sites (most notably, Amazon.com).  However, our proposal involves a tailored solution specific to the needs of registry users that can significantly highlight the current benefits of the registry to the user-base, while simultaneously surmounting the shortcomings currently present in the registry today.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary_-_-_TEXT.html," or fluorescent reporters. Using his transposon library FRED gets clues about the genetic elements that will activate in the presence of toxins.
Reporting
Once FRED finds the toxins he wastes no time exposing them. Building upon last year's single output electrochemical system FRED now uses the new triple output system to report the toxins. This novel approach to electrochemical reporting means that FRED is as good as he is fast.
Modelling
Aside from being a stellar detective FRED also dabbles in the art of mathematics and modelling. These skills are used to model the behavior of the system. The results from the modelling helped guide the wet lab experiments which in turn gave new data to refine the model.
Prototyping
FRED gets a lot of information so he stays on top of things with the help of his handy dandy physical device to test the sample and software to interpret the raw data. The device has been prototyped and has an accompanying software platform that works with FRED to detect the toxins.
OSCAR
OSCAR is our Optimized System for Carboxylic Acid Remediation. OSCAR is responsible for converting toxins such as catechol and naphthenic acids into hydrocarbons. OSCAR is also capable of removing nitrogen and sulfur groups to further purify the hydrocarbons produced. Click on OSCAR to learn more!
Decarboxylation
In order to convert tailings pond toxins fully into hydrocarbons, we need to remove carboxylic acid groups. We are using the PetroBrick, from the University of Washington's 2011 iGEM team, to cleave off carboxylic acids to produce hydrocarbons. Click here to learn more!
Catechol Degradation
Catechol is a common toxic compound found in tailings ponds. We looked into giving OSCAR the ability to degrade catechol, which would also cleave ring structures of toxins.
Flux-Variability Analysis
We wanted to optimize OSCAR's output of hydrocarbons, so we computationally modelled how we can add particular metabolites to the growth media to increase hydrocarbon output. Click here to see what we found out!
Bioreactor
OSCAR needed a home, so we developed an enclosed bioreactor system where toxins can be converted into hydrocarbons for output. Click here to see how we designed the bioreactor!
Upgrading
Nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms can produce nasty airborne pollutants when burned, cause acid rain and acid deposition, and can damage valuable catalysis mechanisms involved in fuel processing and emissions control."

COLLABORATIONS
Valencia UPV - Chatter Plant
We helped translate their questionnaire into French and then went to interview famous greenhouses in Paris, including:
Jardin du Luxembourg
Jardin des Plantes
Jardin d’Auteuil
They used these interviews and questionnaire to conduct market research for their project.
They implemented our escape game design, a pedagogical game to learn synthetic biology and tested it on non-biologists. They provided feedback on both our design and our game play instruction rulebook, which we then used to improve the game.
Pasteur Paris - Aether
They gave us a basic part that they designed, which functions to produce silicatein alpha in bacteria. We characterised the part and submitted it into the biobrick registry. We used this part in our overall design as one of the biomaterials.
We attended the France iGEM meet-up hosted by the Pasteur team. They also attended our play testing of the escape room where we were also able to give them a tour of our lab.
IONIS Paris - Softer Shock
We provided our equipement and materials , such as the plate reader machine, incubator as well as the glassware and media needed. We also helped them design their protocol for the characterisation and discussed how best to detect their reporter systems. We also provided our nanodrop allowing them to measure DNA concentrations for part submission.
We tested their SimRNA handbook, used to model our RNA organelle strands.  Over a couple sessions, we discussed how best to model the RNA agglomerations and then downloaded the software. They then helped us fully understand and execute the software.
Surveys
We also helped other iGEM teams around the world by answering their surveys:

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Modeling#Protein Predictions_-_-_TEXT.html," For many of the predicted receptors in the genome of Physcomitrella patens the prediction did not yield a positive result. With respect to the signal peptide, all mentioned receptors would be suitable as a template for our synthetic receptor. The predicted data show that the SERK-Receptor is favorable for our application, because its signal peptide is statistically the best recognized one and bears the smallest risk of failure.
Prediction of Transmembrane Regions
Figure 2: Prediction and analysis of transmembrane regions
Introduction
Additional to the identification of the signal peptide, it was very important to identify transmembrane regions within the receptors, because we wanted to use a type I receptor as a template that contains a N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal intracellular domain (see our localization page ). To analyze this issue, the prediction tool TMHMM was used for several different receptors. Again the most suitable receptors were ERK, FLS2 and SERK.
Results
The analysis yields a signal peptide and a single transmembrane domain for all three depicted receptors (see fig. 2). The estimated reliability of the predictions was equally good for all examined receptors, whereas the signal peptide was most reliably predicted for the SERK receptor.
Discussion
Focussing on the membrane topology point of view, all the investigated receptors would be suitable blue prints for our synthetic receptor. As the SERK-Receptor yields the best prediction, it was chosen as the favorable template. Another reason to choose the SERK-Receptor was that it is derived from Physcomitrella patens. The only problem, concerning this prediction, is that the N-terminus of this receptor is predicted to be extracellular. The falsification of this prediction was simple, because the SERK receptor contains a C-terminal kinase-domain, which is known to be involved in signal transduction.
Choice of the SERK Receptor
Finally we decided to use the SERK receptor as a template to generate our synthetic receptor. The final receptor was designed in RFC[25] standard, which allows in frame protein fusions. The final constructs were designed containing the SERK signal peptide ( BBa_K1159303 ), an extracellularly located effector protein, the transmembrane domain of the SERK receptor ( BBa_K1159305 ), a short linker and a GFP, to investigate the cellular localization of our receptor with the aid of fluorescence microscopy.

Note Do not vortex to avoid shearing of chromosomal DNA. Do not incubate for more than 5 minutes to avoid denaturation of supercoiled plasmid DNA.
Add 350 µl of the Neutralization Solution and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6                 times.
Note It is important to mix thoroughly and gently after the addition of the Neutralization                     Solution to avoid localized  precipitation of bacterial cell debris. The neutralized bacterial                      lysate should become cloudly.
Centrifuge for 5 minutes to pellet cell debris and chromosomal DNA.
Transfer the supernatant to the supplied GeneJET spin coloumn by decanting or pipetting. Avoid                 disburbing or transferring the white  precipitate.
Centrifuge for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place the coloumn back into the same collection                tube.
Note Do not add bleach to the flow-through.
Add 500 µl of the Wash Solution (diluted with ethanol prior to first use) to the GeneJET spin column.                 Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds and discard the flow-through. Place the column back into the same                 collection tube.
Repeat the wash procedure (step before) using 500 µl of the Wash Solution.
Discard the flow-through and centrifuge for an additional  1 minute to remove residual Wash Solution.                This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in plasmid preps.
Transfer the GeneJET spin column into a fresh 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (not included). Add 50 µl of                the Elution Buffer to the center of GeneJET spin column membrane to elute the plasmide DNA. Take care                not to contact the membrane with the pipette tip. Incubate for 2 minutes at room temperature and                 centrifuge for 2 minutes.
Note An additional elution step (optional) with Elution Buffer or water will recover                      residual DNA from the membrane and increase the overall yield by 10-20%. For elution of plasmids                     or cosmids >20 kb, prewarm Elution Buffer to 70 °C before applying to silica membrane.
Discard the column and store the purified plasmid DNA at -20 °C.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#NiC_-_-_TEXT.html," conducted by Marko Ahteensuu, a Collegium Researcher at the University of Turku, Finland, who specializes in ethics in biosecurity and synthetic biology. The workshop began with a short lecture by Marko where he mainly focused on “Naturalness” and “Ethics in Synthetic Biology”. The workshop proceeded with a discussion session and here participants discussed an ethical issue entitled “A Weapon of Mass Destruction” in small groups. Each group presented their own ideas regarding the issue, and the term “dual-use research” was touched upon. According to Marko’s lecture, dual-use is defined as work that could be use to terrorists as well as to legitimate researchers. Here, participants also discussed aspects of their own project that could pose as an ethical issue.
Through this “Unsolved Ethics” workshop we hoped to open our minds as well as minds of other iGEM members regarding ethical issues in synthetic biology. As young researchers, we should always consider the risks, or in this case the ethical consequence that could arise from the work that we are developing.
Speculative Design
In this workshop, current developments in science and technology are extrapolated into alternative future realities, to discuss how the research areas could affect society and life itself. The scenarios are visualized and made tangible so that people who are not experts in the field can take part in the ethical discussion of how we want our future to look like.
The workshop started with a 30 minute presentation where the design field was introduced through a series of examples and projects. After that, the participants started in their own iGEM projects, creating speculative scenarios that discuss how their project might develop in the future both from a positive and negative point of view. The workshop aimed to help the iGEM teams answer the recurring question - How do you think this might be used in the future?
Mini-Jamboree
The Mini-Jamboree was an event during the conference where all Nordic Teams presented their synthetic biology projects. Each team had 10 minutes to present their project, followed by a short Q&A. There was a panel of judges that choose a winner based on the official iGEM criteria for standard tracks . We had the honor of having Vinoo from iGEM HQ at the mini-jamboree, and he gave an inspiring presentation and told us more about iGEM and things that can help us.
The judges were no less than Felix Richter, the iGEM Stockholm 2015 project leader, and Caroline Dahl, Head of Innovation & Research and Founder at Ortrud Medical. During the Gasque (a Swedish student dinner party"

Solution
Challenges Solutions: Enhanced sensitivity Proteolysis signaling Mechanosensing
 
 Enhanced sensitivity of mechano-sensors and their coupling to the signaling
Enhancement of cell sensitivity to mechnostimuli by the ectopic expression of mechanosensing ion channels and gas vesicles.
Gas vesicles sensitize cells to respond to ultrasound which triggers opening of mechanosensitive calcium channels. Influx of free calcium ions                                             activates the calcium-responsive reporters and reconstitutes a mediator to activate the downstream signaling pathway.
The challenge of increasing the sensitivity of cells to ultrasound or other mechanic stimuli could be solved by overexpression of ultrasound responsive ion channels.                                 Mechanosensitive promoters have been investigated by the MIT 2010 team , however we were interested                                 in mechanosensitive receptors. There are reports in the literature that some TRP family mammalian channels and bacterial channels (MscS and MscL) are responsive to                                 osmotic shock, which led us to hypothesize that they should also be able to respond to ultrasound. An additional idea for the enhancement of the mechanosensors occurred                                 to us through browsing through some previous iGEM projects. Protein gas vesicles have been used in bacteria by several iGEM teams                                 ( Melbourne 2007 , Groningen 2009 , UCL2012 , Glasgow2014 ) and OUC-China team reported in 2012 that they could reconstitute gas                                 vesicles in E. coli from only two components. Gas vesicles, in contrast to cytosol, are compressible, so application of pressure waves to the gas vesicles should                                 strongly affect the cellular cytoskeleton and the membrane of cells containing such gas vesicles. If we could successfully reconstitute gas vesicles in mammalian cells                                 this could strongly increase the response of cells to mechanical stimuli and ultrasound.
Activation of mechanosensing receptors usually leads to an influx of calcium ions into cells, which might thereby be coupled to reporters or selected                                 signaling pathways via formation of a calcium dependent complex. Several calcium responsive protein probes have been reported in the past, such as those based on                                 calmodulin, and we set out to identify the design that would efficiently respond within the range of calcium ion concentrations triggered by mechanosensor stimulation (

).
 Proteolysis based signaling pathway and logic function processing
Our idea was to use highly specific proteolysis to mediate protein signaling. In comparison to phosphorylation, proteolysis is irreversible, but could nevertheless                                 lead to a response as fast as the one"

OUTPUT
To sense intracellular ROS content and express its changes quickly and                     intuitively, we constructed roGFP2-orp1 fusion protein and optimized it.
Increase the sensitivity of roGFP2 to hydrogen                     peroxide
Overview
We made codon optimization of roGFP2 gene sequences and constructed RoGFP2-Orp1 fusion protein                         to make roGFP2 more sensitive to the REDOX state of cells.
Specific methods:
First, we obtained the gene sequence of roGFP2 from the part:BBa_K2296006: Constitutive                         Promoter-RBS-roGFP2-Orp1 C82S and codon optimized it for our chassis organisms---yeast, in                         anticipation of better expression in yeast.
Second, we synthesized the codon-optimized roGFP2+linker sequence, obtained the sequence                         of Orp1 from the yeast genome and ligated them by OE-PCR. This enhances the specificity of                         roGFP2 for recognizing hydrogen peroxide and increases its sensitivity to H2O2.                         After that, we completed the 82nd cysteine point mutation (C82S), which made our signal output                         more responsive.

Overview:
After optimizing the most important detector component roGFP2-orp1, we need to construct it                         into yeasts modified in regulator and feedback part. In order to make roGFP2-orp1 in a suitable                         redox state, we"

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#Human Practices#Intergrated HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," Joseph L. Goldstein said in 2015 Lasker Award Ceremony, “The most original scientists (and artists) in our day discover newness by blending existing knowledge with imaginative thinking.” Art and science are connected primely by imagination. That`s exactly the original motivation of our story.
Key point:
Imagination
Blending existing knowledge with imaginative thinking
Fancy gene circuit and imaginative way to present
Orientation of science-deriving artwork:
To balance the relationship of art and science in our project is not that easy, so it was crucial for us to know how to make our work more attractive, acceptable and influential for the public. This led to our interview with Pro. Yu from BIG. As the chief scientific advisor of Art and Science Research Center, he indicated that “Science serves as a tool while art is the ultimate purpose.” We began to explore the novelty and the unique art value of our work.
Key point:
Science-deriving artwork
Public concern
Novelty which distinguishes it from traditional art forms
Addition of designs dynamic changes, the structure of space
Story maker and soul-bringer:
To explore the unique art value of our project, we had several face-to-face meetings with artists from Art and Science Research Center, who are professional and experienced in this pioneering field. They pointed out the significance of the interaction with the public practically and more importantly, emotionally. Collaborating with them, we came up with the presenting form of story-telling deriving from Oscar Wilde’s story, The Nightingale and the Rose, which easily rises the audience’s emotional sympathy. Also, choosing the rose as the symbol of our story, for it is well accepted as the symbol of love and art. Blending emotional art value with scientific work indeed bring the soul to our project.
Key point:
Interaction
Storytelling and emotional sympathy
A typical symbol for wide popularization
Giving soul to project"

The killing ability of warrior1 is rather weak. The weakness is partly because that warrior1 kills itself, and partly because it does not effectively kill beggar2. This result is consistent when our orthogonality test, as the orthogonality of warrior2 is quite well, but the orthogonality of warrior1 is not very good.    In order to solve this problem, we have to modify our gene circuit so that warrior 1 does not kill itself and at the same time, effectively kill beggar2."

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," continued to follow up with contacts at the Pine Creek wastewater treatment plant. On May 9th, Michaela met with Magdalena Pop (Magda) from GeekStarter to discuss logistics for a workshop which GeekStarter was planning on holding at the University of Calgary for all of the Alberta iGEM teams. The list of requirements for the workshop was provided by Magda and is listed below:
Room booking (lecture theatre for expert presentations and small rooms for breakout sessions)
Catering (lunch, served buffet-style in the HRIC atrium)
Printed signs and providing directions to the different rooms during the event (needed to know the number of signs and directions of arrows needed)
Accommodating the final number of attendants (provided by Magda by May 23), as well as any dietary restrictions for the 50-70 planned attendees
Help with snacks and coffee for the afternoon (which was not provided through catering company)
No hotel rates for out-of-town guests could be arranged (as the number of attendees was not yet known)
Week 3: May 15 - May 19
We looked into sponsorship opportunities with Genome Alberta, based on past teams from Calgary receiving funding from the aforementioned organization. On May 18th, Michaela scheduled a meeting with Magda for May 30th at 2:00 PM (MST) in order to review and finalize the plan for the June 11th GeekStarter workshop. Michaela also contacted Lamiley Ludderodt , a caterer affiliated with the University of Calgary, regarding the catering for the workshop.
Our team began to read into microbead policies, as we were aware that microbeads were being phased out of cosmetic products in Canada, and the option of biodegradable microbeads was not widely known to the public. We wondered how increased public awareness of the possibility of biodegradable microbeads would impact government action on what is seen in Canada as a serious ecological issue. A summary of our findings can be found on our human practices page, as well as under Week 6 of this journal.
Week 4: May 22- May 26
We began emailing other Canadian iGEM teams in search of collaboration opportunities. UBC’s iGEM team replied to our email and asked for our CRISPR/Cas9 protocols. McMaster also replied to our email and expressed interest in a wet lab collaboration with our team.

Week 24: October 6 - October 12
Optimization of transformation in small liquid volume
We manipulated various conditions in the original transformation protocol, but it was also useful to streamline transformation in small liquid volumes, as that may more closely approximate the transformation apparatus in our final device. Competent B. subtilis are prepped the same way, but transformation took place in aliquots of 100 μL liquid medium. The results were quantified by either plating and counting the number of colonies that grew on selective media, or by taking absorbance measurements against a standard.
Figure 18: Colony growth of transformed B. subtilis at 30°C and 37°C for different xylose concentrations. B. subtilis SCK6 pAX01-comK cells transformed with linearized plasmid DNA and incubated at 30°C and 37°C with different amounts of xylose, followed by growth on selective media. Colony counts were higher for all concentrations of xylose when grown at 37°C. The conditions resulting in highest growth were an incubation temperature of 37°C and a xylose concentration of 2%.
Figure 19: Absorbance readings of small volume B. subtilus in liquid volume for different xylose concentrations. B. subtilis SCK6 pAX01-comK cells in small liquid volume transformed with linearized plasmid DNA and incubated at 37°C with different amounts of xylose, followed by growth and addition of selection marker (antibiotic). All transformation occurred in liquid. The negative control comprised of untransformed cells (killed by antibiotic), while for positive control, antibiotic was not added to untransformed cells. There was a slight increase as xylose concentration increased.
""Biobricking"" of the comK gene:
In preparation for the parts submission deadline, the comK gene contained in the genome of B. subtilis was PCRed and placed into a BioBrick vector. First, primers specially designed to anneal to the PxylA+RBS+comK region within B. subtilis were used"

Market Research
In order to understand what types of products are available or that are in the testing phase, our team did some research to look at how we could design our product to improve upon the issues in the products we found.
The above table shows a comparison between Coagu.coli and blood coagulants that are currently in the market. As you can see, most of these products are not available to be used yet, and are not affordable. Looking at each coagulant more specifically though, we can recognize the faults present in each:
QuikClot:According to the official QuikClot website, this coagulant intercepts in the natural blood clotting cascade at the very beginning. It uses a substance known as kaolin, which starts the clotting process with the activation of factor XII. Since this factor is located at the start of the clotting cascade, this product will not be as “quick” as the name suggests (Z-Medica, 2014). QuikClot has also been known to be troublesome to remove from a wound after application as the material can become too hard if it is left too long in the wound. Bleeding can also resume after removal (NurseAmyandDrBones, 2015).
VetiGel:This coagulant seems to be the best out of all the others. It is fast and affordable. The only problem is that it is not yet ready to be revealed in the market for human use, and has only been focused on being used in veterinarian clinics on animals (Weller, 2014).
Tisseel Although this factor has not been included in the table, Tisseel is known to be made from substances made of human plasma, which “can contain infectious agents”(Center & Evaluation, 2014) and transmit diseases. Looking into the other faults that this coagulant contains, Tisseel is not available to be used in a home setting by an individual. Instead, it is supposed to be applied"

Figure 7. PCR making use of custom primers to extract Beta-lactamase from the psB1A3 vector. Expected band sizes were seen for all of the extractions at approximately 950-bp. Some unexpected amplification is seen for this PCR. No contamination is observed in the NTCs (no template controls). The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour
A construction that was attempted this week consisted of placing the beta-lactmase gene with a His-tag behind the promoter BBa_J04500 . Also attempted were plasmid switches of the three beta-lactamase genes extracted via PCR. Colonies were seen for all of the transformed ligation mixtures for these constructions. Colony PCR of these transformed colonies only produced potentially viable results J04500 + Beta-lactamase (with His-tag) construct.
Week 12: July 15 - July 19
The primers for golden gate assembly arrived this week and we conducted the PCRs required for our first attempt at making our constructs. The final ligation product was run on a gel and appears promising, showing a 1500bp band, most likely representing our construct. Despite this, transformations have failed and therefore we have to look back at our primers and experimental design.
We now have a more set idea of how we’re going to synthesize magnetoferritin. We will most likely be using a flask with a rubber stopper that will allow inflow and outflow of the nitrogen gas, which will be bubbled into the solution with an air stone. Nitrogen is free to exit a small port in the stopper and reagents can easily be added via injection through the rubber stopper. Safe handling of the thioglycollic acid is paramount, therefore equipment has been ordered (elbow-length gloves, respirator, apron, and something else), and attempts at synthesis will be conducted as soon as we get the equipment.
The beta-lactamase construction attempted last week proved to be unsuccessful however another construction from this week did produce a gene that appeared to be the J04500 + Beta-lactamase with a His-tag part. This construction was sent in for sequencing over the weekend.
Week 13: July 22 - July 26
The sequencing of the J04500 + Beta-lactamase with a His-tag construction from last week revealed that we had successfully completed this part.M"

But the change of Cd2+ concentration has no obvious effect on growth curve and cells expressing CysDes grow under 0.4mM Cd2+ can reach a higher concentration approximate to the group of 0.1mM and 0.2mM Cd2+ than the wild type.
(d) The expression of CysDes does strengthen the E.coli ‘s resistance of Cd2+ toxicity, but also slows the growth of E.coli to some degrees. We can supplement the media with appropriate amount of cysteine to reduce the negative impact caused by the expression of CysDes.
4.Enzymatic activity analysis of CysDes in vitro
To analyze the enzyme activity of CysDes, we choose to detect the concentration of S2- which is reduced from cysteine under the catalysis of CysDes. Because of lacking appropriate purifying methods, we just analyze the activity of the raw enzyme obtained via bacterial lysis. According to the method described in L.Chu et al. of hydrogen sulfide detection, we first cultivate the 1mL mixture of cysteine, PBS buffer and raw enzyme for 2h at 37 ˚C. Sulfide formation was determined by adding 0.1 ml of 0.02 M N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate in 7.2 N HCl and 0.1 ml of 0.3 M FeCl3 in 1.2 N HCl to the reaction tubes. The absorbance at 650 nm is determined after color development for 20 min at 20°C. Sulfide concentration is determined from the standard curve of Na2S.
From figure 4, the concentration of S2- in the group of CysDes is higher than the wild type which proves that CysDes promotes the reduction of cysteine to S2- with good enzymatic activity certainly.
Under the catalysis of same amount of the raw enzyme, we measure the production of S2- with various concentration of cysteine after 2h at 37˚C (shown in Figure 5). The value of OD650 has approximate linear relationship with the concentration of cysteine which means CysDes almost catalyzes the reduction of all cysteine to S2- and CysDes functions well.

Inbal Vaknin
I'm a M.Sc student in the lab. My main interest is gene regulation in yeast. As part of my M.Sc, I'm working on expressing bacterial genes in yeast for the purpose of innovative gene regulation inside the yeast's nucleus. I recieved my B.Sc degree from the Biotechnology and Food engineering Faculty in the Technion. Disclosure about myself: In 2013, I participated in the iGEM contest and I was a part of the very first team from the Technion (and so in Israel), which was my first experience in the fascinating synthetic biology world.
Lior Levy
I'm a Master student in the lab, I received my B.Sc from the faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering at the Technion. I was part of the first iGEM group from the Technion (and Israel) and now I'm one of the new iGEM team mentor. I'm interested in Two Component Systems and especially how to use them in order to make novelty synthetic biology circuits. On my spare time I like to dub cartoons and narrate everything I read.
Michal Brunwasser
I’m a PhD student in the lab and I’m interested in many aspects of synthetic biology. Currently I’m working on synthetic bacterial enhancers in order to gain insight on the regulatory code encoded within natural enhancers. I received my B.Sc. in Life Sciences from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 2006 and my M.Sc. degree in Biology from the Technion in 2010.
Noa Katz
I received my first degree summa cum laude from the Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering in the Technion, and went straight to a PhD degree, as a part of the special doctorate program. I'm interested in many aspects of synthetic biology, mainly because of its engineering-like approach to biology; such as the reprogramming of cells that can cause them to re-grow a tissue, or to act as an analytic micro-robot. In order to know how to program living cells, the way we do electrical components, we need to understand how certain processes in biology actually work. Currently, I’m working on the transcription characterization and the creation of RNA-protein structures in vivo. On a more personal note, I like to read, play chess, and eat vanilla flavored pancakes.

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine.

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Market#_-_-_TEXT.html," In the United States, it is expected to reach $15.3 billion by 2016 (BCC Research). Environmental consulting in the United States made $1.2 billion in profit in 2012, and is expected to grow with a compound annual growth rate of 8.7% until 2018. About 40% of this industry is focused on water and soil quality management (IBISWorld Industry Report 54162). Globally, the water and wastewater monitoring market as of 2012 was valued at 8 billion dollars.
In addition to the increased amount of legislation around environmental monitoring, many companies are moving towards adopting a greener image, and with it, more environmentally sound policies and management practices. Alongside a need for continuous monitoring, there is a demand for technology to pulse-spot test tailing ponds alongside sites with increased ecological significance with both regular testing as well as increased frequency tests during a water quality detection event.
As a portable, fast, on-site, and easy to use toxin detector, our technology could be used to meet the need in the market for a fast, pulse-spot testing system. With this technology, results could be obtained with shorter wait-times, on-site so that sample composition changes are minimized, and could be integrated into data management processes already used in industry. This would make our system ideal for environmental sampling in many remote locations, as well as for the analysis of water composition to detect corrosive compounds that could damage oil processing equipment when reusing process water.
Beyond environmental monitoring sites, contaminated water can cause significant issues when recycled back into oil sands processing systems. Oil companies are a robust second customer base, as we could provide fast on-site monitoring for compounds that could corrode and impair machinery. Our system would act as a simple tool that could spot test monitor a given water channel providing valuable simple readout to the operator. This would add a valuable new monitoring system for oil sands plant operators to measure compounds which would potentially lead to a corrosion problem which were previously unable to be monitored on-site.
Target Markets
Our primary target market is water quality monitoring related to the oil and gas industry. This market segment is dominated by government environmental regulation. As such, it will be critical to align with government mandated requirements for monitoring technology as we will discuss in more detail. This regulation has led to a significant market opportunity due to large increases in the already numerous number of government mandated water quality monitoring sites. General toxin sensing of these government regulated sites fits into a market opportunity of approximately $50 million as shown below:

INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION
Obesity and type 2 diabetes represent a serious health threat to the population all over the world. Glucose overdose has the major impact on this problem. However, sugar does make you feel happy. Some people may choose to limit, or even quit, sugar intake. Others may do more exercise to stay fit and healthy. In plain words, you have to either decline sweet happiness or pay for it with gaining fat or spending hard time burning calories.
In Mingdao’s project this year, we will help you “crush” the sugar by doing nothing except taking one pill full of our engineered probiotics. Really, just sit and read our iGEM story as well as enjoy your sweets and sugary drinks.
In the research, we addressed the health problems caused by excess glucose, providing information of controlling blood glucose by medicine, briefing previous iGEM team projects dealing with the issue of obesity and diabetes, and detail the mechanism of glucose metabolism and pleasure.
In the design and experiment, we will show you how we created  probiotic-based glucose retrieval system with (1) glucose transporter device, which facilitates the cell glucose uptake with high efficiency, (2) glucose responsive suicide circuit, which produces lysis protein and nuclease to destroy bacteria when running out of glucose, and (3) probiotic transgenesis system, which can be utilized to stably transform Lactobacillus acidophilus by chromosomal homologous recombination.
In the end, we introduced the modeling of the glucose uptake efficiency of our genetically engineered bacteria based on our experimental results. In addition, we showed the design of our acid-resistant pill and the prototype to mimic the stomach-gut environment and simulate the pill passing through gastric acid and releasing probiotics in the gut.

What does glucose do to your body?
SUGAR exists in the types of glucose, fructose, galactose, sucrose, lactose, maltose and starch, as well as in wide varieties of drinks and food such as juice, honey, fruit, yogurt, candies and desserts. Simply speaking, sugar is everywhere, anyone can’t avoid it.  Glucose is the smallest form of sugar and used as energy source for the body.

The parts of some of the copper pieces that were not submerged (specifically 2.3, 2.4, 4.3, 5.2) began oxidizing only two hours after the solid media was added to the dishes. All the copper pieces in the Petri dishes also had air bubbles trapped underneath them. 100 mL of liquid media was pipetted into each of six pre-labeled flasks.
Preparing Cells:
The cell cultures were retrieved from the undergraduate lab and placed into centrifuge bottles. The bottles centrifuged with a water balance for five minutes at 12,000 g.  Once removed from the centrifuge, the supernatant of the bottles was poured out. Masses of 9 microcentrifuge tubes were taken, labeled, and recorded. About 1 mL of liquid media was added to the pellet and the solution was transferred to the labeled microcentrifuge tubes. The tubes containing solution were massed. The tubes were microcentrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 g to better isolate the cells from the supernatant. We removed as much of the liquid as possible from the centrifuge tubes, leaving behind the pellet of cells. The tubes containing the pellet only was massed in order to determine the approximate mass of the bacteria in each tube.
Preparing Experiments:
1 mL of AFM was added to the microcentrifuge tubes and the pellets were mixed into the media. One solution was pipetted into each of three liquid media flasks. Copper pieces were massed and one was placed into each of the six liquid media flasks. The remaining six solutions were pipetted into six petri dishes and then spread around the plate using beads. The petri dishes were placed into the incubator.
July 20
Six flasks containing a copper square in each- 3 flasks containing a solution with bacteria and 3 flasks without bacteria- were removed from a shaker that had been operating at 220 RPM. Flasks B2 and B3 contained solutions that were different shades of reddish-brown, while flask B1 contained a yellowish-green solution. The 3 flasks without bacteria all contained a clear, colorless solution.  The 3 copper pieces that were not exposed to bacteria-containing solution retained their original shape, color and finish. The 3 copper pieces that were exposed to solution containing bacteria appeared darker in color, tarnished and had crimpled edges.
