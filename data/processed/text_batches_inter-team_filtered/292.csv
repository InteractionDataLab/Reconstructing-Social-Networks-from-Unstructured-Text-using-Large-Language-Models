Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#lucylabjournal_-_-_TEXT.html,"[pREP4] E.coli containing pQE80-L encoding hHBB were used to inoculate 5ml of fresh LB growth medium supplemented with ampicillin and kanamycin. Once cultures reached an OD600 of 0.6, they were induced with a range of IPTG concentrations. They were left to grow for a further three hours, after which a 1ml sample was taken and the cells pelleted. The cells were resuspended in 100µl of Laemmli buffer, 20µl of which was separated by SDS-PAGE. The cells were resuspended in 100µl of Laemmli buffer, 20µl of which was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an anti-His antibody.

Review:
So, after almost 3 months working on this model, we have the following components: - We have implemented the notations of rules, so that we can define various interaction rules for our system.
- We have functions that take in an interaction rule and apply it to the system.
- Gillespie's algorithm is implemented. As a quick review, this algorithm provides randomness for biological systems and also determines random time for each interaction.
- We have defined cell life cycle for the simulated cells and now they divide after specific amount of time.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," applying the modeling results in the wetlab we optimized the sample preparation for the detection of gene doping. The main steps of the sample preparation are shown in figure 2.
This resulted in an approach in which cell free DNA was extracted from blood derivatives using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit , a kit containing silica-membrane-based spin columns (QIAGEN). Extractions were verified by nested PCR for the abundant natural albumin gene as internal control after DNA quantification using Qubit. Lastly, samples were spiked with artificial gene-doping DNA, based on the values obtained from the gene doping model and successful extraction of the gene doping DNA was verified by PCR.
Figure 2. Sample preparation workflow. The final process involves a two step PCR to verify the presence of the internal standard albumin gene.
1.1 Background Information
Cell free DNA (cfDNA) is fragmented genomic DNA present in the blood originated mainly from apoptotic cells and other DNA leakage processes described in our model ( Devonshire et. al, 2014 , Zinkova et al, 2017 ). This model also predicted that cfDNA in plasma will be a suitable source for detecting gene-doping DNA. The cfDNA contains fragmented genomic DNA and fragmented gene doping DNA. The gene doping DNA and endogenous DNA produce indistinguishable proteins, however they are distinctive on a nucleic acid level. The most striking differences between the two is the promoter and the absence of introns. Gene doping DNA commonly requires a constitutive promoter for higher levels of expression. Second, due to size limits of the gene doping vectors and the unknown regulation of transcription or translation the introns will be taken out, resulting in exon-exon junctions which are unique for the gene doping DNA. Extraction of cfDNA from plasma is challenging due to low concentrations and high fragmentation, but possible.
Since cfDNA in the blood is highly fragmented and quickly  degraded in the blood it is important to as quickly as possible after blood withdrawal process the blood into plasma or serum ( Wong et al, 2013 ). Processing blood into plasma or serum is done by centrifugation, separating the blood in three layers: the red blood cells, the buffycoat containing the white blood cells and the plasma, as shown in figure 2 ( Thurik, 2016 ). The difference between plasma and serum is that serum is the liquid of the blood left after clotting, whereas plasma still contains the clotting factors and needs to be kept in EDTA lined tubes to prevent clotting. Due to the clotting, which damages the white blood cells, the serum has a higher concentration"

SbpA from Lysinibacillus sphaericus CCM 2177
Fig.1: Square structure of S-layer lattices.
The S-layer protein SbpA of Lysinibacillus sphaericus CCM 2177 consists of 1,268 amino acids and is encoded by the sbpA gene. The lattice symmetry formed through self-assembly is a square structure (p4) with a center-to-center spacing of the morphological units of 13.1 nm (see Fig. 1). Badelt-Lichtblau et al. (2009) found that the self-assembly process is strongly dependent on presence of bivalent cations. Therefore the assembly is dirigible, because in absence of bivalent cations SbpA stays water-soluble. At the amino-terminal end the protein consists of three typical SLH (S-layer homologous) domains and an additional 58 amino acid-long SLH-like motif. Those domains recognize a distinct type of secondary cell wall polymers (SCWP), consisting of disaccharide units. The S-layer protein SbpA is extremely resistant to deletions changing its properties.

PROJECT  OVERVIEW
The iGEM HKUST 2018 team attempts to generate electricity from the degradation of the most widely used plastic, polyethylene (PE), using a synthetic biology approach. Making use of E. coli engineered with genes encoding for laccase to degrade polyethylene into smaller alkane chains, our team recognizes the opportunity to further advance this project by addressing another key issue – energy. Using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain’s inbuilt extracellular electron transport mechanism in tandem with genes responsible for alkane metabolism derived from Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans, we will generate electricity from the metabolism of degraded polyethylene, hoping that it will one day help in solving the world’s growing energy needs. Thus, our project serves as an integrated effort to simultaneously solve two crucial problems.

IGEM 2018 - TEAM HKUST
MFC DESIGN
Aside from plastic degradation and alkane metabolism, generation of electricity was another important focus of our iGEM project.
For the Microbial Fuel Cell design, we focused on generating a stable electrical current by utilizing Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain’s inbuilt extracellular electron transport mechanism. In order to better harness its electrogenicity, we housed a culture of the bacterium within a microbial fuel cell of our design, aiming at maximizing electrical output for a given amount of substrate.
Our final design of biosphere-MFC conjugation had integrated the different comments and suggestions from our potential users. This MFC design aimed to be used both in households or indoor public areas.

Experiment & Result
Firstly, we need to construct three parts of the gene circuit:
Part 1: T7 promoter + toehold triggered by miR144 + GFP + T7 terminator
For part 1, we want to add the toehold triggered by miR-144 to the upstream region of the GFP coding sequence. We used gene2oligo to design many short single-strand DNA and then conducted LCR and second PCR to synthesis our part 1. (http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1700000:Design)
Part 2: T7 promoter + toehold triggered by GFP mRNA + T3 RNA polymerase + T7 terminator
We can obtained T3 RNAP sequence from BBa_K346000 in iGEM distribution. This part was much larger than part 1, so LCR could be inconvenient and expensive. So we used assembly PCR method to add T7 promotor, toehold triggered by GFP mRNA and T7 terminator to the gene. (http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1700001:Design)
Part 3: T3 promoter + RBS + GFP + terminator
Part 3 consisted of a GFP generator and a T3 promoter. GFP together with RBS and terminator was got from BBa_E0840 from iGEM distribution. Then we again used assembly PCR to add T3 promotor to the gene.
Secondly, we linked the 3 parts in order into one plasmid – pSB1C1. We designed primers which helped add BsaI cutting site to the parts and the backbone of the plasmid. BsaI site in the parts was mutated by overlap PCR. Then we used Golden Gate assembly to link the three parts and the plasmid together.
Finally, we want to apply our experiment to the cell free system and make the freeze-drying paper and use the paper to test saliva for diagnosing esophagus cancer. We are really sorry that we didn’t finish this part because our time is limited and so we didn’t have time to do it.

TUST_China,2017,Team:TUST China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"! If that doesn't happen, don't worry! You are also lucky because you can chase your own interests now! If you think about why iGEM wants undergraduate students to be involved majorly rather than postgraduate or Ph.D. That is because college student has the advantage of boldness and imagination. Only in this case can the team come up with a novel idea. Innovation is the key!
Persuade the University
The reason why iGEM is having survival issue in many universities is that it is literally a jamboree of the rich, a competition that burns money, with registration fee+ entrance fee more than 100,000 yuan. In this case, places like International communication center, teacher’s affair office or office of your college is your best shot to raise funds. If you can get your professor to help, you will be much more persuasive than on your own. That is the exact reason why you want a nice professor. The biggest cost comes from the funds the experiment needs. If your professor is willing to offer his own lab's funds, things will be easier. If that is still not sufficient enough, you might need to talk to more faculty members or started applying some projects that provide funds.
Tips: the funds from cooperation is also a good alternative
Training and project initiation(This is serious)
A good project is fundamental for everything.                             (I am not suggesting our project is the best actually I deem it not good enough).                             It helps your persuasion with the university,                             the professors and supports the sustainable development of iGEM in your university.                             You need to show your potential of winning the awards and                             makes your project looks like a good investment to the school's faculty.                             Even with the fact that there aren't many universi-ties opening courses of synthetic biology,                             you shouldn't be discouraged and former years' wiki is a good start. Gradually,                             you will find yourself capable of reading paper which is the basis of brainstorming.                             Communication is the key and you need to trust your team. When encountered with problems,                             stop hesitating to ask. Here I recommend a qq group created by Zhang Haoqian---iGEM China&Syn Bio.                             It is a great platform with many friendly pro-fessors or experienced researchers willing to answer academic question.
Tips Read a book called ""molecular biology lab work handbook"" before you start your lab work. Don't ask me why, just read it.
Prepare for the competition

Attending Conferences (Communication)
The 3rd iGEM conference in  Taiwan:
Xiao Yangbo and Zhao Yiqing, two of our  team members, attended the 2015 iGEM conference held by NCTU in Taiwan from  July 19th to 24th. Serving as a “small jamboree” facing  to teams in Asia, presentations and poster introductions were given according  to different project designs as well as experiment progress. In this way,  efficient and harmonious communication between teams was realized while we got  helpful advice at the same time.     
CCIC(China Community of iGEM Competition  summit):
Five members of us also attended CCIC held  in Peking University on August 8th. We found that there were teams  working on systems similar to ours. Although we did not give a presentation at  the conference, listening to those correlated projects indeed shed light on our  work, therefore worth the participation.

The output BAM file from base recalibration can be used directly to call the somatic mutations in the samples. Additional information might additional be trimmed or flag in order to avoid bias in the final result.
Mutation Calling - Mutect2
Mutation calling is one of the core functions of the Ginga pipeline. The somatic mutations found in the samples are responsible for the modifications in the final translated proteins and effectively the neoantigen sequences that Ginga                   aims to detect. Unfortunately, due to the lack of ethical approval to access other patient’s dataset and the concerns regarding the data protection of whole exome sequences, the results of this validation were perform without a reference                   matched normal sample. The lack of a matched normal reduces the mutation calling accuracy of this validation results and requires extensive optimization of the parameters. However, this analysis is now supported in the latest version                   of Mutect2 (v 4.0.9.0) and can be performed by running the single tumor sample mode in addition to using databases of known polymorphic sites (Kalatskaya et al.).
The mutation calling was done with Mutect2 in GATK (v 4.0.9.0), which currently is under development (Beta Version). The samples were initially analysed in single tumor sample mode against the hg19 human reference genome with no germline                   resource or PON. This first results identify an unrealistic number of mutations, for example a total of 198,760 mutations were identified for sample ERR2683866. These results (Table 7) are expected as no matched"

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics results_-_-_TEXT.html," public does not have enough specific knowledge to understand the complex principles of synthetic biology and the research that is going on to understand it.
Only a few have difficulties to envision what the public's perception from their own current point of view.
Some believe that poor communication of research will lead to fear in the general public.
It is hard to think for someone else, but in some cases one can estimate to a certain extend how somebody would react on particular information. In this case, the informed scientific community is asked to estimate the public's perception on the controversial research of Craig Venter. The answer's are diverse, where the majority (51%) thinks that the public will perceive the research as controversial and Venter is trying to create new life forms, while a relatively large minority of 35% of the researchers think that the public will think that he is only putting biological components together. From the open-answers one strong point was made, focusing on the importance of proper communication in order to inform the public objectively. Using statements such as ""playing God"" might work to draw attention, but can be interpreted negatively.
Risks
As outlined in the background information section, one of the main issues in synthetic biology concerns bio-safety and security. To obtain information on how researchers in the field think about this subject, we questioned the relevance of these concerns. Both the dangers of errors and terrors are addressed, as well as the attitude towards risk-taking in this emerging field of science.
Graph 7.
7. Synthetic biology may enable us to create biological systems artificially. There is a possibility that someone will create something dangerous. Are you afraid that synthetic biology might result in the production of a biological system containing some sort of error, which makes it hazardous?
Yes, I acknowledge this possibility, but think it is not significant because there is sufficient regulation
Yes, I recognize that this is a possible outcome and think new regulations/policies should be enforced, to minimize this possibility
No, I think that researchers approach synthetic biology careful enough already
No, I do not fear this at all
Other:
The hazardous error, as appearing in the question is undefined and can be of any kind. This shows the problem realistically as it is currently not yet defined what the errors can be and how dangerous they can be become. A majority of 79% acknowledges that possibility of a hazardous error occurring sooner or later. 56% thinks that new regulations should be enforced to minimize this risk. Only 11% does not fear this, mostly because they think that researchers approach synthetic biology careful enough already.
The other-answers
Most claim this possibility but believe this is not"

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Welcome to Johns Hopkins iGEM
        The International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM) is an annual intercollegiate challenge that seeks to answer the question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The newly-formed iGEM team at Johns Hopkins is composed of mostly undergraduate students with diverse majors ranging from Materials Science Engineering to Biology. While the team has graduate and faculty input, it is almost totally undergraduate run. The iGEM teams work over the summer at their, respective university, and then attend the iGEM Jamboree in November to present their work. We plan to create novel genetic parts that could be added to the existing iGEM registry of biological parts. The MIT iGEM Registry of Parts is the databank of biological standards to which iGEM teams from 2003 and onward have contributed. Currently, the databank only has 16 yeast ""biobricks"". These biobricks are reporters, tags, plasmids and other useful interchangeable genetic parts, that could one day revolutionize genetic and synthetic biology. By the end of our project, we will have most likely doubled the amount of yeast biobricks in the registry.

D, E and F are Y. lipolytica PO1f cells with the empty pSB1A8YL plasmid, which serves as a control for the GFP signal. Notice that even though the empty vector control shows trace amounts of auto-fluoresence, the strain with the GFP expressing device clearly exhibits higher levels of fluorescence. This proves that our expression system works as intended.

Cryostocks were made from CsgA_His_GFP, CsgA_HA_GFP, CsgA_Mfp3_GFP, CsgA_Mfp5_GFP. The same genes were sent for sequencing.
The CsgA_”tag”_RFP was made in ΔCsgA strains.
CsgEFG 4 was successful and we continued with the gene by ligating it in the plasmids pSB4K5 and pSB1C3. We also ligated Spycatcher_His with pSB1C3.

We did a plasmid isolation on CsgC_low/med/high, CsgBC_low/med/high, and twice of I13504. The plasmids CsgC and CsgBC were restricted with EcoRI-HF & SpeI-HF. The I13504 were restricted with XbaI-HF & PstI-HF. The restrictions were than loaded on a 2% agarose gel, after running the bands were cut out and purified from the gel following protocol.
For the congo red assay’s plates had to be made which include LB, Congo Red  (CR; 50µg/ml), antibiotic, Brilliant blue (BB; 1µg/ml), and rhamnose in increasing concentrations (0.1%, 0.2%, and 1%)
We made 6 different types of plates. All plates contained LB, CR, BB, and Chloramphenicol. Four plates contained different concentrations of rhamnose.  The 5th plate contained IPTG as inducer instead of rhamnose, and the last plate was the control with no additional components.
For the CR assay we transformed pSB4K5_CsgA , I3504 (- control), and CsgA_IPTG (+ control)  into CsgA deficient strains (ΔCsgA).

Analysis of questionnaire content
Which type of cancer treatments do you know?
Figure 8.
During your treatment, what kinds of treatment did you receive?
Figure 9.
Result of question 1 showed that, chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy were the most well-known 3 treatments to patients and their families. Among the three, chemotherapy comprised 88.71%, accounting for the highest number of votes, showing that everyone considers ""cancer"" and ""chemotherapy"" closely linked.
It could be learnt from the question 2 that, chemotherapy plays highest application in cancer clinical treatment, accounting for 87.1% of all investigated patients, which made chemotherapy the most well-known one.
Now when it came to new drugs, it surprised us that around 1/4 of the patients already know about molecular targeted drugs and other new drugs, and 14.52% of patients have received new therapy treatment, showing that patients are no longer unfamiliar with targeted therapy and other new treatments now. Also, doctors would rationally suggest the appropriate patients to actively try new therapies including targeted therapy.
We also learned that, there exists many patients who tried target detection but at last not eligible for targeted therapy; For those who apply targeted therapy, only half of them are receiving good effect, while the other patients choose to give up targeted therapy and regress to traditional treatment due to trivial effect or unaffordable medical expenses.
For different treatment methods, which part do you think is more important?
Figure 10.
The results of question 3 showed that, regardless of treatment types, patients value the efficacy superior to other factors. Many patients and their families told us that they would still strive for an ideal treatment no matter how expensive it might be, as long as it can guarantee efficiency. ‘Side effects’ accounted for the"

The Rz gene encodes for a gene of unknown function and is not necessary for lysis in laboratory conditions unless the cell membrane is stabilized by high concentrations of divalent ions. (1)
Electrical Reporting
When the bacterial cells lyse, the intracellular bulk ionic content of the cells is expelled to the extra-cellular solution, thereby changing the current of the solution.  Our team used both resistance and conductance measurements to measure this change.  The method of current measurement is explained in greater detail in the ""Testing"" page.

Milk Agar Plates
The purpose of milk agar plates is often to detect protease activity, including the activity of keratinases.
A measurement of any baseline protease activity of our parent B. subtilis strain (WB700), which does not endogenously express any keratinases, is desired.
Excess protease activity of our parent B. subtilis strain may prevent our use of milk agar plates as an assay for keratinase expression of our future transformants with the kerA gene.
Therefore, the parent B. subitilis strain (WB700) was streaked on the milk agar plates to observe baseline protease activity that could prevent us from detecting keratinase expression after transformation.
Milk Agar Plates (in LB):
Total volume of  600 ml (makes 20-25 plates)
20g (30*.6) nonfat dry milk powder
500mL 2X LB medium
250mL 2X agar
Ideally, there should be a minimal zone of clearing around our B. subtilis colonies.
Next Steps:
Observe the results of our milk agar plates with B. subtilis colonies

Coupling together Biological Chassis
In order to enable the light based communication between bacteria, we have designed a tertiary cycle of different bacteria chassis, assembling each module of reception and emission to construct a light-based feedback loop of red-green-blue light, which will make the proof of concept of  communication over distance and proper signal decoding.
Tertiary cycle
Coupling together Biological Chassis through Light communication
Chassis Description
First Chassis: inRED-outGREEN
First Chassis: Red Light reception module coupled to Green Light emitter module.
Reception module: Red Light Photosensor cph8
OBJECTIVES
The main goal was the construction of a red light receptor able to indirectly trigger a transcriptional response that in our system corresponds to the expression of luxAB genes (Vibrio fischeri Luciferase).
METHODOLOGY
The red light receptor would be the chimeric protein Cph8(Cph1-EnvZ fusion). Exposure to red light inhibits the activity of the EnvZ histidine kinase domain. When active (in the dark) EnvZ phosphorylates endogenous OmpR, a transcription factor which activates transcription from the OmpC promoter and represses transcription from the OmpF promoter. While under light EnvZ would not phosphorilate OmpR, and OmpF promoter would not be repressed. In order to generate the transcriptional response of the luxAB genes in a light dependent manner, they were coupled to OmpF promoter.
This module of red light reception must be used in E.coli deficient in natural EnvZ to avoid cross-talk in the response.
Cph8 is into bio-brick BBa_I15010, however Cph8 needs another two proteins in order to reach its functional conformation and light sensitivity, these proteins are PcyA and Ho1 and they are coded in bio-brick BBa_K098010. There is another bio-brick which is composed of these two bio-bricks, it is called BBa_M30109.

“Research on mechanisms by which melanocytes migrate from the lower hair follicle to the epidermis has focused on cytokine release by keratinocytes, i.e. leukotriene C4 (LTC4), endothelin-1 (ET-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and stem cell factor (SCF), all of which stimulate melanocyte migration.46 As such, it was found that LTC4 and transforming growth factor a (TGF-a), released from keratinocytes secondarily to UV damage, stimulate melanocyte migration in vitro.47 Attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix and their migration over the matrix are mediated by the binding of domains of the matrix proteins with integrin receptor on the cell surface.48 Cultured melanocytes were shown to have an increased random migration on type IV collagen and to express cell membrane a2b1, a3b1, and a5b1 integrins,49 which were shown to be important in controlling the migration of many cell types; similar roles were attributed to the component proteins of focal contacts such as vinculin, talin, a-actinin, and paxilin, which play a critical role in directed cell migration, adhesion, and normal growth."" - New Insights onTherapy with Vitamin D p "
IIT_Kharagpur,2015,Team:IIT Kharagpur#practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Very valid questions were raised by the audience, and many useful suggestions were   given with regard to how we could improvise our presentation for the Giant Jamboree, and tackle   each of the factors (taken into account by the iGEM judges), so as to give our first time   participation in iGEM the best we have. This meetup was indeed a great learning experience, and   has geared us up for the grand finale at Boston!
Survey Responses:
iGEM mandates organizing of surveys as public outreach practice for all participating teams and  for a good reason. Advancements in Biotechnology in recent years have created a buzz in   blogger communities, newspaper reports and science and technology television shows. A lot of   ideas have faced severe opposition on grounds of ethics, religion and simply uninformed   knowledge. Rise of GMOs in agriculture and medical care brought forward debate on the table   where many raised rejection of these products because of unfamiliar nature and impact of   convoluted ideas presented in scientific fiction. Since all iGEM teams are tinkering with the   biological entities to manufacture artificial life forms which can perhaps be in future transferred   as a routinely used technological platform like smartphones, computers and internet. It is   important that public’s opinion be sought, their contributions considered and their information   gap improved. Inspired by a plethora of surveys conducted by previous iGEM teams we developed some ideas  of our own. Since our project is based upon development of a household level device capable of   detecting microbial food spoilage which itself functions upon a synthetic bacteria (an improved   strain of E.coli DH alpha). The improvement is attributed to introduction of a single plasmid   possessing a luxR­AHL quorum sensing detection system which upon presence of [AHL]   beyond threshold level initiated the transcription of reporter gene and thus determining if food   product in question is spoilt or not.
If we told you we can create artificial organism to detect food spoilage in dairy and meat  products by change of colour, would you like to use it?
If it were an easy, quick and trustworthy biological food spoilage detector, how much would you  spend to buy it?
TO SHOW HOW RELIABLE THE REVIEWS ARE BY THE BACKGROUND OF THE  SURVEY TAKERS
How would you rate your health awareness on a scale of 1­10 (1: lowest to 10: highest)
TO SHOW WHICH SPECIFIC PRODUCT SHOULD WE INITIALLY TARGET  Which is the most common dairy product you use?
Which product do you generally face the problem of food spoilage?

Background
Population expansion continues the daily population growth in the world is about 320 thousands .
Food shortage caused by population growth and the reduction of cultivated land are causing humanity to face a huge crisis.
The situation of water resources is not optimistic.We are faced with a lot of problems,such as Water shortage, water quality deterioration,Poor sanitation,Water quality is declining,Urban water shortage,Insufficient development of hydraulic resources.Mankind faces serious challenges.
Also saline-alkali land is a kind of salt accumulation, which means the salt content in soil affects the normal growth of crops. According to the incomplete statistics of UNESCO and FAO, the area of saline-alkali land in the world is 9543.8 million hectares, of which China is 99.13 million hectares.
So we create a kind of engineering bacteria to solve these problems .On the basis of The mechanism of compatibility substance equilibrium osmotic pressure and Absorption of Na+ and removal of K+ functional proteins ,our bacteria can relieve small areas of high salinity bacteria,so we can alleviate the deterioration of Saline-alkali land conditions and the water pollution situation effectively."
ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," applied to mouse models of intestinal inflammation by enemas (performing by SYSU-MEDICINE, click here to get more information). The IBD mice showed many symptoms, including weight loss and colon length reduction (Fig. 6 and 7). We sacrificed mice after 5-day treatment with hEGF or saline, and measured the weight changes over time, as well as the colon length. We found hEGF, but not saline enema rescued the weight loss phenotype (Fig. 6). In addition, the colon length of hEGF treated group was longer than that of saline (Fig. 7). In aggregate, with the joint efforts from both two iGEM teams, we consolidated that recombinant hEGF protein produced from engineered bacteria can effectively relieve several IBD symptoms in an in vivo model, suggesting engineered bacteria capable of releasing therapeutic agents (such as hEGF) could be an attractive approach to fight against IBD.
Figure 4. Weight changes of IBD mice over time.
Figure 5. The length of colons of IBD mice.
The result shows that recombinant EGF enemas are an effective treatment for intestinal inflammation in mouse and therefore can be potent effector of our project. We use EGF as functional module of all the experiments and designs in the section below.

NO Sensor
Introduction
As the first discovered cellular signaling molecule, Nitric Oxide (NO) plays a vital role in many physiological and pathological processes. There is a significant increase of NO concentration within the guts of IBD patients[1-3]. Thus, NO can be used as targeting molecule for therapeutic agents. In our project, we utilized NO as a signal “marker” to recruit our engineered E.coli to inflammatory positions and as a trigger to initiate expression of a potential therapeutic peptide.

Killswitches
One major risk that the synthetic biology community needs to address is the spread of modified organisms in nature and associated repercusions. Many iGEM teams have addressed this issue by introducing so called killswitches in their design. A killswitch system reduces the risk of bacteria spreading in nature by making it unable to survive without certain conditions. A classical killswitch works by the use of a reagent not present in nature that hinders the expression of a toxin. When the bacteria is released to the enviorment, the reagent is no longer present and the expression of the toxin is released.
While this sounds like a good solution there are flaws in the system. A large problem is mutations and genetic recombination that destroys genetic code for the toxin, and therefore making the bacteria able to survive once again. We would also like to argue that the modified bacteria fitness is so much lower than the wild type that the chance of survival in nature is low. To prove this we preformed a competition test, which showed that our modified bacteria would become outcompeted in a couple of days. Therefore we concluded that a killswitch was not needed in our project.
After a long discussion about killswitches our team reached a couple of conclusions. Our first conclusion is that the best killswitch would be one that removes a function of the bacteria much like BGU_Israels p.a.s.e. 2 part . To gain a new function from scratch would need an horizontal genetransfere from another bacteria, or a massive amount of mutations and recombinations. While to loose a function, like producing the toxin, could happen"
Queens_Canada,2013,Team:Queens Canada#Project#Repel_-_-_TEXT.html,"PT is an enzyme that induces a post-translational modification by adding a pantetheinyl arm to the active site of the carboxylic acid reductase, which is crucial for the formation of a thioester intermediate. NCAR was submitted as a single part by Calgary iGEM 2012, but it is dependent on NPT for full function. We thus sought to link these two enzymes together to improve Calgary's part.
YjgB
YjgB is a non-specific zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenase endogenously expressed in E. coli. It reduces a number of different aldehydes to their corresponding alcohol using NADPH as a co-substrate. In this instance, we planned to use yjgB to reduce isoamyl aldehyde to isoamyl alcohol. We were successful in amplifying yjgB by PCR, cloning it into pSB1C3 with a high constitutive expression cassette, producing high concentrations of protein at the predicted size of 36kDa on an SDS PAGE gel. We verified our biobrick before sending it into the registry and found the sequence to be an exact match for the putative sequence from GenBank. Over the next week we will be using mass spectrometry and an NADPH activity assay to verify the amino acid sequence of the part and quantify its specific activity towards isobutyraldehyde. This is the part we have submitted this year. More details on this can be found on the Parts page on the wiki.
ATF1
Alcohol acetyl-transferase 1 (ATF1) ( BBa_J45014 ) is an enzyme endogenous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and was first used by MIT iGEM 2006. It catalyzes the conversion of isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate, which has a banana smell. This will complete the neutralization of isovaleric acid. We received the ATF1 gene from the Biobrick registry where we transformed and cut the part to be placed in with other genes in our pathway.
Testing Isovaleric Acid
Caenorhabditis elegans has impressive chemotaxis behaviour which is naturally used to seek out food sources. It has been shown to respond to a wide range of both water-soluble and volatile chemicals as either attractants or repellants with a GPCR system.
In order to test the effectiveness of our part, it was necessary to create an assay to test our completed part against. Using the assay methodology pioneered by QGEM 2011 (Margie et."
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Implementation_-_-_TEXT.html,". It is fixated on a wooden board with hot glue.
The idea behind that solution was to grow the moss on a big textile fiber inside the tube or on the tube wall. In this manner many parameters are set and degradation experiments could return significant values.
This ""bioreactor"" is an ideal solution to clean highly contaminated water within a closed system. The big area of contact between the moss and the water enables the use of membrane bound effectors. Compared to the open pond and Remediation Raft implementation, the ratio of contact surface and water volume is relatively high. Therefore a secretion of effectors into the water is not needed.
Open filter on felt base
Figure 11: open pond
Our open pond model consists of meander shaped perspex and two threads to adjust the pond's pitch. Therefore different flow speeds can be implemented. The floor of our open pond is lined with agar to grow the moss on. The pond's lid can be taken off to remove the moss.
The open pond implementation can be used as the last step of a wastewater treatment plant. Even though the contact surface between moss and water might not be as big as in the tube reactor, an implementation with membrane bound effectors is still thinkable. Using membrane bound effectors has the advantage that an emission of effectors into the clean water can be avoided almost entirely. Yet a secretion of effectors to the water may accomplish the biodegradation more effectively.
Our swimming remediation raft
Figure 12: Rendering of our remediation rafts in front of the MIT
Figure 13: 3D-print of our remediation raft
At least there are problems both reactor types don't solve. In both cases upscaling involves a great deal of expense.  The tube reactor guarantees a big contact surface between water and moss which is an asset to the filter properties, but the carbon dioxide exchange is a major problem due to the lack of water-air through mix. To manage big scale filtering on an appropriate area it's inevitable to stack the tubes. That makes extra lighting necessary. The open pond model brings along a smaller water-moss surface, therefore the filter properties may suffer and a wider area is needed. As opposed to the tube reactor the costs are lower and there are no air exchange problems to face.
Slightly we return to the question how a biofilter could look like. It has to be a solution that can be implemented in any scale. The costs must be kept as low as possible. Additionally the energy consumption and maintenance must be kept to a absolute minimum to make it universally usable.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," detect toxic compounds such as the ones illustrated above in liquid waste and contaminated waters and to convert these toxic components into usable hydrocarbons.  FRED, the Functional Robust Electrochemical Detector, is capable of detecting various toxic components simultaneously through an electrochemical response.  Building on the single output biosensor for NAs that we developed last year, we set out to design a multiple output biosensor.  We illustrated how this sensor could work by showing that it has the potential to detect multiple toxins in contaminated water.  Additionally, we developed a miniaturized circuit of the potentiostat for the prototype, validated this device in the wetlab, and designed our own software, which we have made available to everyone.
OSCAR, the Optimized System for Carboxylic Acid Remediation, is designed specifically to target toxins such as naphthenic acids (carboxylic acid-containing compounds), catechol, and nitrogen and sulfur containing heterocyclic compounds. Using the PetroBrick ( BBa_K590025 ) we were able to convert various naphthenic acid based compounds into their hydrocarbon analogs.  Additionally, we wanted to be able to degrade other toxic components of tailings so we used the xylE gene ( BBa_J33204 ) in order to cleave catechol, an abundant intermediate in many toxic areas.  Not only did we set out to break down catechol, but we attempted to see if we could further reduce the toxicity of the catechol breakdown product through use of the PetroBrick.  When we co-culture these genetic circuits we can selectively produce new compounds from catechol compared to with xylE alone, suggesting that the Petrobrick may be used to create new hydrocarbon based compounds! Lastly we wanted to remove sulfur and nitrogen from heterocycles using the dsz and carA operons respectively.  Not only would this improve the quality of fuel produced, but also prevent the production of NOx and SOx during combustion, reducing the amount of air pollution produced from burning fuel.
Taking A Step Back - Human Practices Inspired Our Project!
Before starting our project, the Calgary iGEM team felt it would be important to answer a few questions about how FRED and OSCAR could be applied in the oil and gas sector.
Would oilsands industry be interested in a biosensor and bioreactor for remediation purposes? Yes! Our meeting with the Oilsands Leadership Initiative (OSLI) has affirmed that industry is interested in potentially using synthetic biology for remediation of toxins.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," lesson plan, the activity involved taking a field trip out to a local body of water where students would collect a sample for measurement. Ms. Moriarty raised some obstacles. For example, what happens to students who don't want to go on field trip? Who is going to cover the cost of a substitute teacher, transportation costs, insurance?  In sum, field trips are a logistical nightmare.
So we brainstormed a work-around. Why not have students go out and collect water samples from their local environment as a pre-activity assignment? Not only did this circumvent the difficulty of organizing a field trip, this also gave students a sense of ownership - a sense of individual responsibility that we had previously identified as an important factor in a successful civic engagement initiative.
The second obstacle is the constraints imposed by teaching to a curriculum. Ms. Moriarty mentioned the tight schedules associated with teaching to a curriculum.  However, the AP Biology curriculum is __ into four big ideas and that The College Board recommends two lab activities per big idea. We identified AP Biology standards that the lesson plan could fulfill, allowing our lesson plan to be more easily integrated into an AP Biology curriculum.
Our goal for the wet lab portion of the project was to develop an inexpensive biosensor for triclosan to implement in a high school laboratory setting. The problem we wanted to approach was to find a molecule that could interact specifically with triclosan and whose interaction with triclosan could be coupled to a measurable readout. In trying to understand the biology of triclosan, we discovered that its natural target might fit these requirements:
It is an enzyme (FabI) that is directly inhibited by triclosan and
Whose activity also depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH
In addition, our device requirements needed an enzyme that could also:
over-express well in E.coli,
show activity on its respective substrate at <2nM level of enzyme,
was inhibited by triclosan at the >2nM level of inhibitor, the higher level of TCS found in treated wastewater and toxic to algae [18]
While the FabI class of enzymes are promising, it was unclear which of the thousands of enzymes we should use since all Bacteria and Eukaryotes have a fabI gene.

A glycerol stock of pCh13V (hph Gibson) was created, then miniprepped for later site directed mutagenesis of hph (which has both E and P cut sites).  Digestions of pC13M (crtB) and pC13E (T7 polymerase) were column purified and quantified.  The PCR of pC13K with GC and non-GC trials was redone, since the fragment was of the incorrect length during gel imaging yesterday - goal is to ligate to pAK13D.  Following the PCR, a gel was run which showed no bands. Perhaps the polymerase was forgotten? Another PCR of pC13K was performed and run on gel. A band showed at exactly 1.8kb as expected.  pC13M was ligated to pAK13D, placing crtB downstream of the T7 promoter.  pC13E was ligated to pC13P, placing the T7 polymerase gene downstream of PtrpC (a native fungal promoter) - this is the first part of our genetic circuit with the second being the T7 promoter upstream of various genes (GFP and RFP for diagnostic purposes - to quantify promoter functionality and the carotenoid genes for proof of concept).  Plates of pC13AH (T7 + crtY) had many colonies, so they were restreaked, and colony PCRs were run while cultures were made of some of the colonies.  A gel of the PCRs was run (image name was pC13AHcolonypcr7-17-13); gel was inconclusive (correct band was accompanied by strong incorrect band at 1kb). Will test again using digest screen of minipreps tomorrow.  Heat shock transformed pT7 + GFP (pAK13D + pC13Z), PtrpC + GFP (pC13P + pC13Z), pT7 + BAR (pAK13D + pCp13X), PtrpC + BAR (pC13P + pCp13X) ligations into chemically competent E. coli.

Us
Our team is proud to say that we almost did all the work on our own: finding sponsors, making communication tools about our project, finding the protocols to use and optimize them. However, we needed occasional assistance during our project, therefore we required help from different people: scientists, administrators, specialists and even lay persons. We would like to warmly thank all these persons for their contribution and support. Our project moved forward because they offered their help.
Ulule: a crowdfunding website
Ulule is the first European crowdfunding website. We have posted our SubtiTree project on this site to collect funds for paying the Giant Jamboree fee. The collect was successful: we had 53 supporters and € 1,787 collected! We warmly thank all the supporters, it was very encouraging to see that people mobilized for us!

Rainbofilm
Biofilm has been our team's long-standing interest. Though our motivation to study biofilm at first is on its effective elimination, a review paper on biofilm totally changed our view of it and led us into a new direction. When something as difficult to eliminate and natural as biofilm is, can we make use of it instead of destroying it? Following this strand of thought, we started to investigate the advantages brought by the advent of biofilm for the bacteria, such as its increased resistance to harsh conditions under which normal cells cannot survive. Another fascinating fact about biofilm is that cells are differentially expressed to form different layers within biofilm.
We continued to develop our project from two ideas based on the background. The first is based on biofilm's differentiated expression. We hope to construct a three-layer stratified expression system within biofilm in response to oxygen concentration gradient. This could serve as a prototype for future construction simply by replacing the reporter gene with user's target genes. The second idea stems from the biofilm's strong resistance to bad growth conditions, such as when surrounded by high concentrations of heavy metal. We want to engineer and develop our biofilm into the second generation of biosensor. As a natural concentration gradient of heavy metal is formed along the depth of biofilm, with the same threshold for detection constructed in all the cells, the whole biofilm system would be able to detect different levels of the heavy metal concentration in its surrounding environment.
Gut Flora
We believe engineering gut bacteria is a promising field in the future, for bacteria are easy to be engineered compared with engineering human cell, and human gut is naturally inhabited by many different bacteria. We could construct a gut bacteria kit for either supplying nutrients such as vitamins or synthesizing and delivering drugs. We're highly motivated to do this project, for it offers a good solution to alleviate the current famine and diseases brought by malnutrition in many developing countries around the world. The drug delivery, adapted to host's circadium rhythm and physiological state, would be an ideal approach to cure some chronic diseases. However, we didn't choose to further develop Gut Flora Kit as our team's project this year, because we have limited knowledge and experience in gut flora and intestinal environment.

Our Improved Part
BBa_K2557001
The Peking iGEM 2017 team identified the properties of Bxb1 gp35 (BBa_K2243012) in E. coli. We obtained the sequence of this part and requested the plasmid from them. Since our chassis organism is mammalian cell, we optimized the codon and then we identified BBa_K2557001 in detail in HEK 293T cells. Although Bxb1 works well in HEK 293T cells, we did not repeat the activity reported by Peking iGEM 2017 team in E. coli.
Characterization
Fig.2 Function verification of reversal efficiency and threshold characteristics of different recombinase in HEK 293 T Cells.
(A)Fluorescence microscope observation of HEK 293T undergone different experimental treatments.
(B)The statistical chart of average fluorescence intensity of cells shows that the cells with Bxb1 recombinase have a higher fluorescence intensity than those with TP901 recombinase under the same promoter strength and recombinase concentration. However, if the concentration of recombinase is low, there is no significant difference in fluorescence intensity.
(C)The statistics of the proportion of fluorescent cells show that the proportion of fluorescent cells has a sudden jump discontinuity between low concentration and high concentration of Bxb1 and TP901 recombinases. Similar results were obtained in all three repetitions.
The results of image B show that the reverse efficiency of Bxb1 recombinase is higher than TP901 recombinase under the same promoter strength and recombinase concentration. However, if the concentration of recombinase is low, there is no significant difference in fluorescence intensity. The results of the image C show that Bxb1 and TP901 recombinases have a threshold property. So, the proportion of fluorescent cells have a jump discontinuity between low concentration and high concentration of recombinase.

The Idea
Using a network of E. coli to form a smart material
for low concentration detection!
Bio-detectors have been a big part of the iGEM projects ever since the competition first started, it's easy to see why: One of the simplest systems to build using our current tools for synthetic biology is a simple Input→Output ""linear"" (Promoter→Signaling Gene) bio-detector but this method has a major flaw:
In order to get a detection signal that's visible to the naked eye, we must have a LOT of bacteria change color (or any other signal). With the linear approach we find ourselves needing high concentration of the detected material for our system to be effective!
Now, while this issue is far from new and various teams have already tried to tackle this exact problem before, our team worked for a year on a new approach utilizing things like quorum sensing for inter-bacteria communication and signal amplification which is possible thanks to our creation of a synthetic bio-film using a revolutionary organic molecule called Azobenzene, resulting in what we refer to as a
'smart, self assembling material'
How It works
Alpha System
Alpha System
The Alpha System is the preliminary design we planned for a biosensor that can detect various materials at low concentrations.
The main goal of our design is to make the bio-sensor capable of detecting harmful substances at far lower concentrations than existing bio-sensors. To"

""Ethics is knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is right to do."" - Potter Stewart
Ethics
Figure 1: Socrates practicing dialectics.
When working in the field of synthetic biology one must have in mind that especially this field of science has many opponents. Here are some of the most common arguments against evolving genetically modified organisms (GMO), which is the main discipline in synthetic biology; -We must not play God, -it is not natural and -we cannot foresee the consequences. Let us take a closer look and try to find out whether or not they have any substantial weight. This will be played out as a dialectic dialog. Dialectics is the philosophical discipline fathered by Socrates where understanding and agreement comes through dialogue not through analyzing syntax, semantics or theoretical systems.
Why not ignore any arguments? When people use the “God” argument, the biggest mistake is to wright it of as medieval and out of touch with the modern world. If one is interested in being taken serious, one must also take all others serious. In a proper debate, which involves solving ethical issues every single argument made by capable persons who are to be influenced by the outcome of the decision, must be taken serious. "

At last, I would like to thank some people for their help, solicitousness and criticism. These are especially: Jonas for his annihilating criticism; Tatjana and Hasan for their effort to improve my BSE (bad simply English); Lorenz for his scientific review; Lea for some great pictures in the work break; Laura, Jan, Dominik, Phillip and Rebecca for answering any silly question (really fluorescent mice?); the British Columbia iGEM team for allocating their word clouds and, of course, last but not least, Rike for her being there when ever I needed help (stay a porn-vampire!). Thanks all of you!
 
Philosophical Reflection
One may wonder why I am here and why you, my dear reader, have to read my lines. I am not normal. Well, concerning iGEM and the variety of young, unusual students I have to explain why I am even more abnormal. I study Philosophy and, indeed, philosophy is quite different from synthetic biology. In Spring 2010 I got involved in a strange thing called iGEM. I listened, got interested and ... was involved. Once within, the question came up what a philosopher could do in the evolving field of SynBio. There were so many interesting tasks and topics which occured after a first introduction! But after all, the human practice team and I agreed in two budding issues, one more ethical, the other more philosophical.

Module 3: Genome Deletion
Module 3 is the final module of the system. The E.ncapsulator has successfully completed its job of protein production (module 1) and encapsulation (module 2).  Now, it needs to be prepared to be converted into a safe pill carrying the protein of interest.  This is done by removing the genetic material which renders the cell inanimate.
Rationale
Module 3 acts as a reusable module for removal of genetic material without toxic effects.
Removal of genetic material by the use of restriction enzymes prevents the accidental transfer of DNA to other gut microflora, which could lead to development of virulence. This module is a highly reusable for any chassis system where there is a need to remove genetic material after genes are expressed.
Our pill is to be consumed within the human body.  This rules out the toxin-generating methods to induce cell death. Restriction enzymes are the preferred method for inducing cell death as they ar relatively harmless outside of the cell.
Theory
Engineering cell death
Due to the possible pathogenicity and health concerns, cell death must occur before the pill is ready for consumption.  Therefore, the method chosen needs to be foolproof and have failsafe mechanism.
  About our genetic circuit
Under the control of a thermoinducible promoter system ( K098995 ), when the temperature is raised, the promoter is activated and restriction enzymes are produced.  There is a safeguard here as the temperature of the human body is around 37°C, so that even if the bacteria are not killed by the heat pulse, they will be killed after they enter the human body.
The restriction enzymes DpnII ( K200009 ) and TaqI ( K200010 ) are produced.   This duplicity of restriction enzymes ensures that even when one enzyme becomes mutated and dysfunctional, the other restriction enzyme still works well by itself. Therefore, by using two restriction enzymes, we can be more certain that our DNA has been digested.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," were measured in biological triplicates and after 2 h one set of triplicates of each of the three systems were induced with 50 µl 100mM IPTG in their 50 ml culture (500 ml shake flasks). Fluorescence measurement was performed with the Synergy Mx from BioTek with an excitation wavelength of 496 ± 9 nm and emission wavelength of 516 ± 9 nm. The following graph shows the resulting fluorescence adjusted for the measured optical density to account for difference in growth of the cultures and to only show the fluorescence per cell.
Comparison of the fluorescence adjusted for OD of I20260, B0015 and the double plasmid system K1319014 + K1319008
After induction with IPTG after 2 h the double plasmid system produced a fast fluorescence response with an over 10-fold increase compared to the non induced state. I20260 served as positive control and B0015 as negative control.
The strong fluorescence response (10-fold increase) after induction with IPTG shows the functionality of GFP inside the fusion protein. After the induction a TEV protease is produced which is specifically cutting the recognition sequence build inside the linker (K1319016) between GFP and K1319002. The cutting results in a separation of GFP and REACh2 resulting in a collapse of the FRET system between the two. This results in a fluorescence signal of GFP due to the fact that the emission is no longer absorbed by REACh2 and emitted as heat but rather as fluorescence with a wavelength of 511 nm. The overall fluorescence of the double plasmid system reaches the fluorescence level of the positive control indicating a total clavage of all fusion proteins by the produced TEV protease.
The very low fluorescence in the non induced double plasmid system of K1319014 and K1319008 shows the functionality of K1319002. As established before, the GFP is being expressed correctly inside the fusion protein, therefore the reduction in fluorescence in the non induced double plasmid system is a direct result of the quenching ability of K1319002. The quenching, after subtraction of the background fluorescence, reduced the fluorescence of GFP by a factor of 10. This also includes the slight leakiness of the TEV protease.
To eliminate the effect of the leakiness of the K1319008 construct in determining the quenching ability of K1319002, K1319014 was also compared against I20260 and B0015 on its own under the same condition as above (again in"
UNIFI,2017,Team:UNIFI#Delft_-_-_TEXT.html," interesting speakers talked about Synthetic Biology and how they implement this in their field. The first speaker was Dr. Cees Dekker, a TU Delft distinguished professor who gave a presentation entitled “From measuring on single molecules to building a cell from molecular components”, where he showed examples of his journey from single-molecule biophysics to his group’s recent ambition to build a cell from molecular components; his own efforts focus on establishing an in vitro system to realize synthetic cell division.  Then Dr. Denis Murphy, Professor of Plant Technology and Head of Biology Research and Head of Genomics & Computational Biology Research Group at the University of South Wales gave a talk on “Using bioinformatics & big data analysis in genetic technologies for medicine & agriculture”,  surveying the growth of mega-data and the challenges it brings along, how reliable knowledge and wisdom can be created during research and some of his group’s work on the use of systems biology in cancer research.  And last but not least, Dr. Dirk Stemering, Professor at the University of Twente and Researcher at Rathenau Institute, spoke about the involvement of Rathenau Institute with iGEM and the stakeholder dialogue workshop they organized on antibiotic resistance as a societal challenge and the role of synthetic biology in this discussion.
The topics were really interesting and current so that lots of students at the end of the symposium asked questions. Between the second and the third lecture all the students together had packed lunch, offered by TU Delft, and Italian students seized the opportunity to know the other teams. They were fascinated by the other European students and the passion for science they shared. In the afternoon, after Dr. Stemerding’s lecture, all the teams started a poster presentation session, to find out what everyone was up to and to get discussions going. About thirty teams participated, with very innovative projects. Everyone was surprised and at the same time curious of UniFI project: a mix of science and art which fit well the spirit of Italy. In the end of the day, they had a nice barbeque organized by TU Delft students in the sport center of the university. But fun wasn’t over yet, since after the barbeque they all went to a pub for a typical dutch beer with the rest of the students. On Saturday 8th all teams were invited to join in some fun activities in Delft, but the italian team wasn’t able to take part in any of them, for they had to catch the return flight.  According to the students, it was an important experience they couldn’t have passed up because it gave them the"
Harvey_Mudd,2012,Team:Harvey Mudd#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," None of our constructs significantly affect pathogenicity or evolutionary advantage of the bacteria.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee or review board at your institution? If yes, what do they think of your project?
Our school biosafety committee says that our project ""falls under the general biosafety umbrella of work already going on in those lab spaces"". In other words, our methods, protocols, and safety procedures are all in use in these labs already, and have been previously confirmed as safe.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?
The best way to guarantee safety is to stick with standard procedures. The more people who have used a protocol, the less chance that there is an unknown risk. Since our innovation is in computational parts, we stuck with time-tested protocols for all of our wetlab work. We depart from standards only in designing our new promoter/repressor pairs, and we are then careful to make sure the new sequence does not code for protein.

     1.Training for iGEM
The iGEM program requires the interdisciplinary abilities. To approach this purpose, we designed a series of trainings including computer programming, biological experiment skills, etc. (The following photographs illustrates the process) The collegiate team from Zhejiang University provides an opportunity which shows us how the biological experiments run.
     2. Pre-research of project
We distributed questionnaires and conducted survey in order to learn about the current knowledge of local peoples towards cultural artifacts in Hangzhou. The following diagrams are analyzed by the data. According to the data, the current situation of protection and renovating towards cultural artifacts and synthetic biology does not have bright prospects. The lack of attentions in civilians can cause the enormous negative effects on research and the practical usage, so we organized a series of activities to publicize the cultural artifacts in Hangzhou, the synthetic biology.(more details in Publicity)
     3.Publicity
(1)To acquaint students synthetic biology, our team’s human practice group publicize this subject several times during the summer break in our city including the danger and benefits of transgenosis food that was familiar and relevant to the citizens.  Furthermore, we upload the basic synthetic biology knowledge in our school’s official website for months and update the latest information or the experimental knowledge at a time period.
(2)We hold a presentation in our school to introduce the iGEM to our successors. It consists that the general ideas of iGEM, the specific parts which are totally different from the biology competition in China, the judgements, also Q&A section and the advantages of taking this competition. Our team leader Andrew Luo gave an excellent lecture.
(3)As we mentioned before, to introduce local citizens the importance of cultural artifacts in this city,  we sent out the specialized post cards with 7 different kinds of landscape seals and our team seal in order to publicize our project and the local artifacts protection at the same time.

What we created was not only an edutainment product, but also a carrier of iGEM and synthetic biology which output influence no matter where it is. It can be applied in most situation such as classes, entertainment, activities, or even in our daily communication.
Many teams were amazed at our innovative idea. We are also invited as the only team in CCiC (the largest iGEM Conference in China) to share our experience these years.
Gene Card online
Gene Card Online is an online board game developed by Team UESTC-China, realizing the organic combination of synthetic biology and board game. The most basic elements of synthetic biology are clearly delivered to people with the combination of restriction enzyme, DNA ligase, vector, target gene, bacteria and PCR. People can easily understand what synthetic biology is in the process of enjoying the game.
Considering many limitations of paper board games, we decided to put them on the Internet this year to further realize the goal of promoting the development of the project. Nowadays, any place with access to the Internet can use Gene Card Online at any time for various purposes, such as teaching, popular science and entertainment.
Gene Card still seems to have a bright future.

Starting a New Team
Early on this season, we got to bring our iGEM love and experience to Consort Alberta. Through workshops both in Calgary and Consort, as well as frequent Skype meetings, we helped Consort launch their first ever High school iGEM team. In addition to teaching lab techniques and how to use the registry, we helped team to brainstorm and troubleshoot their project. The team had a great year, even bringing home the award for ‘Best Human Practices Advance’ at the High School Jamboree.

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,"ire-Delory, Mrs Anne Cambon-Thomsen and Simon Desbois who were with us throughout our ethical thinking process and thus helped us build the foundations of our project.
A special thank to Pierrick Montagne, Gilles Truan and Théo Depresle for their beautiful pictures, your skill in capturing moments are amazing.
Project support
To implement our project, we needed to understand the functioning of a beehive and the bees behaviour. Christian Boucher is a researcher from a famous French lab and has some beehives. He agreed to meet us and was able to inform us about bees and to advise us on the molecular biology part of our project. He was a helpful link between bees and biology, and we thank him for his availability.
We owe M. Gilles Truan our deepest gratitude for his availability, and his unreserved support on synthetic biology and genetic regulation.
To analyse the supernatant of our cultures (and particularly to try to detect our compounds of interest), we used the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) of the Metatoul platform. We would like to thank them warmly for making this state-of-the-art technology available to us.
Also thanks to Mrs Lindsay Peyriga, who showed our team members how to correctly prepare NMR samples, how to run acquisitions and helped them with the interpretation of the results.
Attract support
We based part of our strategy on the demonstration made in the US8647615 patent that butyric acid has an attractant power towards varroas. We thus decided to design the butyrate production pathway for our attraction module, and we acknowledge that this disables us from commercializing our project.
To design the butyrate production pathway, we met with M. Philippe Soucaille, teacher at the engineering school INSA and researcher who shared his experience in metabolic engineering.
Special thanks to Mrs Angélique Vétillard and her PhD student Vincent Piou from the laboratory Vacbio EA 4357 linked to the University Jean François Champollion for their warm welcome in their lab to experiment varroa attraction and eradication.
M. Patrick Chekroun for the realization of the T-tube test we designed to experiment varroa attraction at the Vacbio laboratory.
Eradicate support
To design the eradication module of our genetic system, we met with Mrs Nathalie Gorret who gave us interesting information about pflA and pflB genes. Moreover, we wanted our bacteria to survive during two weeks but did not know how to proceed. Mrs Gorret was the one who first talked to us about the Bio"

L-Form simulation
Started programming L-form genomic fusion simulation using Java. So far everything went smoothly, we have some bacteria basic movement mechanics, and soon will be looking into how to make two bacteria fuse when they meet together.
E.coli Innoculation
We innoculated the transformed E.coli (pGFPrrnb) that we did yesterday into LB.
Cloning switch brick
Aim:
Cloning the switch brick into pSB1C3.
Methods:
We extracted our pSB1C3 plasmid from the BioBrick distribution kit. Through the use of restriction enzymes (XbaI and SpeI) we cut out the RFP insert from the MCS of the plasmid. We ran the digested product on a 0.8% agarose gel and purified the DNA (plasmid backbone) through the use of [gel extraction purification].
We checked the concentration of the purified DNA through nanodrop (spectrophotometer).
Results and Discussion:
It turned out that no DNA was present in the solution. This was due to too much elution buffer that was added to elute the DNA. This resulted in a very low concentration, and we will not be able to continue the [ligation protocol]. This protocol will need to be repeated the next day. Please refer to August 5th

To interpret the above data, we first compare the constants of dissociation, Kd. In this context, Kd represents [Gzmbfree][Inhibitor]/[Gzmbinhib-Inhibitor] at equilibrium (Bisswanger, 2008); therefore, a lower Kd would represent better inhibition: more bound GzmB compared to free GzmB.
We can also analyze the Ka, the association constant. Ka is the inverse of Kd, and can be found as [Gzmbinhib-Inhibitor]/ [Gzmbfree][Inhibitor]. This represents the relative amount of bound molecules, so that a higher Ka represents stronger binding affinity. Compared to the mouse inhibitor Serpina3n, human ACT3m has a lower Kd and a higher Ka, which suggests stronger inhibition. This conclusion is in agreement with Marcet-Palacios et al., where this novel inhibitor was also compared to mouse Serpina3n (2014).
The Hill constant may also be considered to analyze the nature of the inhibitor-GzmB complex. With n>1, Serpina3n is likely to bind to multiple sites on GzmB (Weiss et al., 1997). ACT3m, in contrast, has a n<1, meaning that it likely binds competitively to selective and perhaps singular sites. This information is interesting; taking the association constants into account, this means that despite less opportunity to bind, ACT3m still acts as a better inhibitor than Serpina3n.
Inhibitor Concentration Calculator
The following equations were developed with a question in mind:
How much inhibitor is needed to bring GzmB levels back to normal?
Since there are many diseases that cause inflammation, and thus increased levels of GzmB, we created a calculator to determine the amount of treatment needed for any GzmB-related diseases. The model can show the relative percent decrease of GzmB as the inhibitor concentration increases. A patient could obtain information regarding their condition and calculate the amount of treatment needed.
Given that
, reversing the parameters yields the equivalent function of

. This equation calculates the inhibitor concentration that corresponds to a certain relative level of GzmB.

The Biosynthesis of Cannabis - a little more detail
In Fig. 1 you will have seen the names and acronyms of a number of compunds, which probably say nothing about the actual pathway! So I'll try to decribe it more clearly here.
As shown in Fig. 1, there are two compounds whose expression (the amount of them that is produced in the leaf) is controlled by a specific area of the Cannabis plant genome called locus A. These two compounds acts as the ""core"" upon which other things are added, later on in the pathway. Divarinic acid is identical to olivetolic acid, except for a hydrocarbon chain coming off the phenolic ring, which in the latter is slightly longer:
As the carboxyl group (-COOH) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) are found on neighbouring carbons, decarboxylation can occur upon heating in the absence of enzyme. Therefore, the pathway shown in Fig. 1 assumes that decarboxylation occurs before the addition of geranyl pyrophosphate. Fig. 3 shows one of the routes through the pathway, using the skeletal structures of the compounds involved:

We have biobricks!
This morning we had the sequence data back from some of our mini-preps and the sequences showed that we have successfully cloned 4 of our inserts into the pSB-1C3 shipping vector.
The sequence data was interesting to analyse; from the 8 samples we sent, 1 was the wrong insert all together (the sequence aligned with LsrGFP and not Lsr Holin, indicating some haphazard gel loading), Dispersin B with DspA secretion tag has a 2964P->T point mutation and another was completely missing the insert. For the latter two of these, we're sequencing different mini-prep samples tomorrow. For another of the samples, only the forawrd read was successful and so we've asked them to repeat the reverse read. The other 4 were successful and the biobricks are"

In case we can show a proof-of-concept in our iGEM project, we could close the loop in green algae culturing, so all fractions are used. Prof. dr. Timmermans informed us  that there is still a long way to go before culturing green algae on the open sea is reality. On top of that, the separation of the different fractions (proteins, carbohydrates, etc.) proves to be difficult. All in all, the potential upside is enormous, once the research on culturing green algae has developed further. We are then able to tap into an infinite source of cellulose and use all fractions of the cultured green algae. A win-win situation.
NIOZ has not found a purpose for their cellulose yet
RIVM
The Dutch Governmental Institute for Public Health and Environment ( RIVM ) wants to stimulate Dutch iGEM teams to consider the broader effects of their project on the world surrounding us. This includes investigating ethical, societal, and technical aspects concerning the project. They asked us to adhere to the Safe-by-Design concept, which states that safety should be an integral part of each project, to be considered during every phase and aspect from the early beginnings all the way to the end.
The first meeting was with Korienke Smit, a policy advisor, and Niek Savelkoul, a trainee and member of the 2017 iGEM Wageningen team. This meeting took place on june 20th, 2018.      During this meeting we discussed our initial ideas about how we are planning to implement the Safety-by-Design concept into our project. We got some valuable tips and input, especially about the upscaling of our process, which brings a whole set of new challenges with it, something we had not considered until then. We were planning to use antibiotics, which might be difficult to upscale safely regarding antibiotic resistance issues. Styrene is toxic, and having massive bioreactors filled with styrene-producing yeast strains could be a danger to public health. We were already considering to use CRISPR-Cas9 to remove the need for antibiotics, but these remarks contributed to our decision to make the switch. Another factor was our plan to run evolutionary experiments to improve yields. Korienke had suggestions for this as well, and suggested looking into the 2017 Heidelberg iGEM team, that came up with a clever way to accelerate evolution using quickly-mutating phages.      At the end of the conversation we received some advice on how to pitch our idea: our main advantage"

Also in September, we attended a regional meet up held by UCAS, through which we laid the foundation for further collaborations among iGEM teams in Beijing and Tianjin.
During the Chinese national holiday, Tsinghua and Tsinghua-A team held an exhibition on synthetic biology at Chinese Science and Technology Museum (CSTM). By introducing visitors to microorganisms and microscopes we gave them a basic understanding of microbiology. We provided graphs of bacteria for children and encouraged them to design their own bacteria. We even provided florescent bacteria with GFP, RFP and YFP plasmids for children to draw on LB plates. Later we sent the pictures of their bacterial painting back. We also talked about the mechanism of allergy which is closely related to Tsinghua A's project. Members from both teams had a great time and we are looking forward to further collaborations.
Integrated Human Practice
At the beginning of our project, we were aiming to design a bacterial neon light. In order to maximize fluorescent signal we designed a positive feedback loop. However our pilot study indicated a massive leakage problem, and this positive feedback circuit was entirely out of control. Trying to fix this we asked around in a regional meet up in Peking University. We weren’t surprised when we found out that half of the teams suffer from promotor leakage and nearly all of them have troubles controlling expression. So we shifted our attention to a more practical issue and designed Neon Coli, the Necessary Expression Only E. coli. We improved the original positive feedback circuit and made it tunable, which enables it to optimize expression, facilitate signal detection and assist in synthetic biology computations. Throughout the course of our project, we used surveys and interview sessions to evaluate how our progress is going to best fulfill its purpose.
According to the questionnaires we sent out at the CCiC, most teams included bacteria as their chassis, and nearly half of them used quorum sensing in their project. Many of the teams have introduced signal amplification/termination process into their circuits. From these statistics we realized that some of the problems such as leakage and lack of robustness are universal. Some teams provided their solutions, like changing the vector/sensor/promoter and decreasing plasmid copy number, but most admitted that they had no idea if these methods would work. This is why NEON system is important: it might provide a solution to improve unsatisfying expression results. Finally, nearly all of the teams agreed that our project would be one prospecting solution to their problems. To us, this was a great encouragement"

University of Virginia Mid-Atlantic Meetup
Over the summer a portion of the team traveled down to UVA to present our project in front of five other teams: William and Mary, University of Maryland, UNCA, UVA, and University of Georgia. We collaborated with other teams by answering questions and brainstorming ideas about how our project correlates to others. Here we also learned about medal requirements needed for participating in iGEM as well as the potential and opportunities that come with being an iGEM team. After the group presentations we heard from professionals in the science field who later in life took their iGEM projects and turned them into businesses. THis opportunity was one of the most inspiring events that our team attended because it got us motivated and excited for the future of iGEM at the University of Delaware.

Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!

Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
