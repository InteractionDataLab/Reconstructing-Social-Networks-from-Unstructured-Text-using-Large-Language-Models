Jean Cury
1st year master student in Biology at the ENS Paris and UPMC, Paris 6
My current internship is about studying a synthetic recombination site of the integron system, at Pasteur Institute, Paris. This gives me a good insight into synthetic biology, and motivates me to participate in iGEM. What attracts me also in doing iGEM is the interdisciplinary team, the team reflexion, and everything about creating a team, organizing it, learning from other fields represented. Indeed, I truly believe that learning from your friends is a good way to improve your knowledge and satisfy your curiosity. In addition to my internship, I'm following bioinformatics and arabic courses.

Safe Lab Work
Besides of ensuring a safe project design, we are solicitous about our biosafety and general safety in our lab work. All secondary schools use biology laboratories with biosafety level 1 [4] . We also believe that safe lab practices are important, so we emphasize safety through maintaining a high level of personal hygiene and apply good microbiology techniques [5] . We wear lab coats and gloves while doing any experiment and wash our hands with soap before leaving the laboratory. To prevent any bacteria being left on the bench after experiments, we always use alcohol to wipe the bench thoroughly before we leave. (While doing any experiment with e.coli, we ensure the bacteria do not expose to the environment by setting up a sterile space using a Bunsen burner and working in the heated area. Also to keep the bacteria away from the open environment, we seal every used petri dishes with parafilm before long term storage.) We received safety training when joining the team, topics include risk assessment, general precautions, fire precautions, handling chemical spills, disposal of chemical wastes and experiments on biotechnology. Details of the training can be found in here . which we follow to the letter.
Other Safety Concerns
Some steps of our experiments require the use of UV light, whereupon exposure to UV radiation may result in sunburn, pigmentation of skin and slight discomfort [7] . To ensure our safety, we make sure that any parts of our body won’t be directly exposed to UV radiation; we will place a UV filter board [8] between us and the source of UV radiation so that it will be blocked from us.

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Ethics macro_-_-_TEXT.html," essence or autonomy of life.
Nevertheless, the level of artificialness or naturalness is difficult to define. Currently, synthetic biology has a metabolic engineering character, with a focus on understanding and using nature and natural systems. Making complete artificial systems is still in a distant future. This does not mean that one should not consider moral issues related to artificial life, but one should also realize that the current ethical issues in genetic engineering techniques cannot be omitted just because other issues are arising in synthetic biology. There are some implicit assumptions in synthetic biology that need to be considered.
3.4 Implicit assumptions in synthetic biology: forgetting what’s currently important?
Between 2005 and 2008 several papers, fact sheets and reports , , , ,  have been published on the ethical and social reflections related to synthetic biology. Within most of these publications the authors elaborate on the following four issues:
Biosafety: health and environment
Biosecurity: biological weapons and terrorism
Intellectual property rights: commercialization and globalization
Artificial life: ethical considerations
One should notice that the issues raised here relate to synthetic biology applications in higher levels of artificialness than is currently being researched in most instances. Of course one should realize that there is only a vague difference between advanced metabolic engineering and the more artificial levels of synthetic biology, but what is often not considered in modern papers on the ethics of synthetic biology, are issues related to metabolic engineering practices like genetic engineering.
It seems that implicitly stakeholders working in the (self proclaimed?) field of synthetic biology live under the impression that ethical considerations that relate to synthetic biology should be considered in stead of ethical considerations relating to recombinant DNA techniques. Skipping this field, where there is already much debate on what is or should be allowed from a moral point of view, seems to be the easiest thing to do. But in this case we are only omitting some relevant issues that have not really been solved yet. Of course, this also depends on the application area of the application. E.g. in Europe the GM food debate stirs many souls, while GM techniques in medical research are much more appreciated. Discussion topics that seem to be missing in synthetic biology are highly related to ethical issues in nanotechnology and biotechnology. Some relevant issues and related ethical questions are enlisted below:
Public knowledge and involvement in scientific development: should the public be informed about science?
Public awareness and appreciation of the technology: would a highly informed public be more appreciative of scientific developments?
Trust of all stakeholders in government, governance and enforcement: do NGOs, the public, scientists, etc. have faith in regulations?
Trust between the stakeholders: can opposing parties in ("
Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Human Containment_-_-_TEXT.html," In the absence of antibiotic and presence of competition (through other soil bacteria, fungi and protozoans) we would expect the bacteria to mutate the plasmid as it presents an added metabolic burden. The bacteria were incubated for over six weeks to check for plasmid retainment. Each wee, cultures were grown up in medium containing both ampicillin and kanamycin to check for bacteria resistant to these two antibiotics. The grown-up cultures were plated out and checked for fluorescence, which would only be present in bacteria containing the plasmid. To ensure that we were not growing up antibiotic-resistant soil bacteria, we grew up cultures from non-inoculated soil as negative controls.
3. Result
After seven weeks, the bacteria could be recovered from sterile and non-sterile media and were shown to express GFP. Plasmid DNA was extracted from cultures showing E. coli-like appearance by miniprep. This DNA was digested with EcoRI and PstI to check for presence of the sfGFP insert. Bacteria from sterile and non-sterile soil contained the unmutated GFP insert, as confirmed by sequencing. In addition, there were bacteria showing different colony morphologies present on the plate inoculated from non-sterile soil. However, these are likely to be present due to the depletion of antibiotics in the plate by the resistant bacteria. A miniprep confirmed that these bacteria do not contain a plasmid.  (For more extensive results on this experiment, please see our Gene Guard page.)

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Wednesday 9/7
Tet construct:  Plasmid pSB1C3 was concentrated before it was digested with the enzymes Xbai and SpeI. The plasmid was ligated with digested PCR1, PCR2 and PCR3.
Lac Construct:
Pcon_rbs_LacI(withoutLVA)_term, BBa_C0012, was digested with EcoRI and SpeI
GFP, BBa_E0840 in plasmid has beed ligated
LacP, BBa_R0010, was ligated with our C part in plasmid
The ligated products were transformed.
Thursday 10/7
The transformation from yesterday was successful. Colony PCR was performed on all transformations. The result showed that part B (Bba_R0010) and C (Bba_E0840) had been ligated successfully. Unfortunately nothing could be seen on the gel with regard to PCR1, PCR2 and PCR3. Therefore a new colony PCR was performed on different colonies with PCR1, PC2 and PCR3. The gel showed no or no proper bands, so we concluded, that a religation must have happened. Therefore we checked our enzymes by digesting pSB1C3. Here we could conclude that something must be wrong with XbaI, as it does not cut.
An ON was made containing BC construct.
Friday 11/7
XbaI was doublechecked and we found out, that the enzyme does not cut when using the green Fast Digest buffer.
We puridied our PCR1 (Pcon_rbs_BBa_C0040(LVAtag_removed)_term) and PCR3 (Ptet_BBa_E0840) and digested these while using the colorless buffer.  Furthermore PCR1, PCR2 and PCR3 were amplified by a PCR reaction.
ON containing BC contruct was miniprepped and run on a gel together with C in plasmid. The length of the bands were compared and seemed appropiate.  Anyway, to be sure, a PCR was made on the BC construct. This time the gel showed too short bands, which could mean, that the C in plasmid has religated.

Fig 1. Selective metal ion recognition by metalloregulatory proteins. Adapted from Peng Chen and Chuan He, 2008.
    It is notable that the MerR family is a group of transcriptional activators with similar N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding regions and C-terminal effector binding regions that are specific to the effector recognized. Interestingly, the subgroup shows sequence similarity in the C-terminal effector binding region as well as in the N-terminal region, but it is not yet clear how metal discrimination occurs (Fig 2 and Fig 3). This subgroup of MerR family regulators includes MerR itself and may have evolved to generate a variety of specific metal-responsive regulators by fine-tuning the sites of metal recognition.
Figure 2 Sequence alignment of MerR and PbrR. MerR family TFs share a highly conserved homology at their metal binding domains (Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007), which implies that our strategies of bioabsorbent engineering might be applicable to other cases of heavy metals.
    Inspired by the fact that MerR family TFs share a highly conserved homology at their metal binding domains (Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007), we developed to engineer strategies of bioreporter and bioabsorbent which may be applicable to other cases. Therefore, we then expanded our reverse engineering strategy to another common toxic heavy metal, lead (Borremans et al., 2001; Chakraborty et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2005; Julian et al., 2009; Mergeay et al., 2003). We primarily took lead resistance operon apart, followed by analyze of function, structure and operation of PbrR, the lead responsive regulator. Then modeling was conducted to analyze the characteristics of PbrR and topology of its regulation behavior. Information collected confirmed the possibility to design genetic circuit that makes lead sensor and regulator components more efficient and robuster. We also engineered PbrR into single-chain coiled coil (MBD) via the same method as MerR. Exhilaratingly, following expression of PbrR MBD on the surface, periplasm and in cytosol of bacteria and the lead (II) absorption test showed that our bacteria can absorb more than 50% of 10^-6M Pb (II) in 2 hours, which is comparable to mercury MBD expression in E"

The surge in popularity of Synthetic Biology as an engineering discipline in recent years can in many ways be attributed its passionate community [1] [2]. Much effort has been spent on promoting SynBio as an excellent media for boundaryless open scientific collaboration, exchanges and education, surely inspired by the success of the Open Source initiative [3] [4]. The arguably most important event in the encouragement of this pragmatic Linus’ law-inspired engagement of Open Synthetic Biology is the annual iGEM competition during which students partake in developing the tools of trade.
To mold the future of the discipline, cooperation, respect, good sportsmanship and celebration of the collective efforts are some of the core values presented by the iGEM Foundation. The most lucid manifestation of this is the endorsement of scientific collaboration between project groups - in stark contrast to the more commonly found mano-a-mano style competition. As a team that chose to work with microplastics for the joint opportunity to not only contribute to synthetic biology but raise awareness of how we can collectively make strides toward reducing plastic pollution, these values resonated with our beliefs as a group of aspiring ecoconscious scientists. Thus, we engaged in as many exchanges as we found possible, to varying degrees of comprehension.
We want to extend our sincerest gratitude to all the teams that we have been in correspondence with during the passing year. Your passion, optimism and tenacity inspired us to make the most out of the iGEM experience.

After an extensive skype meeting with the iGEM team of SVCE Chennai in which we exchanged ideas, suggestions and well-wishes, we stumbled upon the opportunity to assist them in their project. They had set out to create a library of adaptors between transcriptional and translational regulation in E. coli by combining the translational regulatory system of the tna operon in combination with riboswitch like elements responding to the physicochemical conditions of the cell. However, as they had limited prior experience with modeling of biological networks, they were unsure as how to proceed with the synthesis of reaction rate equations for a quantitative description of the gene expression dynamics. Coincidentally, we had just finished a similar analysis of our project and all parties collectively agreed that we would attempt to model their system. After a few"

Overall project
Arsenic is a poisonous metal that occurs naturally in ground water and can also be concentrated in industrial and agricultural areas.  It is odorless and tasteless so people can consume it without knowing it.   Arsenic can build up in the body and lead to health problems.  We decided to use a synthetic biology approach to build an iGEM biosensor we call ""Winterkist, Heavy Metal Detector"" that could be used to detect exact levels of arsenic in a laboratory and also have a warning system in it that alerts people who want to test water but don't have access to laboratory equipment.  To do this we made one composite part that joined an arsenic-sensitive promoter, BBa-190015, with a GFP-generator, BBa_E0480 so that greater arsenic levels could be detected by a stronger glow in a fluorimeter.  In another composite part we joined the arsenic-sensitive promoter to a wintergreen smell generator, BBa_J45119.  If arsenic contaminated water is placed with our Winterkist detector and salicylic acid, the combination will make a wintergreen smell warning someone not to drink the water.  In the lab we were successful in building both composite parts and joining them into a single device.  We have had a difficult time characterizing the device's ability to detect arsenic in either way.  We can show in a control experiments that arabinose stimulates the fluorescence of GFP under the control of ARA-C in the pGLO plasmid (Bio-Rad) so we know that we should be able to detect it if it is working.  We have more work to do.

Figure 3: The design of docking domains in our experiment. At each set of docking domain, the top was connected with ACP that its upstream joined in the PFC 23 and   its downstream joined in the RFC 10. The following came close to KS that the upstream joined in the RFC 10 and the downstream joined in the RFC 23. The following has   no linker generally.
Results
After long exploration, we have got the standard DDs that can be used in different connections of ACP and KS. All docking domain are class 2 in our project. At each   set of docking domain, the top was connected with ACP that its upstream added the RFC 23 and its downstream added the RFC 10. The following came close to KS that the   upstream added the RFC 10 and the downstream added the RFC 23. The following has no linker generally. With dedicated efforts, we have built out the different modules   by using the same docking domains. With the upstream and downstream added for assembly, it has been constructed into pSB1C3 vector for further use.

For (c), number 1 to 5   refer to the “DD4上、DD4下、DD6上、DD6上、DD6下” separately.
Conclusion
In our initial design, we aimed to create the standard general DD that can connect different Module (get more information about Module, please click here). Now, we   have got the standard biobricks of DD but without strict verification. Then, we will continue completing the remaining parts of the experiment.

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."
XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Plant_-_-_TEXT.html," Kunieda and his team identified five abundant heat-soluble proteins in the tardigrades, which can prevent protein-aggregation in dehydrated conditions in other anhydrobiotic organisms.[1]
Figure 7. Stage Photo of Tardigrades in Ant-Man 2.
In 2017, Thomas C. Boothby and his team segregated three TDP proteins in the water bears and explored their mechanism of action[3]. This is a schematic diagram of the mechanism they have done so far. At the same time, one of the 2017 iGEM teams TUDelft , attempted to preserve the Cas13a protein using the TDP proteins, and they also tried to preserve the bacteria with the TDP proteins and obtained amazing outcome.                     In our project, we are going to use TDPs to help preserve the protein Cas12a and OMVs.
Abstract
We have carried out research on TDP proteins this year. On the one hand, we plan to preserve the Cas12a required for protein detection and OMVs required for treatment with TDPs. On the other hand, as the wiki says, TDP is a new biological activity protector with great potential. So we are going to use TDP proteins to simplify existing methods of preserving proteins and bacteria.                     There are two novel protein families with distinct subcellular localizations named Cytoplasmic Abundant Heat Soluble (CAHS) and Secretory Abundant Heat Soluble (SAHS) protein families, according to their localization. In our project, SAHS1 was used to preserve the proteins and CAHS1 was used for the preservation of the bacteria.

By summing the $\mathcal{R}$, the cleavage probability relative to the on-target, over all off-target positions on the plasmid, we compute the $P_{FP}$, the probability of a false positive output, provided that there is a positive output:
$$ P_{FP} = \frac{ \sum _{\textrm{off target}}\mathcal{R} }{\sum_{\textrm{off target}}\mathcal{R} + \sum_{\textrm{on target}}\mathcal{R}} = \frac{1}{1+ \frac{\sum_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\sum_{off}\mathcal{R}}} \tag{8}$$
Computing $P_{FP}$ for crRNA 1-4 (Figure 5) shows that crRNA 3 has the lowest probability of yielding a false-positive result on the TcR plasmid, i.e. being activated by a non-target site on the plasmid: 1 in 100 billion. Interestingly, experiments in the lab show that Cas13a also performs highest collateral cleavage activity when loaded when crRNA 3.
Figure 5: Off-target cleavage probability (relative to on-target) for crRNA 1 to 4 on TcR plasmid. Off target cleavage probability (relative to on-target) for crRNA 1-5 on the TcR plasmid ($\Delta C=0.25$,$\Delta I=2.5$). crRNA 3 (orange) is the crRNA with one on-target site that further displays the lowest probability of false-positive activation on the TcR plasmid itself (i.e. on the non-target sites). Interestingly, crRNA 3 also results in best Cas13a performance in the lab .
Rewriting the implementation of the model into a command line utility allowed us to use the TU Delft computer clusters for simulating the off-target effects of our crRNAs on the genomes of different relevant organisms (genomes retrieved from NC"
Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," some rules ourselves, but none of us were familiar with board games. We also considered making online games once, but for us students major in medic and biology, it was too hard to write complex program. The dream of spreading through the game remained on the blueprint for a long period.
Development
Things were turning around after we got in touch with a professional board game lover, Ruiling Zhong. Miss Zhong was the president of Fudan University Board Game Club. Luckily, she was such a nice person who agreed to help us with our board game project for nothing in return. She had rich experience in numbers of board games, and provided multiple examples for us as references. Several team members were invited to join in their club activities to experience multiple types of board game. With our relative professional knowledge and enhanced experience in board game, we finally started designing.
After times of playing, discussing and brainstorming, we decided to abandon the previous strategy of copying and improving. What we want to achieve is a game that can motivate players to learn more about immunotherapy by themselves, rather than a normal board game just for fun. Thus we need a frame which suit our idea perfectly. This can only be achieved by developing the game mechanics and the contents at the exact same time.That was when an even bolder and even more impressive idea was brought up: To design a game of our own and by ourselves. And we started from scratch, to construct from the very first piece of stone.
And it was hard. We’ve been brainstorming until all the ideas ran dry. We’ve been constantly making tests until every part of the game was polished again and again. And we’ve been so desperate because things just didn’t seem to work out perfect. But it grew gradually. And after all the brilliant ideas we never gave up on, after all the joys and troubles we will never forget, Cell War was finally brought to life, on the fifth of July.
Cell War
WARNING! Cancer invasion is detected in the human body. Our immune fighters are dispatched immediately for the mission. The war can be triggered at any moment… Attack and defense, gamble and foresight, craft and strategy, luck and adversity, lone battle and team combat… In the war against cancer, you need more than what you think.
Warriors! Draw your sword, and fight the war!
Come and join us at the Hynes Convention Center!
We will randomly select ten participants and send out the light version of Cell War!
Public
To share Cell War with more people, we grab every chance to demonstrate our board game. Our board game was brought to conferences, schools"

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#test999999_-_-_TEXT.html," in pasture in order to prevent infection.
Symptoms
When the worms migrate in the arteries they cause inflammation in the arterial wall and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms, it may form an embolism, which can detach and travel in the bloodstream until it reaches and blocks smaller blood vessels. This prevents oxygen and nutrient supply to surrounding tissues and may result in colic[14]. This can cause problems in the animals, with the worst case scenario being death[4].
Having these parasites is obviously a huge problem and there is great need for methods that can detect the parasites before ingestion, preventing infection.
Methods for Detection
To be able to count either small or large strongyles, the current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them.  The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs! This technique only makes it possible to detect strongyles after the infection which is a huge disadvantage! Other methods for detection, such as using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [12, 13, 17].
What is currently needed is a simple detection method which could be used on site without specialized equipment. To fulfill this need we aim to develop a detection method that can be applied to pastures in order to prevent infection to begin with!
Preventing an Infection
After infestation, the window of opportunity for treatment is comparatively small, as the large strongyle spends most of its life cycle in the blood stream, where the treatment is ineffective. It is therefore important for the farmer to know what levels of infestation are present in the pastures and whether these are safe for their animals to graze on. We aim to develop a tool which allows quantitative measurement of such infestation of pastures, which would decrease the occurrence of infection.
Creating the Worm Buster
A step by step guide
So, how will we achieve this?
How will we achieve this? The first thing is to define the desired characteristics of each worm buster. To face the problem the team need to develop bacteria with two different functions. The two different bacteria we will be described below
First Method
The Small Worm Buster
One method is to engineer a bacteria that lives in the intestinal tracts of horses and report a quantitative signal of small strongyle in feces. The small strongyle buster can therefore work as a diagnostic tool and give horse owners the possibility to use individualized dosage of treatment                                  depending on the level of small strongyle infection.

8) Expert Box: Greenovation (Freiburg)
Figure 13: Expert interview with Dr. Schaaf, Principal Scientist at Greenovation BioTech GmbH
In September we went on a road trip to visit interesting companies and experts to get some consultation on our plans. As there is a biotech company which successfully uses Physcomitrella patens as a production organism for therapeutic proteins it became clear that we had to meet a responsible person of this company. Dr. Schaaf, the Principal Scientist of Greenovation invited us for a discussion and subsequently he showed us the production facility and the other labs of Greenovation. During the meeting we discussed their work flow  for Physcomitrella and ours. We talked about production rates of therapeutic proteins and learned about its cultivation conditions in a bioreactor as well as in nature. During the discussion we also considered ordering the transformation of PhyscoFilter plants (so calles BryoTechnology). This hypothetical collaboration would have been possible and would have cost us around 50,000 to 70,000€ per effector. The price would have included the DNA preparation, transformation and expression analysis of 1000 clones. Beside the possibility of a collaboration with PhyscoFilter the company also holds patents which could, in theory, block the application of Physcomitrella for commercial phytoremediation. In this case it would become necessary to buy a license for the usage of transgenic phycomitrella plants. Other experts we have consulted can be found in our Advisory Board .
9) Expert Box: Prof. Posten (KIT Karlsruhe)
During our road trip we talked to Prof. Dr.-Ing. Clemens Posten, who is head of the Institute of bioprocess engineering at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). During our visit we were shown the institutes's bioreactors and Prof. Posten gave us an idea of how a symbiosis between plant"

Digestion screening for B5new2.
Medium gel results: B5new2 clones all showed the correct length for ligated plasmid! we decided to keep B5new2-3 to continue the assemblies and B5new2-9 as a backup copy. Both plasmids were sent to BMR Genomics for sequencing.
File:Pv B8 5 actual.jpg
B8-5 construct was actually a wrong plasmid: the 4Kbp fragment was non digested DNA. Sequencing results will tell us what there is inside the cloning site.
Small gel results: R0011(S-P) and E0240(X-P) were cut and purified through gel-extraction, while B8-5 could not be cut because the bands were not correct: maybe the heaviest band noticed on August 24th was a non-completely digested fragment, not a correct-size insert. We decided to throw B8-"

Silver HP 1. Public (1) On August 25th , our team members took part in CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Community)          and made live online broadcast of the meeting.The live video streaming went well andthe total number of online visitors reached 1993. We saved the video for rebroadcasting the parts which audience don't understand. It can help the new iGEMers to know what is iGEM,and  facilitate them to understand past projects.
(2) Combining the previous experience , we held the academic salon with the theme of ""light control"".Nearly 50 iGEM teams and students interested in synthetic biology participated in. We adopted online live and offline salon to organize activities. And discuss the theme “Light and Control in Synbio” warmly. (3) In order to expand the influence of HZAU-iGEM, we make presentation about the iGEM game and our project this year. At the same time, we also further expand the IGEM awareness, let more people know about synthetic biology. 2. Product design We will make our design a product. Firstly, for the basic research of scientific researchers can easily use it, maximize the controlling effect as much as possible via synthetic biology method; the second is to industrial production, reduce energy consumption and enhance economic efficiency. (1) In industrial applications, we are also pursuing the optimal solution of the synchronization method as much as possible. Economic efficiency in industry is a significant factor. Product feedback is also the core of our human practice and project design-how to reduce the cost of synchronization and how to reduce our product costs further. (2) We have further studied the positioning of our products in the laboratory level. The questionnaire showed that more researchers have a tendency to buy product that containing both kit and device. So we will make effort in combining kit and device for the popularize our future product. 3. Safety"

In place of the colour output present in the Evry Paris-Saclay design, we have added our part BBa_K2205008 , which produces our first connector in order to trigger a response from following modules of the Sensynova platform.
Figure 3: SBOL Visual of the Evry Paris-Saclay Psicose Biosensor as the Detector Unit
Part BBa_K2205023 detailed above was designed using Benchling and ordered for synthesis through IDT. Using Benchling, virtual digestions and ligations were simulated resulting in the plasmid map detailed below.
Figure 4: BBa_K2205023 in PSB1C3
Implementation
The Psicose detector construct obtained by gBlock synthesis has been designed to include required overhangs for Gibson assembly into the linearized plasmid pSB1C3. The plasmid backbone was acquired by digestion of the part BBa_K2205015 with XbaI and SpeI, cutting out the original sfGFP construct. The Psicose detector construct was assembled into the plasmid backbone using the NEB Hi-Fi kit and transformed into DH5α E. coli cells . miniprepping . DNA samples were then sent off for sequencing to ensure that the constructs were correct. Sequencing data can be found on the Parts page .
Characterisation
A preliminary qualitative assay was carried out as an initial test for this construct. Co-cultures of Psicose detector, processor unit and sfGFP reporter ( BBa_K2205015 ) were inoculated and grown overnight in LB+chloramphenicol (12.5 ng/ul). The day after the cultures were diluted at OD600 0.1 and mixed together to obtain co-cultures with ratio 1:1:13 (detector:processor:reporter). The samples were supplemented with 33.22 mM Psicose to induce the expression of quorum sensing molecules and eventually achieve the reporter visualisation (Figures 8).

Conclusions and Future Work
The results demonstrate that further characterisation needs to be conducted in order to optimise the psicose detector variant in the Sensynova platform however, due to time constraints resulted from"

Nacht van de Kunst & Wetenschap
Nacht van de Kunst en Wetenschap means Night of Art & Science. It was held in Groningen. We were invited as one of the Llowlab partners and it was our first experience in educating the society about Synthetic Biology. We designed three games to demonstrate different parts of our project.
First the audience was introduced to the idea of a receptor. We had build a Lego receptor to explain how a receptor is specific for one molecule. The light went on when a banana was placed but not by apple.
To explain why we want yeast to detect certain molecules, we designed a smelling game. There were 10 different bottles with odours and the visitors of our table were called to find what do they smell the one that would have the most correct answers is the winner of our yeast cuddly toy.
The third game was two vases with sand the one had paprika powder in and mixed with water the solution was becoming fluorescent.    We said we mix it with yeast so to show the production of fluorescent protein by yeast when is activated.

Abbie Gottert
Abbie is one of the most caring, friendly and empathetic people you will ever meet. Between assisting with Logo and Banner design, reviewing the literature, helping Johannes out with the policy and practices, and assisting with lab work, she finds the time to have a full time job and maintain a balance between them. Always concerned with the well being of the group, she goes out of her way to make sure that everyone stays healthy, happy and mentally sound.
Thank you so much, Abbie. Although you couldn't be with us all the time in lab, we always knew you were there in spirit - whether it be a GIF image sent in chat or popping in in the late afternoon after your other shift. ""Good friends are like stars, you can't always see them but you know they're always there."" Abbie is our good friend and has been a shining star in our team.

Kevin Setzer
Throughout the summer, Kevin was extremely busy working full time while also helping out our iGEM team. Though most of his contribution was done outside of NAIT, we could not have grown into the team we are today without Kevin Setzer.
Kevin mostly worked with Joy in the coding and designing of Team NAIT's Wiki sites. He was the bug exterminator, the very necessary second pair of eyes involved in editing all the HTML, CSS and dreaded Java that coded our wiki. Additionally, Kevin also helped in the post-production processes of our 3D animation (i.e: After Effects and Photoshop editing). When he could, Kevin also came to the lab to help prepare reagents necessary for processes and experiments later in the day.
Although busy, Kevin tried his best to find time and help out our iGEM team. Thank you, Kevin! Together, we've gone to infinity... and beyond!

The absence of inhibition towards P. aeruginosa by the hybrid Laterosporulin-ThuricinS  compared to their single protein effect, could be due to a loss of function. However, the hybrid MIC values decreased towards the S. aureus strains, indicating a synergistic effect. The tendency for increased inhibition when bacteriocins are in a hybrid construct leaves the possibility of other strains similarly being inhibited, when exposed to a hybrid bacteriocin. Thus proving an important characteristic of the designed hybrid bacteriocin leaving the opportunity to design a synergistic antimicrobial compound.

Figure 2: Top10/pSB1C3-PanK-Sec secretes visible aggregates of PHB.
We designed the BioBrick K2018050 , consisting of a hemolysin based secretion system and pantothenate kinase II. The BioBrick was fused into the iGEM standard plasmid pSB1C3 via 3A assembly. The functionality of this construct has been qualitatively indicated through culture growth, see figure 2.
Since our bacterial strains can secrete plastic, PHB extraction and production can be performed in entirely new and innovative ways. Secretion of PHB allows us to retrieve plastic without using toxic and expensive chemicals and thus allowing us the utilization of a Flow Bio Reactor for continuous PHB extraction.
At this point we can not confirm whether the BioBrick can produce more plastic than non-secreting PHB producing strains, as we have not received consistent results from parallel extraction experiments with non- and secreting PHB producing strains. We have however, extracted substantial amounts of PHB from top10/pSB1C3-PanK-sec in order to  assess the possibility of its use in 3D printing.

Concernant le second, la littérature montre que la création d’un phage recombiné avec base de penton de l’adénovirus, une protéine permettant le passage des membranes par endocytose,  est possible. La création du vecteur cellulaire , qui aura pour objectif d’intégrer le plasmide thérapeutique au sein de cellules malades eucaryotes,  est donc réalisable. Il est prouvé que l’on peut jouer sur l’efficacité d’interaction de la base de penton avec les intégrines des cellules eucaryotes en utilisant soit l’ensemble de sa structure soit son motif RGD seul. Dans le contexte du projet DVS , c’est l’ensemble de sa structure que l’on a placé sur la capside du phage Lambda. Possédant alors une moins forte affinité pour les intégrines cellulaires que si on avait utilisé le motif RGD seul,  les vecteurs cellulaires pourront d’avantage se disperser et par conséquence, toucher un plus grand nombre de cellules.
Des études in vivo chez l’homme ont prouvées qu’amener une version wild-type d’un gène suppresseur de tumeur au sein d’une cellule tumorale pour qui ce gène est muté permet le déclenchement du processus d’apoptose et l’inhibition de la croissance tumorale.
En reprenant l’ensemble de ces données, il apparait évident que la mise en application du DVS dans la lutte anti-cancer du poumon à non petites cellules représente une franche alternative aux traitements déjà existants, le vecteur tissulaire ciblant l'organe d’intérêt et le vecteur cellulaire pouvant délivrer le plasmide thérapeutique à l’activité apoptotique confirmée.

Goettingen,2014,Team:Goettingen#project overview_-_-_TEXT.html,"., (2012), more than 90% of the reported deaths caused by fungi are associated with species from four genera: Cryptococcus, Candida, Aspergillus and Pneumocystis, but epidemiological data for fungal infections is poor, as these infections are often misdiagnosed and there is a lack of accurate data from the developing world.
Endemic dimorphic mycoses
Endemic mycoses occur in geographically localized hotspots where even immunocompetent individuals are at risk. The following table is a reproduction of the information presented in Brown et al., (2012), where the authors make some comments regarding the quality of that information: 1) The data is extrapolated from a few and geographically localized studies and 2) accurate data is lacking from the developing world and the calculations may underestimate the true values of the presented statistics.

As discussed in the Project Description some of Erwinia amylovora´s virulence factors depend on the quorum sensing (QS) phenomenon and, in this specific case, the type of AHL used by this phytopathogen is the 3-oxo-C6-HSL. For simplicity, they will continue to be named as AHLs along the whole model.  Despite the fact that E. amylovora is not a very studied bacteria and therefore its QS either, we were able to simulate its behavior comparing it to the Vibrio fischeri´s one. The main reason was because of its similarities in the gene regulation. V. fischeri works with the LuxR/LuxI regulation while E. amylovora was found to work under a similar system with a highly homologous regulation, EamR/EamI.
EamI: REGULATED GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR QUORUM SENSING ACTIVATION
The EamI is a regulated gene and more precisely an auto activator one. Its activator is formed by a dimer of a complex made of a LuxR protein bonded to an AHL molecule. Thus two molecules of each are needed. The EamI protein itself is an AHL synthase, that is why it is called an auto activator, but how is it involved in QS  virulence regulation?  In Vibrio fischeri, when the activation of the LuxI gene is held, it also triggers the expression of the entire lux operon, where the genes responsible for producing the characteristic luminescence of this bacteria are found. Homologously, this occurs the same way in E. amylovora, when the EamI activation is held, the genes that will be triggered are the virulence responsible ones: the exopolysaccharides (ams and lsc operons) and the T3SS.   When this regulation is interrupted (our purpose), two virulence factors will be inhibited"

All of the work that was done during this project was both planned and executed by our iGEM team members. It all started of with some brainstorming sessions that began in the middle of May, although the actual lab work began in the beginning of June.
During the summer we have worked very closely with the Linköpings iGEM team 2013 . Since it was their first year to participate in the competition we decided to do our best to provide them with any assistance they needed, such as providing them with parts, knowledge etc.
In addition to assisting Linköpings iGEM team we have also sent biobricks to the following iGEM teams:

Introduction
Background
Tuberculosis (TB) ranks as the 2nd leading cause of death among various infectious diseases [1]. The fact that earlier diagnosis and treatment indicate better prognosis attaches great importance to the diagnostic services for TB patients. The current methods include tuberculin skin test, blood test and sputum culture. However, tuberculin skin test is not sensitive, blood test is risky and sputum culture needs a waiting period as long as 1-2 months which will delay timely treatment. Methods based on nucleic acid detection (NAD) are highly sensitive, safe and rapid; however, they are not widely applied to clinical practice. Why?
After consulting some front-line practitioners of TB control, we found that NAD has high false positive rate because non-specific amplification frequently occurs and current methods of NAD are not able to read out sequence-specific information; this makes them barely reliable. What' more, NAD requires expensive and clumsy instruments which are not accessible to rural areas where TB is epidemic (For more detailed information, see Human Practice ). Therefore, Peking iGEM 2015 is devoted to building a new reporter system that enables NAD to be specific, reliable and less instrument-dependent.
CRISPR
To improve the specificity, we need a system that can read out sequence information directly. The first thing coming to our mind is the clustered regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, which is originally from prokaryotic immune system [2]. Cas9 is a sequence-specific, DNA cleavage protein guided by single-guide RNA (sgRNA); they form a complex and can be easily programmed to recognize any target sequence [3]; in previous studies it was engineered to be catalytically dead (dCas9), thus to form a programmable DNA binding complex [4]. But how can we convert the invisible sequence information into easily measurable"

Regulation
The Natural System (Left) Under high oxygen tension, PpsR prevents transcription from the puc promoter of the pucBA genes, and thus prevents the expression of LH2(1st panel). Under low oxygen tension, this repression is removed by activated AppA, thus allowing expression of LH2 from pucBA(2nd panel).
Synthetic Regulation System (Right) Our system takes advantage of constitutive protein expression from the puc promoter at low oxygen tension, and replaces pucBA with Cph8 at this site. Placing pucBA expression under the control of the ompC promoter  allows for Cph8/OmpR control of LH2 expression under varying light conditions. Under high intensity of incident light, Cph8 will not be autophosphorylated, preventing expression of pucBA (3rd panel). When light intensity is lower, Cph8 will autophosphorylate, thus phosphorylating and activating OmpR and promoting expression of LH2 from the ompC promoter.
This regulation system was designed such that light is able to penetrate deeper into and through photobioreactors where light is plentiful.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Safetytest_-_-_TEXT.html," on engineering principles applied to biology, the safety engineering applied in the usual technologies will be able to be applied to synthetic biology. This gives a base to develop a system to identify and eliminate hazards that will reduce the risks associated to synthetic biology. An example of a tool from safety engineering that can be applied to synthetic biology are the Fault Analysis Trees, which will be explained further below.
Biocontainment
In current industrial applications such as fermenters, the use of closed settings that are easily controlled and proper waste management allows for the safe use of genetically modified microorganisms. However, taking these organisms for use in external situations increases the chances of an accidental release. Therefore, the existence of efficient containment mechanisms that avoid the spread of the modified bacteria will be needed in order to exploit the full potential of synthetic biology [3].
For a biocontainment mechanism to be effective, it needs to prevent the proliferation of the organisms. These situations are the mutagenic drift, the environmental supplementation and the horizontal gene transfer [4]. An analysis of the chosen biocontainment mechanism can be found below, as well as two other alternatives:
Auxotrophy
The aim is to engineer organisms so that they need an essential compound for their survival. There are two ways of doing so [3]:
Removing an essential metabolic pathway that will make the bacteria dependent on one or several biomolecules. For example, deleting the gene thyA makes the bacteria dependent on thymidine and removing the gene asd makes the bacteria need diaminopimelic acid, methionine, lysine and threonine to survive.
Introducing a lethal gene, such as gef or nucA. This gene will be under control of a compound in such a way that the depletion of said compound will activate the lethal gene and result in consequent cell death. For example, a xylS-gef switch was developed in such a way that the bacteria was dependent on benzoate [5].
Introducing two copies or combining the two methods will help the biocontainment method to be resistant to mutagenic drift and horizontal gene transfer. However, the main limitation of this method is the environmental supplementation, as this method will only be effective as long as the natural environment does not have sources of the necessary compound's for the survival of the bacteria.
Induced lethality
Also known as ""killswitch"" mechanisms. It could be considered the opposite to auxotrophy, as in this case a compound will induce the death of the modified bacteria, while it will not affect natural organisms. Among the death-inducer we can find IPTG, heat, sucrose or ar"

Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Public Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," provisional patent, we discovered the estimated cost would be in the vicinity of $3500-$6500 depending on the level of detail we wanted to cover e.g. the number and extent of the claims, the full description of the idea, diagrams and experimental protocols as well as the filing & service fees associated.
Due to the relatively high estimates we received, we looked into other options for filing a provisional, including recruiting a law student to join the team and contribute their knowledge to our IP protection. This avenue did not eventuate as our ideas on what we would like to patent continuously evolved over the course of the project and we could not reach a sufficient degree of clarity to bring on a lawyer for the filing of a provisional patent.
Nonetheless, we proceeded with caution, ensuring to follow the advice of the University of Melbourne’s tech transfer office and not disclose our ideas without ensuring our disclosure was protected. An instance when we had to implement this protection was during our scientific collaboration with Oxford, were we ensured Non Disclosure Agreements were signed prior to the disclosure of our project to them. They indicated their interest in using our project as a case study in their ‘iGEM intellectual property guide’, however we felt that this might put our IP rights in jeopardy, so we decided not to proceed as a case study.
At this time, our team is looking to produce at least one provisional patent following the iGEM 2014 competition on at least one of the various techniques we designed during the project.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," techniques to be able to find the promoter that would be coupled to the reporter which would at last create the worm buster.
By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the worm buster, horse owners will not only know how large the treatments should be but also when the treatments should happen. Thus they complement each other to minimize the amount of anthelmintics used; thereby helping to prevent resistance development.
The Worm Buster
The first thing the team did was to define the desired characteristics of the worm buster and outline the project strategy
Requirements
Our bacteria needs to live in the intestinal tracts of horses.
They also need the ability to report a quantitative signal of small strongyle in feces.
The small strongyle buster can therefore work as a diagnostic tool and give horse owners the possibility to use individualized dosage of treatment depending on the level of small strongyle infection.
Project Outline
1. Worm Culturing
The first step was to obtain live nematodes by the recovery of the eggs from the feces. After this process the large strongyles were divided from the small strongyles using a 3D printed microfluidic chip or a microscope and stored for successive use.
Figure 2: The first stage of worm culturing.
2. Transcriptomics + Phage Display
As not a lot is known about our worms of interest, we needed an approach that would allow us to detect the worm without knowing its specific markers. For this, we developed new applications of two existing approaches.
Transcriptomics
For the first one, we have been developing a custom transcriptomic analysis protocol. This was necessary because transcriptomics is a new application for Oxford Nanopore technology. The transcriptomics procedure relies on the co-culturing of nematodes with E.coli and subsequent sequencing of the bacterial mRNA. This will ideally reveal which genes are upregulated when the worm is next to the nematode. The promoters of these genes can then be used to develop a biosensor by linking them to a reporter!                                       As our result show, transcriptomics with the nanopore MinION works if a better technique to reduce the amount of RNA in the sample is discovered thus we have discovered a new application to Oxford Nanopore Technology.
Figure 3: Flowchart representing the trancsriptomics outline.
Phage Display
The second approach used a technique called “Phage Display”, which utilizes a random peptide library expressed on the surface of phages. By repeated rounds of affinity screening, only phages with high affinity to the molecule of interest will be selected. Sequencing the genetic information of these phages"

The cost per ton of carbon dioxide captured must more become economically feasible or mass carbon capture will never happen.
Looking to the Past
Luckily for us, nearly 2.4 billion years ago, cyanobacteria, bacteria capable of photosynthesis, changed the composition of the atmosphere from containing large amounts of carbon dioxide and virtually no oxygen, to being nearly as oxygen rich as our atmosphere is today [16]. This event is known as the “Great Oxidation Event.”
Cyanobacteria are one of the only organisms that have a historical precedent for changing the entire world’s climate and atmospheric composition. When trying to solve our carbon dioxide problems today, it makes sense to look back on nature’s example. Therefore, for our project, we chose to genetically engineer a well-studied and moderately fast-growing strain of cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (S. elongatus), for the purpose of carbon capture. Specifically, we will engineer our cyanobacteria to efficiently produce and secrete a sugar called sucrose, which can be used in industrial fermentation to produce certain plastics and ethanol biofuel. By using cyanobacteria-derived sucrose as opposed to corn-derived sucrose, food prices for developing nations are not driven up, and unsustainable amounts of  fertilizers and fossil fuels are not required [1]. By using cyanobacteria-derived sucrose over sugarcane-derived sucrose, deforestation and disruption of the natural ecosystems in the Amazon rainforest are reduced [2].
Photosynthetic cyanobacteria strains such as S. elongatus can produce sucrose more efficiently than both corn and sugarcane. Previously engineered S. elongatus has consumed carbon dioxide and secreted roughly 80% of that carbon intake as sucrose [3]. Crops such as sugarcane only allocate 15% of their carbon as sucrose, and large amounts of land and fertilizer are required for their production [3]. Because of the high efficiencies involved, sucrose production from cyanobacteria may be an effective method for carbon capture by converting carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used to make stable, high-value products such as bioplastics and biofuels.
Figure 2. Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide. In our system, photosynthesis is designed to produce sucrose, a useful industrial product.

1.Nitric oxide sensor
We constructed our NO sensor in the pCDFDuet-1 plasmid (Figure 1). Although the E. coli has native NorR expression, increasing its expression facilitates the elimination of stoichiometric imbalances between NorR in the genome and PnorV on the foreign plasmid, avoiding interference with the host's detoxification of nitric oxide.
According to the results of the ShanghaiTechChina_B 2016 team , 100μM SNP aqueous solution can continuously release NO, and the NO concentration is stable at about 5.5μM. This concentration is the concentration of NO in patients with IBD and it is nearly 100 times higher than normal people. So, we can simulate the patient's inflammatory signal in vitro. In the subsequent test of the NO sensor, the final concentration of the SNP aqueous solution we added was 100 μM.
We transformed the constructed plasmid of NO sensor into DH5α, and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight to dilute to OD = 0.2. After 1.5 h of growth at 37 ℃, the inducer IPTG and SNP aqueous solution were added. After 6 h at 37 ℃, 1 mL of the bacterial solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 1 min (Figure 2). It can be seen that the NO released by the SNP aqueous solution can effectively activate the expression of the reporter gene. But to our surprise, the blue chromoprotein in group 1mM IPTG without SNP was also be activated. We have not yet figured out the reasons behind this phenomenon. But we speculate that it may be caused by leaky expression of promoter PnorV when the NorR overexpress. Due to this, we will use a weak promoter to express NorR in future engineered bacteria to avoid leakage.

Horizontal gene-transfer of the HT gene will not harm the biodiversity “in the wild”. As the gene does not increase the fitness of the domestic plant, unless there is a caretaker to spray for weeds and pests. Gene-transfer of the Bt gene could hurt the wild biodiversity. The plants overall fitness would increase, due to the ability to fight off arthropods who feed on it. This would lead to an overall fitness decrease in the feeding arthropods, as feeding animals dies from the toxin. This might lead to birds who feed on said arthropods to migrate from the area in search of food, leading to another loss in biodiversityBerthold, Peter. Bird migration: a general survey.

Future impact on biodiversity
As stated, climate change does have a negative impact on biodiversity. One way for GMOs to help improve biodiversity is to decrease the output of greenhouse gasses, or decrease the amount already found in our atmosphere. HT and Bt crops already help with that, lowering the amount of herbicides and pesticides used in agriculture fields.

Reaction 3, AHL:LuxR
Conflict: k3 (ON) <k3 (OFF)?
Reference: Goryachev et al. (2006)
The references they cite for obtaining their parameters were not specific for that kind of parameters, in fact, one mentions the rate of RNA polymerase in HUMAN!
- Check whether the article mentions how they transformed the parameters.
They seem to explain why in their model, the k3(ON) is ""so small"" to start with:
<<common to all models considered here, is that the stability of  the state ""off"" defined by the constitutive Transcription levels of I  and R comes at a price of high value for the critical self  Extracellular concentration.>>
This explains the criteria they used to determine their parameters:
<<For each layout we attempted to identify a set of parameters  that optimize the functional fitness of the network. The search in the  parameter space is constrained by requesting that the kinetic  parameters must remain in the biologically realistic range and the  resulting network should demonstrate the behavior compatible with our  present understanding of the phenomenon quorum sensing.>>

This Cultural Day is a traditional annual activity of our Life Science College and everybody in Shenzhen University is welcomed to take part in it.
On the day, our team got a stall, projected some video clips of iGEM and set a quiz part. By asking a few simple questions, our team approximately gathered some data. The statistics suggested that nearly 90% of our round person had never been in contact with iGEM or Synthetic Biology before.
Whatever, we initially acquire the conception of Synthetic Biology in Shenzhen University.

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#HumanPractice#NRP59_-_-_TEXT.html," manipulated wheat. Later, it was found out that even though wheat is resistant to mildew and showed a higher yield in the greenhouse, it performed less well in the outdoor tests [6].
Even worse, it was more susceptible for the dangerous ergot fungi which are highly poisonous. Though the explanation from Simon Zeller, a PhD student who worked on the outdoor test, does not shine a good light on gene technology: he argues that the mildew resistance puts some pressure on the fertility of male wheat plants and subsequently it takes longer to fertilize the female plants. This gives ergot more time to infect the plants. This turn of events was hard to foresee and needed the outdoor research, as Simon Zeller states in the article [6].
Other voices, like Dirk Dobbelaere, Professor for Cell Biology of University of Bern,  call it ‘trivial’ that there are different results in green houses and outdoor tests and that the problem of ergot is ‘hundreds of years old’. [6] The NRP 59 is rather undifferentiated in the wrap up of the results on the outdoor research on wheat, even though the outdoor research was a big part of the whole research. Contrarywise, NRP 59 points out the research of the literature studies. Urs Niggli, director of the Research institute of organic agriculture, said: ‘There was a need to point out that gene technology is good’ while at the same time damp results from his own institute: ‘we found no risks of GMPs, but we did not work with the newest strains available’[6].
In October 2010, the newspaper ‘Sonntagszeitung’ already titled: ‘green gene technology about to fold’ [7], since the cost for outdoor experiments exploded. Militant opponents of green gene technology destroyed the fields of the outdoor tests of GMPs. Thus, the costs to guarantee the safety of the fields were about as high as the costs for the experiments (0,78 CHF for safety for 1 CHF that was spend on research!). The fields needed to be guarded day and night and completely fenced, so the national research council had to provide more money for the outdoor research. After the end of the three year project, it is not yet decided what happens to the fenced research facility, which operation costs about 750 000 CHF a year. On the one hand, the facility can provide know how and technology for the research with GMPs, on the other hand it is not known if further experiments will be done in Switzerland if the moratorium on commercially used plants is"

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#MBPconstruction_-_-_TEXT.html,". Earlier work suggested that the truncated peptide only consisting of the metal binding domain can form a stable dimer with its mercury binding affinity remained [2]; and DNA binding domain and metal binding domain can function individually [3]. Based on all these above and carefully structure analysis of MerR via 3D structure modeling, we directly tandemed two copies of metal binding domain of MerR together, to implement a mercury metal binding peptide (MBP) (Fig 2).
STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
As described before, MerR family transcription factors can be separated into two modular domains: the metal binding domain and DNA binding domain. The signature of the family is a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif followed by a coiled-coil region, namely, a similar N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding domains and a C-terminal effector binding domains that are specific to the effector (eg. metal ions)to be recognized[4] (Fig. 1A, Fig 3). These two domains communicate with each other by the intervening region (hinge). The crystal structure of several members of MerR family have been solved which provides us evidence for MBP design.
Figure 1. The results of 3D structure modeling for MerR based on data of CueR. (A) Crystal structure of CueR[5], which represent the overall structure of the MerR family. The ribbon diagram depicts one monomer in color and the other in gray, with DNA-binding domain in blue, the dimerization helix in red, the metal binding domain in purple and the metal ion in cyan. (B) The predicted three dimensional conformation of Hg (II) bound MerR structure by our 3D modeling. Two monomers are indicated in green and cyan, respectively. (C) and (D) were obtained after rotation of the structure in (B) by 90° about the z-axis and x- axis, respectively. The C-terminal metal binding domain and the N-terminal DNA binding domain are likely to be modular for each other.
Figure 2. Scheme of MBP construction and the predicted MBP structure. (A) Linear structure of MerR coding region. (B) Construction of MBP. The MBP was constructed by fusing two copies of metal binding domain of MerR in tandem with a flexible SSG bridge. Blue bars indicate the dimerization helix in the metal binding domain of MerR, and gray bars indicate other α-helices of MerR. The red line indicates the SSG linker, and the blue and green lines indicate the"

Day 16 13/07/15
Overnight cultures of MS349 containing pSB1A3 LIMS and MS340 containing pSB1C3 were set up, ready to be miniprepped. We then set up an overnight digest of miniprepped plasmids pSB1A3 and pSB1C3 using the enzymes ECORI and PSTI.
Day 17 14/07/15
Another agarose gel of digested plasmids pSB1A3 and pSB1C3 was set up, this time it worked. We then miniprepped the overnight cultures from the night before. We then ran a gel and carried out gel extraction of both plasmids. Following this, we ran an analytical gel using Hyperladder I in order to quantify the plasmids. Finally, we set up overnight cultures of Top10 cells containing the plasmid pVS72.
Day 18 15/07/15
We miniprepped pVS72, then transformed it into VS45. Following the transformation, we plated the cells onto combined Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin plates. We then ran a gel of leftover digested pSB1A3 and pSB1C3 from 14/07/15. From this we were able to gel extract the plasmids.
Day 19 16/07/15
First, we counted the overnight colonies of VS45 with pVS72. From this, we were able to calculate the transformation efficiency.
Day 20 17/07/15
No wet lab was carried out on this day as we focused on dry lab tasks.
Day 21 20/07/15
We produced fresh LB agar plates containing Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin. Next, our transformed VS45 with pVS72 colonies were streaked onto fresh Chloramphenicol/Ampicillin plates and incubated overnight.

It is capable of   digesting genetic material. The RBS is from BioBrick ( BBa_B0030 ). The   combination of these two BioBricks is the first step of achieving our nucA killswitch, which consist of the tetR repressible promoter ( BBa_R0040 ), the RBS   controlling the nucA gene ( BBa_B0030 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ).
Obtaining RBS ( BBa_B0030 ) and nucA ( BBa_K729004 )
Experiment:
01/08/16: The RBS ( BBa_B0030 ) was obtained from the part distribution 2016,    the plasmid was transformed to E. coli Top10 using this protocol . The nucA ( BBa_K729004 ) was requested from    the iGEM headquarters. Colonies from these transformations were    cultured in LB medium. Grown cultures of E. coli Top10 with RBS and nucA were used to obtain a glycerol stocks and plasmid    isolation was performed (QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit) . The concentration of the    plasmids obtained was measured on Nanodrop. The plasmids were stored at    -20°C.

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," through a tour of the city to the presentation of each project and activities prepared by some of the teams.
The presentations were held in a museum called CapSciences, dedicated to the popularization of science. We had to present our project both in French and English to a public composed of the other teams and non scientific people. It was very interesting to work on our communication skills and trying to find the balance between simplistic talk understandable by the general public and a scientific communication with our peers. It was also a great opportunity to learn about other team's projects.
On Sunday, the two Parisian teams had prepared activities. Paris Pasteur was a survey related to their subject. Paris Saclay offered us to reflect on biosafety applied to our projects. They helped us identify the potential dangers in our project and how we could act on them. Each team was filmed explaining their solution. You can find our own video here .
All in all this meet-up was a great chance to exchange and get to know other French-speaking teams. We would like to warmly thank the Bordeaux team for the organization of this special event!

KU Leuven team - Modeling the diffusion of the molecules in our trap
During our time in Brussels for ExpoSciences international , we decided to launch a collaboration with the KU Leuven team. We exchanged about our tools and methods for modeling and finally collaborated on some specific parts of the project. You can see the result of our common work just below.
From Belgium with love
To evaluate the efficiency of our trap's design, we wanted to model the diffusion of the acids we produce in our trap. We were not experts in this type of modelling, and the KU LEUVEN team very kindly accepted to help us with this. Big thanks to them!
You can find their results in our modelling part here .
The French touch
To help them in their project, KU Leuven Team asked us if we would be able to model the effects of the production of two metabolites of interest on the growth rate of their strain. We designed and analyzed a Flux Balance Analysis based approach to answer their question.
The results are presented on their wiki and we invite you to visit this page to see them.

The policies and practises have always been an important part of the Uppsala iGEM projects and we have worked hard this year to incorporate it as much as possible in our project. We have tried to reach out to the community in various ways. We visited a high school in Uppsala to inform younger students about iGEM, synthetic biology and the great possibilities that exist in this field of study. We also visited a power plant to investigate how the Decyclifier could be incorporated in the industrial process to further reduce the concentration of toxic PAHs. Surveys were made for the public to both inform people about our project and synthetic biology and in return learn their opinions of it.
To further connect with society we have been active on different social media throughout the summer, like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. More than that we had interviews and articles about the project and iGEM published in several newspapers.
This summer we have had collaborations with several other iGEM teams. Together with the Stockholm iGEM team we organized a much appreciated Nordic iGEM conference where we were lucky enough to have Randy Rettberg, the chairman of iGEM organization, visiting and participating in the activities we had planned.  Furthermore we helped the Indian team SVCE Chennai, who are participating in iGEM for the first time, to get started and together with SDU Denmark we collected and compiled data of iGEM teams using antibodies when discussing a sponsor deal with the antibody producer Agrisera.

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," grouped in Design Factory (DF), an international network of innovation in universities and research organizations in five continents of the world. DF is promoting the learning and research through passion-based culture and effective problem solving. Our team belong to this group since our establishment, participating in several activities organized to spread science and technologies knowledge to university students.
As part of the UPV Welcome Fest, a Design Factory Exhibition was organized with the aim of explain all the innovative projects that university teams undertake during the year. We had the opportunity to explain what SynBio and ChatterPlant are about giving amazing information leaflets . Both project and SynBio field caused great expectation among members of whole university community. We were delighted to answer all the doubts that they had and we attended all their suggestions.
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS’ LEVEL
PRAKTIKUM UPV
High School students will play an important role in improving and strengthening the future society. As SynBio knowledge needs to be spread across both undergraduates and High School students, we took part in the Praktikum UPV 2017. In this interactive speech we were able to make SynBio innovations known, as well as how SynBio affects society and how iGEM is involved in its progress.
The Escape Lab
In collaboration with Paris Bettencourt iGEM Team, we perform a pedagogical game in order to incite to debate about pros, cons and issues of several scientific issues. We decide to organize this activity in a group of 20 adults (between 18 and 23 years) with a limited knowledge in biological areas. They enjoyed and learned a lot of new concepts about Synthetic Biology. As can be seen in the following pictures, they had a wonderful evening being bacterias and lab students!
PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION’S LEVEL
Synthetic Biology needs to be spread in many levels and we thought that regional government could promote young talents and diffuse all the opportunities that SynBio offers. After several talks with Deputation of Valencia, we reached the agreement to offer scholarships to contribute to the development of Synthetic Biology in our city. Thus, students will be able to learn and live the experience that involves working closely with SynBio.
Bearing this in mind, our student members organized an informative conference where the mayors of our region had the opportunity to get interest in our project and its repercussions. Thus, we try to promote young talent in our city through this initiative.
WORLD LEVEL
Nonetheless, after planning all these activities in our community, we wondered how we could spread our message around the world. Most of SynBio information is published in English language and it can be a bottleneck"

Pneumosensor Future Work
Lysis Module
Our team designed but was unable to test this module due to the limitation of not being able to work directly with Streptococcus       Pneumoniae (Biosafety level 2) in our lab. This module proposes to kill Streptococcus Pneumoniae upon detection when coupled       with the detection and  modules by releasing specific bacteriophage lytic enzymes, Cpl-1 and Pal.
Amidase (PAL)- cleaves the peptidoglycan between N-acetylmuramic acid and L-alanine
Lysozyme (CPl-1)- cleaves the glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine
The enzymes are tagged with osmY ( BBa_K892008 , Washington 2012) via a linker to be exported out of Escherichia coli. Both enzymes have       very different N-terminal catalytic sites and share a similar C-terminal cell wall attachment site, which binds to choline in both cases.       Cleavage with either of these enzymes results in a weakening in the cell wall, which leads to the externalization of the cytoplasmic       membrane and ultimate lysis of S. pneumoniae.
PcomCDE
PcomCDE is a promoter induced by phosphorylated ComE, which can be replaced by a phosphorylmimetic mutant (ComED58E) in experiment. We could not    manage to verify the sequence of our ligated product, PcomCDE- BBa_E0240. Therefore, in the future, we hope to continue the verification process, and complete our    construct.

Collaboration
One of the most important aspects of iGEM is the act of sharing information. It is a wonderful way to meet other people from all over the world, to work together, sharing skills and knowledge, in order to further scientific research. Below, we summarise all of the collaborations we've had with various 2015 iGEM teams.
Warwick iGEM
We mini prepped and PCR’d part BBa_K314110 and sent it to the Warwick iGEM team after they had used up their own supply of the part from the iGEM kit plate. We were not using the part ourselves, so it was an ideal match.
Look through Ria's process of preparing the sample.
iGEM Bordeaux
We ran toxicity assays for Team Bordeaux to evaluate the effect of their bacterial product (curdlan) on wild bacteria, using our Pseudomonas putida - which we were already using to test our anti-biofilm agents - as a proxy.
Leon's data and report can be found here.
National Chiau Tung University Formosa and National Taiwan University
Team member Lychee went to Taiwan to spend some time helping NCTU_Formosa in the lab by running a colonies PCR and gels, and by assisting with translation/improving the quality of English on their wiki.
He also visited iGEM NTU in their lab and gave them human practices advice based on some of own outreach ideas: school talks etcetera.
ITB Indonesia
We distributed and collected responses for their project questionnaire as part of their human practices.
Trinity College Dublin
They have helped our outreach and media reach a wider audience through the creation of iGEM Academy: a youtube channel intended as a central hub for past, present, and future iGEM teams to share their videos.
The youtube channel has a lot of intresting videos, check it out here.

The brief pathway of acetic acid synthesis is shown in the figure below.
○ Succinic acid[Expand]
Succinate has been recognized as an important platform chemical that can be produced from biomass. [15] There are two main methods in fermentation to synthesize succinate(Fig.1,2). One is under aerobic condition and the other is under anaerobic situation. Gene silence technology [16] can be employed in aerobic pathway. Genes of PoxB, Pta, sdhA and some other enzymes could be knocked out to ensure a high succinic acid yield [15].
Fig.1 Anaerobic pathway
Fig.2 Shikimic acid pathway
○ 3-hydroxypropionic acid[Expand]
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important platform chemical from which several commodity and specialty chemicals can be generated[17]. DhaB, a coenzyme B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase, converts glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA). GdrAB is a glycerol dehydratase-reactivating factor [18]. GabD4, a novel aldehyde dehydrogenase, is responsible for the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids [19]. The brief 3-hydroxypropionic acid synthesis pathway is shown below [20]
○ 3-hydroxybutyric acid[Expand]
Poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) (P(3-HB)) is a polyester of 3-hydroxybutyrate that is synthesized by a variety of microorganisms as intracellular carbon and energy storages under unbalanced nutrients conditions [21-22]. An operon of three genes (organized as phaCAB) encodes the essential proteins for the production of P(3-HB) in the native producer, Ralstonia eutropha [23]. The three genes of the phaCAB operon are phaC, which encodes the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase, phaA, which encodes a 3-ketothiolase, and phaB, which encodes an acetoacetyl coenzyme A (acetoacetyl-CoA) reductase"
Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#Vision_-_-_TEXT.html," of the size of the droplets to be formed. Although the formation was successful we got a first-hand experience why yeast is not easy to work with. The short growth time and easy handling of E. coli is encouraging a future effort to generate LLPs in E. coli.
2. Human cells
LLPs has already been observed in HeLa cells by attaching YFP to the droplet forming proteins. Therefor LLPs does not need to be proven in human cells anymore. By combining our idea of using LLPS for metabolic channeling and the already proving environment of human cells the advantage would be an increased production of pharmaceutics and other products only synthesizable in human cells.
