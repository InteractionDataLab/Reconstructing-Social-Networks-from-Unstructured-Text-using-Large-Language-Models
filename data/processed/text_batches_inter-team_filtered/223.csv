On the other hand, the enzyme adaptor has two same restriction enzyme recognition sites. In one of our enzyme-USB, it is the AarI recognition site; The other enzyme-USB is the BsmAI recognition site. The AarI and BsmAI are similar to BsmBI which all can make a 4bp sticky end designed by ourselves.
When we want to insert a functional enzyme into our fusion protein, first we need to have a PCR experiment to add a head and a tail around our enzyme. After that, the enzyme product also has the restriction enzyme recognition site. When digested by the specific restriction enzyme, it can generate the same sticky ends, so our enzyme can be inserted into our part.

In order to bind TAL protein designed by 2012 Freiburg iGEM team, the TAL USB also consists of T1 sequence, T14 sequence and two sites for type II restriction enzyme BsmBI.
When digested with BsmBI, this part can produce two sticky-ends that can bind TAL-Protein DiRepeat (Bba_K747000 to Bba_K747095)

Today we made the final test with the construction of bio sensor (BB_Essential + E0840) according to “Quantification of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) induced by different mercury concentrations”. The experiment was made in triplicate for each concentration. We also made measurements of those samples for its fluorescence and growth (through O.D) every hour and a half until total 4:30 hours of experiment. We had a lot of fun making the experiment! :)
We used the equipment Hidex Chameleon to measure samples with the dark plate for fluorescence and the white plate for optic density. All samples were measured in triplicate.
The results are: Optic density of DH5α exposed to 0µg/ml, 0.01µg/ml, 0.02µg/ml, 0.1µg/ml, 0.2µg/ml and 1µg/ml mercury concentrations for time 1 (1:30 hours), time 2 (3 hours) and time 3 (4:30 hours):
Intensity of Green Fluorescent Protein in DH5α induced by Hg concentrations of 0µg/ml, 0,01µg/ml, 0,02µg/ml, 0,1µg/ml,  0,2µg/ml e 1µg/ml on time 1 (1:30 hours), time 2 (3:00 hours) and time 3 (4:30 hours):

Whose eternal philosophy is seeking truth from facts.
Progressive education can produce those able to govern;
Never say you know the essence, let alone the truth.
Reform is necessary, and renewal is a must;
To be a vanguard is to be both creative and innovative;
Dear young vanguards should be clear of the principles.
Be devoted to study, deep in thinking and good in understanding;
We offer arts, science, agriculture, technology, and beyond;
It needs you to know them all -- their origins and applications.
To become successful people will be like true gold to be made;
To give up fractional views we’re of far sight and broad mind;
To rejuvenate our great nation is to harmonize the whole world.

PETase League
Makerere University
After browsing abstracts for the 2018 Jamboree, we contacted all of the PET related teams we could.
Makerere University
OLS Canmore Canada
RHIT
ULaVerne
Yale
From our communication, we learned that most teams were struggling to secrete PETase enzyme. Our team was no exception, so this informed our decision to abandon further work on secretion of PETase via HlyA. Instead we focused on PETase in cell lysate, which we have confirmed to be functional.
We collaborated the most with Makerere, who are entering their first year in iGEM! We shared whatever advice we could based on our experience, and discussed plans to use our detection system to analyze Makerere's degradation results, although intercontinental shipping may have made the plan too ambitious.
Baltimore BioLab
We discussed the creation of bacterial cellulose film with Baltimore BioLab. They provided us with critical insight into the process and supplied valuable materials. We also received advice on the design of our custom bioreactor.
2018 Mid-Atlantic Meetup
Team UMaryland hosted this year's Mid-Atlantic Meetup, giving teams an opportunity to practice presenting their ideas and exchange feedback with other iGEM teams in the Mid-Atlantic Area!
Each team gave a short presentation followed by a Q&A, and we had have coffee breaks and lunch in between. We also hosted guest speakers Dr. Tom Burkett from the Baltimore Underground Science Space, and Elliot Roth of Spira to talk about their experience in synthetic biology from a broad range of backgrounds.
Thank you to all the teams who participated, teams: William and Mary, Virginia, Pittsburgh, Richard Montgomery, and Georgia State!

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," was more important than the risk of getting infected (read more here ). So we can conclude that talking about ""real risk"" can be misleading when debating with the public. Instead, ""analysis of all the known risks that can be anticipated"" could be a better alternative. Of course, there are unknown risks for a certain technology, which cannot be analyzed or measured. These have two main sources: risks that arise from intentional use of the technology for harmful purposes and risks that arise from unexpected accidents or secondary effects.
Thanks to the interview with André Krom (RIVM) we became aware that the risk perception is affected by a number of factors. We thought that a good way of predicting the reception of the public to our device would be to look into these factors and estimate the impact of Mantis in each of them. After a literature research [1,2], a list of factors was created. Most of the factors are based on two opposite concepts, one of which inspires safety while the other inspires risk. We placed Mantis nearer one term or the other based on our judgment. The result can be observed in Figure 1.
Figure 1: This figure represents the expected risk perception of the public towards Mantis, taking into account a number of factors affecting risk perception. On the right, you can find the characteristics that would make Mantis be perceived as safe, and on the left the ones that would make Mantis be perceived as risky. Below each factor, there is the statement on which we based our decision. Beware that this is only a guide because it does not represent all factors either the relative importance of each of them.
Conclusions: Risk has an important subjective component and the producers need to take this into account when presenting a technology to the public and implementing it into society. When pursuing the acceptance of the population, it is important that they perceive the benefits of the technology.

Responsibility
Responsibility can be defined as the duty to deal with something. In the case of developing a technology, it is the responsibility of the producers to deal with the risks associated with the technology, implementing safety measures. Here we discussed how many safety measures must be implemented to make a technology safe. Furthermore, we discussed what happens when the effects of the technology are beyond the producer's"
Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," is 10%, you will be able to count 166-833 colonies, which is a lot, but more manageable.  The second dilution would put 10 uL of the 8.33x10^4 cells / mL tube into 1 mL.  The number of cells in this second dilution would thus be 8.33x10^2.  Plating out 20 uL or 100 uL of this final dilution will give you either 1.66x10^1 cells or 8.33x10^1 cells onto the plate.  This last situation is the most accurate for determining plating efficiency, because even with 100% transformation efficiency, one would only have to count 166-833 colonies.
We made an excel spreadsheet to help us calculate this in the future.
PCR results
Well
2 - 300-400 (pCYC)
3 - 100 or less (PTEF)
4 - none (pGPD)
5 - ~400 (mCYC + ZifA BS)
6 - 400-500 (mCYC + GliA BS)
7 - ~500 (mCYC + LexA BS)
8 - 100 or less (pTEF primers, control)
9 - 100-200 (pGPD primers, control)
10 -100 or less (mCYC + BS primers, control)
The ones that seem most promising are mCYC + ZifA BS and mCYC + GliA BS, seeing as they are within the correct lengths.  The mCYC + LexA BS should be 244 bp, but the band appeared around 500 bp.  pCYC should be 288 bp, but its band was at 300-400.
Note that wells 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 all came from the first round of PCR.  As such, we did not get an accurate assessment of the PCR that really did work, which was the second round.  We need to run another gel tomorrow using the correct PCR products.
Did 30 uL restriction digests of the purified PCR products, with the exception of mCYC + LexA BS (mLexA).  Thus, the parts that were digested with EcoRI and PstI in buffer H were ZifA (no promoter), GliA (no promoter), LexA (no promoter), mCYC + ZifA BS (mZifA), mCYC + GliA"

The ligation was performed overnight, after which the ligated plasmids were transformed to two different E. coli DH5α strains
The size of the construct was determined by colony PCR
Several positive clones were inoculated, and their plasmids were isolated after inoculation
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One of the most important and basic requirement for a gold medal is to improve the function OR characterization of an  existing Biobrick part. So we decided to characterize the Biobricks designed by our own team.

BIOFILM ENGINEERING
What are biofilms?
Biofilms are communities of microbes where the cells aggregate onto a surface, and are bound together by secreted extramembranous materials made of a mixture of specialised carbohydrates and extramembrane proteins. The special environment in the biofilm allows cells to survive harsher environments.
What is the “biofilm response”?
Bacterial cells can exist in multiple physiological states, switching between them as a direct consequence of environmental factors. Common ones include heat shock, nutrient (carbohydrate or amino acid) starvation, metal micronutrient starvation, etc.
Gene expression in each of these physiological states is mediated by the changing the sigma (σ) factor involved in transcript synthesis. Each σ factor has its own consensus sequence; the σ factor on the RNA polymerase recognises and binds to promoter regions. When a σ factor is active, its effect is to shift which fractions of the genome are preferably expressed, because of the different promoter recognition consensus sequences. The sigma factor that is involved in the stationary phase (i.e. no motility, no reproduction) of E. coli strains is the σs factor. It directs the expression of genes necessary to induce biofilm and aggregation behaviour are a subset of those genes whose promoters are recognised by the σs factor.
Modulating and Measuring the Biofilm Response
The focus of our project is to characterise the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response for cells in which key genes for both structural and regulatory aspects of the biofilm response  have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardised battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation of the biofilm response.
Defect in the BioBrick Paradigm
Due to the mechanics of the BioBrick Assembly method, the BioBrick paradigm lends itself to the construction of gene parts that are necessarily additive. Consequently, apart from using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene"

Figure 2: Tom Hobson, members of the iGEM team Duesseldorf 2018 and us after a great discussion.
Why this lecture?
We wanted to support the new commission for ethics of DURC issues with input as the head of the commission from our university attended and introduced the committee at the beginning of the evening. In our talk we showed how the education on DURC issues could happen and presented our next steps. Our central message to the 80 participants of the lecture evening can be summarized as follows:
Freedom needs responsibility - raise awareness!
Figure 3: Our team member Irina Rais addresses the 80 participants.
4. Step What does the international situation looks like? – International Survey
We extended our perspective to get an international look on the level of knowledge and prepared an international version of the German survey. The survey covers the topics Dual Use, Dual Use Research of Concern and their imparting at universities. Since the survey is still active we are still looking for more participants to get a better international view!
Click here to participate in the survey!
Nevertheless, we evaluated the data from the period of July 18 to October 3rd to get a first international impression.
Key data of the international survey:
-249 participants -39 countries -86 universities -63 iGEM Teams
We also designed a world map with all countries that participated in the survey highlighted in green. Our goal is to see the whole world marked green!
Figure 4: World map of the survey participants.
Remarkable Data and Major Problems – Worldwide
71%: do not know the definition of Dual Use Research of Concern 61%: do not know the definition of Dual Use 60%: do not know a contact person to ask for questions and concerns 63%: criticize an indifferent or very poor enlightenment at their universities 78%: want a more pronounced enlightenment as part of their university education
Here you can view the detailed evaluation!
We believe that actually even less people know about Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern. The survey was mainly done by other iGEM teams thus motivated students interested in the topics which does not depict the situation for the whole student community. On the other hand, the poor results may also be due to the fact that no official, uniform definitions for Dual Use and DURC exist. Different organizations come"

Friday
In the morning we continued researching and working down the to-do list.
At 3pm we had a meeting with Laura Rowe in the Biotechnology Department, who had previously worked on bioluminescence, to tell her our ideas and ask for her input/advice. The meeting was really helpful and we went away and started researching some of the things she had talked about, including brightness measurement, different coloured luciferases and inclusion bodies. These are our notes from the meeting.
Late in the afternoon, Duncan also showed Peter a paper about a mutant bacterial strain with very bright luminescence, to be investigated further.

pC13B (crtY) was digested with XbaI and PstI, and pAK13D (T7 promoter) with SpeI and PstI (standard RFC 10 cloning). However, the gel showed only one band for each (what one would expect for pAK13D, but pC13B should have had two bands).
We started cloning crt genes downsteam of the T7 promoter. Because the T7 promoter is too small to extract as a fragment, we're placing crt genes downstream, then transferring the promoter+gene fragments back to pSB1C3. Today we digested crtY and the T7 promoter plasmid, but the digestion of crtY failed.

Competition for school students - ‘A Day of Scientist’
Our team believes that one of the most important things for our world’s successful future is the connection between science and schools. That is the reason, why we decided to launch a competition for school students, called ‘A Day of Scientist’. The aim of this project was to present scientific progress not only in Lithuania but in the entire world.
The results of this competition were shocking! We received lots drawings and videos which showed how students from middle and high schools imagine scientists’ routine. You can see the winner below
The winners of this competition had an extraordinary opportunity to visit the biggest and the most innovative science centres in Lithuania: UAB ‘Thermo Fisher Scientific Baltics’ and Vilnius University Life Sciences Centre. We are thankful to our sponsors for these prizes. We believe that this competition will become annual and will attract more and more students to life sciences.
Participation in National Science festival ‘Spaceship Earth’
National Science festival ‘Spaceship Earth’– annual event, which started in 2004 in two biggest cities of Lithuania – Vilnius and Kaunas. Since then, Science festival became most important and biggest cluster of popular science events and spread into more than ten cities. During series of diverse hands-on activities (lectures, demonstrations, excursions, exhibitions, which now annually exceed 300) each September more than 30 000 participants visit all main universities, laboratories of the biggest technological companies, such as TEVA/’Sicor Biotech’, ‘Thermo Fisher Scientific Baltics’, ‘Ekspla’, other innovative companies, museums. Children of all ages, schoolchildren and families are taking part at the concomitant open air events (science fairs) in Vilnius and Kaunas.
Science festival took place on September 8th-19th. At the grand opening, which took place at the cinema centre ‘Forum Cinemas Vingis’, our members Kotryna and Emilija were interviewed and gave an introduction speech about iGEM, synthetic biology, personal qualities needed in science and life sciences perspectives in Lithuania.
During the festival, we hosted two events. Firstly, our members Kotryna and Diana conducted a lecture for high school students about the modern biotechnology, genetic engineering, iGEM competition and synthetic biology.

Search for template DNA to construct experimental parts has begun. Search of the Registry found no parts which could be used for our design. We have contacted DTU-Denmark 2011 iGEM team to obtain some of their parts directly. Parts requested from DTU are on plasmids BBa_K678049 and BBa_K678056. Serrano labs has also been identified as a source of mammalian parts and MTA transfer is being set up to allow us to receive the parts.
WEEK 4
This week was spent designing construct 3 of our project, the construct for selectively killing Cancer stem cells based on their expression of ALDH. Protocols for user cloning were also studied this week.
WEEK 5
Constructs using the DTU parts have been designed.
Friday was spent at the UK team meet-up.
WEEK 6
Protocols for the lab have been put together and orders for reagents and consumables ordered.
WEEK 7

CU-Boulder,2012,Team:CU-Boulder#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," has been shown that the LuxG gene product increases brightness by functioning as a flavin reductase (Nijvipakul et al., 2008).  This enzyme is not essential for the luminous phenotype but we determined that it would be a useful addition to the registry because it recycles the FMN substrate, therefore generating more FMNH2 ready to be oxidized with the fatty aldehyde and increasing light output.
We utilized VF because the luminosity is easy to measure with a high degree of sensitivity and low background noise. The organism is luminous at a wavelength that can be perceived by the human eye, and we can therefore use the organism as a model system for reporting when pathogenic factors would have been initiated in other bacteria.  Using a plate reader, we characterized at what OD the VF starts to glow, and characterized how the density of the organism affected the luminosity.
Project 1: Experiments
1. Vibrio fischeri as a model system: Characterize VF as a model system for quorum sensing and luminescence via plate reader experiments.
2. Assemble the LuxABCDE operon + LuxG: The Cambridge 2010 ""E. Glowi"" team submitted the Lux operon to the registry, BBa_K325905, but several attempts at transforming E. coli with this part failed either due to its large size (6478bp) or due to an inaccurate registry submission. Several other teams have tried to use their part since 2010 but none have been successful. For this reason, our team is BioBricking each Lux gene individually and submitting them to the registry. <a name=""results1""></a> </html>
Project 1: Results
The figure above shows the plate reader data characterizing Aliivibrio fisheri's luminosity at a specific OD. The luminosity starts to increase at OD .23, and then after the A. fisheri becomes stationary, the luminescence sharply decreases. This experiment was read on a plate reader every 20min with 5 trials. A. fisheri was grown up for 4 hours in a room temperature shaker. Then pelleted and washed three times with LB + NaCl. Diluted to an OD of .05 and placed in the plate reader.
Additionally, LuxC,D,E, and G were isolated from WH1 VF and standardized to biobrick format.  LuxA and B were isolated from VF WH1 and contained internal EcoRI/PstI cut sites.  We used site directed mutagenesis to modify these sites in order to obtain biobrick format"

Abstract: “Our project aims to design a genetic device able to count and memorize the occurrences of an input signal. We achieved this by utilization of auto-inducing loops, that act as memory units, and an engineered riboregulator, acting as an AND gate. The design of the device is modular, allowing free change of both input and output signals. Each increase of the counter results in a different output signal. The design allows implementation of any number of memory units, as the AND gate design enables to extend the system in a hassle-free way. In order to tweak bistable autoinducing loops we need a very fast and robust method for characterizing parts. For this we have created a genetic algorithm that will enable us to find parameters of the parts used in the design. It also allows the combination of data from multiple experiments across models with overlapping components.”

Abstract: 'Essencia coli' is a vanillin producing bacterium equipped with a control system that keeps the concentration of vanillin at a constant level. The showpiece of the project is the feedback mechanism. Vanillin synthesis is initiated by irradiation with blue light. The preferred concentration can be modulated using the intensity of that light. At the same time the bacterium measures the amount of vanillin outside the cell and controls its production to maintain the set point. The designed system is universal in nature and has therefore potential benefits in different areas. The concept can easily be applied to other flavours and odours. In fact, any application that requires a constant concentration of a molecular substance is possible.

Westminster,2012,Team:Westminster#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," IGEM on assembly rules.
July 29
Continued  investigation into PlugnPlay assembly.
July 30
Registered for iGEM UK Team Hangout. 
Karin identified EcoR1 as the only illegal site in ALDH1A1     promoter sequence.
July 31
Following iGEM response a decision to use PlugnPlay assembly     has been taken. BUT parts will have to be made standard for submitting to the iGEM     registry.  In particular, it will     still be necessary to remove illegal sites from promoter regions.
August 1
Project has been further defined and some new roles     delegated. Discussion on mutagenisis and removing illegal sites from the     promoter region.
August 2
Promoter sequence of ALDH1A3 determined and primers     designed.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/220
Promoter sequence checked against commercially available     sequences. No illegal sites found in the promoter region.
August 3
Search for antibiotic resistance gene for mammalian cells in     the biobrick registry. Search for backbone for mammalian expression continues.
August 4
More discussion on the use of PlugnPlay. Using PlugnPlay     means that we could test the un-mutated promoters, but would have to do the     mutation to conform to parts standards. It remains uncertain how mutagenisis     will affect the promoter activity.
August 5
Possible backbone identified.
ALDH2 promoter sequence determined and PstI site has been     found. Primer for amplification of the promoter region have been designed.     There is a suggestion that it may be possible to omit the region containing the     PstI site. This needs to be looked at further.
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/217 .
More work on the Cre-lox system reported. More work     presented on identifying biobrick parts. Backbone and fluorescent parts looked     at.
Consolidation of progress and identification of next steps     for the project.
August 7
Received very useful information from DTU regarding their     use of PlugnPlay:
“Response     from DTU:
Thank you for your interest in using our assembly     system.
The Plug'n'Play system was created in hope that iGEM     would see that they needed to change their assembly standard and the RFC-10,     and that it did but it is a slow process. Most of our parts did therefore not     comply with the RFC-10 and iGEM did not accept them. However, we had to apply     the RFC-10 to a least one"

Transforming LacZ parts
We attempted to transform the following parts: I732017, E0435, E0435, I732005 into our competent DH5α. E0435 (on CM) had 0 colonies). The others (on Carb) had 10-20 extremely small colonies (after 16+hrs of incubation) each. We picked 2 of each for liquid culture, but none grew.
We requested the parts directly from MIT.

Mass Balances
Cellulose mass balance
Cellobiose mass balance
Glucose mass balance
Arrhenius Equation
Arrhenius equation is an empirical relationship which is used to model the temperature dependent reaction rate constant. Note: T1 is set at 45 °C
Constants
Kir — Reaction rate constant of reaction i
Eai — Activation energy of reaction i
R — Universal gas constant
Construction of Model
The model was constructed using the numerical programme MATLAB. A script file was generated which holds the variable dictionary, constants, temperature dependency equations, the ""ODE45"" differential equation solver, and the plot command.
A separate function file to the script is created as script files can only operate on the variables that are coded into their m-files. Rs (the substrate reactivity parameter) changes at every iteration because it is dependent on the S the substrate concentration at a given time, the substrate being cellulose. Therefore S at the first iteration is S0, the initial substrate concentration. At the second iteration S is the previous value calculated by the ODE, and so on. After each step the new value of S is fed into the function file and is used for calculating the reaction rate constant for cellobiose and glucose, etc.
Rs — substrate reactivity equation
ODE45 calls on the function file to calculate the rate equations and then substitute them into the respective mass balance. A numerical integration is performed and the results can be seen below. ODE45 is used as it is more accurate than other solvers (according to Mathworks) . It is based on an explicit Runge-Kutta formula and is a one-step solver.
Results

Initial conditions: Cellulose - 100 g/kg, Glucose - 0.01 g/kg , Cellobiose - 0.01 g/kg.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.      It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",     and ""What is the purpose of existence?""

Proof of concept
font-family: 'Karla', sans-serif;
We have successfully proved our concept of plasmid-sensing logically adjustable                             cell killer (P-SLACKiller) at every step of our model and wet experiment. See our final results here!
·Problem we aim to solve·
font-family: 'Hind Madurai', sans-serif;
Genetic engineered bacteria which use plasmid as expression vector are widely                                 employed in many social domains and developed rapidly these years. However,                                 the plasmid segregational instability has been the limitation of scientific                                 research and large-scale industry production for plasmid-based expression system.
So, what’s the plasmid segregational instability?
font-family: 'Nixie One', cursive;
It’s known that uneven cell division arises frequently which is bound to                                 produce two daughter cells with different plasmid numbers. The cell with                                 less plasmids will produce cells with much less plasmids.
In our project, those cells with not enough plasmid number is called as ‘Slacker’, in the contrary, ‘Worker’ is the name for cells with enough plasmid.
font-family: 'Imprima', sans-serif;
The existence of slackers will sharply decrease the efficiency and profit due to the slacker’s                                 increasing proliferation ability while producing no target substances.
font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;
There is no efficient way to prevent the birth of the slackers. Can we make                                 the bacteria themselves monitor the plasmid losing situation and eliminate these slackers?                                 In this way, we can enhance the plasmid stability,                                 stabilize the microbial population structure and finally improve the production efficiency.
Project overview
We decide to equip the bacteria with a plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer (P-SLACKiller)

We choose a constitutive promoter to express inhibitor gene, and an in-promoter which                                 is repressed by inhibitor to express killer gene. Under normal circumstances, for                                 plasm"

Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Practices#An iGEM Critique_-_-_TEXT.html," than regional competitions (especially for teams from outside North America), and how much work the eight employees put in to make iGEM run as smoothly as it does. Randy brought to light some points that I was unaware of and helped give me a better perspective of the situation. He had said that planning and organization for non-North American teams is a nightmare when you don't know if you're traveling halfway across the world until two weeks before you need to do it, and I completely agree with him on that point. I am perfectly fine with changing my opinion on regional competitions.
But I knew I was naive to certain points when I wrote this, and I believe that the main points I make are not hindered by that naivety. The justifications may be different, but my overall points remain the same. By no means am I trying to denigrate any of the great work that the iGEM Foundation puts in each and every year.
What I am trying to say is that I can be grateful of everything that iGEM has done for me and thousands of other individuals, and still disagree on some of the fundamentals and how things are conducted. Some of my disagreements are listed above, and I still hold these opinions after my conversation with Randy.
He offered justifications as to why things are the way they are, and his opinions on how teams acquire funding, how they run, and what directions iGEM can and is willing to take. And while I don't disagree with what he said, I felt like it wasn't enough. There are less obvious points about who is responsible for funding, what prices are fair and what prices seem too much; what constitutes education and science, and making clear what role iGEM can and does play in each of them; and what iGEM's direction is, what its goals are, and what its responsibilities are.
But I understand that all of these complexities can't possibly be covered in a half hour conversation with someone you've just met. I also understand that at some point tough decisions need to be made about iGEM in general, and even if you have the best intentions, you can't always do everything you want to accomplish. I experienced that myself with my own team this year, and I know that dealing out criticism is much easier than finding and implementing solutions.
I still believe in my opinions exressed above (except the regional competitions), and that there are ways to combat these issues that haven't yet come up. But I do believe iGEM, like any other group, will grow and change over the years, and with each iteration become better than they"

It is also known that mntH is regulated negatively by increasing manganese ion concentrations. This is allowed to happen through the promoter called mntR (Que. Q., Helmann. J.D.; 2000). This means that B.subtilis has the ability to limit the manganese metal intake system when the intracellular concentrations of Mn2+ starts to approach cytotoxic levels.
Cadmium Sensing
If our project is to process cadmium and not other metals, we need to genetically engineer Bacillus subtilis to carry out a set of cellular processes based on the action of metal sensors. These metal sensors will detect cadmium through a system known as AND Gating.
There are two metal sensing repressors, which are known to respond to cadmium: ArsR and CzrA (also known as YozA).
i) ArsR
ArsR (also known as YqcJ) is a protein which is part of the ArsR-SmtB family of transcriptional regulators. It is a regulating protein for the arsenic resistance operon in Bacillus subtilis (NCBI website – arsR family transcription regulator profile) (Moore. C.M and Helmann. J.D; 2005).
The ArsR protein acts as a repressor until it is conformationally changed by the presence of arsenic ions (Harvie. D.R, et al; 2006). However, arsenic is not the only metal which can cause this action to happen; it has been noted that silver (Ag(I)), cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) (Moore. C.M and Helmann. J.D; 2005) can cause this action to happen.

Overview
We established three models, one for modelling diffusion of lysostaphin, one for the bacterial production of lysostaphin per cell and the last one for a full model on our hydrogel patch, integrating the results of the two other models. The first model was supported by two diffusion experiments to determine diffusivity of lysostaphin in water and also diffusivity of lysostaphin in dextran hydrogel. For the second model, results of eradication of S. aureus were used to calculate the total production of lysostaphin during that experiment, and along with the cell count, the lysostaphin production per cell. In the end, the third model was modelled in COMSOL Multiphysics in 3D to simulate a layered structure consisting of a nutrient layer, cell layer and hydrogel layer. The diffusivity values through the gel of model 1 and the lysostaphin production per cell of model 2 were implemented to make statements about how the gel should be composed or any future insights on the future development of the gel.
After thinking about a fitting shape for our hydrogel, model results were used to adapt the hydrogel thickness to suit our wound healing application. We modelled which patch thickness would be feasible to create a patch that is as thin as possible, but also allows enough lysostaphin to reach the skin to eradicate S. aureus biofilm using experimental input as lysostaphin production rate and hydrogel parameters describing the microstructure. Our model showed  that a patch with a thickness of the order of magnitude of approximately a millimeter allows a high enough concentration of lysostaphin to eradicate S. aureus. Subsequently, we adapted our hydrogel patch design to synthesize a hydrogel patch with a thickness of 0.75 mm. We could show that this hydrogel could be easily created and yielded flexible, stable hydrogels. Furthermore, viewing the future of our hydrogel patch, we"

In normoxia, hydroxilation of HIF-1α trigger ligase complex, leading to HIF-1α degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In hypoxia, HIF-1α becomes stable and acts by binding to HIF-responsive elements (HREs) in promoters
Oxygen Dependent Degradation Domain (ODD)
The second mechanism includes a few understructure elements called TetR-VP16 complex and two different plasmids, pTet-off and pTRE vectors. In pTet-off plasmid, PCMV constitutive promoter with medium strength codes TetR-VP16 protein complex which can bind its respond element present in second plasmid, pTRE. Tetracyclin respond element (TetRE) is a protein binding domain which allows the binding of TetR component of the protein complex. Whereas, VP16 component works as a transcription activator for the weak constitutive promoter (PminiCMV) existing in pTRE vector. TetR-VP16 protein complex can activate this weak promoter in pTRE vector.
ODD is a peptide about 200 amino acid long which includes a hydroxylation site of prolyl hydroxylase. In normal oxygen levels, hydroxylation from this site causes peptide to be targeted by ubiquitine-proteosome degradation system to be eliminated swiftly. However, in hypoxic conditions, hydroxyl subgroups cannot be added to ODD domain which results as the survival and accumulation of peptide and the components cohesive to it. (Huang et al. 1998)
We aim to insert an additional peptide called oxygen dependent degradation domain (ODD domain) between TetR and VP16 components. With this mechanism, TetR-ODD-VP16 complex can only initiate the transcription of only weak promoter in hypoxic conditions because of the degradation of the complex by proteasome in oxygen presence. ith this, protein complex is expected to behave like a hypoxia inducer.
In hypoxic conditions, hydroxyl subgroups cannot be added to ODD domain which results as the survival and accumulation of peptide and the components (TetR and VP16) cohesive to it.

The last presentation included information about current applications of genetic engineering in industry and agriculture around the world. The purpose of this section was to provide concrete examples of current uses of synthetic biology that many of us encounter in our everyday lives, such as the production of recombinant bovine growth hormone (rGBH), aspartame and various other food additives, and nutritionally enhanced or pest-tolerant food crops. In discussing these examples, broad questions regarding ethics were interspersed with a discussion of the many differences between engineering microorganisms versus macroorganisms. Ethical concerns and transparency are often tied in with the goals of industry and legislature, and possible dilemmas were discussed with the group’s participation. The presentation was concluded with emphasis on the idea that as technology evolves, so should ethical discussions and regulations; although we may not have the ""right"" answers to the important ethical questions, the important thing is to continue to engage the public in a dialogue about the ethical issues related to synthetic biology and its applications.
Finally, a Jeopardy game was used to wrap-up the event. Questions were incorporated into the game based off of the information that was covered in the three presentations and reinforced during the activities. Groups of three to five participants were paired with an iGEM team member, though the team member was not allowed to directly tell their groups the answers. The team members served as a reference of whether or not the group members were on the right track. The winning group was given first choice of prizes. The rest of the prizes were given away in random order as door prizes.  Prizes included color-changing cups with the team’s logo, gift cards to local businesses, and merchandise from the university bookstore.
Our team was hugely successful in preparing all of the different activities and presentations for this event. Advertising for the event was achieved through various means, including: campus-wide and department-specific listserv notifications, flyers in all academic buildings and residence halls, campus radio ads, and chalk on the sidewalks all over campus. Feedback from attendees was extremely positive. Twenty people attended the event, which was a sufficient amount for the event to be engaging and successful, although the team had hoped for attendance of at least thirty individuals. In the future, attendance could be improved by holding such an event during a more convenient time than a weekend. We also believe that as the team increases awareness of iGEM and synthetic biology in the community, attendance at educational events is likely to increase as well. The team is excited to build on the success of this event even"

When synthetic biology's potential paths of innovation or stalemate are juxtaposed, there is an inescapable coupling of disappointment and appreciation of how patent law intersects our most promising sciences. Patents then, may indeed be our most transformative invention of all.

This experiment is the pre-test that shows us whether the amount of Pantide is sufficient enough to perform the toxicity against the larvae. We applied the sample onto the leaf disks and put five cutworms into the separate cabinets for feeding assays. The positive control in the experiment was to apply Bacillus thuringiensis on the leaf disks, which is nowadays the most widely-used bioinsecticide, and the negative control group in the test was DD water. We preserved all the result of the remained leaves sealing with the glass paper and calculated the percentage of the remained area on the leaves. The collected data were analyzed by t–test and calculated with the p-value. The p-value is a function that measures how extreme the observation is. The widespread use of “statistical significance” (interpreted as “p ≤ 0.05”) is a license for making a claim of a scientific finding that leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process. In the picture, it shows as a star. The more the stars are, the more significant difference is. Here are the feeding assay results.

Figure4 shows the pictures of the remained leaf disks after twelve hours of feeding assays. After we had done the feeding assays on tobacco cutworms with the three dilution ratios, we measured the area with the software imageJ. Figure5 shows the percentage of the remained area on the leaf disks. The higher the bar is, the larger the remained leaves area is. Figure6 shows the p-value with the star attached to indicate P < 0.05 and two stars to indicate P < 0.01. The p-value of the T-test can be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other. The smaller the p-value is, the more significant the differences are between the two groups. The observed phenomenon can be analyzed below.
With the dilution of Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin, the remained leaves area decreased, which indicates the dose response. The dose response is shown in figure5.

Justification: Personal communication with Howard Berg. 'The direction is random, more or less, but there is a slight forward bias. It varies from tumble to tumble. The turn-angle distribution peaks at 68?° rather than 90?°. Tumbles turn out to be more complex than believed in 1972. Motors switch independently, and a tumble can occur if one or just a few motors change their directions of rotation. Tumbles are short, as judged by the tracking microscope, because they involve filament physics rather than motor physics: a transformation in polymorphic form, following motor reversal, from normal to semi-coiled. See Darnton, N.C., Turner, L., Rojevsky, S. and Berg, H.C. On torque and tumbling in swimming Escherichia coli, J. Bacteriol. 189, 1756-1764 (2007).'

Controlled by light, the smell of bacteria got changeable, rather than keeping only one kind of smell. The changeable smell would have more wide applications, such as fragrant lamps, multiple-odor artworks and changeable signals. In our project, we used the odors controlled by light to created a fragrant rose, which connected the color and smell, and this expressive form of art was certain to increase the interest of the public in art and science.
We must show our respect for the projects and the teams mentioned above, because they inspired us to pay attention to the combination of art and science, and they did really good job. We wish we can prompt the people’s understanding of art and science by our project, on the basis of the wonderful works done by previous iGEM teams.

The following figures show data in which the background of chitin is already detracted from the measured results. Since the blank showed auto-hydrolysis of ATP, resulting in ADP, they were subtracted as well.
The measurement of four replicate enzyme reactions shows an indirect detection of acetic acid via NAD+ absorbance. This proves that NodB has generated acetic acid during deacetylation of chitin into chitosan.

We ordered 60mer FAM labeled [A] TALE A target sequence and FAM labeled [B] TALE B target sequence oligos and hybridized them with their reverse complement oligo to make double stranded pieces of DNA containing the target sequence of our TALEs. Using these target sequences and following the TALE Nitrocellulose Functionality Assay , we showed that TALEs bind to their target sequence. We incubated Ferritin fused to an E coil to TALE fused to a K coil to make the FerriTALE complex. The complex was then blotted on strips of nitrocellulose paper. The strips were then blocked with milk and soaked in the appropriate DNA solution. Finally, the strips were washed and imaged. We showed not only that TALEs bind DNA (Figure 40 and 41), they are also specific to their own target site (Figure 42).

In our new version, we abort this design and change the passageway in the box into small holes. Customer can judge whether there are termites by observing whether the holes are blocked.
Trap
The inspiration of our trap unit is from an existing device. The device works like this: Pine put in the device will attract termites and when climbing into the device, they will eat the Toxin accidently and die in or out of the device.
Kill
We want to kill all termites but our toxin will not be influential for a very long period. Our experiment has shown that is it enough to return. Along the same way, termites goes into their nest and spread Toxin to their family.
Total Design (DRAFT 1.0)
Mechanical Parts
Besides functions, we think more to improve our device. We design a box with a removable cover instead of a pressurized cuboid. By this way, customer will clean our device more easily, and it is convenient to reload wood bricks. We also design a wider ring under the cover, to avoid the slide when device shaking
Instruction Manual
Usage
When using the device, customers should place the Attracting Cover with wood to attract more termites. Once they notice the bottom holes are getting smaller, or stuck by termites’ secretion, the Trap Cover should take the place of the attracting cover and the Kill Function works!
Warning
By writing application scenarios, we have already visualized the intended impact of TERMITE TERMINATOR and present Techno-moral vignettes, focusing on the potential wider impacts of our application. According to these unintended scenes, to reduce future risks, a series of warnings have been added to the Instruction Manual can be proposed.
Online Server
Furthermore, we have designed an application to make a Real-time tracking online system. With this application, it does not matter if our customers have any problem using our device. We have thought of putting 14 functions into this application. The functions are listed as follows.
The app has more usage than providing convenience for customers. By analyzing the data about the frequency of downloading the app and buying the baits, we can know lots of information about termites in a certain district, which will be shared on the internet. So people can learn more about our termites and terminate them more easily. We, iGEMers from ZJU, are termite terminators!

iGEM Team Aachen for iGEM Team TU Darmstadt
Our teams met for the first time at the German iGEM meetup in Marburg held in the beginning of August. As both our teams worked with the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAA) we exchanged our project ideas and experiences. From this basis a lively contact and a scientific collaboration evolved, that was of mutual benefit.
Here we describe our contribution to the exchange.
We are probing our DMNBS tRNA/synthetase variants with a fluorescence based, two plasmid screening system established by iGEM Team Austin Texas 2014. By using this system, fidelity and efficiency of ncAA incorporation can be determined. Though O-methyl-L-tyrosine (OMeY) is a well-known and frequently used tRNA/synthetase pair, it was not analysed before with the Austin screening system.
The OMeY tRNA/synthetase pair used by team Darmstadt was cloned into our pACYC derived backbone and transformed into E. coli BL21 cells, already containing the screening system. The cells underwent the same cultivation and screening routine as our DMNBS variants. For this, a microtiterplate was inoculated which was filled with medium of different OMeY concentrations (0-5 mM). The aim was to identify a sufficient concentration of ncAA to achieve high levels of fluorescence and growth rate to evaluate the incorporation efficiency.
Unfortunately, the measurement did not yield usable data, as the bacteria grew highly irregular and fluorescence signals were not comparable enough to evaluate. iGEM Team TU Darmstadt for iGEM Team Aachen
A few team members of Team Darmstadt have knowledge of protein modeling. So they offered to simulate and evaluate the exchange of tyrosine with O-(2-nitrobenzyl)-L-tyrosine (ONBY) in the linker peptide.  Thus we can value the effect the protection group of ONBY has on the structure of the protease.
This is pretty helpful because we can estimate if our approach can be successful at this site of the protein.
To elaborate the influence of ONBY on the structure of subtilisin E Team Darmstadt estimated parameters for the force field CHARMM27 in a similar way as they did it for ONBY. Afterwards they incorporated ONBY into the wildtype structure (PDB accession number: 3WHI ). The structure was subsequently energy minimized using GROMACS 5"

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#HumanPractice#GMO_-_-_TEXT.html," biotechnology and synthetic biology is a big one and it is of great importance to address it. In this day and age scientists are not only researchers anymore but have to be public educators. If the general public is ill-informed and therefore dismissive about a field of study it will change the law to prevent further research, as seen in Germany today. This burdens every scientist with the challenge to educate the public about the chances and necessity of his research.
Legal regulations on the release of GMO plants
Introduction - MON810 and the EU
Probably one of the best examples of the difficult legal processes GMO food has to go through is MON810. This transgenic corn, producing the Bt-protein protecting the plant against the European corn borer, was legally authorized in the EU in 1998 after a safety assessment by a board of experts. Nine years later the license ended and MON810 had to be reevaluated in order to remain legal in Europe. This time the safety evaluation was conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). After a long and thorough research about the impact of the Bt-protein on wildlife the EFSA presented its findings in 2009. The result was clear: MON810 does not have significant impact on wildlife if any at all and it was therefore safe to cultivate. Needless to say the license was granted.  But many European states ignored the verdict of the EFSA and prohibited the cultivation of MON810 using a law which granted them permission to do so if new scientific evidence pointed towards other results than the EFSA presented. In response the EFSA conducted several long-term studies investigating the justifiability of these national regulations but no new evidence towards harmful impacts of the Bt-protein was found. Additionally no evidence was ever brought forth by any of the countries using these regulations. Even worse the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) conducted several studies which showed the validity of the EFSA studies but Germany continues to ban MON810.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

OUTREACH
This year XMU Software and XMU China 2013 joined forces to hold a series of Human practice activities, in an effort to promote the safety problems of synthetic biology, propagate the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition, facilitate the communication and collaboration among iGEM teams at home as well as introduce XMU Software, XMU China 2013 and our projects to the broad public.

Lectures on Synthetic Biology
We collaborated with the Chemical Society of Fujian province to successfully hold a wide array of activities for a high school' s summer camp in our university. On July, 16th, 2013, lectures themed with synthetic biology and iGEM were made available to all the high school students in the summer camp. The number of high school students is more than three hundred.
The outline of these lectures included the basic concepts of synthetic biology, introduction of iGEM, its safety requirements and other experimental techniques. We tried our best to illustrate what is iGEM in great detail: from the very idea of synthetic biology to a potential and developing subject.
After the formal lectures, interaction part started in which the high school students could learn more biological knowledge with fun. Our team members interacted with the high school students actively: answering questions about synthetic biology, sharing experience of iGEM competition as well as further encouraging them to participate in iGEM.
In addition, we tried to emphasize the aspect of safety from two parts of our activities. One was that we would make. We made sure that the software or the bacteria which we used or created were harmless. The other was the safety of information. Our software which owned the security certificate would protect our users' private information from violating.

Graph 2 shows the averages of the results in Graph 1. Based on these averages, the IPTG did not appear to have an effect on our reaction under these conditions. Our bacteria passively produces the repressor for pLac, but since we added more pLac to the system, there may not have been enough of the repressor to inhibit the production of our EstA, which may explain why IPTG did not have any effect on the reaction.

Graph 3 shows all our data for the absorbance values (measured at 400nm) for BBa_K2694000 breaking down 4-nitrophenyl palmitate with and without IPTG. Our control started at 0 and ended at 0.002 (same control as for Graph 1. All other samples did not increase significantly. This shows that BBa_K2694000 is not good at breaking down the 4-nitrophenyl palmitate under these conditions. As shown in our qualitative data in the section above, however, it does breakdown the palmitate. In this protocol we only used 100uL of cells as compared to 500-1000uL; maybe with more cells we would see the reaction happening faster.

This week was kicked off with a project development meeting with Emily and David, and we devised a protocol for biobricking the hpaC gene. Additionally, methods to place the genes coding for the 4 enzymes, DszA,B,C and HpaC into a single construct were explored. Within the lab, the PCR performed on the resuspended pUC18-hpaC was not successful initially.   Furthermore, we ordered the substrates/compounds that we intend to use for desulfurization tests. Once the substrates and the Rhodococcus strain arrive we are going to test how effectively the bacteria can desulfurize different sulphur-containing compounds that resemble naphthenic acids. Finally, we came across a paper published by REFERENCE , whos team had developed an improved efficiency DszB through site-directed mutagenesis in 2007. This was through a point mutation to the gene, converting a tyrosine at position 63 to a phenylalanine residue. A member of this team was contacted to request the plasmid that contains the mutated gene. The conversion step carried out by DszB is the major bottleneck in the "

        Solve that differential equation.
        1/(N-n) dn=k*fex (t) dt         ∫1/(N-n) dn=k∫fex (t) dt         -ln(N-n)=k∫f ex(t) dt + C
    Since we already know that ∫f ex(t) dt= x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438) in this condition.
        -ln(N-n)=k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)         (N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))

When bond with LacI4, pLacI is repressed and its transcription speed will decrease significantly. In order to express this alteration, as mentioned above, we use another part of pLacI* with decreased transcription speed instead of pLacI in the species.
The structure of binding sites is shown in figure (see Figure 3). The graph indicates that LacI monomers first bind together to form LacI dimer, then LacI dimers forms LacI tetramer, and finally LacI4 binds with pLacI* to form pLacI*:LacI4.

Modeling with Templates
Manual modeling of biological system is widely used in synthetic biology. However, it requires an overall understanding of the biological network and large amount of data, making it difficult even for professionals. Actually, the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur with a same mechanism. Based on this idea, we introduce the concept of Template, which is the minimal data set for describing biological reaction networks, as a feasible way to implement automatic modeling. The term “automatic” does not mean modeling without providing any information. Instead, we aim at providing minimal amount of data. Similar to C++ programming language, templates allow generic description of species of a certain structural pattern or reactions of a certain reaction mechanism.
Substituent and Template
There are two kinds of templates: Template Species and Template Reactions. They are designed to represent a family of species with similar structure and a family of reactions with similar mechanism respectively. In order to realize this idea, we add the container of Substituent into MoDeL. There are currently six objects in this container, ANY, ANYUB, ONE, ONEUB, NZ and NZUB. Though defined differently, they actually serve the same purpose: representing other parts. Let’s take ANY as an example (see Figure 4). ANY, represents parts on ONE chain and the number of represented parts can range from zero to infinity. For example, a DNA species with structure ANY - pTetR - ANY represents any DNA with part pTetR.
Figure 4: Template DNA species
A reaction with template species as its reactants, modifiers or products is a Template Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism."

Optimized Societal Impact & Risk Integration System
Developed by our team and based on the work by Cummings & Kuzma et al., 2017 [ 1 ], OSIRIS is a robust screening tool to identify issues of increased concern and limited uncertainty in order to quantitatively demonstrate the dynamic relationship between a Synthetic Biology project and its impact on the world. It is characterized by high interoperability in different case-studies and its multi-faceted methodology of information collection as received from a multidisciplinary panel of experts. A proof-of-principle analysis can be found here . A complete step-by-step guide follows:
Methodlogy
I. Pre-analysis
1. Carry out an eSWOT Analysis. eSWOT is an enhanced Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis (eSWOT) of the proposed project. Add a pre-processing step before the SWOT analysis by employing a PCR (Parameter Chain Reduction) brainstorming method in order to feed validated-only SWOTs in the final analysis. The PCR “program” is the following:
(i) Possible SWOTs are proposed through team discussions.
(ii) SWOT candidates are decomposed into simplified complementary statements.
(iii) Socratic method (also known as maieutics, method of elenchus) is utilized as a way to thoroughly investigate possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The team is divided into groups of two interlocutors, one that asserts the proposed SWOT statement and one that targets for refutation.
(iv) Only SWOT candidates that survive the in-depth debating (during multiple rounds) are tampulated in the final eSWOT analysis.
2. Create a Stakeholder/Value Matrix to identify all stakeholders that might have interests or concerns regarding the proposed project. This constitutes the first filter of the sample of multidisciplinary experts who can provide greater insight into detected or emerging project issues.
3. Map out the stakeholders (Experts) according to power and interests on a Stakeholder (Expert) Map in order to gain further insight on their position relative to your project.
4. Create a Risk Map to better understand the risks of your project in order to aid in downstream analysis.
These 4 steps allow team members to have a clear picture of the stakeholders/experts and complete an initial risk assessment.

We thus decided to incubate ISA, ISD, ISI cells and competent cells with the some biotinylated nanoparticles conjugated with TexRed reporter.
This time again you can observe in the following pictures, nanoparticles (red) and cells, but we cannot tell if they are attached or not.

With the previous results we cannot make a conclusion on the functionality and localization of our fusion proteins.
We also  did immunostaining assays, consisting in incubating the cells with FITC fluorescent antibody but we didn't have a fluorescent signal.  With all this even if we know that our cloning strategy was good, we cannot really conclude anything about the protein's expression and functionality.
Growth curve and Western Blot
Finally we did a Western Blot and growth curve of our transformed cells to at least prove that our protein is indeed expressed.
Figure15 : WB of the different INP - streptavidin constructs
We did a western blot expecting a signal at the ~50kDa bands corresponding to our protein. For this experiment we used a FITC conjugated, anti-streptavidin polyclonal Antibody. Despite the gel quality, you can see in the following picture a band of the desired size.
Finally we did a growth curve of the cells containing our constructs. For this last experiment, the cells were inoculated overnight with 1mM IPTG. In the morning they were initially diluted to a certain OD and then the OD was regularly measured. We can see that the insertion of our plasmid affects the growth of E. coli cells.
Discussion
Our idea was to clone a fusion protein made of INP and Streptavidin  that will be able to target streptavidin at the cell surface. This streptavidin could then further be used to attached biotinylated nanoparticules to the cells. We thus designed assays to clone this fusion protein and verify its functionality and localization.

Conclusion
(1.)      International market trends and opportunities
The price of petroleum is not very high in the current international market, so it seems to have less profit on producing biofuel. However, we can never underestimate the threat of energy consuming. The energy crisis is still visible in the upcoming future since a number of fossil fuels in the Earth is limited. Hence, it is not quite urgent but definitely imperative to develop sustainable energy sources. Microalgae oil may be a capable one of them. FEBICO once had the interest to join the green fuel plan proposed by the government of Taiwan.
(2.)      High additional value in algae
FEBICO has its dependent in-house microalgae laboratory.It aims at creating microalgae biotech products with high added value. That is, the FEBICO products contain some rare nutrients or have particular functions. For example, Vegetable DHA from marine microalgae, Astaxanthin from Haematococcus Pluvialis mixed with Spirulina in capsule and immune diagnostic reagents, etc. Mr. C. C. Chiueh also threw out the idea of filtering pollutions such as endocrine disruptors by algae, viewing it a promising design that will solve environmental problems.
(3.)      Production in commercial scale
FEBICO has a 140,000-square-meter manufacturing site with over 60 microalgae culture ponds at southern Taiwan. With the patent of “Cracked Cell wall”, FEBICO can pop the thick cell wall of Chlorella like popcorn without producing heavy metal pollution. It allows up to 80% absorption rate, maintaining 100% nutrients in algae.
(4.)  iGEM spirit and biosafety
We introduced iGEM competition to Mr. C. C. Chiueh. “Get and give” is the core spirit in the design of “Biobricks System” which made a great contribution to synthetic biology. To some extent, sharing brings more benefit than merely competing each other. However, it is a pity that it is still a minority to find out a “sharing” term in commerce. Besides, to diminish the concern about genetic engineering, we explained the function of “Suicide mechanism” in our project. With the picture of the plasmid we constructed, it is clearer to understand the concept. Positive construction means making stuff instead of researching basic things. Both of us－FEBICO and NYMU iGEM team are making effort to achieve this goal.
Mr. C. C. Chiueh showed his interest in DNA sequencing. Dim"
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#project_-_-_TEXT.html," the protein production was started using aTc: ""non"" = non-induced; ""low"" = 25 ng/mL aTc; ""high"" = 200 ng/mL. After induction the cultures were grown for further 5 h at the same concitions and cells were afterwards stored at 4°C until they were used for analysis or bioprinting.
After the cell harvest the optical density (OD550) was determined again as it is known that a high expression of EspP makes the outer membrane of E. coli permeable and this drastically affects cellular viability. For the scAvidin-autotransporter and the secreted BAP-NanoLuc autotransporter at high inducer concentration show clearly reduced viability as they did not show any growth after induction at OD550 = 0.5 (see Fig. A). In order to analyze the functionality of the whole design and these new BioBricks we subjected each of the twelve cultures to three different treatments and determined subsequently the amount of NanoLuc luciferase using the manufacturers substrate kit (Thanks to our sponsor Promega ;). At first the total NanoLuc luciferase content was determined in samples that were just washed once with PBS and contained the whole bacterial cell (see Fig. B), bacterial cells that were incubated with PPA-buffer (periplasmic extraction buffer; 500 mM sucrose, 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) that extracts the proteins present in the periplasm (see Fig. C) and finally the culture supernatant of the cultivated bacterial cells (see Fig. D). The total NanoLuc activity is only present in bacteria that are transformed with a plasmid encoding the luciferase and there is a clear dependency of inducer concentration a detected luciferase activity. In the samples where a periplasmic extract was prepared the luciferase activity is highest in the samples of the secreted luciferase as the EspP-fused BAP-NanoLuc is attached to the cells and only proteins from lysed cells are present in the periplasmic extract. In the case of the samples where the supernatant of the cultures was analyzed the luciferase activity is present in both ""high"" induced samples.
As the luciferase activity only gave an indication for the subcellular localization of the cargo-autotransporter fusion protein, we also performed flow cytometry measurements. For this purpose the same cells were stained with app. 10 µM A3C5-Fab that was coupled to the fluorescent dye"

(1) First, in E. coli terpenes's precursors, such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), are produced by non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway. In MEP pathway, there are four enzymes, (ispD, ispF, idi, and dxs) that are rate-limiting enzymes to produce terpenes’s precursors in E. coil. In order to create a high-yield strains producing IPP and DMAPP, we exogenously engineer to superimpose these genes into E. coli to create strains overproducing IPP and DMAPP in a MEP pathway.
(2) Second, in addition to introduction of three genes in a MEP pathway, we further introduced farnecil diphosphate synthase gene (ispA) or its mutant (m-ispA, S80F) from E. coli in combination with geraniol synthase gene from Ocimum basilicum (ObGES). These gene-combinations are possible to convert IPP and DMAPP into to farnesol or geraniol, respectively.
(3) Finally, we further introduce an activator gene of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump (MarA) to release the farnesol and geraniol from the cells and increase the content in the media that shows increase these flavors in the air.
Plasmid Construction
Fig.4 Farnesol synthesis device
The ispA encodes Farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Farnesyl diphosphate synthase can utilize both dimethylallyl and geranyl diphosphates as substrates, generating geranyl and farnesyl diphosphate, respectively. Therefore the enzyme can catalyze two sequential reactions in the polyisoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. In E. coli, farnesyl diphasphate is dephosphorylate by enzyme of its own. As a result, this device can synthesis farnesol.

\( \vartheta = \) the minimum dosage of dsRNA to kill weed
Thanks to our human practice work, we got many useful data, like the plant water consumption and the total number of weeds per mu (0.0667 hectares)
By the assumption that 133pg/L dsRNA can effectively suppress the expression of target gene confidence interval [2].
Figure 1. Relative water consumption among different crops and different irrigation method.
Meanwhile, water absorption of each plant can be represented by this formula:     \[ V_{plant} = ET_c + C_w \]
Where
\( ET_c = \) Crop transpiration rate
\( C_w = \) Plant water consumption
What known is plant water consumption \( C_w \) is much less than RCE, so we simplify the formula to:      \[ V_{plant} = ET_c \]     Based on the Penman computing method and the data from China Meteorological Observatory (CMO), we use equation set to compute the \( ET_c \) in China.
Plant transpiration, ETc, can be determined by transpiration of reference plant, ET0 and transpiration coefficient, Kc. The method of calculating ETc is following:     \[ ET_c = ET_0 \times K_c \]     We use Penman-Monteith formula to calculate transpiration of reference plant.      \[ ET_0 = \frac{0.408\Delta (R_n-G)+\gamma \frac{37}{T_{day}}u_2(e_s-e_a)}{\Delta + \gamma(1+0.34u_2)} \]

Improvement of Biobricks
We did a lot of characterizations and improvements of Biobricks. The Bricks can now be used by the iGEM community. Because of a better structure and overview of the website, we published our results on the Biobrickpage Biobricks .
Cooperation with iGEM team SDU-Denmark
Our team was highly motivated to get in contact with other teams and help teams from other countries. During the European workshop in Paris we met members of the iGEM team from SDU-Denmark and the idea of an intense cooperation came up. After the workshop in Paris we held video conferences and discussed current issues of our projects, like problems with the assembly of BioBricks and parts from the registry that did not show the desired function (e.g. <partinfo>K238008</partinfo>). Especially as we took part in the iGEM competition for the first time we were really grateful for the help of the Danish team, which shared their practical experience with us.
After a few video conferences the idea was born to meet in person and the Danish team invited us to the beautiful city of Odense. On September 24th half of our team got up very – very - very early (3 am) and drove to Denmark. As we were really tired after 8 hours in a small car, we were happy that the team from SDU welcomed"

With a stronger sporulation signal, the concentration of Spo0FP and Spo0BP increased significantly, while the concentration of Spo0F dropped significantly from approximately 9000nmol/fl to 2300nmol/fl, comparing Figure 1.1 to 2.1.

Comparing Figure 1.3 and 2.4, the concentration of Spo0A falls from approximately 100nmol/fl to 50nmol/fl when [SS] is increased.
Referring to the graphs obtained from the model, it seems like increasing the sporulation signal concentration, does not increase the Spo0AP concentration. However, the concentrations of Spo0BP and SpoFP did increase as the sporulation signal concentration increased.

Synthetic gene switch shows adaptation to DNA copy number variation
Background:What is Gene Regulatory Network (GRN)? Gene expression is the most basic but complicated process in living system. The interactional connection and regulatory effect among genes make up a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN). People have done great research to figure out the mechanism and rules behind gene regulatory network. Typical gene regulatory networks can achieve bistability, state-switch, biooscillation and so on. Also, some specific network structures have been designed and synthesized to realize artificial control.
What is Adaptation? In order to function reliably, any network needs to keep expression efficiency and accuracy when molecular components fluctuate. So the ability to robustly function and keep the same level of expression despite the fluctuation is called adaptation. In our project, the specific fluctuation is the DNA template abundance (copy number) variation. How did the idea occur to us ? Our project initially originated from medical treatment of cancer. Specific therapy to kill cancer cells greatly demands an effective method to recognize cancer cell. Hela cell is a kind of cancer cell that contains a large amount of endogenic mir-21, while the amount of this microRNA in normal cells is rather low. This remarkable difference inspired us to design a network of which the output protein value is related to the input value of mir-21. So a rational GRN is needed to sense input signal and to distinguish cancer cell from normal cell. Previous research has offered some functional GRNs successfully sensing the difference between high input and low input. We hoped to find out similar network topologies that may also achieve corresponding high-low switch. However, there exist many complicated factors that may arouse noise during the expression of gene, which leads to instability and lack of efficiency. We noticed that the number of DNA template (copy number) has a great effect as a noise on the expression intensity. Since the actual amount of copy number involved in gene expression process is hard to measure or control precisely, we have to consider adaptation to DNA copy number variation as a key character of a network. So our goal is to search for a rational GRN that can sense the input signal, realize the switch function and show adaptation to copy number. Besides, GRN consists of"

Motivation
Due to the complex nature of metabolic engineering, there remains limitless possibilities regarding shortcomings in a metabolic network. To reconcile some metabolic lapses, our team strategized this year’s project around optimizing the pAMB pathway from our 2016 iGEM project . While proud of our platform, we were keenly aware of a few obstacles hindering bioconversion.  Foremost, our Pu promoter was never able to regulate the production module. While IPTG was an effective inducer, it is expensive to scale. Additionally, we suspected that our terminal product was toxic to the cells and inhibits further bioconversion. Lastly, the AMB pathway has a high degree of specificity. To develop a more robust library of products, we would need to explore enzymatic homologs. In summary, we intend to develop a more robust microorganism for the bioconversion of aromatic waste to aromatic aldehydes.
This year, we set out to tackle these metabolic shortcomings in the following ways:
Develop a functioning Pu promoter element to fine-tune protein production in the presence of aromatic waste.
Express efflux pumps to alleviate toxic effects.
Explore enzymatic homologs to develop a wider library of products.
Pu Promoter
To fine-tune protein production, our team designed the following composite parts. BBa_K2451013 was designed for a general proof of concept, and BBa_K24510015 is directed towards fine tuning our team’s 2016 production circuit (BBa_K1966000 and BBa_K1966001).
Figure 1: Pu Promoter Parts Submitted to Registry
While we first designed these parts in 2016, our past characterizations led to inconclusive results with respect to literature [1]. After an extensive search of the registry and various experimental parameters, we set out to re-develop our regulatory Pu promoter. After various constructions and experiments, we eventually arrived at construct BBa_K2451013, depicted above. This construct displays promising results for"

Eliminate Chinese’s prejudice about biotechnology
After hearing the community's concern about biotechnology, we held two lectures to clear their prejudice. Meanwhile, we printed 200 booklets to expand publicity.
Background
In China, because of the UN human issue that scientists used 60 children to examine their new transgenic product, Golden rice last year, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains indistinct. The masses even became scared of the transgenic technology as well as the total biotechnology. As a result, transgenic products were resisted all over China.
Lectures
Although many biologists came out to prove their justice, many Chinese still have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of biotechnology for college freshmen and high school students. We introduced the current stereotype phenomenon, then presented the biological applications that have made great contributions, such as bio-fuel, Artemisinin (kind of drug for malaria, first extracted by Chinese pharmacist Youyou Tu) produced by yeast and microorganism which can curb environmental pollution. Because our project involve the knowledge of both biological process and the lecture also involved the development of Synthetic Biology, which is a course of cross-disciplines, requiring us to look at a living organism from the perspective of information system. These contents attracted the attention of students from College of Information.
Brochures
To circulate synthetic biology knowledge and inspiration, we demonstrated key ideas in the discipline in a booklet and handed out the booklets to more high school students. Two students e-mailed us to express their interest in synthetic biology and consulted to us about how to be admitted by Tsinghua University.
COLLABORATION
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM.
Communication & Collabroation
With University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB)
We cooperated with the iGEM team from University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB) and we both learned a lot of thing from each other.
We often had friendly conversions through WeChat and told each other what our projects is about and how our projects is going. They told us that they had some trouble in assembling a plasmid they needed. They tried a lot of ways to assemble the plasmid but failed and they asked us for help. They sent us the photo of their unsuccessful plasmid and after some analyses we suggested them using a method called Gibson Assembly. They adopted our opinions and did some try again. Later, they told us that they had made it successfully and we were all glad to hear that.
We also invited them"
