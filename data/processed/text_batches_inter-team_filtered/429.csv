Peking,2018,Team:Peking#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," point of view, realizing a possibility in engineering is of great significance in itself. This has enlightened us to summarize some abstract and modularized ‘potential properties’ in our project, apart from seeking practical applications of our bioparts.
We also realized that the main difficulty of our subject to build a low-cost fluorescence microscope lies in the cost of equipping it with a fluorescence light source. Fluorescence technology plays a significant part in synthetic biology research, but it is much too expensive for general industry. We talked about the possibility to lower the cost of fluorescence technology and think it is probably necessary to try to develop low precision and low cost fluorescence technology, especially since it has become quite common to utilize fluorescence in biotechnology.
We therefore communicated with Dr. Zong Yeqing, who showed us his self-made fluorescence stereomicroscope. A fluorescence stereomicroscope was needed in a project but there was none in the institute he works in, and it was not worthwhile to spend millions of RMB to buy one for a single project. So he built one himself. The total cost of his self-made fluorescence stereomicroscope is 1000 RMB (approx. 150 USD at the time of writing). It can be used for observation, incubation and heating. The communication with Dr. Zong Yeqing not only gave us hope for building a low-cost fluorescence instrument for production and medical research, but also reminded us of the significance of building low-cost instruments for scientific research itself.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Future#Economic potential analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," the natural bone                 structure as much as possible through the use of micro-organisms.
The positive consequences of using micro-organisms for bone engineering
Spot E.Shape can be used for the construction of a wide range of bone prosthesis. Here we focus on                 hip prosthesis. These are of particular interest because they still result in a high acute mortality rate and the risk of complications serious shortens the life expectancy of the patient. Thus it is useful to look for new ways to produce hip implants.
Recently, surgeons are using a 3D printed implants made of titanium, polymers or                 ceramics for hip transplantations. Here the patient’s CT scan is used to design                 an exact replica of the femoral head. Our project could optimize this design by                 using bacteria that form and precipitate calcium phosphate in a controlled way.                 From there a porous, spongy structure similar to the bone can be formed. It's possible that these bacteria have to be supported by some structure (e.g. titanium frame) to receive the necessary characteristics for the hip implant.                  Thereafter, this technique can also be used as a surface coating for the titanium alloy, so that the wear effects will be far less.
In order to identify and deal with the competitive implications of the so called                 salient attributes, we used the ACE Matrix (Attribute Categorization and                 Evaluation) by Ian C. MacMillan and Rita Gunther McGrath (7) applied to our                 orthopaedic device. The columns refer to the level of energy the attribute                 generate for the customer while the rows refer to the sentiment it provokes. (7) This analytic tool serves to identify the right mix and dynamic fit between                 the customer needs and the attributes of the product. (7) Particularly                 interesting are the powerful energizers that often become the determining factor                 for the purchase decision. The layer of calcium deposited by the bacteria can be                 seen as a coating for the titanium structure which reduces substantially the                 amount of constraint and wear of the prosthesis (Energizer). Wear is something that more                 traditional metallic and polyethylene prosthesis have to deal with. Other reasons why customers would be willing to buy our product (compared to the competitor's one), are its eco-friendliness and low material cost (possibly lower price).

An important issue is that dissatisfiers can encourage the customers (mostly                 surgeons) to opt for a competitor"

Anna Garvey
I am a Senior Biochemistry student at Wisconsin Lutheran College and have been an iGEM team member for three years. This year, I stepped away from the lab work to spend most of my time focusing on the Policy and Practices portion of the project. I was responsible for writing the various surveys, lecturing at the biotechnology informational event, writing portions of the wiki and doing general wiki editing.  As graduation is approaching, I’ve started to seriously think of what I am going to do after my undergraduate education is through. This is terrifying. Ultimately, I do hope to either attend graduate school to obtain my Ph.D or attend medical school. Until then; however,  I am going to take a few years off in to pursue other dreams of mine. Hopefully, I will spend the next portion of my life teaching students English in various countries across the world through programs such as Friends of China and Hearts of Change. During the summers, I plan to focus on writing a book and traveling the rest of the world. That’s the true dream if I’m being honest with you. There are 6.8 billion people in the world and I want to meet all of them and see their cultures and learn from them all that I can. So that’s the plan. And like I said last year, I really don’t know what I want to do yet, or where I want to go, but I do know that I want to strive to lead a happy life and I suppose that is all I need.

I am a senior Biochemistry major with the intent of going to medical school. This year is my second as a member of the iGEM team. While the first year I primarily did lab work, this last year I downsized my workload, due to medical school applications, and spent my time with phage therapy research and the summer camp. My favorite part of iGEM was getting to know all the other members with many similar interests. My life outside of iGEM consists of working as an emergency medical technician, playing on the Wisconsin Lutheran College Tennis team, and playing the guitar.

Nanodrop - mutated dCas9 and backbone:
The concentrations of enzymatically digested pdCas9 and pSB1C3 were too low to be detected (negative values).
Therefore, the mutated pdCas9 and pSB1C3 were amplified via PCR to increase the amount. Further we plan on cutting the PCR product with restriction enzymes over two nights, before separation on gel and isolate the desired fragments. This may increase the concentration of the products after gel digestion. Probably, heat inactivation of the restriction enzymes after gel digestion and DNA isolation may be a good idea (most of the enzymes are separated from the DNA fragments on gel), before the ligation step.

Restriction digest of PCR-amplified mutdCas9 and pSB1C3; Media and agarose gel preparation; Inoculation
Goal:
Restriction digest of PCR-amplified mutated dCas9 and pSB1C3
Make LB and M63B1 medium
Make 0.8% agarose GelRed and GelGreen
Inoculation of LB medium with transformed bacteria
Procedure:
Restriction digest of mutated dCas9 and pSB1C3:
PCR-amplified dCas9 and pSB1C3 were digested in separate tubes. The restriction mixtures were made by combining:
17 µL PCR-amplification product (mutated dCas9 or pSB1C3)
2 µL NEB 2.1 buffer
0.5 µL EcoRI-HF
0.5 µL PstI
The restriction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for two days.
Media preparation
Both, LB and M63B1 medium were prepared as described previously (____). The pH was adjusted to 7.1-7.2 by adding NaOH. The media were autoclaved and stored for later use.
Agarose gel preparation
For preparation of 200 mL of both GelGreen and GelRed 0.8% agarose gel, 1.6 g agarose was added to 200 mL 1xTAE. The solution was heated in a microwave until the agarose was completely dissolved (approximately 3 min at maximum heat). The gel was cooled down before 10 µL of dye (GelGreen or GelRed) was added.
Colony picking and inoculation

Signal Output
the detection circuit
To measure the sweetness of sweeteners, we designed the detection device consisting of the promoter Pfus, the reporter gene mRFP, and the terminator CYC1t.
Fig.1 The detection circuit
The upstream signal will be produced when the human sweet taste receptor T1R2-T1R3 detects sweeteners, the signal can be transmitted to detection device through the MAPK pathway which exists in yeast naturally. And this signal will activate the promoter Pfus specificity, thereby initiating the expression of the mRFP reporter gene.
In order to construct the detection circuit, firstly, we connected the three parts Pfus , mRFP, and CYC1t by OE-PCR. However, the results were not as good as we expected. So we changed the method to Gibson assembly to connect this device with the linear plasmid pRS42K.
Fig.2 construction of detection circuit by Gibson assembly
pRS42K is a kind of shuttle vector which can be used both in E.coli and yeast. After finishing the construction in E.coli, we transformed the plasmid into competent cell CEN.PK2-1C by LiAc transformation.
In order to make sure the detection circuit works, we cultivated two types of haploids S.cerevisiae, CEN.PK2-1D(α type) and CEN.PK2-1C(a type) together and observed them by fluorescence microscopy. The CEN.PK2-1D(α type) can excrete a pheromone which can be detected by the pheromone receptor Ste2 positioning on the membrane of CEN.PK2-1C(a type). After detecting the signal, our reporter device will express mRFP. Besides, we also used purified α pheromone to test the function of our device.
Group A: transformed CENPK2-1C(a type) and CENPK2-1D(α type)
Group B: transformed CENPK2-1C(a type) alone
Group C: CENPK2-1"

Flavor improvement
The thought of eating E. coli does not sound that delicious – and that is why we want our OneProt to taste like lemon. Though the cloning proved unsuccessful. However, we have characterised  an odor-free E. coli strain and compared it with a wild type K12 MG1655 E. coli strain. We have used Ion Mobility Spectroscopy to analyse the two strains, since we deemed it among the best methods to analyse odors. From the results it was shown that the odor-free strain does not produce indole, which is the compound responsible for the characteristic odor of E. coli.
Added parts and devices
To the great iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts we have added 3 basic parts, 2 regulatory devices, 1 constitutively active production device and 4 regulable production devices.

PoPs is equivalent to the flow of RNA polymerase molecules along DNA ( Julien and Calendar, 1996  ; iGEM Team Cambridge, 2007 ).
Figure 9: Gene sequence of final test construct including Sensitivity Tuner elements.
Purpose of Sensitivity Tuner application
We presumed weak expression rates of our reporter luciferase indicated by pretesting the native system <partinfo>K389015</partinfo>. For having a broader range of quantification for our prototype test system, an amplification device was implemented.  For amplifying the output signal of luciferase induced by acetosyringone, three sensitivity tuners, distinguished by the amplification factor, were combined with our detection system. To modify the sensitivity tuner for our purpose we took BioBricks with amplification factors from 10 (<partinfo>I746380</partinfo>) to 35 (<partinfo>I746390</partinfo>), removed the pBAD/araC promoter (<partinfo>I0500</partinfo>) and GFP read out (<partinfo>E0040</partinfo>) and replaced it by the reporter gene luciferase <partinfo>K389004</partinfo>(Figure 9). This enhanced luciferase BioBrick was assembled to the VirA/G signaling system BioBrick. The benefits of luciferase as reporter gene instead of GFP are a broader range of measurement, higher sensitivity and low half-live making cinetic tests possible ( Williams et al.1989 ).

Receptor modification strategy
The smartest way of receptor-modification is initiated by a silico approach based on a 3D structure of the native receptor. Followed by primer mutagenesis of the computantional gained results a precise adapted peptide emerges. This concept has been proven by Looger et al., 2003 .
Because of time limitations within the iGEM competition and a lack of biological data in literature - no x-ray cristalography structure data for VirA linker region available- this strategy was not applicable.  Therefore we developed two different stragies in our MARSS project:
The first strategy was an error prone PCR approach by building a mutant data base for selection. The second strategy was a primer mutagenesis based approach.
Random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR (EP-PCR)

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Tag-Optimization_-_-_TEXT.html,"
After applying the domain border combination A2 (see Fig. 6 ) to all T-domains we inserted to the indC gene, we quantified the amount of indigoidine produced per cell density of E. coli cells expressing both the engineered indC variant and a PPTase (Sfp, Svp, EntD or DelC). We used a Tecan infinite M200 plate reader and applied the quantitative indigoidine assay described in the methods section. Fig. 10 shows the relative indigoidine production of representative samples in this measurement, illustrated as a heat map. The indigidine production strongly varies among different combinations of T-domains and PPTases. Notably, one of the engineered indigoidine synthetases is more efficient than the native enzyme itself. This most efficient indigoidine synthetase carries the synthetic T-domain #3. With this remarkable finding we wanted to have a closer view at structural aspects of this enzyme. Currently, the crystal structures of both the native IndC and our optimized variant are investigated by the group of Dr. Bange (Philipps-Universität Marburg).
Figure 10: Combinations of Engineered Indigoidine Synthetases and PPTases differ in Efficiency. E. coli TOP10 cells were co-transformed with engineered variants of the indigoidine synthetase indC and different PPTases. The x-axis depicts four variants of indC, in which the T-domain has been replaced (1: native indC; 2: indC with synthetic T-domain  1; 3: indC with synthetic T-domain 3; 4: indC with synthetic T-domain 4 (please find the Methods section for detailled informations on the synthetic T-domains) and a E. coli negative control expressing an unfunctional indigoidine synthetase, in which a random sequence was inserted. The y-axis indicates four different PPTases we used (1: sfp from B. subtilis; 2: svp from S. verticillus; 3: entD from E. coli; 4: delC from D. acidovorans). The color of each field indicates the maximal relative amount of indigoidine production per cell density by cells expressing the respective indigoidine synthetase and PPTase. Remarkably, when coexpressed with EntD, the engineered indigoidine synthetases with the synthetic T-domains 1, 3 and 4 result in higher indigoidine"

Brucella is a notorious human-bird virus. What laws has this smuggle broken?
Vice Professor Wang:
I’ve learnt about the news on Xinhua.com. Smuggling pathogens illegally, is violating the Canada “Export and Import Permits Act”, “Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act”, and “Human Pathogens and Toxins Act” and so on.
BNU-China:
Do we have similar laws and regulations in China to prevent cases alike?
Vice Professor Wang:
Domestically, we have Health Law, in which such cases are stated illegal, but no corresponding penalty is clarified. Just like smuggling pathogens, many other conducts violating scientific ethics currently don’t have relevant rules and regulations specified in China. We can only make the sentences with Criminal Law, in respect to the harm already done on people.
BNU-China:
Do such cases involve in academic ethics issues, or smuggling property right?
Vice Professor Wang:
Of course, such deeds undoubtedly violate the academic ethics, but considering China currently doesn’t have clarified regulation, we can’t define it as property right smuggling. Only after related regulations are stated and enacted can we call it illegal.  In case of these violations, it is also controversial regarding which clauses to refer to, as well as which penalties to sentence.
BNU-China:
As Professor Zhirong Sun in Tsinghua University pointed out, development in synthetic biology could bolster the innovation and progress in energy, environment, and many other fields. Synthetic biology would even emerge as the fourth biggest industry following auto-manufacture, real estate, and tourism. Then, are there any related legislations?
Vice Professor Wang:
There’s indeed a bright outlook for synthetic biology. But we currently don’t have many related clauses; the only few counted are in “Law of the PRC on Science and Technology Progress”.  However, this law was enacted back in 1992; it’s a question to think how much of it can we adopt onto the newly-emerged synthetic biology.
As with legislation, I propose to start making beforehand. For instance, the outbreak of SARS in 2003 had highlighted the urgent need of infectious diseases regulations; “Law of the Peoples Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infections Diseases” was thus born in 2004 as a response.  We currently have “General Rules for Biosafety"

EJN transformed with pJQ200SK-OmpA/PbrR was selected from LB agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics, and the resulting strain was designated EJNC.
Culture  Conditions.
LB broth for E. coli JM109 growth contained 10g/L tryptone, 10 g/L NaCl,  and 5 g/L yeast extract. KPM minimal medium was adopted for all nitrogen  fixation assays and contained per liter 1040 mg Na2HPO4, 3400 mg KH2PO4, 26 mg CaCl2·2H2O, 30 mg MgSO4, 7.5 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.3mg MnSO4, 8000 mg glucose, 500 mg casein hydrolysate, 36  mg ferric citrate, 10 mg para-aminobenzoic acid, 5 mg biotin, and 1 mg vitamin  B1, supplied with 10 mM (NH4)2SO4 (KPM-HN) for  pregrowth or 10 mM glutamate (KPM-LN) for nitrogenase activity assays.  Antibiotics were supplemented as required at the following concentrations: 100 μg/mL of ampicillin, and 20 μg/mL of gentamycin.
Quantitative  Real-time PCR.
After harvesting bacteria from  LB medium, purification of total RNA was performed using RNAiso Plus reagent (TaKaRa,  Japan) following the protocol described by the manufacturer. One microgram of  qualified total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with a PrimeScript  RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser per the manufacturer’s  instructions (TaKaRa, Japan). qRT-PCR of the  resulting cDNA was performed with gene-specific primers (Table 1) on a CFX  Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA) with a SYBR Premix Ex Taq  (Tli RNaseH Plus) Kit (TaKaRa, Japan). Standard curves of cDNA dilutions were used to determine the PCR efficiency. An expression data analysis was performed  by the Pfaffl method of relative quantification using CFX Manager 3.1 software (Bio-Rad, USA).

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Localization_-_-_TEXT.html," we tested a total of three signal peptides - one taken from the parts registry, and two designed by ourselves.
The EGFR signal peptide was taken from the iGEM parts registry ( BBa_K157001 ) and combined with a BioBrick encoding the CMV promoter sequence ( BBa_K747096 ) via the RFC10 cloning standard.
The BM40 and Igκ signal peptides were designed by us, providing additional spacing as well as a Kozak sequence to the 5'-UTR of the constructs and combined with a BioBrick encoding the CMV promoter sequence ( BBa_K747096 ) via the RFC10 cloning standard.
As shown below, the EGFR signal peptide taken from the parts registry is constructed in a way that the signal peptide ORF immediately follows the RFC10 cloning scar after the CMV promoter, thus resulting in a very short 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of the transcribed mRNA. The combination of the CMV promoter with the synthesized BM40 and Igκ signal peptides allows for a considerably longer 5’ UTR of the resulting mRNA - additionally allowing them to contain a full Kozak consensus sequence by design. The Kozak sequence is recognized by the ribosome as a translational start site; this element missing or deviating from the consensus sequence may considerably decrease translation efficiency. [2] For the EGFR signal peptide construct, a Kozak sequence is not present, as it would have to preceed the start codon ATG - a position which is occupied by the RFC10 cloning scar. Since both, the distance from the promoter to the open reading frame as well as the Kozak consensus sequence are considered crucial parameters for expression levels [3] , BM40 and Igκ signal peptide constructs are likely to resut in increased expression levels compared to proteins containing the EGFR signal peptide from the parts registry.
As the functionality of the signal peptides had to be determined before including one of these into the final receptor constructs, the three options (Igκ, BM40, EGFR) were tested via bioinformatic tools as well as by conducting a secretion assay of luciferase constructs.

During our experiment, we independently proposed some creative ideas and tested them.
Firstly, when we measure the OD 600 of bacteria fluid, we often use 1ml fluid each time. But to keep the total volume, which makes it no effect on the subsequent measurement, we need to make a lot of LB medium and cultivate a large amount of bacteria for one time, which is not economical.
Accidentally, we used nanodrop to measure OD600 in iHuman institution where has no common spectrophotometer. Nanodrop is a kind of instrument which only needs very little liquid to measure OD, which could largely saves LB liquid medium and simplifies the procedure of measurement. However, for that the optical path is not the same for nanodrop and common spectrophotometer, it is necessary to make the standard curve which could ensure the corresponding OD of nanodrop for each bacteria’s growth stage. We used the same sample to be measured by nanodrop and spectrophotometer, and then made this curve from these data, getting the coefficient for the translation of OD600 of common spectrophotometer to nanodrop.
Figure 10. The standard curve which showed the coefficient of the translation from value of OD 600 of spectrophotometer to that of nanodrop

Random-mutagenesis PACE
Following our first PACE tests based on the the split T7 RNAP paper, we designed a new PACE test, using our modeling to estimate the glucose concentration in the lagoons as well as in the turbidostat. First tested in a pre-test using PREDCEL, we tried to transfer equivalent conditions yielding mutations in PREDCEL on the PACE apparatus. In order to do that, an alternative bacterial strain which contains the pJC175e plasmid, a plasmid usually used for plaque assays, providing geneIII under a psp-promotor for all phages was used. In addition to this propagation plasmid, MP1 and MP4 were transformed into one strain respectively. These strains were used for propagation of phages, used for the Dickinson-PACE testing too. Since the Dickinson-phage propagates in previously performed pre-experiments very well, the effect of the concurrent performed propagation and mutagenesis should be at its maximum. This is further underlined by the fact that in this case, geneIII is provided for free. Thus, there should be no selection pressure except from pressure on the best propagation regarding codon optimisation. Beyond that, a lot of random mutations should be observed when the MPs work reliable. To reach this point, three days of mutations using the MP1 and the MP4 strain simultanously in two turbidostats with one lagoon for each turbidostat were implemented. Sequencings were performed by picking eight plaques of each lagoon from the last sample included into the plaque assay. In this case, phage washout was not observed, displaying a phage titer which were settled between 10^4 and 10^7 in both lagoons.
Figure 12: Design of the Accessory Plasmids for the Evolution of Cas9
The AP consists of five subparts that are devided by homology regions for Gibson assembly (numbers). It carries an expression cassette for the transcription of a gRNA (between 1 and 5).  GeneVI (2-3) is under control of a that can be activated by the Cas9-rpoZ in context with the respective gRNA. luxAB accounts as a reporter for fluorescent readout of geneIII activation (3-4). The whole plasmid can be produced with different origins of replication (4-5) to modulate the copy number and by exchanging the geneVI part with the RBS.
Sanger sequencing results from these plaques showed a high number of different mutations in the "

Terrapin Farms
Next we spoke to Terrapin Farms, an organic hydroponic farm that uses Nutrient Film Technique systems, where they grow microbes in the plant growth water to improve the flavor of their greens. We wanted to learn about the use of microbes in farming, since ultimately that is what we would like to do. They do not face any additional legal regulation since their bacteria are sourced from the soil and not transgenic. In order to keep their bacteria alive, Terrapin uses molasses instead of traditional nutrient solutions containing salts and citric acid. The molasses not only provides a source of sugar for the bacteria, but also helps control the pH of the solution. We discovered that people do not seem to have a problem with the microbes because soil farming also has bacteria. Like most traditional hydroponic farms, Terrapin has high hopes in hydroponics' role in future food production. They reinforced the idea that hydroponics has the ability to allow farming in areas less amenable to traditional agriculture.

We sought out small hydroponic farms in order to learn more about their challenges and what was obstructing them from expansion. Nathaniel Shaw is the Hydroponic Production Manager at Karma Farms, which is a small farm that focuses on year-round production of greens to the local community. His farm struggles with low margins and inconsistent crop yields. We discovered that he hopes to improve crop yield with a better lighting system and more automation for measurements such as pH and temperature. He emphasized the need for consistent crop yields to keep the business going.

We talked to John Bolton, who revealed that the biggest problems in hydroponics revolve around maintaining a controlled environment. Heating is an important part of control because of the cold winters in upstate NY. He mentioned to us that one of the biggest causes of hydroponics farms failing was labor costs.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"Rimmer, 2008), Rimmer observes ‘The reasoning here is somewhat odd - the Opposition Division dismisses the ethical and human rights objections of the opponents by characterizing them as merely economic arguments.  The decision highlights how the European Patent Office narrowly construes exclusions from patentable subject matter on the basis of ‘ordre public or morality’’
The problems of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) are of course not a factor solely for synthetic biology.  However, given the role these have played in related fields of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, synthetic biologists must start to take action now to avoid a repetition of past injustices.  Patents are supposed to encourage innovation, but once again, extreme positions have clouded a fair debate.  Few are arguing for a complete abolition of property rights and copyrights of any kind, but ‘TRIPs was designed to ensure higher-priced medicines.  Unfortunately, those prices made medicines unaffordable to all but the wealthiest individuals.  As they signed TRIPs, the trade ministers were so pleased they finally reached an agreement that they didn’t notice they were signing a death warrant for thousands of people’ (Stiglitz, 2006).  And that is ultimately what it comes down to, the deaths of thousands across the developing world, for lack of drugs despite the fact that for drug companies for instance ‘African sales represent under 2 percent of the total’ (Stiglitz, 2006).  ‘The instrumental position is that the human right of a corporation to protect its intellectual property trumps the medical need of a sick person’ (Saul, 2001).  Saul rejects as “pseudo-rational” the intellectual property arguments saying ‘The terminology used is terrifyingly clear about how reason is thought of.  It is to be essentially utilitarian.  Thought – of which the intellect is an element – is merely property.’  He furthermore highlights problems of ‘a civilization to attempt to live off licensed knowledge is the intellectual re-creation of the old absentee landlord problem.’  Stiglitz doesn’t even give it that much credit, ‘If you own a piece of land, you can do with it as you please, so long as you remain within the law: obeying zoning requirements, not establishing a brothel, or – most important for our purposes – not conspiring with others who own similar properties to create a monopoly that, left unchecked, may lower economic efficiency and threaten public welfare. …By contrast, intellectual property rights actually create a monopoly.  The monopoly power generates"

Introduction
Not only was the Synthetic Promoter Library (SPL) used as a method for attempting to characterize lambda’s N-antiterminator protein, it was also used as a proof of concept experiment for the BBF RFC 63 – DTU Synthetic Promoter Library Standard where we decided to ligate it in front of BBa_I13507 , which contains BBa_E1010 - an RFP gene and BBa_B0015 - a double terminator that consists of parts BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012. The results of this experiment will be outlined in this section, which will be followed by a section elucidating how the BBF RFC 63 DTU standard was developed and its subsequent advantages.
Construction of BioBricks
The SPL + I13507 construct was ligated into the BioBrick plasmid backbone pSB3T5, this due to pSB3T5 being a low to medium copy number plasmid which contains the p15A replication of origin and a tetracycline resistance marker. The expression of RFP via an SPL would best be controlled and measured through a low copy number plasmid in case too high expression of RFP proved to be detrimental to the cell’s viability, therefore pSB3T5 was chosen as the backbone as it had the best range of copy number amongst the other backbones within the parts-registry. The pSB2K3 backbone could have been used as well, though pSB3T5 gave us more flexibility with the construct as additional regulatory elements were not required such as the case with pSB2K3.
Characterization
The SPL technology was used in order to create a BioBrick compatible standard for fine tuning the expression of BioBrick parts and devices. The methodology used in this proof of concept and what was documented in the standard has slight differences, although the main technology was unchanged, namely the SPL. The differences will"

Pitt iGEM - University of Pittsburgh
We collaborated with the Pitt iGEM team to characterize osmolarity sensitive promoters. Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) require high salt and low oxygen conditions to grow. Therefore genetically engineering a strain of bacteria that can report osmolarity in environments such as oil pipelines and then activate a remediation circuit would be beneficial.
Firstly the promoter was tested by making a sensor with a fluorescent protein reporter. The sensor will induce expression of RFP when osmolarity is high. The sensor can be utilized to measure salt concentrations to determine if SRB can survive. The promoter can then be used to produce Dispersin B enzyme to degrade the biofilm where SRB  can accumulate and ultimately, corrode the pipes. With the deadlines approaching, we shared the sequences for the osmolarity sensors with Pitt iGEM.
The two versions of the sensor, which were designed, include the native wild-type promoter sequence of Escherichia coli proU operon (REF) and the optimized Consensus promoter sequence (Lucht and Bremer, 1990), which is a synthetic sequence with mutations previously discovered to increase expression of the operon that codes for a binding protein-dependent transport system.
In this collaboration, Pitt iGEM team cloned the constructs and transformed them into MACH1-T1 cells with the help from Dr. Telmer , who is our PI. Then they proceeded to test growth of the cells in LB media with varying concentrations of sodium chloride. Finally, RFP fluorescence levels of these different cultures were measured to determine osmolarity regulated RFP expression in cells with WT and the Consensus promoters compared to the negative control.
CMUQ will transform these constructs into DH5a to account for differential expression over different bacterial strains. These studies show that promoter activity increased in conditions of high osmolarity and salt. The next step is to have the proU promoter drive Dispersin B expression to degrade the biofilms. If the cells can be concentrated at areas of high SRB growth this will be more efficient.
Since the Pitt iGEM’s project works with optical control of bacteria movement,"
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts, millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [5]. The infection of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [9].
If farmers had the possibility to know when to treat their horses, prevention of mass rupture and other severe consequences like increased resistance development could be achieved. To reach this goal we have developed a model that (based on multiple parameters) calculates the optimal amount of treatments in a specified period. This will avoid unnecessary use of anthelmintics by raising the awareness in farmers regarding when they actually need to treat their horses.
Current Methods for Detection
Currently the only method for detecting/counting how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal    samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires time sensitive shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing; treating their horses regardless of need which contributes to the resistance problem [10].
Resistance Development
Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection  of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [2,4]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance [2].
Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [14,15].
Due to all of these facts, we have during our iGEM project developed a reporter that is suitable for the in vivo environment of horse intestines. Moreover, we have developed new applications on existing techniques to be able to find the promoter that would be coupled to the reporter which would at last create the worm buster.

Our experiment was successful and the results confirmed our hypothesis.  Charlie and Ogaga further explored different promoters and regulators and completed the basic biobrick sequence for the project. With this done, Dr. Smith was able to order the necessary sequence from the California-based DNA synthesis company, DNA 2.0.
Christina and Lamya continued emailing and calling sponsors while Max continued structuring the team wiki.
Day 2:
The team discussed and researched conjugation and drug-delivery as potential applications of our project.  We then explored the IGEM registry for biobricks that could help us test the feasibility of these applications.
Later on we brainstormed ideas for our human practices project and discussed some potential questions that could be addressed.
Day 3:
As a part of our human practices project, the team decided to explore the possibility of conducting a meta analysis on the data provided by the human practices projects of previous iGEM teams, in order to find some correlations between the projects of different universities around the world.
Sam, Ogaga and Lamya collated the data for all the 2010 human practices projects and ran some basic statistical analysis tests.  They concluded that the projects were too divergent to show any significant trends that could be used to draw conclusions, leading us to abandon the idea of using this idea as our human practices project.
Day 4:
We prepared and practiced the presentation we planned to give at the UK iGEM Meet-up in Norwich on Monday.  Max continued working on the wiki. Charlie and Ogaga concentrated on designing some experiments protocols to test the final project once our kill switch was created.
Day 5:
The team discussed further potential ideas for the human practices component of our project, and we agreed on an innovative project to hold a debate at the World Schools Debating Championships, being held 20 minutes away in Dundee in 3 weeks time. This project however required support external event organizers, so we drew a clear human practices plan and contacted the relevant parties.
Week 3 - 25/07/11
Day 1 and 2:
The St Andrews iGEM team flew to Norwich to participate in the UK iGEM meeting, where we presented our project idea and progress to date to 7 other university iGEM teams (including Cambridge, University College London, Edinburgh University, and more). At Norwich, we were able to interact with other iGEM team members and were given advice by various professors that had volunteered their time"

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Yeast_-_-_TEXT.html," would be necessary to optimize either yeast growth or fermentation through the Crabtree effect. In this way, the Crabtree effect could be monitored (perhaps even online) by measuring fluorescence and used to regulate the amount of glucose to be fed.
EXPERIMENTAL OUTLINE
- We ordered the DNA constructions: pADH2-YAP1 protein and pTRR-GFP protein that were cloned in plasmid pUC57 with a bacterial origin of replication.
- We obtain the Yeplac181 and Yep352 yeast vectors by our laboratory.
- We carried out four transformations of E. coli strain DH5, one for each plasmid DNA (the two constructions and the two vectors), in order to amplify them. See the Transformation Protocol Using Heat Shock .
- We obtained several E. coli transformants in four plates and took some colonies of each DNA construction (from both constructions and both vectors) and cultured them in liquid medium over night at 37ºC in shaking flasks.
- A day after, we extracted the plasmid DNA. See the Mini-preps protocol. See the Mini-prep Protocol .
- We obtained the purified constructions (both in pUC57 plasmid) and the vectors for yeast (YEplac181 and YEp352) also purified. See the Protocol for Gel Extraction
- We digested the four DNAs with restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI in order to obtain compatible ends. See the Digestion Protocol .
- We ligated the pTRR-GFP construction with the Yep352 vector and the ADH2-YAP1 construction with the Yeplac181 vector. See the ligation Protocol .
- The day after that we transformed E. coli with the results of the ligation in order to amplify the final constructions (pTRR-GFP/Yep352 and pADH2-YAP1/YEplac181). We located the recombinant constructs using X-Gal and white/blue selection.
- We took some of these white colonies and cultured them in liquid medium overnight at 37ºC in shaking flasks.
- The day after we extracted the plasmid DNA. See the Mini-prep Protocol .
- After this, we checked the final purified recombinant constructs by electrophoresis, restriction digest and DNA capilar sequencing.
- We introduced the first of the DNA recombinant plasmids in the yeast. See the Yeast transformation protocol .
- We selected the transformants by growth in solid and liquid mineral medium attending to the auxotrophic markers and checked the presence of the construction by PCR."

Athens Science Festival @Athens Technopolis, Greece
Our team participated in the annual Athens Science Festival on April 2018, an event organized by Sci-Co (Science Communication) that brings together students, teachers, professors and researchers, families, and everyone sharing one passion: science.
Students of all ages, from elementary school to university students, joined our discussions. Because of the variety of age groups and their respective biological background, our approach was more fundamental and our team focused on the basics of Biology. Among the discussions, the following were included:
Experimental demonstrations:
Microorganisms of everyday life: Sampling from everyday objects and places (cell phone, bus, toilet sink, sunglasses), we presented different types of bacterial and fungal colonies that are present in our daily routine.
Fluorescent Bacteria: Taking the demonstration one step further, we transformed E. coli by adding a plasmid containing the GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) encoding gene. Shining a blacklight on our petri dish, everyone was able to observe the fluorescence. At the same time, we engaged in discussions concerning the origin of GFP and how it is possible for a bacterium to attain the fluorescence ability.
Discussion on the basics of life: Engaging elementary and high school students we discussed about life, living organisms, cells, bacteria, viruses, the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and, finally, the ability to intervene and tinker with the genome of a selected organism.
After the aforementioned discussion, we asked the students to leave their impressions on paper, either by doodling or by writing biology-related words and phrases, based on what caught their attention. The result is presented below. Surprisingly enough, when asked to draw bacteria, and while having no blueprints on how to do so or relevant images, the students let their imagination run wild, taking inspiration from the preceding discussion.

Amsterdam,2011,Team:Amsterdam#Biobricks#Basic Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," originally found in cryophillic bacteria which thrive in cold environments, like the Arctic. The selected proteins are:
Cpn10 and Cpn60, from Oleispira antarctica
SheDnaK, from Shewanella sp. AC10
CspA and CspC, from Polaribacter irgensii
All these proteins are, at least to a certain degree, homologous to chaperone proteins endogenous to E. coli. In addition, function loss of these endogenous chaperones is associated with cold-induced systems failure. Theoretically, expression of the cryophile chaperones listed above compensates for the loss of function endogenous chaperones experience at low temperatures, in doing so mitigating the impact of these temperatures on cellular activity.
Note that because of the many different levels at which cold-induced systems failure can occur, many different ways of characterising cold resistance are employed in different articles. Two prevalent ones used to characterise our CryoBricks are:
the effect expression of a (combination of) protein(s) has on an organism's ability to survive freezing and thawing
the effect expression of a (combination of) protein(s) has on an organism's specific growth rate at suboptimal temperatures
Especially the latter interpretation is of value to some of our applications . Below, you'll find information on the biology of the selected chaperones, detailling how they contribute to cold resistance in E. coli. For more information on the methods and results of characterising them, refer to the CryoBrick characterisation page.
Unfortunately, because transferring the parts to the pSB1C3 backbone proved too difficult in most cases, only BBa_K538000 and BBa_K538004 could be submitted to the registry as individual parts.

Cpn10 and Cpn60 are homologous to GroES and GroEL of E. coli, respectively. The GroEL/ES chaperone system promotes the folding and/or assembly of over 30% of E. coli"

We assisted Team ShanghaiTechChina_B with IBD (inflammatory bowel diseases) animal model establishment to confirm the function of EGF derived from modified E.coli to prove the effect of the peptide in vivo.
✓ iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).
During the project, HP devoted to study and investigate different aspects closely related to our project including ethics, law and legislation, safety, product analysis, even summary of room for improvement by the methods of literature studying, interview, questionnaire, attending Cell Therapy Annual Meeting etc. HP also had dialogues with high school students, college students and ordinary citizens.
Gold Medal (All are met.)
✓ Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).
The proof of concept was fully described on our Proof of Concept page. We explained and confirmed characteristics of our parts, such as BBa_K1993005, BBa_K1993009 and so on.
✓ Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
To make it a perfect project, HP devoted to study and investigate different aspects closely related to our project including ethics, law and legislation, safety, product analysis, even summary of room for improvement by the methods of literature studying, interview, questionnaire, attending Cell Therapy Annual Meeting etc. What made it specific was that we have been improving our project with the ongoing of HP work. Our HP also had dialogues with high school students, college students and ordinary citizens.
✓ Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions"

I Introdution
    The game “E.coli War” is designed based on our fluid model. In the game, E.coli are divided into two groups, with each group having three kinds of E.coli: warriors, farmers and beggars.
Warriors can attack the enemy
Farmers can provide food for others
Beggars just consume resources
PS：The nutrient produced by farmers can be utilized by all E.coli. It can simulate grabbing of the enemy's grain during a war.
II Rule
    There are 60,000 E.coli at the beginning of a game. They are divided equally into farmers,warriors and beggars. You and AI will get a total of 30,000 E.coli, but the distribution of each kind of E.coli is random. The game is composed of five rounds. In each round, you can allocate 6,000 E.coli .The maximal number of E.coli that your group eventually reach will be your grade. If your grade is greater than that of AI, then you win this round. If you win three rounds, then congratulations, you win the game!

Conferences
NCTU Conference
During July 19th, 2015-July 24th, 2015, NCTU Conference was organized and held by National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Taiwan, Hsinchu. Our team, BNU-China, had the chance to exhibit our project in the conference. During the conferecne, we introduced our project to the whole attendees. Meanwhile, communication and mutual learning among the teams provided us with the opportunity to broad our horizon and help us acquaint more people with our project as well as our university, Beijing Normal University (BNU).
Figure 8. BNU-CHINA in NCTU Conference
Owing to the strong line-up of the attendees, including several well-known universities, we got the chance to illustrate the harm of nematodes and the aim of our project to the most outstanding biological researchers in Asia, aiming to make corporate progress during the communication. From the perspective of synthetic biology, we were looking forward to finishing the transformation of E. coli by the means of genetic engineering. At the same time, we were hoping to enrich our research content as well as promote its feasibility and application value by using mathematical modeling and device invention. It was thought to help bring up a more eco-friendly, economical and effective method to prevent and eliminate nematode  disaster compared with the current one. The exchange experience made our original idea step out of BNU, and made us move forward to Asia, even to the world. The prospect encouraged our team members and offered us new inspirations and ideas which were the significant innovation of synthetic biology in biological control. Besides, the summit managed to urge undergraduates to apply the theory into practice, which is an alternative starting point for students to go out of laboratory and meet the social demand. It had fully revealed modern undergraduates’ consciousness and determination for the social responsibility.
CCiC
On August 14th, 2015, BNU-CHINA took part in the CCiC in Peking University, which was hosted by Peking University. A greater number of teams participated in this conference than the NCTU conference. After preparing for a month, we had a better experiment design scheme, achieved positive"

We also miniprepped our pA13AW cultures. After, we vector dephosphorylated pA13CZ, pC13P, and pCg13Y for fluorescent characterization constructs. We then ligated PgpdA with GFP, pC13AQ with pC13Y, pC13P and mRFP, pC13P with GFP, pA13CZ with GFP, and pA13CZ with mRFP. All ligations were then electroporated and incubated overnight. We sent pC13BX and pC13CJ to sequencing. We digested and ligated pC13CJ and pAK13D and electroporated into DH5a cells. We miniprepped and made glycerol stocks of pC13CG 1,3,4 (labeled TEMP). We will make sure to go back and throw out extras and failed attempts after sequencing results return. We sent pC13CG 3 in for sequencing, using the last of our DNA, meaning if we need more it will have to come from the glycerol stock. We performed our second attempt at site directed mutagenesis of pAh13G with a longer extension time. We recreated and digested inserts pC13A and pC13F (XbaI, PstI). We ligated pC13I and pC13J. pC13AF electroporation did not yield any colonies. We made glycerol stocks of pC13AG, pAK13CR, pAK13CS, pAK13BU, pC13CC, and pC13CD and put them at -80 degrees C. We miniprepped the successful pAK13BU, pC13CC, and pC13CD and prepared them for sequencing. We also ran colony PCRs of pC13BR and pC13BQ, and set up overnight cultures of the successful constructs.
We did a bunch of ligations and are continuing cloning of PgpdA, Anderson promoter with T7 Polymerase, GFP, geneticin resistance, and a strong RBS. We ligated pC13I and pC13AF.

TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Project#Detailed_-_-_TEXT.html," or attachment for example), which is directly linked to the DOPA content and the presence of their additional characteristic residues. (Haemers, 2003)
The similarity between all five mussel foot proteins is that they contain a certain amount of tyrosine. The exact amount of tyrosine relates to the final function of the protein. Tyrosine is namely the compound gives adhesive properties to the protein. After hydroxylation of tyrosine, by tyrosinase and additional required compounds, an extra hydroxyl-group is added to the benzene ring, which will lead to an active catechol-group.  (Haemers, 2003) The catechol-groups in the DOPA can form strong bonds with catechol-groups on adjacent DOPA molecules.  The internal strength of the mussel glue (so called cohesion) is based on the amount of cross-links between polymer chains of the individual adhesive proteins. The “free” catechol groups, thus those which do not cross-link, determine the adhesive properties of the glue. (Waite, 1985) (Pizzi, Mittal and Dekker, 1994)
The five mussel foot proteins seem to differ on one hand by the content of DOPA present in the protein and on the other hand the presence of the other residues. The other residues determine par example if the protein is able to form disulphide bonds etc. (Haemers. 2003) During our project we focus on mfp5, since this mussel foot protein has the highest content of DOPA, which is beneficial for our StickE. Coli.
Biofilms
Using the term biofilm, matrix-enclosed bacterial populations can be described. This extracellular matrix, which is also referred to as slime, is a complex formation, containing a wide variety of compounds such as extracellular DNA, proteins and polysaccharides . There are numerous bacterial species which form biofilms. Usually, the structure of a biofilm consist of more than one bacterial species. As one can understand, this all together makes formation of and the structure of a biofilm extremely complex and difficult to control and regulate.
On the other hand, the “idea” of biofilms could be very useful for many applications in industry for example  water-treatment facilities. As a result, in our project we aim to completely control the attachment and detachment of cells on substrate. Therefore, we will give Escherichia coli a simple, effective and controllable mechanism for binding on surfaces, namely binding by mussel"

Toxin-antitoxin Coupling
There are three types of toxin-antitoxin systems known by far, among which only type II is considered in our experiments and discussion. In type II systems, toxins and antitoxins are proteins encoded by small neighboring genes on a same operon[11]. The general reaction is:
\ \\                         mRNA_{toxin}\xrightarrow{k_{pt}}Toxin\\                         Toxin\xrightarrow{k_{dt}}\phi\\                         mRNA_{anti}\xrightarrow{k_{pa}}Antitoxin\\                         Antitoxin\xrightarrow{k_{da}}\phi\\                         mToxin+nAntitoxin\xrightarrow{k_1}TAcomplex\\                         mToxin+nAntitoxin\xleftarrow{k_{-1}}TAcomplex\\                         Toxin+Target\xrightarrow{k_{2}}Disfunction\\                         Toxin+Target\xleftarrow{k_{-2}}Disfunction
These reactions can be modelled in a set of ordinary differential equations as followings:
\frac{{{\rm{d}}\left[ {{\rm{Toxin}}} \right]}}{{{\rm{dt}}}} = {k_{pt}}\left[ {mRN{A_{toxin}}} \right] - {k_{dt}}\left[ {Toxin} \right] - {k_1}\left[ {Anti} \right]\left[ {Toxin} \right] + {k_{ - 1}}\left[ {TAComplex} \right] - {k_2}\left[ {{\rm{Disfunction}}} \right]\left[ {Toxin} \right] + {k_{ - 2}}\left[ {{\rm{Disfunction}}} \right]

Furthermore, we examined the cleavage product of the protection group we intended to use. We compared the required amounts of chemicals with the existing solution to the amount that would be needed for ours as well as the dangers those substances pose.
Exposure
In our daily lives we get in touch with the contents of liquid washing detergents in several situations:
A. Production
During production of washing detergents, the factory workers are potentially exposed to high doses of the inhibited protease. There is a risk of dermal contact and inhaling the compounds.
B. Home usage
When washing at home the washing detergent can be spilled onto the skin of user. Thereafter residues of the washing liquid can remain in the clothes because of incomplete rinsing and cause dermal exposure.
C. Drinking water
Waterborne substances like boric acid, which cannot be filtered out in purification plants expose consumers via their drinking water.

ONBY (Ortho-nitrobenzyl-tyrosine) and DMNBS (dimethyl-nitrobenzyl-serine) and their cleavage products ONB (2-nitrosobenzaldelyde) and DMNB (Dimethyl-nitrosobenzaldehyde) are not yet characterized in toxicology. Approximate predictions can be made through known data about similar chemicals as other nitroso compounds.

Creating ‘The E.ncapsulator’: in situ manufacture and oral delivery of human biopharmaceuticals
A major, yet unsolved, challenge in the pharmaceutical industry involves overcoming the harsh acidic environment of the stomach in order to deliver proteins to the gut. This year the Imperial College iGEM team has decided to tackle this problem by developing an innovative, self-contained drug fabrication and delivery system. In our 'E.ncapsulator', Escherichia coli will be engineered not only to efficiently manufacture important biopharmaceuticals, but also to coat and protect protein based drugs until release in the small intestine.
Furthermore, in order to create E.ncapsulator tablets for oral delivery, there has been much focus on designing and engineering a number of modules for implementation in E. coli. The modularity that is central to our project will be evident in the areas of protein drug production, self-encapsulation and genome deletion. Utilising the E.coli bacterium, we are creating a re-usable chassis that will allow the development of a range of biopharmaceuticals to be delivered to the gut. Our E.ncapsulator is therefore intended as an elegant solution to, not one, but a range of human ailments and conditions, which cannot currently be successfully treated by oral drugs.
The first module involves engineering E. coli to synthesise the protein drug of interest to sufficient quantities. Once accomplished, activation of module two initiates the encapsulation phase, in which E. coli coats itself in a protective layer of colanic acid to form the E.ncapsulator. This protective capsule is what shields the biopharmaceutical against the harsh acidic environment of the stomach. The third module, genome deletion, is composed of a ‘suicide trigger’ mechanism that destroys the genetic material of the bacteria. Finally, once in the small intestine, the capsule will be naturally degraded by enzymes present, thereby releasing the designed biopharmaceutical to the gut micro biota where it can carry out its intended function.
The self-encapsulation of a synthetic biology chassis is new to iGEM and represents a completely novel and innovative approach to biopharmaceutical design, manufacture and delivery. Throughout the project we have followed an engineering approach that incorporates modular design, detailed modelling and simulation as well as systematic integration. Using such an approach, we are hopeful that the E.ncapsulator will be coming soon to a Pharmacy near you!

Additionally, we came up with ideas to remove biofilms from food and plants (Agrobacterium). Nevertheless, all these ideas either had a much easier and well-implemented chemical alternative or they were very questionable with regards to safety (i.e. containment of the genetically modified organism) and effectivity. Luckily, we ran into new possibilities!

Summary
We were invited to the Synenergene event organised by Rathenau Institute. This event was to make iGEM teams realise the importance of performing a responsible research in their project. During the event we came into contact with several stakeholders and experts.
Antibiotic resistance shield
The overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistances. Although this problem has already been popping up in scientific and newspaper articles for over 30 years, its threat is one that can no longer be ignored. The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that annually over 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths in the United States are caused by antibiotic resistance. Moreover, it is approximated that by 2050, 10 million people will die annually due to antibiotic resistance. The ‘antibiotic apocalypse’ needs to be prevented, so action should be taken now!
Antibiotic resistance detection with Cas13a
Up until now, we had been focussing on a plan with the protein Cas9. Nevertheless, this was not the optimal protein for what we wanted to achieve. Participating in iGEM, we caught up with the most recent achievements in the synthetic biology field, amongst which a very interesting paper about Cas13a by Gootenberg et al. Their paper indicated attomolar sensitivity in combination with rapid DNA or RNA detection, which would be perfect for detecting antibiotic resistance genes!
Tardigrade proteins
Simultaneously, team members came up with a completely different idea, based on practical limitations in the lab instead of a societal problem: western blotting. In order to improve on this method, we would require"
