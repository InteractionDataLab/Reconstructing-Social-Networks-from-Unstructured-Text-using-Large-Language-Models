iGEA day 2
Back to Srishti to work on the iGEA entries, this time, to develop a bacteria within the realms of the scientifically possible. Each group has to make an artifact and represent it in a film to tell the story of the iGEA bacteria. Developing the ideas from Wednesday, each group kept the same categories.
Best Ecosystem & Shooting Star (short-lived, burning bright)
Best New Emotion & Best Pop-Culture
Best Social Critique & Remix Culture
The film should illustrate the working of the BioBrick in particular and organism in general, using existing BioBrick terminology.
The idea can be wild, but the science must be possible in 2010!

Model of the Glandotransius
This morning, the iGEA teams presented their films and artifacts, made since last night!
The Glandotransius Akshitta, Shreya & Anusha
The Glandotransius is an engineered E.coli that stimulates various glands in the human body. It accentuates the effects of certain hormones. It produces DMT, Dimethyltryptamine , a chemical produced by the pineal gland, found in almost all plants and mammals and a hallucinatory, dangerous drug. The Glandotransius stimulates the ecosystem of the various glands, from the testes to the hypothalamus. While the pineal gland is synonymous with Shiva’s Third Eye , its over-stimulation may also bring with it lack of perception leading to lack of communication, a plethora of psychological and physical problems and long term effects like permanent damage to the immune and central nervous system.

Bacteria which help coordinate your music with the weather. E.cloudy is a Bacteria which is temperature sensitive and produces electricity. The E.Cloudy bacteria contain two existing BioBrick parts – BBa_K098995, responsible for the thermo sensitivity.(Designed by Harvard 2008 IGEM team) and BBa_K499271, responsible for the electricity (designed by Boris Kirov IGEM 2010).
Apart from being aware of the weather, it creates awareness in how two very different genes, from possibly two very different organisms have been put together to create a machine.  It could lead us to questioning our rights to remix things, whether it is OK to mix the machine with living cells, and our rights to play with natural selection. Can we define this as"

Creating Silk Monomers and Hybrid-Silk by Iterative Capped Assembly (ICA)
The ICA method ( Top )
The ICA method was described as a solid surface-based sequential ligation, which adds DNA constructs with matching overhangs individually in series Briggs, A. W., et al. (2012). ""Iterative capped assembly: rapid and scalable synthesis of repeat-module DNA such as TAL effectors from individual monomers."" Nucleic Acids Res 40(15) . This makes it possible to custom design genes, which can later be amplified through PCR. The method is especially effective when making repetitive DNA constructs. Traditionally DNA is added to a gene through primer overhangs in a PCR, but when working with repetitive genes, the primer could recognize multiple sites and thereby cause multiple variations of the gene. The stepwise ligation method utilizes the strong chemical binding between streptavidin and biot"

Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

Modelling
We created simplified molecular models of YAP1P:SKN7 and MSN2/4 regulation during oxidative stress response
We created two molecular models of the regulatory mechanisms of YAP1P:SKN7 and MSN2/4 transcription factors which focus on the main species involved in their regulation when the Gpx3 protein (ORS sensor) quantity increases. These models are depicted below in the figures 5 and 6.
Figure 5. The molecular model of the activation of Yap1p and Skn7p. Gpx3p = thiol peroxidase, Crm1p = Karyopherin for Yap1p export from nucleus, Pse1p = karyopherin for Yap1p import into nucleus, Trx = thioredoxin, YFP = yellow fluorescent protein.
Figure 6. The molecular model of Msn2/4p activation during the oxidative stress.PKA = protein kinase A, P = phosphate, Msn5p = karyopherin involed in exporting Msn2/4p from nucleus, TRX = thioredoxin, cAMP = cyclic AMP.
We simulated the Yellow Fluorescence Protein (YFP) production during stress with a mass action model in COPASI software
We ran a series of simulations on a range of different values involved in the model of YAP1P:SKN7 mechanism, including kinase activity, plasmid quantity, Yap1p degradation rate, transcription factor concentrations and promoter binding rate. Below (figure 7) we show a plot of the overall behaviour of the protein production given our model and parameters.
We support the model in which Not4 is responsible for Yap1p degradation
During the run of our simulations, we observed a tight relationship between the degradation rate of Yap1p and the Not4 activity rate. We support the validity of the model suggested in (Glushan et al. 2012) since this model reflects a prediction of protein which fits our estimations and expectations. We show a plot (figure 9) below, which shows the behaviour at which the Yap1p:Skn7 complex stabilizes in dependence of Not4.
We support the findings that transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7 participate actively in the initial stress response mechanism of the cell
According to our results on protein production, our cells show a specially high initial response, shown as an exponential function. This response maintains until the quantity of plasmids gets"

Name: Karen Kar On Cheng
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
Karen is a our team leader. Despite that, she is easy to approach and always willing to help other members. She is always the first to enter the lab and the last to leave. Thanks to her, we don’t need to worry about running out of reagents as she is always on top of replenishing supplies. In the lab, she has been very patient with us, always replying “should be okay…” whenever we’re unsure or stressed out about something. She is responsible with keeping track of the team’s progress.
Name: Leona Long Ching Lai
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
Leona is a very devoted member of the project. The leader of one of the three module groups, she practises tough love on her group mates. She has a pretty loud voice so it might sometimes sound like she's being harsh but everyone knows she doesn't mean it. The most valuable trait of her is that she always tries to do beyond her responsibility and never cares about claiming credit, from planning daily experimental procedures to preparing materials for weekly presentations. We all appreciate her very much.
Name: Luna Jaya Eresta
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
The Teacher. Luna is a great teacher and leader. She’s very organized and quite perfectionist in her work.  She is clear about what to do in the next step and focus on how to modify experiments in order to get a more reliable and persuasive result. Every day in the lab becomes smoother and easier because of the Workflow Plan that she initiated for our group. She’s also very good in delegating work for other people while considering their strengths and weaknesses. Besides, she’s secretly a quite sensitive and careless person, but she’s very professional when it comes to work. She also loves to tell jokes (although some of them are not funny) and take good photo of our team so that we can leave behind wonderful memories.

Image below. shows an example reaction catalyzed by amidase. The enzyme hydrolases the functional group and disconnects the linked product molecule in one step forming a native dCTP nucleotide.
4. Lyases
Lyases catalyze the elimination reaction of various chemical groups by breaking C-C, C-O, C-N and other bonds. As a consequence of bond breakage, lyases allow the substrate nucleotide to lose a part of linked substrate, therefore newly formed product nucleotide becomes accessible to Phi29 DNA polymerase and in turn is incorporated into a DNA sequence. Additionally, lyase catalyzed reactions can be linked with simple chemical conversions, leading to removal of whole substrate as depicted below. Image below visualizes the cleave of C-C bond leading to a product nucleotide, which spontaneously undergoes beta elimination reaction, leading to native dexocytinine nucleotide.
5. Isomerases
Isomerases catalyze the conversion of one isomer to another. Combination of isomerases with other stereospecific enzymes, such as hydrolases, can be employed to change the configuration of nucleotide linked substrate molecules which are in turn removed by secondary enzyme, thus recording the activity of rate limiting enzyme. Image below shows a substrate bound nucleotide. The stereospecific amidase only catalyzes the removal of S isomer substrate. Introduction of isomerase enzyme allows to record the catalytic activity of this enzyme in a form of amidase hydrolyzed nucleotides."

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Remember, our ProteinGAN has never seen a protein sequence. This is the network’s interpretation of how an DNA helicase should look. Right of the bat, we saw that it successfully learnt that a protein sequence should start with Methionine - and that alone was outstanding, as it learned some rules of nature already!
The networks have also captured that enzymes can have different sequence lengths - as GAN generates all of the outputs of the same length by default, some of the generated examples had a variable number of 0's attached after sequence of amino acids. For example, these two sequences have different lengths:

補足：
今まで、移動系、色素系、分裂系がありましたが、今現在システム全体が書き出せるものは
「物質合成→積算＆コミュニケーション→output」
の色素系であります。移動系のアイデアには、積算値が戻らないという利点があります。
しかしその位置情報を大腸菌に認識させるという、積算の次のステップのシステムが現在出されていません。
分裂系も、２のn乗で増えていくので色素系と比較すると問題点が多いです。
テスト前まで色素系を進めていこうかという話をしました。もちろん分裂系、移動系は棚上げで。
５日に話した色素系に必要な条件を書き出します。

Bioethics Overview
The University of Illinois Champaign Urbana 2010 iGEM team divided the bioethics project into two parts. First, we created and distributed a survey on the public’s knowledge and perception of synthetic biology. We then took the survey results and used them to customize our interactions with the public in order to better inform the community about synthetic biology.
A New Approach Towards Synthetic Biology Outreach
Check out our paper documenting this New Approach to Synthetic Biology Outreach! Media:UIUC-IllinoisHumanPractices.pdf
Video Documentation of Synthetic Biology Outreach
Video also found here!
Public Outreach
As the second part of our bioethics project, we participated in a number of public events to inform the general public about iGEM and synthetic biology. The results of our survey were useful to help us gauge our audience’s preconceived notions of synthetic biology. For example, from the results of the survey we realized that the public is exposed to a myriad of inaccurate representations of synthetic biology. We were able to counter these views and introduce a more accurate picture of the field during our interactions with the Champaign-Urbana community. Listed below are each of our public outreach events as well as upcoming and planned events.
Outreach Events:
Engineering Open House:
The College of Engineering at University of Illinois-Champaign Urbana puts on an annual Open House to allow the public and prospective students to get a glimpse of the college’s diverse programs and clubs.

Attendance to Meet Ups
The meets ups bring several advantages to the teams. It is one of the simplest ways to reach a greater number of people to whom you can explain your project. And therefore they allow you to know first-hand the projects of the rest of the teams so that you can consult and clarify doubts. These meetings also allow for more related and powerful collaborations thanks to knowing the rest of the teams in person. And last but not least, they allow you to practice exposing your project with a view to improving in the Giant Jamboree.
Our team attended two meet ups that took place in the month of August.
Marseille
Mediterranean Meet Up (Marseille)
This meet up took place between Thursday 9 and Friday 10 August in the city of Marseille and was organized by the team of this city, the Aix-Marseille. In it, all the teams from the Mediterranean area were summoned, so they ended up attending both France and Spain. Francisco, Gonzalo and Ivan attended this meet up on behalf of the team.
The event began with a reception in which all teams had their first informal contact. Subsequently, a 5 minutes presentation of each of the projects was organized, summarizing the concept on which the proyect was based, the work carried out and the plans to complete it. After the exhibition, each team answered the questions that could have the jury and the rest of the teams.
Later they invited us to a joint meal. In the afternoon it was organized a sightseeing tour of the city, but due to inclement weather it had to be suspended, although we could enjoy a pleasant evening of board games and conversations with the rest of the teams. At"

The arguments they made really made us think about the implications of GM crops. For example, some good points were made about the economic effects GM crops have on developing countries and how they may actually prevent developing countries from economic and industrial revolutions. In the end, the opposing side (in favour of GM development) won the debate.
Media Coverage
We were very lucky this summer to receive significant media coverage of our project. At the start of the summer we were approached by PLoS SynBio to write a blog post for them as part of their iGEM series. This was great as initial exposure as we got to share our project with the far and wide synthetic biology community as well as other iGEM teams.
Read the PLoS SynBio post here: http://blogs.plos.org/blog/2016/06/23/igem-blogs-the-dna-typewriter-edinburgh-igem-2016/
As a result of our collaboration with the National Library of Scotland, we were included in a press release from the Library. These publications were great in getting our project exposed to the local Edinburgh community.
Read the initial press release here: http://www.nls.uk/news/press/2016/08/dna-data-storage
A few weeks later, we were absolutely buzzing when Bulgarian National News contacted us to do a video interview! We loved sharing our ideas on TV as it made us consider our science communication skills; a very useful skill we used throughout the duration of the summer! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm5s5TpE2Uc
The benefits of having an international team became more clear after a Greek news site picked up on our story: http://www.zarpanews.gr/

Phusion PCR was also done for the tAOX1 fragment at following conditions with 35 cycles and also PCR product as template. For us it can not be recognized at which annealing temperature the primer binds best. That is why we choose an annealing temperature gradient more. This time from 50 °C until 60 °C. The mixture of the sample is the same as last time.
Team Site Directed Mutagenesis:
Clean-up of tvel10 and pSB1C3 (both cut with NotI); Dephosphorilation of pSB1C3 with SAP and ligation. Transformed into KRX and plated on select-agar.
Team Cellulose Binding Domain:
Colony-PCR of CBDcex(T7)+GFP_His -clones with no result, even the positive-control was negative, so we plated three colonies for a test-digestion instead.
Digestion of CBDclos(T7) with AgeI and PstI and digestion of the GFP_His -PCR-product with NgoMIV and PstI over-night.
Team Cultivation & Purification:
Today we harvested the cells from the cultivation on 08/15, disrupted them in equilibration buffer via sonication, centrifugated and purified the supernatant via HisTrap column. The purified samples in 500 mM Imidazol were given to the activity test team.

Team Cloning of Bacterial laccases:
Today we performed a ligation from the digestions we have done before. The ligation included of course the T7 promotor, the backbone pSB1C3 and the individual laccase genes. Ligation was performed with T4 ligase for 20 minutes at room temperature and stopped through a five minute incubation at 70 °C.

After communicating with NUDT-China, we knew that both of our projects would use N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone (AHL for Las system), at that time we had gotten AHL, so we sent AHL to them, besides, we provided BBa_K1334030 to them. Similar situation happened to BIT, which team had also received AHL from us.

Popularization
During our process in finishing the project, we had also tried to introduce iGEM to more people around. To achieve our goal, we had hosted series of wonderful activities.
In May, at the very beginning of our project, we hosted Scrawl Competition in Microorganism, in this competition, every participant would get a culture plate and E. coli which contained GFP, they could use inoculating loop to draw what they like on the culture plate.
In September, we utilized the chance of welcoming the fresh to our university to advertise iGEM, in order to bring them knowledge about iGEM as well as happiness, we hosted series of activities. When the fresh come to university to register, they will get a bag which contains books about the university, card they will use in daily life and other guide that can help them to adapt the university. We added our poster and an exquisite badge into each bag, they were very happy when getting gifts. In addition, we also hosted a meeting to welcome them and advertise iGEM, our header Sun Haoyuan gave them a wonderful speech and told them a lot about his experience in university and iGEM.
Further than advertising to students around us, we have taken other ways to expand our influence. One way is through the internet, we have set up our own Xinlang Weibo, public pages on Renren and QQ groups, we keep telling the public about iGEM and the process of our experiments. Till now on ,we have a lot of fans, and they can learn numerous knowledge from us. Another way is participating in competition hosted by our school, in the early October, we took our program to Creation Competition in our school, and we showed our idea to many teachers in different majors and finally got a great score.
Communication
We have communicated with a lot of universities and organizations. First of all we will introduce you CCiC here. CCiC is Central China iGEMer's Consortium. In the early April, HZAU-China, HUST-China and WHU-China ,WHU-Pharm worked together to prepare for this great meeting,"

UC Davis Promoter Characterization
The UC Davis iGEM team asked us to help in producing a multi-lab, extensive characterization of a commonly used part library - from the iGEM part kit! The team provided us with a protocol and a list of promoters from the parts registry. One of our team members (David Dinh) resuspended these parts from the kit, transformed them into DH5alpha cells and grew them according to their suggested protocol. RFP expression was collected from a plate reader and sent to the UC Davis team. The data we collected is also available here.
TU/Eindhoven: Synthetic Facts Project
This summer, the TU/Eindhoven team made a website which they hoped would serve as ""a Fact Checker to help members of the general public associate with the field of synthetic biology. (Their) Fact Checker will become available online and will allow users to both view and submit facts of their own.  Each submitted “fact” will be reviewed and commented on by respected sources. This way it is hoped that (they) can prove or disprove a number of myths about synthetic biology and thereby promote the idea of synthetic biology to the general public."" To help the team, we researched one fact that can now be found on their site by clicking the badge below.
University of East Anglia (Norwich, England) Project
The University of East Anglia team asked for help obtaining soil and sediment samples from various locations around the world. The team wanted to use the samples to test a biosensor that they are developing for their iGEM project. Our team member, David Dinh, went to Crissy Field and Heron's Head Park in San Francisco and dug up sediment samples that were then mailed to the East Anglia iGEM team."

Swot Analysis
STRENGTHS
WEAKNESSES
Innovation capacity: There is currently no filter using our technology
Market share: We expect to occupy the segment of inexpensive air purifiers. There is little competition in this segment.
Today, there are only a few studies about indoor air pollution. We will create an unseen database about this issue and spread it with researchers. This side project will improve the visibility of our device, aether.
Our product is a modular device in its design, and can be modified according to specific needs (ie. adapt aether to cars, offices or schools)
The support of the Institut Pasteur gives us a certain exposure.
Less financial capacity (required for the development and the marketing plan)
Low brand image
We need to make engineering tests, and to measure our device’s performance under real conditions to ensure the viability of our product.
We need to define a “pollutant bank” and to design filters that are more specific to these pollutants.
OPPORTUNITIES
THREATS
Market with high growth potential: $29 billion in 2021.
If overall pollution decreases, specifically in Europe, scientific discoveries on the effects of pollution on health lead to lower tolerance levels.
Important players already well established on the market: Dyson, Philips, LG…
Newcomers: startups like Air Serenity, Teqova ...
Our system relies on intensive research that needs to be done.
Patent
In our global world, focused on innovation and entrepreneurship, it seems legitimate and necessary to protect one’s creation. For this purpose, multiple tools are available. But let’s start with the different parts of our project that deserve protection:
First of all, there are the biologics we produced in the lab.
They are an invention. Thus, they could be protected by patent law.
There is our filter itself (or at this point: its prototype).
This is an invention as well. But it is also a three-dimensional product.
Therefore, the filter could benefit from both protections: patent law; and design and model law.
Eventually, there is our logo.
This last one could be protected by a copyright such as a trademark.
Patenting is an appropriate way to protect one’s creation: it offers a monopoly for the inventor, but this advantage is limited to 20 years in order to provide the society with a right to use and re-use the creation. Thus, the patent is an incentive tool for technological innovation. It contributes to technical progress, economic progress and social welfare. Therefore,"

Introduction
The InterLab Study requires a plate reader and a spectrophotometer, which is difficult for our team to perform in our lab, so we collaborate with the teams from Beijing National Day School and Peking University. Instructed and helped by the leader of Peking University’s team, our two teams perform the InterLab Study together and generate data for following experiments.
Calibration
We use LUDOX-S40 as a reference point to convert Absorbance data (Abs600) into standard optical density (OD600).
Protocols we carried out to measure the absorbance 600 nm of all samples:
Add 1000μl LUDOX into cuvettes.
With a standard 1cm spectrophotometer, measure the Abs600 reading of LUDOX.
Rinse the cuvettes and dry it naturally on a paper towel.
Add 1000μl distilled water into the same cuvettes.
With a standard 1cm spectrophotometer, measure the Abs600 reading of distilled water.
Import the data into the Excel sheet.
These are the data we obtained from the protocols. Correction factor is obtained by the calculation.
Fluorescein fluorescence standard curve
We use a dilution series of fluorescein to generate the standard curve.
Protocols:
Serial dilution is carried out: concentrations of fluorescein from 50μM to 0μM with 50% difference are obtained. (The last sample is left empty, therefore 0μM)
Use a plate reader to obtain the fluorescence of the fluorescein.
Import the data into Excel sheet and generate a standard curve.

According to the Michaelis-Menten equation of the enzyme kinetics, we found the best training time of the second seed is 5.5 hours and the best reactivity time after adding ONPG is 30 min in the process of the β-galactosidase assay.
As you see, the inhibition efficiency of the sRNA-ipgC is about 60% and the sRNA-sicA is about 35%. Apparently, the sRNA-ipgC has better function than the sRNA-sicA.But both of them have function of inhibition. Next step, we will continue to explore their structure to get better results.

3. MIN SYSTEM
3.1 INTRODUCTION
Min system consists of MinC, MinD and MinE. MinC protein is the real division inhibitor. And MinD, as a kind of ATPase, is believed to function by activating a MinC-dependent division inhibition mechanism [1]. Additionally, MinE is a topological factor.
Under normal conditions, MinC and MinD act in concert to form an inhibitor of cell division (Fig.3-1(a)). When combined with MinC, MinD increases the activity of MinC by 25~50 times [2]. The MinC and MinD division inhibitor is required to prevent separation at the potential division sites at the cell poles by preventing formation of the FtsZ ring [3]. However, the MinC and MinD division inhibitor lacks site specificity without MinE, for it prevents separation at all division sites——both polar and central (Fig.3-1(b)). The role of MinE is to give topological specificity to the MinC and MinD division inhibitor [4]. It suppresses the action of the division inhibitor at mid of the cell, allowing FtsZ ring assembly at this site, but not at the cell poles.

Advisors
This section we want to dedicate to our advisors. As most of our team members are still bachelor students and had no or only minor knowledge about actually working in a lab before getting in touch with iGEM, our advisors played an important role in starting our project. They guided us in the long process of shaping our abstract ideas into real, scientific strategies and are the reason why we can now proudly announce that we are able to organize and execute our own experiments. Here, we want to present how each of them supported our project.

Supervisors
Alongside with our advisors we also owe special thanks to our supervisors. In 2016, RWTH Aachen University has had its third iGEM team and this would have never been possible without reliable faculty members who promote the iGEM spirit. They enabled us to work on our idea by providing us with their expertise as well as resources and lab-space. We are very grateful for their support and look forward to another successful synergy between our experienced supervisors and a new iGEM team that is bubbling over with ideas"

Synbiologica team wins 2013 Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge for biomedical device development
June 12, 2013
Pictured left to right are Mackenzie Coatham, Dr. HJ Wieden (team advisor), Erin Kelly, Harland Brandon and Isaac Ward.
It’s win number two for the University of Lethbridge student researcher/entrepreneurs who form the Synbiologica Ltd. team.
CEO Isaac Ward (3rd year, Neuroscience), first-year Biochemistry student Erin Kelly and Chemistry and Biochemistry masters students Mackenzie Coatham and Harland Brandon have developed a new method of detecting hormones, and are in the process of patenting their idea.
Their proposed biomedical device technology -- called “Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-Time” -- is expected to bring next-generation hormone detection to the research, agriculture and medical markets.
In addition to winning $10,000 in the SouthVenture Business Plan Competition in March, the group recently took first place in the Tech Stream side of the Chinook Entrepreneurial Challenge, an annual business planning competition hosted by Community Futures Lethbridge Region.
They received another $10,000 in cash, a one-year lease on space in the tecconnect -- An Alberta centre for New Commerce -- a high-tech business incubator operated by Economic Development Lethbridge -- plus a host of other in-kind prizes including business consulting from MNP and ActionCOACH, and several thousand dollars worth of media services.
“I am extremely proud of the Synbiologica group for their achievements and wish them continued success,” said Dr. Dan Weeks, the U of L’s Vice-President (Research).
“The U of L is a comprehensive research institution that offers significant research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. This approach is important as it equips our graduates with the knowledge and ability to thrive in their research and entrepreneurial careers.”
The competition evaluates and awards business plans submitted by entrepreneurs who have taken advantage of the"

Colanic Acid
Aims
Colanic acid biosynthesis is both time consuming and metabolically expensive. If the E.ncapsulator is to be used in an industrial setting, then colanic acid mediated protection must be highly efficient. Protective efficiency can be defined as the percentage increase in fluorescence per µl of colanic acid produced (when compared to control cells). The following assay can be used to elucidate this parameter.
Assay
This assay can be divided into several phases as shown below:
Growth of cells (Assay preparation).
Measurement of cell density.
Measurement of packed cell volume (PCV).
Measurement of the % change in GFP fluorescence following acid incubation.

In real deterministic modeling of biological systems, usually a lot more compounds are involved which might react in different ways, yielding more and longer ODEs. It is important to keep track of all compounds and to make sure that you have a closed system.
When you have written down a system of ODEs, there are a couple of different strategies you can pursue. Perhaps the easiest is to make a Matlab fucntion containing your system of ODEs and using a script with the function ode45 . The Matlab code to do this for the example system considered here looks like this:
function dy = example(t,C)  %% Reactions % A + B ->k-> C      % Example reaction  %% ODEs % d/dt[A] = -k[A][B] % d/dt[B] = -k[A][B] % d/dt[C] =  k[A][B]  %% Species % A = C(1) % B = C(2) % C = C(3)  %% Parameters k  = 1; % example reaction rate  %% System of ODEs dy=zeros(length(C),1); dy(1) = -k*C(1)*C(2); dy(2) = -k*C(1)*C(2); dy(3) =  k*C(1)*C(2);  end

Add 9.8mL of LB, 40ul of adenine solution into each test tube. Then add 200ul of BL21 overnight into each test tube. Incubate on the shaker at 37 Celsius.
Make the M9+ suspension medium and supplement it with the appropriate amount of uracil and adenine. In this case, 200uL of adenine solution and 400uL of uracil solution was add 50mL of M9+.
Make a LB/adenine/uracil solution by adding 200uL of adenine solution and 400uL of uracil solution to 50mL of LB.
Remove all the test tubes off the shaker after 2 hours. Centrifuge all the tubes at 4000rpm for 10 minutes at 7 Celsius. Discard the supernatant using pipettes. For the LB tubes, add 10mL of the LB/adenine/uracil solution into each tube with a pipette, being sure to pipette up and down to resuspend the bacteria. For the M9 tubes, add 10mL of the M9 solution into each M9 labeled tube with a pipette and resuspend the bacteria.
To each tube, add the corresponding amount in ul of 5-bromodeoxyuridine, a mutagen, to each test tube with a 100, 200, or 500. (Ex: Add 100ul of mutagen to LB:100 and M9:100.)
Take 1mL from the LB:C tube and pipette it into a cuvette. Using 1mL of LB in a cuvette, blank the spectrophotometer at 600 OD. Then measure the absorbance of the LB:C cuvette.
Place all the tubes on the shaker at 37 Celsius for 30 minutes.

Further Applications
Ultimately, the ability to express virtually any protein of interest shows great potential for laboratory work. Our Sporobeads could for example express TAL effectors for the binding of sequence-specific DNA stretches. This could allow simple GMO detection of food crops. Besides expressing proteins capable of binding compounds or ions of interest, our Sporobeads could also display proteins which have enzymatic activity. The 2011 University of Washington iGEM team developed an enzyme, Kumamolisin, which cleaves peptides. The substrate of this enzyme is a specific amino acid sequence which causes reactions in individuals with Celiac disease. Such a cleaving enzyme could be used to eliminate irritants from gluten-containing food products.
Sporovector
There are many possible applications for our Sporobeads , as it is possible to display all kinds of different proteins on their surface. To easily create them, we designed a Sporovector in which you just have to insert the gene encoding your fusion protein of choice.

Monschau
Our first journey with the team led us to the small town Monschau in the Eifel region of western Germany. For the weekend of 2nd to 4th of March we stayed in the castle of Monschau for team building.  We traveled via bus and train from Düsseldorf to Monschau. During the ride it started snowing which is why we were granted a wonderful view at our arrival. We had to walk through the snow-covered city up to the castle late at night and met a man dressed as a medieval guard soldier, who kindly explained to us the quickest way to the castle.
The next morning we held our first team building exercise in the castle, guided by one of our advisors. The aim was to estimate our own strengths and think about the area of responsibility in which we can use our abilities the best. It started with a little game about ourselves. We made a poster with different important characters in a team like “planner and manager” or “creator” and everyone listed themselves under one or more categories. Then we asked every team member how he or she would categorize this person and if they agree with the self-assessment.
After lunch we explored Monschau in daylight, took pictures together and looked for souvenirs. Back at the hostel we met again to hold our next seminar connected to our previous one. Now we started to plan the structure of our team and decided that we wanted the team leadership to have three main coordinators: a team leader, a social-media-representative and a laboratory-manager"

Today was so much fun! We went to the Science Museum early in the morning, and got tickets to the “Science behind Pixar” exhibit as well as the Ice Age 4D screening. The Pixar exhibit was so, so inspiring and entertaining; we all pretty much left determined to work at Pixar one day. We also looked at the fish exhibit, which was a partial inspiration in the early stages of our work, and which we’d read several papers about, but it was so much better to see it in person. There were many exhibits that had components similar to ours, so it was helpful to see how they are integrated with the rest of the design. Overall, it was a very fun and educational visit!
7/13/2015: Day 31
We spent most of the day working on the prototype. We added the new animations that Casey sent in, and most of the functionality has been laid down with the most recent changes.
7/14/2015: Day 32
We spent a large part of today figuring out the math for the animation and widget response. Since the entire background is one widget (both the workbench and the environment area), we needed to define when a flask is dragged into Mars (and at what point it happens). We used the distance from the center of the Environment semicircle, which was simple enough for the two horizontal widgets. However, the two widgets on the side are rotated, so it took a while to figure out how the coordinate system work and how to get a flask’s absolute coordinates on the screen (as opposed to its coordinates in relation to its parent widget). We did figure it out eventually though, so that felt satisfying!
7/15/2015: Day 33
Today was another Math day! We spent most of the morning fixing the rotation of the flasks so that when they enter Mars, they’d turn to point towards its center (so that the bacteria exists towards it and not in some random direction). In the afternoon, the MIT App Inventor team came to visit us, and we had some time for demos and a presentation. We spent the rest of the time we had after that talking about the art we’ll need, and finalizing some of the designs we’ve been working on.
7/16/2015: Day 34
We got laser cutter training this morning! It was so much fun. We are probably going to be cutting out our tangibles next week (Casey’s been working on designing them), so it really feels like the project is coming together. Casey"

Newcastle,2016,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," with. We were working with Risk Group 1 Organisms i.e. ‘those which are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans’. This means the main techniques we used to manage our risk when using these was wearing the appropriate PPE (such as nitrile gloves and lab coats) and proper disinfection of surfaces and equipment before and after use with ChemGene and 70% ethanol during our project.
As our work involves genetic modification, we end up with ‘new’ organisms and so we are responsible for assigning them a risk group. This risk group is assigned depending on the components that were used in making the new organism. The organism, protein and risk group for parts not from E. coli are given in the table below.
Bacteria
Protein
Risk Group
Pseudomonas fluorescens
Outer membrane porin F.
2
Synechococcus elongatus
Metallothionein SmtA.

As one of the organisms we use is a risk group 2 organism, it was important that we closely reviewed the coding sequence we intended to use. In this case, it is OprF from Pseudomonas fluorescens. Fortunately, when we consulted the UniProt entry for OprF (ID: PORF_PSEAE ) we found that this protein is well characterised, with experimental evidence at the protein level. Additionally, the structure of some of its domains has been determined using crystallography and can be found in the protein data bank .
According to the available data we know that OprF has porin activity and serves to form small water-filled channels which are involved in ion transport. The protein also has a structural role in regulating cell shape and the cell's ability to grow in low-osmolarity medium.
We assess this as being a safe to use protein coding sequence as it does not fall into one of the dangerous categories listed in the safety guidelines, nor when we consulted the database of virulence factors for Pseudomonas  did we find the gene for this protein indicated. Additionally, the gene product, the porin itself has no potential for dual use and is not harmful to the environment in any way.
Although we assessed this coding sequence to be safe for use in our designs, we have chosen to assign risk group 2 status to E. coli transformed with plasmids containing constructs which contain this gene and express the OprF protein. That is, our part BBa_K1895005 . Any work involving this plasmid and transformed products will be confined to our level 2 biosafety laboratory.

As one of the important apoptosis-mediated factors, ROS could be propose under a variety of                         stress, such as cold induction, metal ion induction, high pressure induction. However,                         considering the feasibility, time period, operational difficulty, and the cause of ROS                         accumulation, we finally accumulated ROS through overexpressing yeast endogenous genes.
It's been established that overexpress some genes can accumulate ROS in yeast cells previously,                         in hence we selected two genes, yno1 (encodes a genuine NADPH oxidase, which is located                         in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and produces superoxide in a NADPH-dependent fashion) [6] . and ndi1 (codes for the internal mitochondrial ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which                         transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone in the electron transport chain) [7] to achieve our goal of ROS accumulation.
Improve the tolerance of ROS
Fig. 2 knock out gene yca1 through homologous reorganization.
Higher ROS content comes higher mortality rate. In order to prevent the yeast from dying for                             oxidation, simultaneously, maintain a high level of ROS accumulation in vivo, we need to knock                             out the gene yca1, which encodes synthesis of metacaspase, a homologue of the mammalian                             caspase, and is known to play a crucial role in the regulation of yeast apoptosis, for avoiding                             the death induced by high concentration ROS. [8]
Up to now, we complete the construction of a yeast stain that can accumulate ROS endogenous                             alive.

Let's see how other parts are built step by step.
Feedback
When we have already placed the yeast cells in an oxidative state, next step is to control the                         accumulation of ROS. So we set up the feedback part.
We supposed that the reason of ROS accumulation in our project is the overexpression of related                         genes. If so, the ROS accumulation can be reduced through repressing gene expression. There are                         two common global-repressors to inhibit the gene expression, RNAi and dCas9 technology. We                         compared two technologies and asked our advisor, Dr. Ying Wang for advice. She suggested that                         we chose dCas9 for it got a higher success rate. We followed her advice and continued other                         designs.
After choosing the inhibition method, we started to find a ROS sensor with low sensitivity to                         ROS, since we hoped"

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

We can scale this down even further due to our ability to transform the iron core of the protein into a catalytic active substance called Prussian Blue (Zhang et al., 2013). Thus, instead of multiple bound reporter proteins we can further scale down the output of our system to one with essentially one reporter. The ability of our system to scale up and down according to the need of detection means this system is applicable in areas ranging from low sensitivity to high sensitivity.

SCU-China,2016,Team:SCU-China#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,", we had collected several constructive suggestions. Such as: “Your hydrogel insoles maybe a bit cold for people to use in winter.”Or “How about your insole swelling after absorbing the foot sweat?” Also, they talked about the flatfoot. All their praise and suggestions encouraged us very much, so we decided to continue to improve it. Finally, we made the advanced hydrogel insole— insole 3.
Insole 3:
Instead of using one kind material and the flat surface, insole 3 was made of two kinds of hydrogels and it had an ergonomic hook face structure. In the force-intensive areas such as the toe, sole and the heel, the fist softer hydrogel was used to support the force and the first type E. coli to grow. In the other area, the tougher hydrogel with the second E. coli grow on it. Besides, we introduced the swelling super absorbent polymer(SAP) particles and dried one to deal with the swelling problem. Insole 3 had two different types. The summer type was thinner than usual and absorbed the CecropinXJ directly without the first type E. coli grow on it. The winter type insole had an extra convenient heating equipment on the bottom of the insole. It also had four layers.
You can try it on Gaint Jamboree！
It should be pointed out that people’s need for the special insole inspired us. We thought it was an opportunity for us to produce personal customized insoles. Everyone’s feet are different, even one person’s two feet were rare identical. With the help of foot scanner or the camera of the smart phone, we can produce your personal customized antibacterial and deodorant insole for you, your own “comfortable”!

Patent Application
As a very practical application of innovation, we want to make our project a further continuation of the real daily life in the more general case - the real into commercial application.
To this end, we negotiated with the patent application service professionals. Topics will be packed to make more business sense as a result. After finishing the application form, we have submitted to the People's Republic of China Patent Office for patent application. In the process of talking to the Patent Office clerk, the clerk said: this product is of extremely practical application value. We believe that our products can be correctly on the road of commercialization."

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

In addition, special issue offers access to peripheral issue, such as interviews to teams and experts, case analysis, experience in team construction and popularization of synthetic biology. We excavate the quintessence of the past work as the shoulder standing on which the following teams could see further.
 
Communication with Counterparts
 
If Newsletter builds cooperation as the bridge to connect with other teams, our communications via net-video and face-to-face meeting establish a deep friendship with counterparts.
 
We initiated net-video meetings with the iGEM teams in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Tientsin University (TJU) and National Chiao Tung University (NCTU). We were so excited to see their faces on the screen that some of us talk over one another. Jianxing Huang had to keep order from time to time. We delightedly shared our progress and experience, and introduced our ideas with each other. During the meetings, we learned a lot from our counterparts: SJTU put forward a design of a video in which the development of iGEM in China would be shown, and their imagination astonished us. The campus cultural festival of Tokyo Tech showed a creative Human Practice idea, and we found we two were quite different in selection methods of team members, the manner of working, and the way of thinking, from which we were illuminated a great deal. And it was the innovation of TJU’s idea that convinced us. It is particularly worth mentioning here that NCTU’s enthusiasm really inspired us a lot.
 
In addition, we were glad to call on iGEMers in other universities. On July 16th, Chen Jielin paid a visit to the iGEM team in Zhejiang University (ZJU) who generously provided some strains for us. And we were so happy to see 3 members from ZJU again during their reciprocal visit to us. Yang Liu visited TJU’s lab on July 28th, and she brought back their latest progress and experience. Fan Wu and Yue Jiang reported our idea in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). We also have face-to-face meetings with Northeast Agricultural University (NEAU), South University of Science and Technology of China (SUSTC), South China Agricultural University (SCAU) and Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU).

Digestion of the PCR product then allowed for ligation of the insert and destination vector using the PstI sites and XbaI and SpeI (XbaI and SpeI have compatible sticky ends). Note that after the ligation, there will be a scar in the gene where the XbaI and the SpeI sites were ligated.
The ligation appeared to be successful. The ligation mixture was transformed to DH5α competent cells and plated onto chloramphenicol-containing agar plates.
Plasmid from 5 colonies (C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5) was cultured, extracted, and then digested with EcoRI and PstI.
As evident in the figure below, at least 4 of the colonies appeared to contain the insert. The empty, linearised pSB1C3 backbone ran at approximately the correct size (2070 bps), as did the insert (740 bps).
N.B. MW marker is the 100 bp Ladder from Axygen. * indicates the colony picked for sequencing and eventual transformation to the expression cell lines.
The DNA from Colony C2 was confirmed using Sanger sequencing at the Australian Genome Research Facility. This DNA appears in the registry of standard parts as BioBrick BBa_K1394000 .
For the USP peptide and the linear Magainin 1 peptide, the genes were synthesised by GenScript and delivered in pSB1C3. The expression vectors had identical gene regulatory elements to that used for the Magainin 1 Star peptide. They only differed in the codon optimisation used, and they also lacked the assembly scar described above.
Protein expression and characterisation
After acquiring our genes, the project moved to protein expression and purification. We expressed both star peptides (Magainin 1 Star Peptide and the USP peptide) in both the SHuffle T7 and BL21(DE3) cell lines, both sourced from New England Biolabs. As the Linear Magainin 1 peptide does not have any special disulfide bonding requirements, we expressed it in BL21(DE3).
The plasmids were transformed to the expression cells, and a single colony was cultured and induced overnight at 17 °C. A whole cell sample both before IPTG induction (-IPTG) and after the induction period (+IPTG) were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and loaded on a 15% tris-glycine gel.

Analysis of the answers
Expectations for modeling
“Modeling could help to make your choices within biology more rational.”
- A 4th year life sciences student
Modeling was seen as a way to gain theoretical insight into the biological system: to explore the limits of a system, the space where it can work and its predicted dynamics. Some respondents hoped that modeling would give insight to whether their system could function at all. One respondent mentioned modeling as a way to reach a conclusion if experimentation is not possible. Many respondents expected modeling to give predictions about how the biological system functions.
It was hoped that these predictions would help with focusing the experimental work and thereby minimize the quantity of required experiments. For instance, modeling was seen as a way to explore the bottlenecks and critical parameters of a system. In practical terms it was hoped that it could give guidance on for example which RBS or promoter to choose to make the biological system function as desired.
Some hoped that the modeling could precisely represent the biological system, but more often respondents were rather sceptical of modeling biological systems due to lots of unknown variables and many aspects that are difficult to model.
Issues in cooperation
“It is sometimes difficult to communicate, however, more often than not I think collaboration between fields is just an advantage.”

Because the ITC experiment requires a higher protein concentration and buffer composition. The preliminary analyses lead to unsatisfactory results are as follows. 1) The low concentration of ligand and receptor leads to less meaningful data. 2)VEGF is an insoluble protein, probably due to its poor solubility in buffer (20 mM HEPES + 150 mM NaCl) resulting to lower protein concentration in solution. 3) The activation of proteins in solution buffer were weaken.
We’ ll do further experiments to confirm our conclusion, by optimizing the method of protein expression and purification as well as the contains of solution buffer.

KDR is a receptor with immunoglobulins-like domain. Not a standard antibody, KDR still has some homology with antibodies. We got the crystal structure of KDR binding to VEGF from protein data bank (3v2a.pdb). However, some key residues are missing, probably because of the accuracy of solution structure. We used SWISS-MODEL [9][10][11][12][13] to rebuild the structure. Then, RosettaAntibodyDesign was operated. We tried GraftDesign, replacing whole CDR H3 with a CDR structure from antibody database. The interface energy has decreased from -41.850 to -43.639 REU. Thanks to the GraftDesign, the CDR H3 has been replaced by a longer one, and the contact area has increased a lot.

Thus, the behavior of the flagellar motors reflects the relative proportion of receptor signaling complexes in the kinase-on and kinase-off conformations.  Both chemoeffector binding or release and methylation or demethylation can shift receptor signaling complexes from one state to the other.  For example, attractant ligands drive receptors toward the kinase-off state; subsequent addition of methyl groups shifts receptors toward the kinase-on state, reestablishing the steady-state (adapted) balance between the two states and restoring random walk movements.
TlpB in Helicobacter Pylori:
H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that resides in thestomachs of over half the world’s population. Its gastric habitatcontains a marked pH gradient from the highly acidic lumen,which can reach pH 2, to the more neutral environment adjacentto the epithelial lining, which is typically pH 7.  Based on genome sequence analysis, the H. pylori chemotaxismachinery resembles that of the well-studied model, E. coli,with a few notable variations including the absence of themethylation enzymes involved in receptor adaptation (Sweeneyand Guillemin, 2011).
Figure 5: Chematic representation of chemotaxis signaling in E. coli (A) and H. pylori (B). Chemoreceptors are shown in purple and flagellar motors in greenspanning the cell membrane. Cytoplasmic chemotaxis proteins CheA, CheW, CheY, CheZ, CheR, CheB, CheV, and ChePep are labeled. Protein modificationsare shown as pink circles for phosphorylation and purple hexagons for methylation. Activating interactions between signaling pathway components are indicatedby arrows, and speculative interactions are indicated by dotted lines.
When Helicobacter pylori and Escherichia coli bacteria which belong to two separate systems are examined, we recognize the vast similarity between the two. Both systems have chemoreceptors which belong to the MCP family enable the detection of chemical substances which do chemotaxis. Also, both bacteria also share in common the proteins required to send signals to necessary regions.
H. pylori has four chemoreceptors, TlpA,TlpB, TlpC, and TlpD, and several polar flagella that dictatesmooth swimming behavior in the presence of an attractantand increased stopping behavior in the presence of a repellent(Lowenthal et al., 2009; Rader et al., 2011). Only a"

Human practice
We mainly did some human practice about publicity of synthetic biology so that more people can know what synthetic biology is, what iGEM is and what our standard and software is. Some workshop meetings were made to support other teams and get help from other teams. We also made a survey concerned with ethic issues in synthetic biology.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," cells transfected with Pcmv-GFP gave GFP signals. HEK293FT cells transfected with the commercial pEGFP-N1 showed similar results, while the same construct without any promoter did not give any GFP signals. Scale bar = 10µm.
EF-1alpha Promoter ( BBa_K1119010 )
Introduction
The constitutive human Elongation Factor-1alpha (EF-1alpha) Promoter regulates gene expression in mammalian cells. It is known that the CMV promoter is commonly used for constitutive expression, and here we introduce EF-1alpha promoter as an alternative mammalian promoter, which works in a wide range of cell types. The origin of this part is from Homo sapiens chromosome 6 genomic contig, GRCh37. p13.
In our characterization, the sequence of EF-1alpha Promoter was assembled in front of a GFP reporter ( BBa_K648013 )and hGH polyA terminator ( BBa_K404108 )using Freiburg’s RFC25 format. The EF-1alpha promoter-GFP was then transfected into HEK293FT cells and in vivo green fluorescence signal was observed under fluorescence microscope. The positive control was iDUET101a plasmid ( Addgene Plasmid Number 17629 ) that contains EGFP reporter driven by an EF-1alpha promoter. A negative control was made by GFP generator that does not contain the EF-1alpha promoter. As a side by side comparison, a CMV promoter driven GFP reporter was also transfected, though a quantitative comparison between the two was not conducted in our characterization. Detailed protocols for our characterization work can be accessed via the link.
Result
Figure 1: GFP signal of EF-1alpha observed. HEK293FT cells were transfected with iDUET101a (positive control), pEF-1alpha-GFP, pCMV-GFP (alternative mammalian constitutive promoter), and GFP without promoter. Cells transfected with pEF-1alpha-GFP showed weaker green signal compared to those with iDUET101a and pCMV-GFP. This result agreed with the result reported by Qin et al., that the EF-1alpha promoter gives weaker activity than CMV promoter in HEK293T cells. Our negative control, GFP without promoter did not give any GFP signal. Scale bar = 0.1mm
At the time of regional jamboree, no GFP signal could be observed in cells transfected with GFP reporter driven by EF-1alpha promoter. Originally, we thought that the sequence of"

Pasteur_Paris,2016,Team:Pasteur Paris#essai menuvertical_-_-_TEXT.html,"Marina MALETIC
She finished high school in Belgrade, her hometown. She was in a ’bilingual’ class, which was oriented towards social sciences and literature. Some of her classes were half in Serbian, half in French, which helped her improve her French vocabulary. After graduation, she moved to Paris to begin studying life sciences at Pierre and Marie Curie University. This year, she obtained her Bachelor’s Degree and, in the fall, she is starting her Master studies in genetics at Paris Diderot University. Marina is Serbian gal, she is a hard-worker in the lab but always ready to go out for a drink. She is very kind and helpful since she is our serotonin girl!
Xavier MONTOY
He is studying industrial design at ENSCI-Les Ateliers in Paris. 5 things to love about Xavier: He is an awesome designer (he likes to make smelly wallets out of kombucha). He works out and is very athletic (but would definitely skip a session to go on a Pokemon hunt). He is a great artist and plays the piano (he also listens to PNL, so...). He is very careful about his diet and likes to eat healthy food (but will wash it down with 5 beers). And finally, he is an amazing person, and a great asset to have in an iGEM team (indeed, his spirit animal is the penguin...🐧)
Mehdi MOREL
He has a bachelor in Cellular Biology and physiology, and he’s currently in his last year of Master degree in Biochemistry of therapeutic and toxic molecules. The best way to describe Mehdi is to use one of his quote: ""Mehdi is our god"" Mehdi Morel, August 25, 2016. We really appreciate his humility. Beware, he also has a really mysterious sense of humour (try to not be offended!) and he is a master of language accents. He has also many skills in biology, some may say that he's a genius (his mother and him). So it's making him a really good asset in the laboratory! Big player of golf on his Wii console, he plays also soccer ""sometimes"". His favourite animal is the albinos dolphin!
Thomas VIALON

St_Andrews,2010,Team:St Andrews#project#safety#GMO_-_-_TEXT.html," environment (e.g. expression of antibiotics etc)
Escherichia coli DH5 (a K12 derivative) is disabled with respect to growth outside the laboratory. The cells have limited survivability in the environment and often have auxtrophic reqirements which are unlikely to be satisfied outside the laboratory, and thus are unlikely to present a hazard to the environment. The autoinducers 3OC6HSL and CAI-1 are present in nature, for example the LuxR signaling system in marine bacterium Vibrio Fischeri, and the cholera quorum sensing system in most strains of Vibrio Cholerae, including the many avirulent ones.
(iii) Hazards arising from the alteration of existing traits (e.g. alteration of pathogenicity, host range or tissue tropism) One factor to consider is whether the inserted sequence encodes a pathogenicity determinant, such as an adhesin, a penetration factor or a surface component providing resistance to host defense mechanisms. Another important consideration is whether the inserted gene encodes a surface component, envelope protein or capsid protein that might bind to a different receptor to that used by recipient microorganism. If an animal or plant, will the modified organism act as a ‘reservoir’ for an organism that would not have been present in that species before.
.  The inserted genes are unlikely to alter the pathogenicity of the cloning host, E. coli.
(iv) The potential hazards of sequences within the genetically modified organism being transferred to related organisms Factors to consider include whether widespread dissemination of the inserted gene as a result, for example, of either gene transfer or recombination of the genetically modified micro-organisms with a wild-type micro-organism, would be a matter of concern. If an animal or plant, what would happen if wild type organisms organisms mated with the genetically modified version (e.g. escape of plant pollen, escape of fish eggs/sperm etc). If this is the case an important consideration will be whether, in the event of a breach of containment the organism  could survive in the environment for long enough for such a gene transfer to take place.
Escherichia coli DH5 (a K12 derivative) is recognized as being unable to colonize humans and is disabled with respect to growth outside the laboratory.  The cells have limited survivability in the environment and often have auxtrophic reqirements which are unlikely to be satisfied outside the laboratory, and thus are unlikely to present a hazard to the environment.

COLLABORATIONS
Collaborations
With the extensive support we receive from Mindfuel’s geekStarter program, many collaborations were made possible this year, both with High school and Collegiate iGEM teams.  Three different Mindfuel events were held in the last year, which brought the following teams together to share our ideas and project successes, and to troubleshoot and support one another with stumbling blocks:
Notre Dame Collegiate iGEM
Lethbridge High School iGEM
University of Calgary iGEM
University of Calgary BioMod
University of Lethbridge iGEM
University of Alberta iGEM
Through these meaningful collaboration events, we got to know other students working in Synthetic Biology and made meaningful connections with other experts and mentors in the field.  In particular, we are grateful to have met the U of Alberta iGEM team, who worked with Dr. Robert E. Campbell, who was an expert in mCherry, and provided us with a sample of purified mCherry lysate for our spectrophotometric assays!
We had hoped to connect more closely with the Tianjin 2016 iGEM team members since our PET-hydrolase constructs were intended to be modifications and improvements upon their excellent work. Unfortunately, we did not get any responses from our emails or social media outreach to Tianjin 2016, and so we were not able to collaborate with them.
