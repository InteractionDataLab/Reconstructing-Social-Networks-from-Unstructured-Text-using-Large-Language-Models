Do you know nothing or nuthings?
A knowledge survey by LiU iGEM
LiU iGEM performed a survey to test the common knowledge about food allergies. The 330 participants                     were between 18-56 years old and students or employees at Swedish universities*. The survey was                     conducted in Swedish and spread by social media, mostly on Facebook.
Education
LiU iGEM predicted that participants with a university education including studies of the immune                     system or allergies and hypersensitivity, i.e. immunology or allergology, would have a greater                     knowledge about allergies than the ordinary student or employee. Participants were therefore asked                     whether their university education had included sections of these subjects. A quarter of the                     participants’ university educations had included sections of immunology or allergology.
How would you define allergy?
Participants were asked to define what an allergy actually is. Students and employees, who have not                     studied immunology or allergology defined allergy as an abnormal defense mechanism (67 %), inability                     to break down a certain substance (21 %), a cold linked to a certain stimuli (5 %), a food                     intolerance (3 %), hives and facial swelling (3%) or as a seasonal cold (1 %). Allergy definitions                     are summarized in Figure 1. Participants educated in immunology or allergology knows their subject                     and 95 % answered that an allergy is an abnormal defense mechanism.
An allergic reaction is indeed caused by the immune system, which is the main defense mechanism                     managing the protection against invading organisms, e.g. bacteria, viruses and parasites. These                     invading organisms are in many cases harmful and cause illness. An allergy is when the immune system                     mistakes an otherwise harmless substance as a dangerous intruder. The allergy inducing substances                     cause the immune system to overreact and produce Immunoglobin E (IgE) antibodies, which in their                     turn cause a chain reaction of cells releasing histamines and other chemicals leading to an allergic                     reaction and symptoms that commonly are associated with allergies, such as hives, facial swelling                     and other cold resembling symptoms1.
Inability to break down a certain substance is a more suitable description of one type of food                     intolerance caused by enzyme defects, e.g. lactose intolerance which is the inability to break down                     lactose, a type of sugar present in dairy products. Food intolerance, unlike food allergy, can have                     a number of different causes. Food"

Rare codons
When overexpressing genes from other organisms. Initially we won't be very worried about this, however there might be lower expression of the protein from the bacteria we will use. If this becomes a bigger problem we might use bacteria strains that already contains tRNA for different rare codons.
Neglect, synthesize the gene, overexpress rare tRNA or use a strain that already overexpress the tRNA

We are lucky enough to quickly get this. Once we increase the initial concentration of one cell, we are really surprised to observe  oscillate behavior. But this also inspired us to discover more special aspects. In the end, we identify the following behavior.
We could just simplify increase the Hill coefficient for AHL-induced production of Zeo-R of one cell. The results suggests that the two prisoners fight every hard, oscillates between the two cell populations.
How we explain this? Actually the Hill coefficient is about the sensitivity of AHL in one cell, if we increase this, it means the cell will more easily to notice the AHL change in the environment and act quickly, just like a man is more calculative, he can incisively notice the other’s good will and quickly take advantage of it. But soon the other man also realize his trick and give the revenge. So the system break down.
A farther question how to increase the Hill coefficient? We may increase the active site on the enzyme, but of course it’s difficult. Then we come up an idea that we can increase the binding sites of the gene on the promoter, this may be helpful and easily doable.  We looked for some articles and find out the Prof. T.K. Lu from MIT electric engineering department has reported a similar approached [3]. Whether this approach would work or not remain to be tested.
we also used the software from SUSTC-Shenzhen-B to help us. Here is the result:
Future work
First part: the classical prisoner’s dilemma
1) We use bacteriological experiments to simulate the classical prisoner’s dilemma: the length of sentence is equivalent to the slowdown of growth.
2) Because of the symmetry of the classical situation (the sentence is same to A and B), we can choose the previous cell A and cell B. Cooperate and betray will be realized by constitutive promoters of different activities.
3) Before we start the experiment, we will pick the plasmid pairs with the different combination of constitutive promoter, transform into two E.coli to get cells A and B.
4) Cultivate the bacteria without adding Zeo nor Nickel to reach OD 0.2-1.0. The LuxI, LasI, tetA, Zeo-r expressed by the two kinds of bacteria are almost the same.
5) Start the experiment: mix cell A and cell B and add appropriate amount of Zeo and nickel to adjust the sentence under different situation. Observe the growth"

Secondly, the Thymidine nucleotide at the zero repeat is very important to the binding affinity of the TALE (Meckler et al., 2013). Thirdly, the binding affinity of TALE varies based on the types of the nucleotides present in its target site. The relative affinities are: NG(1)>NN (0.18)!HD (0.16) "" NI (0.0016)>NK (0.00016) (Meckler et al., 2013). All these points must be carefully considered while designing the TALE to maximize its binding affinity and specificity.
The four TALEs designed by Slovenia 2012 iGEM team, were ordered from the registry (TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ), TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ) and TALE D ( BBa_K782005 )). Primers were designed to incorporate the the target sequences of TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ) and TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ) ([A] and [B]) in the RFP generator. This plasmid will be used as a target sequence. Primers were also designed that incorporate selected point mutations of [A] and [B] into a biobrick. Once these plasmids are made they will be used to determine how the TALEs affinity is altered by mutations. In addition, two other TALEs were ordered from the the authors of the Meckler et al. 2013 paper.
Week 5: May 27 - May 31
We continued our literature search for a unique and stable pathogenic E. coli marker for the TALEs to bind to. Potential pathogenic O157:H7 E. coli markers: stx1, stx2 (Yoshitomi et al., 2012), uidA (Yoshitomi et al., 2003 and Feng et al., 1994), eaeA, hly, rbfE (Fortin et al., 2000), and Z3276 (Li & Chen, 2012). However, BLAST searches determined that the use of only one 18 bp sequence is not sufficiently specific and sensitive to detect pathogenic markers. Should we continue to search for only one marker or more than one or expand the detection to any toxic Shiga producing strains?
In addition to searching for a pathogenic E. coli marker, we also started working on the TALE sequence and its"

PCR Bacillus RBS
We created 2 different Bacillus RBS sites simply by primer annealing and extension. Each product includes an 8bp RBS plus the BioBrick prefix and suffix for a total of 54bp.  The products were visualized on a 3.5% Agarose gel with bioline's hyperladder V.
RBSs is the consensus RBS sequence for Bacillus subtilis, and thus we believe it to be a very strong binding site -   AAAGGAGG
RBSw has a 2bp modification from RBSs, which we believe will weaken it -  AGAGGTGG
The amplification of RBSs yielded only one band on the gel. The product was purified using microclean and contained 14.8ng/uL after clean-up.
RBSw, however produced 2 bands on the gel. The correct size was gel-extracted and purified. After purification the yield was 12.3 ng/uL.

Also, we needed to design our genes that we wanted to insert in a way their products wouldn’t harm humans, and it was necessary to decide which therapeutic proteins we were going to produce as tumor toxins. From our past project and bibliographical research, we found out that the soluble part of the protein TAT-Apoptin (<a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1166005 "">BBa_K1166005</a>)was a protein that has an antitumoral activity with high specificity leaving healthy tissue in its majority unharmed. Nonetheless, the protein’s activity could be enhanced by using a survivin siRNA, which overexpressed by tumoral cells; thus, we needed to regulate the expression of it. This was accomplished by using a  hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) promoter (<a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K404106 "">BBa_K404106</a>), which is induced by several transcription factors found in cancerous cells, which will stop the siRNa from activating in a healthy cell.  For more information, you can check <a href=""module4.html"">Module IV</a>.
Then, the bacteria was designed to produce its recombinant bacteriophage under a quorum sensing system, which is described in <a href=""module2.html"">Module II</a>. Also, the strains that are being used in the project cannot survive outside laboratory conditions for more than two weeks because they are derived from E.coli K12. Therefore, the probability of producing bacteriophages outside the laboratory conditions is very low.
Finally, its important to recall that the project is not ready to be used as an industrial product, as more research is needed. This knowledge will be generated after all the experimental tests on this strain are finished, which must include in vivo and clinical trials, outside the reach of a one-summer test. Also, a construct without antibiotic resistance is yet to be developed and the use of an auxotrophic dependence construct needs to be developed previous to its release.

We aim to make a construct that is activated in the presence of a hasS-hasI complex that is formed in the presence of CD44v6 on the surface of cancer cells. The construct makes use of luxR and luxI to activate the production of invasin and listeriolysin O (LLO), as well as a designated drug that will be able to kill off the cancer cells.
The combination of both invasin and LLO allows the bacterium to invade mammalian cells and escape from the endosome into the cytoplasm of the cell. Once in the cytoplasm, the drug released from the bacterium can build up within the cell to result in the destruction of the cell. Combined with RIOT Sensor and RIOT Transponder, the bacterium can potentially target and eliminate cancer cells with minimal side effects.
Initially, small amounts of N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) produced by our engineered bacteria freely diffuse in and out of the cell. In tumor regions with an expected higher cell density, the concentration of AHL also increases. Past a threshold, LuxR binds to AHL and this LuxR-AHL complex will further activate expression of LuxI, producing more AHL. This creates a positive feedback loop that increases both the concentration of LuxI and of our desired proteins, invasin and LLO.

Results
The AMC experiment showed that we are able to detect a significant difference between the Bitis species and the Naja nigricollis. The initial AMC substrate experiment led to a more comprehensive substrate screening experiment that resulted in multiple substrate candidates. We managed to assemble the peptide sequences into the plasmid backbone (pSB1C3). The venom degradation test of the reporter molecules amilCP and β-galactosidase showed no reduction in the colorimetric or enzymatic properties. We improved part BBa_K592009 by adding a His-tag, the expression of color was not reduced and the color protein could easily be retained by a His-tag purification. To further improve our diagnostic device a reduction on the response time for the result was undertaken. Instead of the amilCP the reporter enzyme β-galactosidase were to be attached to the substrate linker. However, there were no successful assembly of ScAvidin with the linker to the β-galactosidase.
Visit experimental design page for the theory and design behind our experiments, and protocols for the protocols of our experiments.
AMC Experiment
In this experiment, we used the AMC fluorescent molecule, coupled with a peptide sequence (A-L-K) known to be cleaved by serine proteases from literature. The molecule emits fluorescence when it is released from the peptide it is coupled with.  For that reason, we expected to see fluorescence when the peptide was cleaved by proteases in the snake venom. We first generated a standard curve of the AMC molecule without the peptide sequence as seen in figure 1. The raw data for the standard curve can be found here .
Figure 1: AMC standardcurve.The AMC molecule is not connected with the substrate in this part of the experiment.
We tested the AMC-substrate peptide against the venom from our three snakes of interest, Bitis arietans, Bitis gabonica and Naja nigricolis. We made measurements in five different timepoints, with five different venom concentrations. The background noise was deducted from all measurements. The experiment showed that this particular substrate is cleaved significantly by the two venoms from Bitis arietans and Bitis gabonica, but not by the venom of Naja nigricolis as seen in figure 2-4. Different concentrations of venom had great effect in the fluorescence intensity. You can find the raw data here .

<img src = ""
"" class = ""contTitle"" />
As written in the Project part, we can imagine an expansion of the sigma-recounter, which can count a lot of numbers. One of the most important problems arising from the expansion is that a single induction may inadvertently increase the count number 2 or more times. We will explain this by considering the 3 counter. Below is the construct of the 3 counter.
<img src = ""
"" class = ""figure"" />
When arabinose is induced for the first time, sigma A will be expressed and its positive feedback loop will be put in motion. On the second induction, sigma B will be expressed, and third, GFP will be expressed.
There is a problem that occurs in the first induction. Not only sigma A but also a little amount of sigma B will be expressed in the first induction, as a portion of sigma A precociously stimulates the next step in the counting sequence. The sigma B positive feedback loop circuit exemplifies that little expression. Because of these two characteristics, sigma B has possibility of being highly expressed before the second induction; in other words, it counts 2. We did not have to model this in our main construct, because GFP does not have its positive feedback loop circuit.

Nerve and electrodes
As seen in the other parts of this wiki, we chose to use a nanoporous membrane in our device. The first goal of the membrane was to confine our biofilm, so it does not escape the prosthesis. Moreover, we also used our membrane as a conductive electrode. This solution was interesting since we didn’t have enough time to develop an entire electrical device which collects and treat the signal of the nerves. However, we know we still need to improve our interface if we want the patient to fully control his prosthesis. That is why we decided to look at what is already made in this field. So, first, we detailed how it is possible to model the electrical characteristics of a nerve. Then, we searched for information on electrodes and signal treatment.
This section is principally based on the thesis of Olivier Rossel: Dispositifs de measure et d’interprétation de l’activité d’un nerf. Electronique. Université Montpellier II - Sciences et Techniques du Languedoc, 2012. Français.
Nerve modelisation
Gold-coated membranes
One of the goals of NeuronArch is to use or even develop a neural signal collection solution that is both non-invasive for the nerve and highly selective. In this context, we seek to develop an innovative architecture to significantly improve the selectivity of extraneural electrodes. In order to be able to develop such a solution, we must be able to estimate the electrical potential created on the surface of the nerve by the propagation of transmembrane currents at the level of the axons.
For this study, we are only interested in myelinated axons present in the peripheral nervous system. Models that represent the extracellular voltage produced by the passage of an action potential for this type of fiber already exist. The evolution of the extracellular voltage in the space separating two nodes of Ranvier can be described by these models.
First, we are going to detail the physiological characteristics of the human nervous system. Then, we are going to model the electrical currents of an axon. Finally, we will estimate the influence of such currents at the surface of a nerve and model an entire nerve.

Additionally, the time course was adapted: 48 hours are usually recommended for biofilm growth but we were uncertain as to whether that might be too long; the biofilm growth could possibly overwhelm the activity of Esp or Esp could simply have lost activity after such a long incubation time.
Biofilm Assay, Second Attempt [✔️]
When repeating this assay, the samples were now not split anymore in supernatant and pellet, reducing the amount of work. Furthermore, 12 replicates of each sample were performed and the plates were quantified after only 27 hours of incubation.
Again, the S. aureus results were unfortunately not usable since both positive and negative controls showed highly unusual behaviour. The tests on P. aeruginosa, however, displayed some measure of inhibition though the effect does not seem to correlate with the amount of cell lysate that was added. However, considering that incubation with 50 μl of cell lysate reduced the absorbance by almost 50 % compared to the negative control, some measure of biofilm-inhibiting activity seems to be present.
Figure 16. Absorbance at 595 nm after incubation of P. aeruginosa with cell lysates for 27 hours.
After those two assays, no clear conclusion can be drawn but there are indications that EB might work as predicted. The results obtained using P. aeruginosa imply that EB might in fact inhibit the formation of biofilms though the variance of the samples can be considerable, as explained above. Due to time constraints, we were unfortunately not able to repeat the assays, even though it would have been very beneficial to test either a truncated or cleaved form of EB which has been shown to have a much stronger biofilm-dispersing activity. For any future project involving EB and its activity on biofilm, more replicates and various time points should also be considered.
Demonstrating efficient Biofilm dispersal by EB
The approach was very similar to the one outlined above for the biofilm inhibition. The main differences lies in the timing: P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were incubated for 48 hours allowing them to form a biofilm before the combat proteins were added. All statistical analysis was conducted using Student's T-test.
Biofilm Dispersal, First Attempt [❌]
In this test, we encountered a well-known issue with the negative control - even the cell lysates of untransformed cells (or the lysis"

Actually, the normal function of ears is dependent on a system that realize amplification and subsequent transduction from sound wave to shear force. Given those suggestions, we read a paper about channels on plant cell membrane may take responsibility for their ability of sound sensing, which suggests the possible applications of our project. [2] Also, we designed microfluidics and other stimulus to test our system.
When we studied advanced knowledge about sound-sensitive channels, we consulted Dr. Zhiyi Wei majoring in Biochemistry& Structural Biology suggested that if we want to achieve better efficiency, we ought to use directed evolution methods to strengthen the sensitivity on protein level.

DESCRIPTION
Overview
To achieve our goal of detecting the antioxidants capacity of different products in living                         cells, it our system can be divided into three parts, regulator, feedback and output.
Regulator
Firstly, we choose to increase the intracellular ROS content, considering that:
● The level of ROS in normal cells is low and hard to detection.
● Make the cell under oxidative stress to simulate the normal cellular oxidative process                             or, rather, the aging process.
● The most intuitive effect of antioxidants is their reduction of intracellular ROS                             content. We can evaluate antioxidants indirectly through the remaining amount of ROS.
● After reviewing most cell-based antioxidant detection methods recorded in literature, we                             discover that almost all protocols will induce cell in an oxidant stress firstly.
Therefore, we established this part to do such kind of thing. Meanwhile, we hope the way to                         stimulate the accumulation of ROS is easy and equipment-independent, which makes our system                         more available for customers.
However, higher oxidative stress is always accompanied by lower survival rate, in hence we also                         need to do something to make our host cell more robust and prevent cells from dying for                         oxidation.
Feedback
After increasing the concentration of ROS in cell, there's still somethings we need to                         consider:
● The high level of ROS will damage the cells and even lead to cells death.
● Low survival rate under high oxidant state may affect the signal output of our system,                             making our results not convincing.
● It's hard to control the ROS accumulation in every assay, which means our test may be                             NON-repeatable.
Based on these reasons, we need to add an feedback system to control the concentration of ROS                         in vivo, make it higher than normal level, lower than death level to maintain cell viability                         and last, steady for test. We solve this problem by adding an ROS sensor, which has a suitable                         sensing threshold so that it can maintain the"

We had an in-depth discussion with R&D staffs. They pointed out many aspects in our software to be improved based on their years of research and development experience. Due to lack of time, we have not improved our software based on these suggestions, but we made future plans as follows. Problem 1: The optimum conditions for each reactions’ enzymes may be different, so there is no guarantee that the recommended optimal pathway will achieve the highest efficiency under the same condition. Future plan: We will take into accont the positions and optimum conditions of each reaction’s enzyme when ranking pathways. Problem 2: There are other factors should be taken into account when evaluating the pathway. For example, is the target compound primary metabolite or secondary metabolite? Which period do the biochemical reactions mainly occur in certain microorganism, growth phase or fermentation period? Future plan: We learned that in the production of industrial compounds, producers tend to use microbial fermentation in an anaerobic environment to reduce the biomass energy consumption and achieve high productity. So we will take the types of metabolite and growth state of microorganism into account when optimising pathway. Problem 3: Why not consider about modyfing existing enzymes to improve efficiency of pathway?  Future plan: Enzymes are often engineered to carry out new functions in the context of synthetic metabolic pathways. Enzyme modification is a challenging and promising solution for improving pathway efficiency. We are planning to read related literature and develop this excitiing funcion afterwards.
Education & Public Engagement Game: ""GO ANTS!!!"" Be Curious about the fantastic biochemical reactions in organisms? Feeling boring in biochemical textbooks? If your answer is yes, then try our game! This year our team designed and developed a fascinating game called “GO ANTS”. This game aims at spreading basic knowledge of metabolic pathway in organisms to general public. It is a double-operated game which incites people’s pleasure of cooperation.

Also, we made necessary introduction of our own project, which was really of great popularity among the junior.
After the report, there were still some students interested in the competition and asked several  questions like the ideas about synthetic biology as far as they were concerned and the information of how to join in  the next year’s iGEM competition. Obviously they got known much more. Meanwhile, we’d got a lot ideas from the audience. Without hesitation, we’ve made it a success as far as the meaning and the adequate influence.

Figure 4 shows the distribution of number of bamA mRNA molecules present at 20 minute intervals, appendix B contains analogous plots for OmpA and lgA.
Figure 4. Distribution of bamA mRNA at 20 minute intervals
Distribution of bamA mRNA is extremely spread out initially during the first 40 minutes due to the variation in starting conditions between runs and rapid initial changes in mRNA level in cases of low initial mRNA and very high DNA masses or cases of high initial mRNA and very low DNA masses. By 120 minutes the distribution has settled in a number of distinct peaks corresponding to parameter sets leading to a particular bamA mRNA equilibrium value.
Figure 5 displays average levels of BamA expression per combination of starting conditions.
Figure 5. Average BamA per combination of starting conditions
By examining the model results broken down by starting conditions we can make recommendations about how best to proceed in the wet lab. From Figure 5 we can see by comparing BamA expression with 25 nanograms DNA and 0 micrograms RNA added compared to when RNA is added for the same mass of DNA there is a much increased rate of initial BamA synthesis as a result of mRNA addition. The increased rate of BamA synthesis due to mRNA addition is present in a lesser extent as higher initial masses of DNA are used. When using the maximum DNA mass of 1000 nanograms addition of mRNA in the quantities supported by the PURE system make little effect to protein expression.
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity Analysis is a vital part of the modelling work flow, by analyzing which parameters contribute most to the uncertainty of the models output we can recognize those parameters that are most important to fine tune from wet lab results.
Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Testing (FAST) is a computationally efficient method to calculate variance based sensitivity indices used here via the SALib library [16]. Intuitively variance represents the spread of a set of numbers. FAST indices represent the proportion of the output variance of the model attributable to a particular variable and its interactions. Focusing on BamA expression as the protein of interest total order FAST sensitivity indices were calculated using the BamA protein level each 20 minutes as the model output.
Figure 5. FAST Total order sensitivity indices
Number of BamA plasmid copies contributes most to output variance over the whole time span due to having an extremely high value and having a major effect on where mRNA equilibrium occurs. bamA mRNA degredation rate is considerably faster than BamA degredation rate - with mRNA halflife of the"

That’s to say, this should be a collaboration where the wet-lab team posts a problem they are having and we should address the issue by creating an online software solution.
This year, 2015 USTC team selected Hardware Track. In their project, they try to send their knights composed of CACCI, SPRING and ROSE to detect those molecules which mean many antibiotic substances emitted directly into environment and endangered in human being’s health. (You could get more information about their project from here .) In detail, SPRING, as a partner of CACCI, is responsible for taking photos by Michelson Interferometer and analyzing the data from the photos, especially getting the physical quantity from the fringes produced by the interferometer.
Achievement
When the wet-lab team provides a picture took by CCD based on Michelson Interferometer, we could analyze fringes number and distance between two points selected by user, in the meanwhile, we also could assure the fringe series of the initial point.
Website for our software tool: fringe.herokuapp.com. How to use: here .
Techniques
Image Processing
Denoise the grayscale:
Choose an appropriate Gauss radius, and use Gauss filter to remove high-frequency noise.
Strengthen the fringes. Pixels of fringes are black, other pixels are white.
Remove more noise by the connectivity of pixels. We examine the 8 pixels surrounding a pixel, and we change this pixel into black if 4 or more of 8 are black. In this way, we can reduce black noise and avoid errors in calculation.
Fringe Counting
Get the line’s function by the coordinates of starting pixel and ending pixel.
List all pixels that the line crosses.
Set fringe threshold and non-fringe threshold and read the coordinates of pixels in 2.We regard it as a fringe if the number of continuous black pixels is larger than threshold and not a fringe if else. Each change from black to white represents a fringe.
Hence, we get the fringe number.

In addition to this, at the request of the Trieste team we sent details of an assay that can be used to test for activity of this β-glucosidase. This assay involves 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide, which is cleaved by β-glucosidase to yield a fluorescent product visible under long-wave blue light. We used this assay ourselves for BBa_K523014 .
Wiki Watch
We created a Wiki Watch page that attempted to convey the very basics of what every other team in the competition was doing. Early in the summer, this page was linked from the official iGEM Community page, and we hope it has helped other teams find partners for cooperation.
Updating the Registry
The hub of our community's collective experience is the Parts Registry. During our work, we have discovered some useful information about several parts in the Registry. We have entered this information in the ""experience"" section of the relevant pages.
BBa_K118022
This part by Edinburgh 2008 encodes an exoglucanase, capable of degrading cellulose. We tested its ability to degrade the cellulose analog MUC, and found that it could.
This information has been added to the Registry on the relevant experience page .
BBa_K415151
This part by MIT 2010 is supposed to encode a fusion of the pVIII protein to a GR1 zipper. However, we noticed that the official verification sequencing carried out by the Registry did not match the expected sequence and did not contain a prefix or suffix.
We tried to determine what the sequence actually is, and discovered that it is a fragment of the E. coli main genome. This fragment naturally has EcoRI and PstI sites at its ends. It has evidently been cut with those enzymes and has somehow become inserted into pSB1C3 via those sites. This naturally wipes out the XbaI and SpeI sites, explaining their absence.
This information has been added to the Registry on the relevant experience page .
BBa_K392008
As mentioned above, Trieste and Edinburgh cooperated around the use of this part from Osaka 2010, and came to suspect that the second ATG present in the sequence is the real start codon.
In addition, there are some other discrepancies between the published sequence and the physical K392008 as well.
This information has been added to the Registry on the relevant experience page .

Biobrick Safety
Our BioBricks, especially those containing the gene coding for the mature region of mouse Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMP2), all possess a degree of risk. In mammals, BMP2 is known to elicit a wide variety of biological effects on tissues; the most well known include induction of bone and cardiac cell differentiation. Being a defining member of the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) pathway, it also plays important roles in cell proliferation. Hence, induction of excess BMP2 may lead to undesirable tissue behavior in mammalian systems.
Documented adverse effects of recombinant human BMP2 include formation of cyst-like bony structures and soft swelling with hematomas when the gene product is applied in spinal fusion therapy. Further animal tests using mice with spine defects indicate that the occurrence and severity of these effects are positively correlated with BMP2 dosage. In addition, as BMP2 receptor transcription has been found to be up-regulated in certain cancer types (for example pancreatic cancer), confined delivery of the chemokine is critical.
See relevant documents by following links below:
High Doses of Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 Induce Structurally Abnormal Bone and Inﬂammation In Vivo
Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signalling and Growth Suppression in Colon Cancer
We would recommend that future groups intending to use this gene do simultaneously incorporate methods to control production of BMP2 to minimize its contact with researchers and/or its release into the environment. Our strategy described in the 'Regulation and Control' module may be viewed as an initial attempt to achieve this.
Expression of BioBricks carrying code for the LytC protein cell wall binding domain and RPMrel phage display peptide will lead to the phenotype of RPMrel peptides anchored to the chassis cell wall. It is known that phages displaying this peptide bind preferentially to the highly tumorigenic HT-29"

This guarantees that our CNC coat will not be totally digested for a certain period of time. The relative high cellulase and lysozyme activity in gut ensure that our coated bacteria will be digested when finally eaten.
Fig 3. Cellulase and lysozyme acticity in different parts of termites gut.
Verification of the release delay effect due to the CNC capsulation
After the CNC capsulation, the termites will not die as soon as before because they need to digest the CNC coat first. This results in a period of time for termites to conduct trophallaxis.

Question 3, The antibiotics that you contact in daily life including?
A. Floxacin (42.68%)
B. Penicillins (81.53%)
C. Cephalosporins (64.33%)
D. Tetracyclines Antibiotics (26.11%)
E. Macrolide Antibiotics (23.57%)
This shows that Penicillins and Cephalosporins are still the mainstream antibiotics on the market. It is not difficult to find that Macrolide Antibiotics becomes more and more popular at the same time. Especially, the most bacterium resistance works for Penicillins, which makes macrolid antibiotics expect to take place of penicillins. In other words, it is necessary and hopeful for us to produce a new macrolide antibiotic, using Synthetic Biology.
Question 4 to 6, Investigate the public attitude toward antibiotics.
Will you ask doctor to add antibiotics if you catch a cold?
A. Yes. I will if the drug is not effective.
B. I will be sure to follow doctor's orders.
C. I prefer to buy cold medicine by myself.
D. I will buy antibiotics by myself.
What will you do if you have to take antibiotics?
A. If the drug doesn't take effect, I will increase dosage with the permission.
B. I won't take medicine any more.
C. I will take medicine when I remember.
D. I will be sure to follow doctor's orders.
What will you do if the doctor give you some antibiotics used for long time?
A. Ask doctor to give me other antibiotic of new generation.
B. I will be sure to follow doctor's orders.
C. Have no sense in it.
As people have a deeper understanding of ABR, the usage of antibiotics becomes more the norm.
The rest of questions mainly investigates that how many solutions do public know to decrease antibacterial resistance and will they be willing to accept a now antibiotic.
Different from above, many people do not know how to decrease antibacterial resistance effectively.
What do you think about exploiting a new antibiotic using Synthetic Biology?
A. The first time must take the sufficient quantity of antibiotic.
B. Avoid using a same antibiotic for a period of time or using the same antibiotic for many times.
C. Mix different antibiotics for one time.
D. Transform the existing antibiotics.
E. Screen the new and effective antibiotics.

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

As an alternative, we came up with idea of extruding our silk via centrifugation.  We designed and 3d printed a column with a small opening at the bottom that could hold liquid and extrude it when placed in a falcon tube in the centrifuge. Although we have not yet attempted to spin a silk fiber, we have spun  fibers from solubilized cellulose acetate using both our syringe pump setup as well as our centrifuge extrusion set up.  We have lyophilized our dialyzed silk product, and are ready to resuspend this in HFIP solvent and spin it.  As soon as we have mastered either the syringe or centrifuge extrusion techniques, we will be ready to produce a fiber from our Bombyx mori silk proteins.

Card Game
This year, as one of our Human Practice projects, we developed a card game called „Pathologia“ . The game consists of cards that represent human pathogens, cures, vaccinations and other special effects that affect human health. The aim of this was to educate about health and disease – with a special focus on the pathogens that cause the disease and their characteristics – in an easy and fun way. As we construed the game in English to enable it to be played all over the globe, we came to realise that a game is best played in one’s native language. This especially applies to our game since most of the cards contain special medical expressions that are not included in the general vocabulary of a foreign language. Additionally, aiming to educate about human health, we tried to include the – in our opinion – most important or most dangerous pathogens. But since many thousand human pathogens exist and different people think of different ones as important, it is nearly impossible for one team to make the game all-embracing. Also, to emphasize the influence of synthetic biology within the game, more new methods or ways to treat diseases using genetic engineering or similar approaches could be added. To address these problems, we decided to invite all teams to collaborate with us on making the game more international, more understandable and as comprising as possible. Thereto we personally asked other teams at the Germany-wide and European Meet-Up as well as posted a collaboration request on the official iGEM Collaboration Side looking for other teams that could translate the basic set of cards and rules to other languages or create new cards for the set. Luckily, many teams got in touch with us wanting to contribute to this project. So first of all, we want to thank all of these teams for making these collaborations possible and the game very versatile. We think, that every single one of these collaborations was very pleasant because we could not only broaden our and the game’s horizon, but also received a lot of feedback on the concept and implementation of the game as well as suggestions for improvement.
Our card game was translated into many languages.

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," BRET behaves similarly but themselves don't catalyze substrates. GFP just fluroscence on its own. For FRET two things (nanoparticles or FPs) acting as donor / acceptor are required; when they are close enough and an external source provides excitement, the donor transfer light received to acceptor which emits a different light.(Piston & Kremers, 2007) BRET is similar to FRET in that donor / acceptor pair is required, but BRET need not external source, rather it is powered by oxidation of substrates.(Pfleger & Eidne, 2006) It seems that for our purposes FRET and BRET are too complicated and doesn't offer good enough signal to noise ratio in our application to justify the use of them. Instead we should focus on simple biochemical reporters, i.e. those enzymes mentioned above.
Thus I have started working on the kinetics of those reporter enzymes.
Week 6: June 3 - June 7
The focus of this week has been the kinetics of those enzyme based reporter genes. There are two approaches to their kinetics, one based on chemical kinetics uses coupled ODEs and another using the results of enzyme kinetics reporting values such as Km and V. I was not trained in enzyme kinetics so I found a textbook by Cornish-Bowden to learn the techniques. (Cornish-Bowden, 2012) This took up most of the week.
The kinetics of horseradish peroxidase in the context of being used for waste water treatment can be found by the work of Carvalho et al. (Carvalho et al., 2006) Even though we intend to use horseradish peroxidase in the context of reporter gene, but we believe the catalytic activities will be the same, so the reaction pathways for pehnols in that paper can be readily adopted for our causes. On the other hand the kinetics of fluorescence of beta-galactosidase has been studied by Huang. (Huang, 1991) However the kinetics presented is very simple compared to work done by Metelkin et al. (Metelkin, Lebedeva, Goryanin, & Demin, 2009) We need to decide whatever the detailed model will give us better results to justify their complexity.
Week 7: June 10 - June 14
In this week 4 models of enzyme kinetics have been built in Mathmeatica for the study of beta-galactosidase, luciferase and horseradish per"
IIT_Kharagpur,2015,Team:IIT Kharagpur#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html,"   and we were able to register towards the end of April. All the registration formalities were carried   out  and  Prof.  Ganguly  was  chosen  as  the  principal  guide  of  our  iGEM  team  because  of  his   expertise  in  synthetic  biology  and  his  willingness  to  dedicate  time  and  resources  for  the   consolidation and success of the project. In the next few weeks, several meetings were held amongst the team members and with our   guide.  Related  papers  were  presented  and  discussed  and  the  idea  was  consolidated.   Accordingly, the work­flow for the project was chalked out. As many of the fourth year students   were going abroad for summer internships, the ones staying back had to schedule their work in   the  lab  and distribute  the  work  to  the  many  third  years  who  were  staying  back  too.  Those   members  who  were  going  for  interns  also  ensured  progress  of  the  wiki  content  development   and other non lab­related assignments.
Lab work:
Wet­Lab work regarding transformations and cloning had started before the arrival of the Kit of   Parts. Sriram and few other third year students had stayed back in the summers and practised   the  various methods of rDNA technology. Prof. Ganguly, along with few of his PhD  students,   was himself present throughout the  summer to train our team members in these procedures.   The Kit of Parts arrived in the summer vacation period itself. After that, experiments began with   full force and as the  vacations ended, the rest of the team members, who had gone for their   internships,  joined  in  one  after  the  other.  All  the  wet­lab  work  was  carried  out  in  the  fully   equipped UG lab of our department which remains open 24X7. Our  experiments  were  often  interrupted  by  setbacks  and  challenges.  When  we  first  tried  to   transform  the  luxR  and  crtEBI,  we  did  not  get  the  colonies.  This  may  have  been  a result  of   experimental errors like improper  spreading or  so. However, after  several attempts, we  could   rectify  it  and  obtained  colonies.  We"

The fimE KO strains show visible rings around the Caco-2 cells. In the plates were fimH KO bacteria were inserted, there were almost no bacteria found in the well even after the first washing steps of the immunocytochemistry. The fimH KO strains with the fimH 49KO+RPMrel gene, without rhamnose induction, showed little but clear attachment to the cells, but if induced with rhamnose for 3 hours, clumps of bacteria formed around the Caco-2 cells, which despite all the washing steps did not detach off the cells! Several pictures were taken from all around the 6-wells and all showed similar results to the ones shown.
Taking into account the results from the Agglutination assay, where the fimH KO with the BBa_K1850011 construct on a low copy backbone did not agglutinate to mannose (therefore at healthy epithelial cells), while at the same time our co-culture showed clear adhesion to Caco-2 cells. We are now confident that our targeted delivery system is completely functional!
RNAi-based logic circuit
Transfections
Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFischer Scientific) was used in experiments with the Caco-2, HEK-293 and A549 cell lines. Approximately 4x104 Caco-2 cells or 1x105 HEK-293 and A549 cells in 1 ml of high-glucose DMEM complete medium were seeded into each well of a 24-well and incubated for 24 hours. Transfections were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer, using the ratios described in [ 6 ] for the different plasmids. Doxycycline was added to a final concentration of 1 ug/ml. After a 16-hour incubation, media containing the lipid transfection complexes were replaced with fresh DMEM media and incubated for 2 days before being analyzed for fluorescence.
FACS Analysis
A BD FACSCalibur analyzer was used for the flow cytometry experiments of the transfected cells. The cells were prepared by trypsinizing each well with 0,25% trypsin-EDTA, collecting the cells, centrifuging them, removing trypsin and resus"

People were also interested to know more about Biotic Blue and the competition, which gave us the opportunity to pitch the idea and spread the word.
Articles About Us
Article in Medicor (1st issue 2018)
One fact that we want to stress as much as possible is that our project, as well as research in general, is for societies around the globe. Research has always been the result of trying to understand how things work, both outside and within the human and animal body. It is also conducted to find solutions and ways to improve life. Why conducting research if not for the benefit of us, or the planet? In the first issue of Medicor (the magazine founded by the Medical Student’s Association, Karolinska Institutet), we stress the importance of diversity in research and how engaging the public will lead to a successful project.
Article in Nya Åland (13th of August)
We believe that it is of great importance to reach out to parts of our society that are more affected or live nearby the problems we are trying to solve. One way of reaching out to these people was to contact Nya Åland, one of two newspapers on Åland. Åland is an island located in the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Finland. We told the newspaper about our project and how we want to tackle the situation that the Baltic Sea is facing, where antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals could impact the aquatic and marine ecosystem.
Interview for Libération (5th of September)
In September, a journalist from the French daily newspaper Libération contacted us regarding meeting up for an interview. The journalist was Amaelle Guiton, a journalist focusing on reporting on political and geopolitical issues relating to digitization, data protection and privacy. Amaelle was interested in talking about iGEM and biohacking, whether they could work together or if they are separated from each other.

HBsu- (x)fp BioBrick Cloning Strategy
The team has been looking in literature for a protein that binds non-specifically to DNA. This will aid the visualization of Genome Shuffling among L-forms by enabling the team to see sections of DNA that have come from two different Bacteria. The decision was made to use the HBsu protein which is encoded by the hbs gene in B.subtilis because it is well characterised and should remain associated with the DNA for a long period of time. The HBsu will be conjugated with a florescent protein such as GFP and RFP.

Edinburgh_UG,2016,Team:Edinburgh UG#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," in Edinburgh and on October 5th the Dundee iGEM and debate teams came down to visit us and have the debate! It was a great success and the debate raised a lot of valid points about the ethics behind GM development. As an example, the team in support of the motion brought up the complex economic consequences farming GMO's can have in developing countries. As both sides of the debate team were constituted of biology and non-biology undergraduate students the arguments that were brought up were very dynamic. The debate definitely brought up some food for thought in the Dundee team and ours! We were also pleased with the audience turn out: there were a lot biology students who may well be working in this field in the future, in addition to non-biology students interested in the topic! The response from them was useful to Dundee iGEM team as part of their human practices.
Newcastle University
This summer, the iGEM team at Newcastle had the brilliant idea to research biological alternatives to electrical circuitry. As we’re sure many iGEM teams encounter throughout the course of their project, with the advancement of synthetic biology comes very difficult and abstract questions about ethics and policy. As part of their human practices the Newcastle team wanted to create a ‘thought-experiment’ game to simulate the questions that they had encountered this summer and get people to think differently about their project.
One area where we ran into many difficult questions was during the development of our encryption. During the summer we came up with many scenarios and had to answer difficult questions about why we wanted to incorporate encryption and when it is appropriate. Our own thought process, coupled with Newcastle’s idea for an interactive game gave rise to the perfect collaboration!
We helped Newcastle incorporate an extra ‘level’ to their game by sharing our experiences and conversations with encryption experts. We also shared with them details of our encryption method so that they could use it in their game and even consider it’s use in light of their biological circuitry.
Exeter University
We met the Exeter iGEM team at the UK team meet-up in London. After our presentation they approached us with some interesting questions on the workings of our error correction system - particularly the way in which we worked out our checksum values.
Following up on these conversations we began work on a very fruitful collaboration in which they modelled alternatives to our checksum method in order to try and increase its capacity for error detection. Their findings can be found on our error correction page .

This device can also be linked to the computer and has the ability of offline CNC screen operation, which improves the detection efficiency. What’s more, little device is convenient to carry and free from  limitation of experimental conditions. Biological method not only has the priority of concise operations and less consumption, but also has the advantages of high accuracy, specificity, and security.
Biosensors Mining
Quorum sensing was first found in Vibrio fischeri in the ocean. Microorganisms achieve information communication by releasing a signaling molecules referred as auto inducer(AI). AI will promotes related gene expression in bacteria, meanwhile regulate microbes’ biological behaviors. Bacteria use quorum sensing to coordinate certain behaviors such as biofilm formation, virulence, bioluminescence and antibiotic resistance, based on the local density of bacteria. Thus microbes can collaborate to achieve cell populations’s engineering.  In Vibrio fischeri , plux promoter regulates the expression of quorum sensing system while plux promoter is automatically regulated by AI. PluxL and pluxR respectively promote transcription to the left and right. PluxL regulates transcription of LuxR gene ;in the meantime, pluxR can also start expression of luxI and fluorescence related genes. LuxI, is responsible for production of N-acyl-homoserine-lactone (AHL) autoinducer while luxR,is activated by this autoinducer to increase transcription of the luciferase operon. The enhanced E.coli quorum sensing system we reconstructed is greatly dependent to plac promoter. Plac will serve as pluxL in this system to promote transcription. Once the transcription has been started by plac, it will extend to series genes such as luxR、pluxR and luxI downstream. Noticeably, the LuxI/LuxR genes form a functional pair, considering LuxI as the auto-inducer synthase and LuxR as the receptor. We can obtain translation products luxI to catalyze the formation of AHL.  The yield of luxI protein is very low with a tenuous concentration of cells, likewise result in the subtle concentration of AHL in periplasmic. As the amount of cells increases, the density of AHL will reach a threshold value, this can strongly accelerate the formation of one kind of complex which is composed of AHL and luxR , also the complex will firmly promotes transcription of pluxR ,hence we acquire desired expression of bioluminescence related genes as well as increasing amount of luxI、luxR、AHL, which in turn form a positive regulation.

Click here to learn more about the DIλ spectrophotometer
How quality control will be performed. The transfer of the inoculate should be done in sterile conditions in a container that also plays the role of fluorimeter cuvette. This ensures that even low-budget labs will always distribute the right strain to people.
An extendable system
Our differentiation system is inspired by the Brainbow system, initially developed for tracking the axons of neurons in mammalian's brain. We modified it so it becomes extendable (A).
This system is randomized on a single-cell level, so each cell produce one —and only one—, vitamin pathway. In most research work, metabolic engineering has been done only one target compound at a time, and little is known about what happens when production pathways are used simultaneously in the same cell (B).
Having one cell expressing only one pathway should theoretically preclude unexpected interactions between different pathways, thus making an extendable framework where every synthesis function is decoupled (C).
The different vitamin-producing pathways can be prototyped separately on a classical lab strain, and it is then easy to put them all together in the same chassis for a multi-functional organism.
The chassis
Let us see how it works under the hood.
Before addition of any metabolic pathways, this is what our empty chassis would look like. The following cassette is integrated in the chromosome. All proteins' coding regions are preceded by a RBS (Ribosome Binding Site) and followed by a transcription terminator.
Constitutive promoter: Thanks to this promoter, a RNA transcript of the cassette will be produced until the first terminator is reached.
The Lox Array: The original LoxP site comes from the phage P1. When an enzyme called the CRE recombinase is expressed, all the DNA between two Lox sites is deleted. Each lox site is made of one overlap region (in bold) surrounded by two complementary flanking regions. The middle of the sequence can be modified, but two LoxP sites will recombine together only if the sequence is exactly identical for both (Richier 2015). The flanking regions cannot be mutated and determine the specificity for one recombination enzyme.
Here are the four orthogonal Lox sites we used:
LoxP: ATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTAT
Lox2272: ATAACTTCGTATAAAGTATCCTATACGAAGTTAT

National Science Olympiad
UW-Madison was the host for the 2011 National Science Olympiad where middle school and high school students came from around the country to compete in science competitions.  As the host, UW-Madison had an exhibition of several academic department and academic student organizations, in which they presented their research for the students to explore.  At each table students could learn about research conducted here on campus through hands-on activities and hopefully inspire them to learn more.
The UW-Madison 2011  iGEM team had a table and we talked about the iGEM organization based at MIT and about our current project.  In order for them to interact with synthetic biology concepts, we created a problem-solving game where students could try their hand at cloning. For example, on our poster we listed several descriptions of genes and promoters. After the students read the descriptions, we challenged them to assemble the genes and promoters in the proper order for expression of a reporter gene. If they put the components in the correct order, they received a glow stick to represent the fluorescence one would see after induction of the system in liquid culture.  Since some students were in high school, we also mentioned to students and teachers about the iGEM high school competition division and encouraged them to look at the iGem website for more information on starting their own team.

A brief timeline
February 20: Meeting with Dr. Tae Jin Kim (Chemical Engineering Department, Stony Brook University)
The group researched potential renewable biofuel products and decided to meet with Dr. Tae Jin Kim, an expert at Stony Brook University’s Chemical Engineering department early on in their project development. They learned about the current state of biofuels and synthetic biology. They met with Dr. Kim, who explained the difficulty in converting lignocellulose, a form of plant-derived sugar, to usable fuels. From the meeting, we learned that it is difficult because of the chemical composition of diesel and gasoline and the long chemical pathways involved in producing them. According to Dr. Kim, decades of research and funding from the Department of Energy has already gone into biofuel production. However, Dr. Kim saw some potential in engineered enzymes, which he thought may have potential to overcome some issues, especially with algae as possible next-generation feedstock. Though originally we planned on focusing on the fermentation process and form lipid biodiesel, this discussion led us to pursue algae and other photosynthetic chassis. We also decided to focus on producing products that have far less complex synthesis pathways, thereby allowing us to focus on the production of feedstock. We also learned that some companies, such as Joule Unlimited, Algenol, HelioBioSys, and Proterro, attempted to work with algae-based biofuel but had become bankrupt. From what we learned in scientific literature on algae-based biofuels, we started to reach out to and investigate these companies, so that we could identify any faults in the system and learn what issues we could attempt to solve. 
March 28: Meeting with Dr. Jackie Collier (School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, Stony Brook University)  
We wanted to meet with an expert who works with cyanobacteria because we lacked knowledge of how to grow our strain of cyanobacteria. We chose to meet in person and tour her lab because were interested in learning how to properly culture cyanobacteria. Touring her lab allowed us to see how microbiologists working with cyanobacteria perform research. She also aided us greatly in our equipment setup and culture conditions. For one, she recommended that we bubble"

OVERVIEW
        The heavy metal pollution is very severe in south China. However, it is very inconvenient for the public to learn about and detect the heavy metal pollution in the water sources around them. Thus, we try to design a low-cost, fast and portable tool for the public to detect the heavy metal ions in tap water and rivers around. Factories can also use it to check whether the concentration of heavy metal arrives the national drinking water safety standards.
        To better understand the pollution status of heavy metals in Guangdong province, and whether our project has achieved our goal of bringing people convenience, we carried out a series of social practice. Our practice can be briefly summarized in three parts:
        At first, we interviewed experts in environment, law and biological engineering, and an official of Environmental Protection Administration to collect their suggestions on our project.
        Besides, we visited and interviewed some members of an electroplating factory, asking for their opinions on our project and collecting water samples for demonstration of our work.
        Moreover, we conducted a questionnaire survey about public awareness of heavy metal knowledge and the demand for public science education, and tried to promote and popularize the knowledge of heavy metal pollution, synthetic biology, biological safety and iGEM, according to the feedback of the questionnaire
        According to the suggestions and opinions we got from this practice, we obtained many practical ideas and then improved the final effect of our project.
        What's more, we exchanged project ideas and experience with many other iGEM teams. For some teams, we helped each other with the projects in order to have a better performance together in the competition.
The overview of our practice is as followings:
Silver
        We interviewed Guining Lu, a professor of environmental studies, about the pollution status of heavy metals, existing detection means and asked for advices on our project.
        We interviewed Xiongwen Yang, a lawyer as well as a professor of Law School, about the existing policies and regulations about biological products.
        We interviewed the Environmental Protection Administration in Zhongshan City, to acquire the policy about the environmental monitoring, the regulations of polluted water"

Ethics
Genetic editing and genetic therapy (especially those involving transgenesis), key applications of TALE, raise several noticeable ethics problems (listed below).
1.  In regard of current lacking of legal treaty on such issues, uncontrolled access to such technologies may cause unpredictable chaos.
2.  Experiments conducted on genetic therapy may pose threat to human life.
3.  Transgenesis and genetic modifying may have long-term effects on the environment
4.  It might be hard to set the boundaries between species with gene editing taken into consideration.
5.  Transgenesis may have negative influence on animal welfare.

Fig.5 Predictive graph during detection
From the analysis results, we can optimize the detection time in order to achieve the most                         effective time. At the same time, for a fixed antigen-antibody pair, the value is proportional                         to the initial reaction rate; the optimal time is approximately the same. Finally, there is a                         clear relationship between the detection time and the gray value relationship.
LIQUID CRYSTAL MOLECULES PERTURBATIONS MODEL
The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models that help simulate and                         predict the process and consequence of biological systems. We developed two models, the radial                         domino model and the blooming model to describe the potential perturbation mechanism and                         interaction modes between protein particles and liquid crystal molecules. The protein density                         threshold can be calculated by this model.
Purpose
An important part of our liquid crystal experiment is to determine an optimal antigen                         concentration, so we creatively proposed two models to calculate the β2-M density                         microscopically. The trouble is that we do not know the range of antigen molecules that can                         perturb liquid crystal molecules. Therefore, we consulted the relevant parameters, proposed two                         models, calculated the range of the single antigen molecule to perturb the liquid crystal, and                         finally determined the threshold of the antigen concentration, which was consistent with our                         experimental results.

Hypothesis
Fig.9 Two possible mechanisms for β2-M to disturb liquid crystal
The process of protein perturbation of liquid crystal molecules is particularly complicated, so                         we can only guess the disturbance mechanism on our own. Inspired by dominoes and the blossoming                         of flowers, we proposed that there might be two mechanisms of disruption. We called them RADIAL                         DOMINO MODEL and BLOOMING MODEL
Fig.10 RADIAL DOMINO MODEL
Simplify the β2-M and 5CB as ball and stick. The distance between each two sticks is equal. Due                         to the interference of the ball, the first stick next to the ball will be inclined at an angle.                         The first stick will affect the next stick"

– subtilisin E gene, optimized for E. coli codon usage The gene of this BioBrick can be used to express subtilisin E, which is an alkaline serine protease, which non-specifically digests proteins, in Escherichia coli. To use this part a suitable leader sequence has to be placed in front as the sequence of this BioBrick does not contain a start codon. Its sequence was originally obtained from a wild type Bacillus subtilis but was codon optimized for E. coli. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page and in the section of the related BioBrick K2020002 .
K2020001
– subtilisin E gene, optimized for E. coli codon usage, with leader sequence pelB This composite part consists of the leader sequence pelB ( BBa_J32015 ) and the subtilisin E gene ( K2020000 ) from our first BioBrick. It can be used to express subtilisin E in Escherichia coli and simultaneously secret the enzyme into the periplasm of the cell. Subtilisin E is an alkaline serine protease, which non-specifically digests proteins. To generate a functional coding sequence that can be expressed in E. coli the leader sequence pelB, which begins with a start codon, was placed in front of the subtilisin E gene. Caused to subtilisin E’s partly toxicity for E. coli, this BioBrick should be cloned into an expression system with an inducible promoter. This should hinder the organism in the expression of the protease during its growing period. With the iGEM promoter BBa_R0011 it was not possible to successfully express subtilisin E. Hence, we exchange the promoter against BBa_R"

Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.

Modelling of DVS efficiency on a lung tumour
Context
Non-small cell lung carcinoma, or NSCLC, is an aggressive cancer, with a relatively high speed growth. Treatments are often ineficient, because the tumor growth is faster than  the elimination by the drug.
Objective
We have decided to model our treatment efficacy for this kind of tumor. Therefore we have modelled the tumour progression, our treatment evolution and efficacy. The objective of the modelling is to verify if our treatment is able to eliminate the entire tumor.
Back to top
Model segmentation
First, we had to recreate DVS complete mechanism and the tumor evolution. Then, for each step of the treatment, we have identified all the parameters that intervene, their actions and their interactions, in order to determine the model equations.
To simplifly the equation we have devided the mechanism and we have modelled each step separately.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  W303 is auxotrophic for leu2, trp1, his2, ura3, and (possibly) ade.  He also gave us pRS303 (1-7-3), a yeast shuttle vector that complements the auxotrophy for the his2 gene.
Another key issue that he helped us resolve was with regard to Test #2, which would test competative binding of an activator and a repressor for the same binding site.  He indicated that the PGAL1 promoter that drives expression of our synthetic activators does not have a very tunable response.  Thus, he suggested that we switch this promoter with PMET25 and replace the promoter in front of each repressor with a constitutive promoter.  This actually is closer to what we would have in our final device, so it makes sense to simply incorporate this redesign of Test#2 into the cloning strategy for the final device.   For this problem of ours, he provided a set of constitutive promoters called 'Funk promoters', in reference to the researcher who tested them (I think).  The promoters provided to us are p413_PCYC (V1-60), p414_PADH (V1-55), p413_PTEF (V1-45), and p413_PGPD (V1-37).  The reference for these promoters is Mumberg et al.  Gene (1995) 156:119.

Biobricks contributed by previous iGEM teams
A few iGEM teams of previous years (e.g. Edinburgh 07, Edinburgh 08, Guelph 08) conducted research in the carotenoid system. We are fortunate to have access to some of their Biobricks in the registry:

The above enzymes all come from a Gram negative Enterobacteria, Pantoea ananatis (GenBank: D90087.2). It is noted that analogues of these enzymes are also found in other organisms (e.g. bacteria Rhodobacter spp. and the fungus Neurospora crassa).
During our preliminary research, we encountered a few issues:
Originally, the registry annotation for K152005 indicated that there was no ribosome binding site before gene CrtI (i.e. “…rbs+CrtB+CrtI+rbs+CrtY…”). After clarification with Team Guelph 08, we were told that it was an error in annotation. The registry"

We approximate the bacteria, the zinc fingers, and the DNA arm by a set of beads. The bacteria becomes one large sphere, the zinc finger one small sphere, and the DNA arm becomes a rod consisting of a cascade of beads.
Using these assumptions, the free energy can be calculated from geometrical and electrochemical considerations. In other words, knowing the positions, radii, and charge magnitudes on the beads, the binding free energy of the system is directly calculated as follows.

One possibility we must consider should this PCR attempt fail again is that the DNA we are using is not what we think it is.  Even if the identity is accurate, it could be impure.

Took 266 out of incubator after 18 hours.  Made two glycerol stocks of 266 and miniprepped.  Eluted in 70 uL EB.
Concentration:
Discovered contamination in some bottles of media that we had, including one bottle of YPD that was used to make the yeast cultures from last night.  Indeed, the negative control (plain YPD with no innoculated cells) demonstrated growth.  As such, we were forced to throw away our overnight cultures and postpone doing the transformations we had planned.  Will try to do the transformations tomorrow.  We also found contamination in the double drop out media used to grow activator + reporter parts, which has dropouts for Met, Leu, and Ura. There was also a need to make plates for use to grow the successfully transformed yeast.  In particular, we need about 12 trp-, ura- plates and 12 leu-, ura- plates.
We began with 1L, to which we added 27.2614 g SD dropout mix, 2.0006 g histidine, and 2.0028 g methionine.  At this point we then realized that we had been following an incorrect recipe for adding amino acids; we were adding far too much.  For example, instead of 2 g histidine per liter, we only need 20 mg per liter.  We thus decided to finish up the mixture for plates by putting in the correct amount of amino acids from stock solutions (leucine for the trp-, ura- plates and tryptophan for the leu-, ura- plates).
We also decided to make 250 mL of leu-, ura- dropout mix with the correct amount of amino acids.  We ended up leaving methionine out of this mixture as well.
For future reference, we have the following stock solutions:
Leucine: 20 mg/mL, add 5 mL per liter

Did a transformation of two Gibson AVPR2-TEVs-Gal4-VP16 attempt and five additional LR reactions. Golden Gate reaction on the AVPR2-TEVs-Gal4.VP16 construct (with additional ligation at the end) and hope for the best. Miniprep Golden Gate reactions and send off for sequencing. (Optimally, we might be able to have someone run the DNA to Genewiz?)  Also obtained CHO cells and thawed. Will let them expand. Miniprepped inoculations from 7/18. Nanodropped and digested them as well. Gels were run. Inoculated colonies from plates from Weiss lab. Poured 8 gels. Tomorrow, we plan on sequencing the five successful plasmids, LRing or re-inoculating those that failed, and miniprepping inoculations from today. Transformed Jenny's 6 LRs from yesterday. Reaction F (NCad-2A-eYFP) didn't seem like it was the full reaction volume (had trouble getting 1 uL even after tapping down) and Reaction A was bubbly/soapy while plating for some reason.

Key features of Circuit+
Search, simple as you can imagine Clearly shown searching result Mindmap Information page SBOL supported LGD Feedback and comment Sharing by uploading
Search, simple as you can imagine
As a registry, Circuit+ provide simple ways to find circuits in the database, search box, circuit list and mindmap. If you have used Google, then you can find no problem to use the search box to find something you want. And the keywords matching search function is powerful, which can be proved by its popularity. The search box in Circuit+ is not an ordinary search box. You can search by genetic circuit name, description and tags. You can also find search box in circuit list and circuit information page and start your search convenient.
Clearly shown searching result
When you have entered your words in the search box and press Enter, a well-designed result page appears. The results make a list in a certain order. The keywords you input in the search box are highlight to be outstand. In the left part of this page is a list of categories. The number besides some categories show the number of related circuit in the categories. You can click one of it to restrict the result in the category. In the top of the page, some filter and sort options can be found. They all can optimize your searching experience. If you use circuit list, the page is almost the same like this. You can firstly choose a category to exclude the unneeded result and then use search box to do some keywords matching searching.
Mindmap
Mindmap is a most interesting to do retrieving, and actually it’s more than that. By clicking bubbles one and another, you can go into a deeper level of the classification and eventually find some circuits. You can use this way to have an overlook of circuits we have here and get some idea about synthetic biology. And most importantly, it can work as a medium of brainstorm. In fact, the first version of mindmap was the result of our brainstorm when we were collecting previous iGEM projects. The classification in mind"
