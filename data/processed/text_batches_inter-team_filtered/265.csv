Central China iGEM Consortium
In the middle of August, our team attended CCiC(Central China iGEM Consortium) held by Peking University School of Life Sciences. The meeting focused on offering iGEMers a platform to display their project progress as the iGEM's rule and learn from other teams. This could be regarded as a bridge for communications among different iGEM teams to share their academic insights, and a great opportunity of team projects display and deepening the understanding of synthetic biology. On the first day of the event ,we listened by our heart to expert's reports, heard about other teams' projects which were stimulating and innovative and handed out about a hundred questionnaires during the conference. Also, we communicated with the professionals who had gathered at the conference.
On the second day of the event our project was presented by Bowen and Chenmao who could fully explain our project from all perspectives and give best presentation of the work that our team had been done. The presentation was followed by a few minutes' Q & A session. All of the questions were answered concisely and professionally by the team.
Coffee breaks, lunch and dinner time were used as networking opportunities. We made friends with the attendees and presented our project with more in-depth details to other teams. Undoubtedly, it is believed that attending this conference really bolstered our knowledge about synthetic biology in general. This was an amazing first experience giving our very first presentation.
Media
Biweekly Newsletter
It is universally acknowledged that iGEMers need a communication platform to introduce their programs, share innovative ideas, ask for help and reply to their counterparts. Though we have Wechat, Twitter and etc., indeed, these platforms cannot connect every team. Therefore, our team was involved to write two issues of Biweekly Newsletter, which can be regarded as a collection of information and introduction about most iGEM teams and an open and easy-to-access platform for exchanging ideas conveniently.
We introduced Tianjin Team and our project in the 5th issue about project update and displayed our modeling introduction in the 6th issue about special software issue. And it's believed that other teams can have a better access to know about us and share their innovative ideas with our team through this electric platform.

(4) Independent variables: geographic area, content, type of media
(5) Statistical model: logistic regression
5. Results:
Due to small number of iGEM wiki, our analysis will focus on newspapers and magazines.  Table 1 showed that the distribution of GTSB conent differs between newspaper and magazines.  Magazines have higher proportion of issues related to science, medicine, and technology than news papers (80.0% vs 57.1%).  Another difference between newspaper and magazines is about the geographic area in the report.  Magazines have high percentage of international issues than newspapers (82.0% vs. 41.8%)
In terms of sufficiency of science translation in GTSB, newspapers and magazines are quite similar in number of viewpoints in the reports.  Newspapers have slightly more perspectives than magaziens.  However, magazines include more attribution for the perpective and provide more reference than newspapers(Table 1b).
In terms of understandability (Table 1c), it is quite obvious that articles in magazines are more likely to be difficult for readers to comprehend than articles in newspapers.  Also, magazines have very higher percentage of including more than 3 technical terms in the articles than newspaper.
The logistic regression in Table 2 shows that the sufficiency of science translation media was signficantly related to the issues in terms of number of viewpoints.  Compared to articles related to science issues, economic articles are less likely to include over 1 viewpoint.  In provision of extended references, magazines are more likely to provide extended references.  Provision of extended references were also related to content of science issues.
Table 3 shows that articles in magazines were far more likely to be difficult and having terminology than those in newspapers.  Articles related to social issues were far less likely to be difficult or having more than 1 terminology than the articles related to science report.  Interestingly, articles related to social issues are less likely to belong to “positive attitude” although only few of them are of negative attitude.
6.Conclusion:
This is an exploratory study exmaining the science translation in GTSB in Taiwanese media.  We found that science reports are the majority in the GTSB media reports, followed by social issues and economics.  Most articles in Taiwanese media possess positive attitude toward GTSB, followed by neutral attitude.  Articles in magazines are quite more difficult to understand than newspapers.  Because magazines mainly reprot science reports on GTSB, we"

Therefore, it consists of the promoter BBa_R0010 , the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 , the leader sequence pelB BBa_J32015 , the newly created BioBrick K2020000 and the terminator BBa_B0010 like the expression system itself. The whole expression is based on the usage in E. coli, so the sequence of the subtilisin E gene from a wild type Bacillus subtilis was optimized for E. coli codon usage. The sequence was partly ordered from IDT ( BBa_K2020001 + BBa_B0010 ) and then cloned into BBa_J04500 , a protein expression backbone which already carries the LacI promoter BBa_R0010 and the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 . Afterwards, a mutation between the pro-peptide and the subtilisin E gene was introduced by performing site-directed mutagenesis. The codon TAT of tyrosine77 was substituted with TGG, which codes for tryptophan, so tyrosine was exchanged against tryptophan at the connection site of pro-peptide and subtilisin E gene. Caused by the mutation in the pro-peptide and not in the direct subtilisin E gene, the actual position of the modified tyrosine was counted from the beginning of the pro-peptide compared to common annotations counted from the N-terminus of the actual enzyme. We were not able to exactly detect the expression of the modified proteases via SDS gel, so we proceeded by executing a skim milk assay on agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotics. Therefore, we streaked out the cells containing the modified expression systems on these plates and incubated at 30°C for three days.

The empty backbone didn't cause a proteolytic activity. A clearance and therefore a proteolytic activity could be observed for the native protease (as demonstrated in the section of BioBrick K2020002 ) but also for the SDM 3 modified expression system. As SDM 3 had been executed to exchange tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site against tryptophan, a proteolytic activity could be assumed caused by the clearance observed.

Design
According to our previous study, interview and social investigation results, we planned to develop an efficient and affordable method that monitors the concentration of dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen and phosphorus. It would be used by publics, especially for farmers and aquarists. After collaborating a great number of related researches and reading a plenty of documents, we eventually discovered the VGB promoter, which has good sensitivity of oxygen. The VGB promoter happened to be one of the provided resources from the kit plates. Based on this discovery, our minds came up with a practical idea ——whether it could be possible for us to use the synthetic biological methods to construct an E. coli strain into a detector. With putting a huge amount effort on researching and instructed by professors, we got an answer: Yes! This will be possible!
Design
In order to avoid the unnecessary problems that we might meet, the final products will be three individual strains of E. coli, with three different circuit for oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus(figure1).
figure1.our design
The oxygen detector was designed to include the Pvgb promoter as a sensor and a GFP gene as a reporter. Different concentration of dissolved oxygen will be reflected in different amount of GFP in a single cell. For us, it will be different fluorescence intensity(figure2).
figure2. the oxygen detector
The nitrogen detector and phosphorus detector are basically the same as the oxygen one. The nitrogen detector uses the PyeaR promoter as a sensor and a BFP gene as a reporter, in the meantime, the phosphorus detector uses the external phosphate sensing promoter as a sensor and a RFP gene as a reporter(figure3,figure4).
figure3. the nitrogen detector
figure4. the phosphorus detector
Despite all the tedious constructing work, the latter two designs have the same pattern “Sensor-Reporter” as the former one. Not only does it help when new detectors are designed and engineered, it also turn the constructing work into a modularity one(figure4).

This segment would not amplify, contrary to gel electrophoresis results which suggested that the 1,930 base-pair construct was appropriately assembled. Something went wrong with the assembly since pVEG through B0015 would not amplify. A new route of synthesis was performed in an effort to correct this and achieve expression:

Slide i2 was measured (also blocked with PDMS flowcell). Binding of Strep to bBSA can properly be seen. Yet, intensity was expected other way around (becauses here: intensity of 50 ug/ml stamp > 200 ug/ml stamp > 500 ug/ml stamp). This may have 2 reasons: 1. Since the fluid (Strep) flows from left to right, all Strep molecules might accumulate at the most left stamp (50 ug/ml) and so constantly decrease from left to right. 2. 50 ug/ml stamp was the first stamp that was made on the activated slide; second stamp was done a little later (on a maybe less activated slide), which may lead to a decreased transfer of protein to the surface. This would maybe also be an explanation for the constant amount of GFP fluoresence (maybe higher concentration and less activated slide counterbalanced each other?!)

Given two vcsfmt files, find the difference between them and produce a file to be put under version control, which we call vcscmp.
Reproduce the original input file from a vcsfmt or vcscmp file.
Convert genomic file to version-controllable format (vcsfmt)
Run dwndiff as follows:
dwndiff <file> [-w]
This produces a specially-formatted file which preserves the information of the original genomic file: the input file can be completely restructured from the output. The important point about the specially-formatted file is that it applies a variety of optimizations to run more quickly under most normal version control systems. If the '-w' option is specified, then dwndiff writes out the output file to a file named the same as the original, but with "".vcsfmt"" appended to the end of the filename. Otherwise, it will write the output to stdout. If '-w' is given as an option, then multiple files can be given as input, and dwndiff will produce vcsfmt versions of all of them.
Take two vcsfmt files and produce vcscmp ""diff""
Run dwndiff as follows:
dwndiff <file1> <file2> -c [-w -p]
As before, this takes in files and produces an output, which can be written to file or stdout. If written to file, it will have the "".vcscmp"" suffix. The difference between this and the previous command is that dwndiff can only have two input files for this mode of operation, and the input files must already have been preformatted by dwndiff. The resulting output, whether sent to stdout or to the specified file, will be the difference between the two, which, when reviewed by a version control system such as git or svn, will appear extremely small.
Recover original file from vcsfmt or vcscmp file
Run dwndiff as follows:
dwndiff <file> -u
This faithfully reconstructs the original genomic file from the specially-formatted version dwndiff had previously reproduced. The file is produced in the same directory as the input file, with the "".vcsfmt"" or "".vcscmp"" suffix removed, as appropriate.
Using this in a Version Control System
The dwndiff utility still leaves a lot of work for the user to do. The user must scan in the file to track to produce a vcsfmt file, then track that using an external version control system (many suuch options are noted above). The user must then perform the same operation"

Skype with iGEM Lund - October 3, 2017 - We were excited to Skype with Lund’s iGEM Team. We specifically talked a lot about our experiences at last year’s iGEM and loved hearing about their creative and extensive human practices. Lund also had questions about how an iGEM team that does not turn over every year, as many do, functions and the benefits and detractions of doing that.
Missouri S&T Regional Meetup - August 12, 2017 - We enjoyed hosting a mini-regional meetup when Washington University in St. Louis’ iGEM Team traveled to our campus. Both of our teams had the chance to present our projects and discuss how our projects would be continuing as we approached Jamboree. We also chatted about their experience with Integrated Human Practices and how we may improve as a team in the future.

6. Follow-up Activities at the Korea Science Festival
Click here to see the Questionnaire
As follow-up activities, we have supported a few science clubs that are selected program roviders at the Korea Science Festival held from 27th of July to 3rd of August. We were not eligible for operating a booth at the event, because Elan Vital Korea is not a school science club but an interschool club comprising different school students.  We had conducted subsequent survey for 141 program providers. Our initial expectation was that they must have had interests and knowledge on the synthetic biology, as they are members of science clubs in schools. However, the result showed otherwise.
Concerns About Synthetic Biology
Comparing the result we obtained with similar survey results obtained in the US and EU (UK), we observed that the public attitude toward the synthetic biology shows very similar distribution.  The majority believes that the level of benefit and risk of the new field are approximately equal.  The result may suggest that they know about the synthetic biology, are aware of the potential risks it may have, but are not – yet – decided on whether it will benefit more, or harm more the humanity.  The result supports our conclusion that we have to pay more attention on the ethics, legal and philosophical aspect of the synthetic biology.
When asked what comes to their mind first about the danger of the synthetic biology and gene modification, many respondents did not articulate their answers, but substantial portion of people (about 20-30 percent) answered the danger of human as well as animal cloning.
Comparing the responses we got with the responses of US, it seems that the Korean people do nothave sufficient knowledge on how the synthetic biology is actually used.  It is possible such result is due to the fact we conducted our survey for mostly younger generations (aged between 10 and 25).

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Planning_-_-_TEXT.html,"iligo etiopathogenesis is supported by morphological and functional evidence that vitiligo is a disease of the entire epidermis with biochemical abnormalities within keratinocytes that influence the ability of melanocytes to counteract the reactive oxygen species (ROS); the morphological alterations of keratinocytes in the skin were believed to alter subsequently the production of the specific melanocyte growth factors and cytokines that coordinate melanocyte activity.17 The in- creased levels of hydrogen peroxide found in affected epidermis are supposed to lead to membrane damage.17 Moreover, oxidative stress may lead to hypopigmentation by me- chanisms that include a microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent downregulation of melanogenic enzymes; this is in good agreement with the deficiency of MITF-M described in vitiliginous skin.31 In addition, cultured keratinocytes and melano- cytes from depigmented vitiligo epidermis have been shown to have a reduced enzymatic antioxidant capacity,17,32,33 thus making the melanocytes abnormally susceptible to im- munologic cytotoxicity and cytotoxicity induced by ROS.27  A growing consensus supports the hypothesis that genetic factors and environmental triggers lead eventually to autoimmune melanocyte destruction.2,14 The altered environment of vitiligo skin, apparently rich in ROS17,34 and having an imbalanced cytokine network, may also contribute to additional melanocyte cytotoxicity and further enhance the pigment loss.“ - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo
“Furthermore, vitamin D and its chemically engineered analogs are supposed of being involved in the control of multiple intracellular pathways responsible for the melanin synthesis and melanocyte survival and in the suppression of the immune response. All these findings encouraged clinicians to further investigate the effects of treatment with vitamin D compounds in vitiligo patients, thus opening new perspectives in the therapy of depigmentation.” - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo, pp. 18-19

We also had the opportunity to present our project to people with a little to no experience in synthetic biology, which was very instructive for us to do. We demonstrated the basics of our project to the younger visitors of the Science Festival by making ‘lava lamps’ with them. These ‘lava lamps’ were made of oil, water and a fizzing tablet, showing phase separation. It was a really fun day, especially when seeing children enthusiastic about the 'lava lamps'.
KNCV Night of Chemistry
19-10-17
The KNCV is the Dutch professional association of chemists, life scientists and process technologists.During the Night of Chemistry we had the opportunity to listen to some inspiring talks about Chemistry, one of the speakers of the night being Ben Feringa. Ben Feringa is one of the Nobel Laureates in Chemistry who gave a very enthusiastic and interesting talk about the molecular world and what drives him in his research. Ionica Smeets, science journalist and a professor in science communication in Leiden, gave some recognizable and amusing examples about communicating your research to ‘normal’ people: how sometimes simple words like 'a model' might cause some confusion. It was a very fun and inspiring night and also very instructive to see how scientists tell their story.
Mini jamboree Eindhoven
03-11-17
In order to have a final practice at the presentation and poster session in advance of the Giant Jamboree in Boston, we organized a mini jamboree in Eindhoven for all Dutch iGEM teams. Teams present were Amsterdam, Groningen and Utrecht. We also invited previous iGEM teams from Eindhoven for some extra expertise. Zoë Robaey, Pieter van Boheemen and Dirk Stemerding were also present to act as judges and provide the teams with some last feedback.
Educational Outreach
Academic Year 2017-2018
For a course about beta didactic design for students enrolled in the study program to become a high school teacher, we provided a case about iGEM and synthetic biology. The aim of the course for the teachers-to-be is to develop material for lessons at high schools and they also test whether this material is suitable. Furthermore, it is also investigated whether these new materials for lessons can be embedded into the exam program. This way, knowledge about synthetic biology can be spread at high schools.

Overview
We regard mathematical modeling as priority of our software, FLAME. In order to achieve a balance between efficiency and accuracy in simulation, we grasp several core elements of genetic circuits, and stick to them throughout the process. When delving into different circuits, we categorize some of them into different logic groups based on their functions, and improve the equations for further use. Here are the features of our models and algorithms:
* For simplicity, we mainly consider the effects of promoters and RBSs on expression, and utilize ordinary differential equations (ODE) and Hill equations in our models.
* Most of the biochemical processes are made up of activation and/or repression, so we use two equations, each representing activation and repression respectively, as the fundamental of our models.
* Instead of sticking to only general principles, we realize the importance of building models for different circuits to improve the accuracy.
* We do not engage ourselves in finding values of all the parameters to exactly simulate a process; instead, some of parameters have little impact on simulation but grossly complicate data-processing, so we left them out. By utilizing only the parameters that is of greater importance, we improve the efficiency and avoid vain efforts.
* Leakage rate is considered to better reflect complex systems and experimental results[14].

Last day here in Boston before I head back to Berkeley.  I think the work done speaks for the summer. It has been productive and fun.
JHU Collaboration
This summer, Boston University had the opportunity to reach out and collaborate with Johns Hopkins University. The iGEM team from Johns Hopkins University was interested in building a few Clotho applications this summer; these tools, which would have added a number of capabilities such as ssh compatibility with Clotho databases as well as superior MIT registry queries. Through direct correspondence in email, as well as face to face meetings via teleconferencing tools, we were able to provide them support setting up their code base as well as development advice. JHU has begun using the new Clotho interface developed this summer at Boston University. The interaction with HUH was favorable for both teams in that we have both developed useful, nontrivial tools that can be used by the synthetic biology community. Increased development and proliferation of the Clotho platform will encourage further development in Clotho. We have hopes that Clotho, will increasingly become the platform of choice for biologists in need of software tools.
Berkeley Collaboration
Boston University reached out to UC Berkeley's iGEM team this summer for a mutually beneficial collaboration. UC Berkeley's team hopes to convey their wet lab projects to a diverse panel of judges and audience members at iGEM with an animation of molecular events. The animated video is meant to help the visualize the key elements of the UCB project, this is especially helpful for the computationally oriented persons in the audience, many of which do not have a strong understanding of biochemistry. Boston University's computational iGEM team offered advice on how UCB could clarify their presentation; wet lab team members from BU also chimed in as well. In return, the wet lab team at UCB rigorously tested the software produced by Boston university, offering comments on usability and reporting bugs. Mutually beneficial interaction between UCB and BU no doubt helped both of our teams achieve a higher degree of excellence before the iGEM Jamboree.

                                                                                                                                                                Since our research projects are interdisciplinary as well as socially-based,
                                                                                                                                                                 we consulted our ideas with professor in the field about the production of our experiment applying the other fields beyond the cultural artifacts protection.
                                                                                                                                                                We then communicate with Prof. Zhang, Zhejiang University, whose field is civil-engineering.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the genom maintained by DNA polymerase I.     The interesting idea behind this approach is the fact that large parts of plasmids carrying an origin of replication from the     ColE1-familiy are replicated by the polymerase I. ( Camps et al. 2003 ; Camps 2010 )     Because of this, the usage of the error-prone polymerase I should mutant mainly our Evobody sequence on a plasmid. Thereby off-target     mutations, which are a major obstacle of in vivo mutagenesis, should be minimized. ( Camps et al. 2003 )
Our other approach is based on creating a plasmid borne hypermutator system by modulating the E. coli DNA fidelity systems.     ( Badran und Liu 2015 ) We will express known mutator genes under tight regulation from a plasmid. By using a plasmid borne mutator     system, in contrast to the more classical approaches of incorporating the mutator genes directly inside the genom.     ( Agilent Technologies ; Greener et al. 1997 )      Thereby we want to circumvent the known problems with globally increased mutation rate, which are genetic instability or general unviability.
Over the course of our project we want to find out which mutagenesis system is most suitable to our directed evolution approach.     Therefore we will compare both possibilities in terms of mutagenesis rate, -spectrum, -controllability and -specifity. How will     we do this? Find out on our mutation mainpage.

Madrid-OLM,2018,Team:Madrid-OLM#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," inclement weather it had to be suspended, although we could enjoy a pleasant evening of board games and conversations with the rest of the teams. At night a meeting was also organized in a pub to end a day where we had met many new people.
The second (and last day) had two interesting activities. The first was the meetings with different experts from the university, which privately asked each team about controversial issues. To see if these issues had been taken into account and the possible solutions and consequences were debated.
To close the event, a poster presentation session was held, which was very enriching to know how to present our project in Boston..
One of the things that were achieved in this meet up was the agreement with the UPF-CRG-Barcelona group to organize an activity in their meet up. Activity that is explained in the following session (and that gave rise to a greater collaboration).
Barcelona
Spanish Meet Up (Barcelona)
This meet up took place between Saturday 18 and Monday 20 August in the city of Barcelona and was organized by one of the two teams of this same city, the UPF-CRG-Barcelona. In it, all the teams from Spain were called, which all but the Valencia team attended. To this meet up they were representing the whole team: Laura, Iván and Francisco. The meet up took place in the Biomedical Research Park of Barcelona (PRBB), center where the host team operates and where they started with a welcome activity. This activity consisted of a game where each one of the assistants of each team presented themselves, so that the subsequent environment was much more relaxed.
The next activity was the one organized by our team. In this activity we proposed to carry out a collaborative guide in which each group would give the main ideas on how they have solved the main problems that have arisen in iGEM. The structure we proposed was followed. We collected these ideas and wrote a complete guide. We explain this collaboration in a later section of the collaborations. After this, some playful activities were carried out on the beach, including volleyball games.
During the morning of the second day, a more detailed presentation of each team's project was made. There was 30 minutes to expose each project in detail. This activity was very useful because the rest of the teams, besides getting to know the details of each project well, could intervene to give advice on how to make the presentations. Each team took a series of points in which they could be reinforced in the face of the presentation of the Giant Jamboree.

Story #1
Prediction 2025: MTD based technology used to create teeth cleaning and teeth whitening treatments. The public gradually accepts the use of cosmetological biotechnology.
Prediction 2050: Use of cosmetolgcial treatment expands to modifying melanin to produce unnatural pigment. Public backlash causes new type of discrimination emerge against modified individuals. This in turn causes a schism within the modified community between bleach-skinned Bleakers and obsidian-skinned Inkers.
It’s 5 AM, April 15th 2047. It’s been 7 hours since the mock protests gave away to riots, and it’s not letting up. War of the fashions between the Inks and the Bleaks. A pale imitation of racial conflict of the previous century. And I find myself a Bleaker awake in a pile of Inked bodies. The streets look like chess board peppered in blood.
I remember how all of this began. A harmless shock statement to offend the common sensibilities. Starting with decades old viral treatment to sterilize and bleach the teeth as a basis, a group of grad students took it a step further by allowing it to modify genetic and epigenetic elements of the skin and making it open source. In the beginning, many variations of the treatment floated around such as chrome and glow-in-the-dark. Some were carcinogenic; others simply didn’t catch on.
Natural selection took course, and only the most popular variations remained: alabaster white or pitch black. White was popular with  wanted to have the image of a rebel without losing their clean-cut image. People who modified their skin wanted to look intimidating and offensive to the public. In retrospect, I think people liked the monochromatic simplicity.
I chose the color white because my girlfriend decided to be an Inker. Black and white go well together you see.
Naturally, the public was outraged. Accusations were made that we were"

Figure 1: kill-switch overview
We have been in contact with the Freiburg team since the beginning of the iGem  adventure. We quickly realized that our respective project were going in the same direction, as we were both focusing on Colitis ulcerosa and engineering bacteria to fight diseases in vivo. However unlike us Freiburg is focusing on finding a way to facilitates local activation of targetted drug-delivery, and uses spores of Bacillus subtilis.
After several Skype meetings we figured out that the best way to join our forces on the project was to share our experience in modeling. We designed and provided them a full deterministic characterization of the kill-switch essential to the circuit bio-safety. The kill-switch is design based on the MazE/F gene mechanism, and is activated under aTc induction.The MazEF system is natively found in E.Coli and Bacillus Subtilis. The system consists in two adjacent genes mazE and mazF located downstream the relA gene. MazE and MazF are co-transcribed under a Pmaz promoter.
MazF is a toxin while MazE is the anti-toxin. The MazEF complex also inhibits the Pmaz promoter. The idea  of the switch is to synthesize under certain conditions the anti-MazE protein which prevents translation of  the MazE protein. Thus it will prevent it from binding MazF. The concentration of MazF in the circuit will increase and lead to cell death.

Check out our amazing design!
Our building blocks!
As a proxy for the detection of L-DNA, we decided to build first a generic DNA sensor                          that could be used to distinguish between the total amount of DNA on the feces of normal and                          diseased patients.
We wanted the reporter to be easily measurable on a lab, but also something that                          could be detected by a patient without any equipment. Thus, our choice was to use a split                          version of mChery Red Fluorescent Protein; mCherry’s red fluorescence can be quantified with                          ease on a fluorometer, and it can also be seen by the naked eye, since its emission fall on the                          visible spectrum. Its split version (which we call hemiCherrys A and B) work on a bimolecular                          complementation system [1] – that is, each of the two parts must be attached to other                          domains that can bring themselves to be close to each other, in a way that the function of the                          reporter is restored and allows for the fluorescence to be emitted after excitation. The                          separated parts do not emit fluorescence nor are able to restore complementarity by                          themselves.
To bring hemiCherrysA and B close to each other on a DNA molecule, we needed them                          to be attached to DNA-Binding domains that would bind close to each other on the substrate                          molecule, and also on a spread-manner fashion throughout the spectrum of DNA fragments.                          To accomplish that, we designed a TALE Domain using modified parts from the Freiburg 2012                          collection [2] to bind to the GT (or CA) microsatellite – the most frequent non-single base                          repetitive DNA on the human genome [3]. Our designed TALE domain binds to a 12-base                          region containing six repetitions of the dinucleotide GT. Thus, on a longer DNA fragment                          spanning the microsatellite, two TALE domains can bind close to each other, each attached to a part of hemiCherry, restoring their functionality.
Of course, before this chimeric proteins can bind to the DNA on the feces, they must                          be secreted by the yeast or bacteria into"

Andrea has contacted a restoration chemist in the engineer department who is willing to help us to come up with a method to clean statues with our bacteria. Cristina knows a private who has a palace in Venice on the Gran canal, they are willing to give has small marble samples to test. The shipment will arrive this week. Giacomo went to a marble factory and found small pieces to make our own black crust. Daniele and Francesco have built with the help of Damiano, our super-tech friend in the physic department, the box apparatus to reconstruct the black crust and already have started the process. Jason contacted a company in Vicenza that sells supplies for restoration. They sell a gel that can be used to apply our bacteria. He will hopefully get a sample when he goes home next week. Finally, Andrea had an interesting meeting at the Cemetery… she met with a guy that makes gravestones. He is going to provide some sample of broken gravestones and will tell us more about the cleaning method for old gravestones. Things are proceeding!
SEPTEMBER
3th: We put together all our data and showed them as a complete story to our supervisors. We are starting this week to clean our stones samples. Tomorrow we will have the visit of a chemical engineer who works in restoration. We prepared a little interview for him.
10th: Update: we have some clean marbles! Our bacteria are working. This week we set more internal deadlines. Many events are quickly approaching.
Here is our calendar:
13th Visit to the Sculptor studio
14th Andrea goes to the engineer department to analyse our cleaned samples

The purified products were digested with the enzymes EcoRI  and PstI, using 2 μl of the product. These purified and restricted products were loaded on gel, see figure 2. It was then discovered that the genes were  barely visible on gel. The restricted genes were purified with the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit and the concentration was measured with the NanoDrop 1000. The clean, restricted products were too low in  concentration to be suitable for ligation.

4 August - 10 August
 
Because the PCR products of NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were lost during the purification and restriction in the week of 28 July - 3 August, the PCR was repeated for this genes, together with the genes that could not be amplified yet. This time a PCR was used that did not lower in  temperature, like the touchdown PCR, but that increased in temperature  with each step. This way it was hoped to get over the huge gap between the annealing temperature of the primer in the first cycle and the annealing temperature of the primer when the flap of the primer can also  anneal to the first PCR products. The temperature was set to increase from 40 °C to 60 °C in 20 cycles. Then, an additional 20 cycles were done at 65 °C. The PCR was performed under standard conditions as was done before, together with a series of PCR that contained GC buffer (supplied with the Phusion DNA polymerase by Thermo Scientific), and a series of PCR with GC buffer and 1.5% DMSO. This time, with the help of Lisa, the PCR was finally successful for all genes, see figure 3.

Overview
This year, we successfully construct synthetic microbial consortia MFC (microbial fuel cell) system with three species. Through the electricity generation platform we design, the final electrical output of the system reaches more than 520 mV and lasts over 80 h. What’s more, the synthetic microbial consortia MFC system can not only enhance the electrical output significantly but also broaden the spectrum of carbon sources. This is the very first time to introduce three different species into MFC system, namely E. coli, Shewanella and B. subtilis. We strongly believe our MFC system will have wide prospects in future applications.
Figure 1. The overall relationship of three kinds of bacteria in our co-culture system.
Microorganisms rarely live in isolated niches because natural microbial communities have unique advantages of stability, robustness and versatility due to nutrient adaptability, stress resistance, complicated interactions, etc. Considering that single-strain MFCs face many practical barriers such as narrow range of carbon sources, low efficiency of electricity generation, demanding requirements for environment and so on, we aim to construct new generation of MFC system by using synthetic consortia with elaborate division of labor.
In our system, there are two kinds of zymophyte bacteria and one electricigen. Co-culture strategy among zymophyte and electricigen develops a delicate commensalism relation on the basis of material, energy and information flow, which may remarkably benefit the whole system.
Material Flow
For the material flow, we construct an engineered E. coli strain to provide proper amount of carbon source, lactate, for Shewanella which has a poor ability of utilizing glucose. In this way, we broaden the spectrum of carbon sources of Shewanella to glucose and even xylose, cellose and cellulose in the future.
Energy & Information Flow
As for energy and information flow, we choose riboflavin as our entry point. It is because riboflavin is the major factor determining the extracellular electron transfer efficiency of electricigen. Firstly, we construct high-yield engineered E. coli strain producing riboflavins and the final yield reaches 90mg/L in tube. The strain works well and the electrical output reaches 350mV. Then, in order to enhance the functionality of MFC device"

Introductory Lab Session: 10th July 2009
Experiment Recap and Introduction
In the previous experiment, we had managed to prove that most of the cultures of E.coli which had passed negative selection did include plasmid DNA. The only E.coli cells not to contain any plasmid were the colony 9 cells but that could be down to several reasons; not all of them down to biology.
The next step is to show that these plasmids contain the BioBricks we intended to transform the bacteria with. This can be done by using restriction enzymes followed by DNA gel electrophoresis. Each standard BioBrick is flanked with restriction sites, which are the target of restriction enzymes. The aim is to cut the plasmid at these sites; one cut leading to an open, linear plasmid and two cuts leading to the production of the BioBrick fragment along with the plasmid backbone. The two enzymes to be used today will be EcoRI and PstI
Protocol
Goksel about to insert some restriction enzymes into the tubes containing plasmid DNA
Although there is a protocol in Dr. Aldridge's lab explaining how to do restriction digests, Prof. Wipat came up with an alternative one. The E.coli colonies selected for further processing included cultures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Because 6 were chosen to be further processed, 12 Eppendorf tubes were required. In the first set of six, there would be the plasmid DNA combined with EcoRI enzyme and in the second set of six tubes, there would be plasmid DNA combined with both EcoRI and P"

What is
Quantifly ?
(VOC)
VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Nowadays, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are commonly found pollutants that have been proven                         present in a wide variety of everyday life situations. Though they are dangerous and present                         almost everywhere, VOCs are not efficiently detected. Usual detection devices are very unprecise                         or requires a very long exposure time.
Bacteria
Biosensor
This is why we developed the Quantifly project : a combination of a bacterial biosensor,                             perfectly adapted to on-field measurements, and an innovative drone that will allow us to                             easily and rapidly quantify the amount of VOCs in the air. The biosensor relies on                             bioluminescence, a biochemical phenomenon that is commonly used in cell imaging. We are                             trying to develop a new application for bioluminescence that should allow us to create a                             biosensor of a new kind, entirely different from the existing devices.
If you’ve followed along and done the steps above, you’ve created a good                             starting place. You’re going to need to make sure your pages are optimized properly.

Drone
Concerning the drone, it is designed to safely contain our organisms and carry them on the                             field, thus acting as a mobile detection platform.

Carine Gimbert
Also known as Stoatix, it is my first participation in the INSA-Lyon team. In my previous studies, I worked on two projects about bioremediation and production of vanillin using biotechnology. So being part of the iGEM team is really important to continue learning how to manage bacteria and working in a student team. I am fond of dance, photography and art in general. I live in a town where the international short film festival takes place : Clermont-Ferrand and one of my favorite is “la révolution des crabes”

When you participate in iGEM once, you just want to take part in this great adventure again !
In my fourth year of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, I’m still enjoying microbiology, modifying bacteria and creating new plasmids! I’m this time on the advisor side... Helping the new team members searching for sponsors and guiding them for experiments in the lab.
In my free time, I like dancing, playing the piano and traveling !
Anne Haziza
I am a third-year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. I am taking part in the iGEM competition for the first time. This project is a good way for me to improve my organization skills, ingenuity and dynamism which will be very useful for the future. Outside of school, I enjoy cooking, playing handball and mainly traveling whenever possible! So I believe on the talent of her team to discover Amsterdam and of course Boston!

I am also known as Clumsix for often being … clumsy. Hell, I am the kind of guy who managed to cut my finger trying to open a bottle of beer and for the record, I was actually using a bottle-opener. My clumsiness is even contagious : Gaël and Yoann also cut their finger during the summer. Anyway, I am also a third-year bioengineering student who love music (especially hard rock !), good food (though I am skinny and absolutely don't know why) and traveling. I may be a bit of a nerd too as I am a videogames fanatic.

Overview
Gene doping is the administration of exogenous genetic material for performance enhancement. Detection of gene doping requires identifying target sequences and detection windows. Our targeted sequencing method includes our novel dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein and requires a minimal set of guide RNAs aligning with gene doping sequences. As there are 10104 possible codon variations in our proof of concept target, the EPO gene, it is not feasible to target all possible sequences in practice. We therefore implemented a search function to identify areas with minimal variation within the sequence, which reduced the testing set to twelve sgRNAs. Second, we modeled the process of infection and degradation of gene doping DNA in blood. From this model, we provided the laboratory with the time dependent concentration of the target DNA. Based on our wetlab sensitivity analyses, the model predicts that with microdosing, our detection method could effectively catch gene dopers.
1. Approach
We identified a threat in detecting gene doping that lays in the possibility of modifying the genetic sequence of a gene without changing the protein sequence produced. This allows gene dopers to creatively modify their DNA sequence in several possible combinations and complicates the design of detection methods. To combat this, the exon-exon junctions with the smallest possible variation need to be identified and sgRNA sequences generated to cover all possible combinations of one gene (figure 1).
Figure 1. Modified doping gene with introns removed. Exon-exon junctions are the target sites for the sgRNAs in our fusion protein.
Once the testing set of sgRNAs is generated for our fusion protein, we determined the time during which the detection of the gene doping DNA in an athlete’s blood sample is possible. This was accomplished by modelling gene doping administration. We considered the entire process of gene doping to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of gene doping and its effect on the athlete. With our chosen model gene being the human erythropoietin (EPO) gene based on the recommendation by Prof. Hidde Haisma from Groningen University, we included the EPO dependent production of red blood cells in our model (figure 2).

Conclusion
The huge energetic and environmental challenges every country will have to face in the following years call for institutional and organisational innovations capable of promoting the development of relevant technological innovations. The success of the open source movement in the software industry tends to support the idea that patents are not the sole way to support knowledge spreading and technological innovations in an economic sector. Building commons can be considered, to some extent, as a fruitful alternative to the patent inflation and its pernicious effects.
The iGEM community, as a group sharing knowledge on synthetic biology, can be regarded as a case of commons. But, as Elinor Ostrom's work highlights, it is the responsibility of every commons to define its own founding principles, namely a governance framework and an appropriate distribution of “bundles of rights” associated with different roles in the organization of the commons. Even if some milestones have been set, much remains to be done in this respect.
Consequently, we propose the iGEM community to develop a genuine reflexion on this important matter in order to form a strong “synthetic biology commons” whose technological and economic success could be compared to the open source movement.
The results of the UBC team’s survey, to the analysis of which we have collaborated, confirm that most of the iGEM community members oppose the patentability of the BioBricks designed in the frame of iGEM. Promoting the intellectual as well as economic value of iGEM outcomes, without resorting to the traditional intellectual property regime, should thus interest most actors in the iGEM commons.

We have achieved following experiment results as our PROOF OF CONCEPT.
(A) We have constructed a signal pathway (in principle) in which bacteria detects Nitric Oxide (NO) released in the inflammation sites in IBD patients, expresses therapeutic molecule - Epidermal Growth Factors (EGF) and releases them back to inflammation sites to relieve IBD symptoms. This is illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1.
Specifically, 1) we mimicked NO release at pathological concentration by SNP (see NO release ).
2) we successfully used NO (released by SNP) to induce expression of a demo protein (GFP), under control of a NO sensitive promoter (pNorV) (see NO sensing ). The demo protein can be easily replaced by the therapeutic molecule – EGF.
3) we successfully demonstrated that our bacterial expressed EGF could relieve the symptoms in IBD mice (see collaboration ). EGF suppressed the reduction of colon length and rescued weight loss phenotype.
(B) We have constructed a therapeutic biofilm system (in principle) for potential delivery of therapeutic molecules, in which we successfully fused a demo protein (EGF) to the biofilm protein CsgA in CsgA null bacteria (see therapeutic biofilm ). The demo protein can be easily replaced by other therapeutic molecules which can function remotely (such as enzymes) without detaching from the biofilm, and thereby helping patients in long term. This is illustrated in Figure 2.
Figure 2.
(C). We have constructed a “warship” to protect and confine our engineered bacteria, attempting to increase the surviving power of introduced bacteria against native microbiota and biosafety levels of using engineered bacteria, but still allow exchanging of nutrient and chemical through semi-permeable membranes (see warship ). This is illustrated in Figure 3.

From Figure 1 becomes apparent that the beehive samples cause a different mRFP response on both mite sensing systems. Initially, the mRFP amount is increases more rapidly in samples containing beehive fragments. This suggests that the constructs are indeed able to sense and report guanine and vitamin B12 in contaminated beehives.
BeeT Survival in Beehive Conditions
We simulated the sugar water conditions , BeeT would encounter when applied, in the lab to check for survival. This is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. The relationship between the maximum ATP available for survival for an E. coli in a sugar-water environment and the theoretical survival time, given a constant water efflux over this time and a starting volume of 2.8e-13 grams. The various coloured lines indicate water tolerance thresholds for the E. coli
Effectiveness of BeeT on Beecolonies
Additionally, we modeled the impact of BeeT on bee and mite dynamics under real world weather conditions. We show this in figure 3.
Figure 3. The honey bee population is shown in blue and the Varroa mite population in red. A: Colony rapidly declines when no BeeT is present. Starting population is 20 Varroa B: Colony barely survives Varroa mite infestation. Shows Varroa mite in red and worker bee population in blue. Starting population is 20 Varroa. C: Colony thrives regardless of Varroa mite infestation. Starting population is 20 Varroa mites. D: Colony thrives regardless of heavy Varroa mite infestation. Starting population is 10,000 Varroa mites.

Technion_Israel,2016,Team:Technion Israel#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"2: Substance for diffusion experiment.
Modeling was done under the assumption that the motility buffer acts as water, due to the fact that it is mostly water (~98%). Potassium permanganate is a salt with a known diffusion limit and acts as most of the materials we want to detect using our system (small molecules). Also, it has an intense pink color in low concentration which makes diffusion limit visible.
We ran the experiment 4 times, with a standard ruler to measure the distance of the diffusion limit.
Fig. 2: Diffusion of potassium permanganate in water in different times (enhanced picture).
As expected by the mathematical model, the diffusion limit starts moving relatively fast and its speed decreases rapidly. The difference in distance between the models and the experiment can be explained by:
-The actual diffusion limit is in too low concentration of potassium permanganate to be seen in the naked eye. If the visible concentration is about  1.5*10-5 [M] the experimental results line up with the model (graph 3).
-The ruler is a crude measuring tool. Its mistake is ± 0.5 [mm].
-Difficulties in loading uniformly the sample, especially in low volumes. Mistakes in loading the sample inside the bacterial fluid and not on, or sticking the drop of sample to one of the entry slot walls will cause uneven diffusion.
Graph 3: Comparison of diffusion model (c=0.00015[M]) to experiment.
Bacterial Concentration
The basic mathematical model for bacterial chemotaxis is the Keller-Segal equations (1) of chemotaxis:
Equation 1: Keller-Segal equation
where:
u[M] is the bacteria concentration.
v[M] is the chemo-repellent concentration.
k1[m2/s] is the bacteria diffusion coefficient.
k2[m2/M * s] is the bacteria chemotactic coefficient.
k3[M/s] is bacteria life and death coefficient.
x[m] is the distance in the channel.
t[s] is time.
The basic assumptions of the chemotaxis model are:
-k2 describes how sensitive is the bacteria to changes in chemo-repellent concentration.            In other words, as its negative value decreases the bacteria will react more violently to same repellent exposure.
-Because of the geometric properties of the channel, this is approximately a one dimensional problem.
-We ran our tests in a short time scale (t<30[min]) so we presume that the change in concentration            of bacteria due to life and death is negligible, k3=0.

We submit the inference that when RNA scaffold binds enzymes, clover version 2 draws two enzymes nearer than D0 thus has more ability to accelerate the enzymatic reaction.
2. Regulate and control by Theophylline
When the concentration of Theophylline is in the range from 0mM to 0.5mM, the concentration of Theophylline and the resulting fluorescence intensity are directly proportional.
Theophylline concentration beyond certain extent will be hazardous to cells and how it affects cells depends on strain type. The study by NYMU Taipei 2010 alerted adding more than 4mM of Theophylline would cause E. coli to die. In our experiments, we find that after adding more than 0.5mM, the Theophylline spectrum curve would be invalid. As a result, we pick up data with concentrations below 0.5mM to analyze as the E. coli cell would be unstable or the regulation of the Theophylline aptamer would not be accurate. See the original data .
Fig.17 7 tests of fluorescence/ OD change over theophylline concentration. There’s evident positive correlation in between.
 
Then we build several SAS models to analyze data with SAS software GLM procedure between 0-0.5mM Theophylline concentrations of treatments, choosing” clover version 2: different treatments versus blocks” test 5-7 to run a SAS model.
ANOVA result P-value shows that Theophylline concentrations have significant impact on fluorescence intensity of clover version 2 and almost no impact on D0. That is to say, our designed RNA scaffold clover version 2 can be regulated and controlled by Theophylline within 0-0.5mM not for random errors or common phenomenon in RNA scaffolds.

So as a policymaker sometimes you have lab-facilities but because they don’t provide the rapid results that you need, you may as well just buy the treatment.

Yes, we have a group of medical professionals with a diploma in clinical medicine. They are called clinical officers and they are trained and certified to diagnose trachoma according to the WHO clinical diagnosis which is based mainly on the trachoma follicles and trachoma inflammation. This happens as a result of chlamydial inflammation. So with some experience you can say: This is trachoma. But you should be aware that there are other bacteria, which cause these follicles. So the diagnosis of trachoma can be confused sometimes with other conjunctivitis. But we trained the clinician to say to their best ability if this is trachoma or not trachoma. The diagnosis can only be confirmed by laboratory tests.
Dominika:
Who conducts the trachoma mapping?
Prof. Kalua:
The mapping is done by our trachoma team, led by an epidemiologist, using this standardized WHO mapping protocol. This is a global mapping project, so each country is doing the same mapping. Each country has a master trainer (which happens to be me). We mobilize the ophthalmic clinical officers and we train them using the active trachoma cases, we certify them and then they go through the exercise of diagnosing trachoma.
Samira:
What do you think are the main problems of diagnosing and treating chlamydial infections in Malawi?
Prof. Kalua:
In terms of the trachoma program. From the field based view you sometimes get situations where you are not sure, whether this is trachoma or not trachoma. The WHO cut is very specific: If you are below 5% you don’t treat, if you are above 5% you do treat. And you know the treatment for trachoma is a mass treatment. Everyone else in the community gets [treated]. But sometimes you are in a situation where you are not sure"

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," This way, a lower rate of false positives is achieved. Also, Mantis contains a positive control whereby the functioning of the device is confirmed.
Current diagnostics: Nucleic acid tests
Alternatively, nucleic acid-based tests have been developed. Here, the DNA or RNA of the pathogen is detected. These tests are mostly used for viral diseases, and can be very sensitive and specific [5]. However, for example the Zika virus, these nucleic acid tests are only recommended to be used together with serological tests, as a negative result does not exclude being infected [8]. Moreover, these tests need specialized laboratories, expensive equipment, well-trained personnel, and are generally unavailable in healthcare facilities in third-world countries [5]. Thus, nucleic acid tests are not optimal for use in tropical areas and remote places. Mantis is point-of-care, meaning it can be used even in low resource areas.
Point-of-care diagnostic tests in iGEM
Other diagnostic tests for the detection of infectious diseases, like viruses or HAT, have been created by previous iGEM teams (for example Pasteur_Paris 2016 , Shenzhen_SFLS 2016 Cork_Ireland 2015 or Aberdeen_Scotland 2014 ). Contrary to these tests, Mantis is modular. This means it cannot just detect one disease, it can be easily adapted to any new emerging epidemic. This makes it very suitable to be used as an initial screening method in any epidemic or pandemic situation. As said before, Mantis is point-of-care as well. This means it can be used in the field by mobile teams, having little to no need for additional equipment and training. It does not need a laboratory environment to function as is the case with most nucleic acid tests. By detecting the pathogen directly instead of through antibody detection, we rule out more false positives. Finally, we took our project a step further than just the development of the test in the lab. We created a working 3D-printed device which includes GPS and data storage for easy disease monitoring and implemented this device in our roll-out plan.
Our approach
iGEM Wageningen 2017 set out to develop a diagnostic tool with the help of experts and health care organizations around the world. Not only does our device fit in the current diagnostic picture, but it excels in modularity. By altering components, the system can be adjusted to sense different targets or change the output of the device. Using this system, we aim to create an universal and standardized point-of-care diagnostic that helps anticipate and combat rising epidemics all around the world"

Gradient aTc induction results indicated that the most significant fold change in GFP signal is obtained from the addition of 25 ng/μl  and 10 ng/μl aTc.
AlkR/pAlkM Sensor Gradient Octane Induction
To determine the concentration of foctane which would facilitate a higher fold change in GFP signal, gradient octane induction is performed. Since the most appropriate aTc concentration is determined in gradient aTc induction, all samples are initially induced with 10 ng/μl aTc. On the other hand, the least concentrated octane which provides a sufficient fold change, might be detected by gradient octane induction.
Figure 9 : Y axis corresponds to RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit) 16 hours after octane addition and on the X axis sample groups are indicated. Voc: octane.
According to gradient octane induction results, it can be concluded that 0.01 mM octane has the most significant GFP level raise. However, the GFP signal amplification can be enhanced in further experiments."

A more “real” application of synthetic biology causing dangers to our security was the potential to synthesize biotoxins, or other poisons that could be derived from DNA sequences.
Other discussions revolved around the “open source” nature of iGEM. Although the registry was met with a positive response from experts, they were also able to see the concerns with making synthetic biology easier and more accessible. We discussed the dangers of making it easy for amateurs to be dealing with this technology. One of the greatest potentials for dangers that DRDC scientists said would arise from simplifying synthetic biology was the introduction of antibiotic resistance to harmful bacteria, and then being released in to the public.

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Placed these cultures inthe incubator around 8:45 pm.  Should take them out around 10:45 am tomorrow for making glycerol stocks.
6/16/08
No one took the cultures out of the incubator yesterday.  Glycerol stocks were not made.
A conversation with Caroline served to be quite informative.  It appears that it will be better to simply test the activity of the PGAL1 and PMET25 promoters while they are driving the production of their respective activators or repressors.  Promoter activity can change depending upon what the coding sequence is.  However, will still continue on with the other ligation process (between J63001 and J63002) for practice.  To this end, the next step is application of Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (CIAP) to the vector only, preventing ligation to itself.  After this, one does an ethanol precipitation before doing the ligation itself. The protocol that I have in my lab notebook for CIAP indicates adding 4uL of CIAP 10x Reaction Buffer and 1 uL of CIAP enzyme to 34 uL of the gel extraction.  Promega's protocol, however, requires diluting the CIAP to 0.01u/uL.  The CIAP we have in the fridge is at a concentration of 1u/uL.  They then recommend using up to 5uL of this diluted CIAP in 50uL of reaction, to yield a final concentration of 0.001u/uL.  Also in Promega's protocol is the use of 40 uL of DNA (up to 10 pmol of 5' ends, where 1μg of 1,000bp DNA = 1.52pmol DNA = 3.03pmol of ends) and 5 uL of 10x Reaction Buffer.
Concentration of J63001 gel extract: 8.4 ng/uL => 40 uL contains 336 ng  (note: don't need to do CIAP on this sample)
Concentration of J63002 gel extract: 13.7 ng/uL => 40 uL contains 548 ng
0.05u CIAP/10 pmol 5' ends => 0.005u CIAP per pmol 5' ends
So we only need about 0.025u CIAP for 40 uL of J63002.

Here is some thoughts from Meng about Model:
PART I: Stimulation of mRFP expression in Yeast system
MODEL：AHL enter the nucleus and accumulate-->
LUXR infusion protein expression--> AHL and LUXR+AD DOMAIN active downstream gene express (two parameters are needed here, one is LUXR combine PLUX，another is AD combine MINI CYC PROMOTER), mRFP express, turn light，use time as parameter draw the MODEL prediction line(start from adding AHL as t=0, beginning AHL concentration influence on reaction time t should be included)
The fluorescence of mRFP measured in experiment, (to test the goodness of fit to the model line)
QUESTIONS: Which of the entering and accumulation of AHL in nucleus and LUXR expression is the rate-limiting step? If LUXR is the one, then parameter determination of LUXR fusion protein expression using t as a variable detected by western is needed.
Control MODEL: (don’t know whether non AD DOMAIN LUXR recruiting POL II can be described by parameters?), if can, use this to replace the mRFP expression line fitted by parameters of AD DOMAIN.
PART II: considering the fluorescence proteins expression of TET system（to be continued....)

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR"

Wednesday: Catherine and I worked on the poster and the protocol for our preliminary user testing where our lab mates and the BU iGem team will act as our guinea pigs. It was an extremely long day. We got both of the things done.
Thursday: Catherine and I worked on editing the protocol. It's starting to look pretty good! Orit took a look at it for us and made some really helpful comments, and now we will take into account her changes for testing our lab mates tomorrow. Evan is helping us style the presentation to the lab colors of orange and blue. We are going to practice today and be ready for the presentation tomorrow afternoon.
Friday: Today, we finished up our presentation, and practiced a few times for our friends in the lab. Then we gave our presentations in front of our fellow students in the math and computer science departments. I believe our project was pretty well received and that people found it interesting, despite the fact that our work is very far away from the direction of focus of the projects of people in the audience.
Week 9: July 29 - August 2
Monday: Eugenie pilot studies day 1! Catherine and I had been working on the user study protocol last week and over the weekend. The both of us had already worked on the Tabula user studies so we know that sometimes protocols need to be edited because they are not working as smoothly as the study runner would like for various reasons (the instructions for the task are not clear or concise enough, there is not enough instruction). Also, sometimes it takes running the study a few times before it runs smoothly. The Eugenie team was really looking forward to getting some feedback for our project!
I heavily recruited from the lab I previously worked in at Wellesley, headed by my major advisor, Yui Suzuki, http://www.wellesley.edu/biology/faculty/suzukiy . My former lab mates were happy to oblige me in my request for guinea pig test users in exchange for some cupcakes and other snack foods. Only one person from that group had had experience in or knowledge of synthetic biology. Overall, the response was extremely positive, and using the system was very easy to pick up for all of our test users.
Orit requested that we also conduct pair user-studies the next day to take a look at the collaborative nature of the project in strangers.

NRPS subgroup (Julia, Philipp)
Possible cloning standards
Handing in biobricks only in pSB1C3 (RFC10 standard)
RFC25 (scar 6bp) standard because RFC10 scar (7 bp) causes frameshift
Parts to be cloned from Tyc
T domains either in front of E or in front of C --> cloning 1 per group
A and C as single domains and as couple in parallel
E domains and Thioesterase
Cutting sites
not in Tyc A/B/C SpeI, EcoRI, XbaI, NgoMIV
Tyc B NgOMIV in C domain, in T-C linker
Tyc C PStI in CIII domain, NotI in AIII domain
Indigoidine subgroup
Plasmid optimised for eucariotic cells
Impossible to clone it as RFC10
Use RFC21 instead -> compatible with Tyc?
first as whole part
Can be transformed wihtin in this week
primer design within this week
Cloning standard discussion
Gibson!!!
find good reason, concept for Gibson cloning
standard cloning techniques unfeasible
Further plan
Order all he plasmids and strains for permeable strain (BAP1  strain, red plasmid, FLP plasmid, template plasmid)
Indigoidine (Ralf) RFC 21 + check for other NRPS (Ilia) pathways
Modularity of Indigoidine RFC 21
in parallel check on Gibson assembly in Freiburg (Dominik)
get Backbones from Washington (Fanny)
Software subgroup (Konrad)
subgroups for data mining, data management, statistical analysis, front end
right now mainly building data management + concept for frontend and analysis
starting with NRPS software only makes sense as soon as NRPS gives any positive results
next one and a half weeks for being productive and then we decide for or against the project

Protocol: Basia Tops:
1. Progress report
a) Phage display:
- the first round will be ready tomorrow
- 1 plate (double mutated with AID) had only 1 colony - maybe too strong mutation? -> let's try to reduce the arabinose concentration
- 3 others had many positive clones
b) AID group
- news from sequencing: wtAID mutates stronger than the mod. AID
- other probes from different times will be sent for sequencing tomorrow
- split the cells earlier?
c) Virus
- Things from Sven are there - available (missing plasmids and primers)
- Transfection tomorrow
- Do we do magnetic beads? Do we stay with Virus and FACS only as a selection system?
d) Antibody
- we need the cells with stably transfected antibody - Kerstin will do that until Friday but the cells won't be happy!
- Basia and Chris will express YFP and CFP for magnetic beads selection system
e) Modeling
- Comparison between deterministic and stochastic model: stochastic model is better
- we should apply the law of mass action
2. Biobricks - who writes what?
- Write an email to iGEM headquarters: is genebank format available? what features should it have?
- everyone should write the texts but only 2 or three people should put it on the parts registry - see the BioBrick page and self-assign
3. Internetseite
4. Poster

SUSTC-Shenzhen-A,2012,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A#Activity_-_-_TEXT.html," get some useful recommendations from a matured iGEM team like HKUST and BGI.
  At 10:00 we came to classrooms of HKUST, after three team instructor’s brief introduction, team leader of HKUST firstly introduced how they built their team and what they have done up to now, and of course their project: to facilitate the treatment of rectal cancer by identifying the cell wall. After that two teams of SUSTC introduced our work: Biosearch----- the perfect combination of iPhone and partsRegistery(sustc-shenzhen-A), transcriptional terminator efficiency calculator. Then members of BGI team introduced how they built special biochemical plant using yeast mitochondrial. Both BGI and HKUST team proposed valuable suggestions: 1. Adding function to support semantic search. 2 reserving the help for novice. 3. Increasing search conditions. 4.experience related documentation is very important. 4.offering drawing or analysis functions(like thinker cell) after search.
  After the simple but no shortage of intense discussion and active interactive seminar, we came to HKUST Tea Restaurant. During the lunch we can know each other and exchange ideas. After lunch, We visited HKUST Seascape place, and posed for pictures.
  In the afternoon,we left HKUST, our team members began a half-day tour in HongKong , visiting and shopping, very enjoyable.

We extract plasmid from competent, the result of electrophoresis showed that no pkd46 in it, we decided to use new competent cell.
Through paper, we knew that the concentration of donor DNA must be high, and that’s one factor we will change in next few days.
We colon Chloramphenicol resistance Expression Cassettes from pkd3 and linked it with mRFP Expression Cassettes vie OEPCR,and recover the product of OEPCR;
Prepare the competent cell;
Transfer the new donor DNA into competent cell vie electroporation method , and spread it on the plate contain Chloramphenicol .
Next day, there was no colony on the plate, there must be something wrong, but had not found it. What we can do was improve the concentration of donor DNA and try this plane again, but there was still no positive result.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help"

Because pTet is leaky, all cells express GFP. It can be difficult to tell if the pTet has been induced and to  what extent, however, plates containing the corresponding concentrations of doxycycline as used in FACS  clearly shows an induction.
Duplicates of plates with doxycycline were made with 0 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, 500  ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL doxycycline. On the plates, TetR-pTet construct with LVA, TetR-pTet  construct with no LVA, pTet-GFP without TetR construct and wild-type were plated.

The experiment was done in duplicates but the second line of results was omitted from this wiki because the results showed the same, please see the parts registry page for all results: BBa_K1475005 and BBa_K1475006 .
The plating of TetR-GFP constructs on plates with doxycycline shows that GFP is expressed at different  levels at different concentrations of doxycycline. Expression increases with an increase in doxycycline  concentrations. The plates also show that GFP, to some extent, is expressed without doxycycline. This  indicates that the Tet promoter is leaky and is not fully inhibited by TetR as it was also seen from"
Newcastle,2010,Team:Newcastle#research_-_-_TEXT.html," yet, but it is unlikely it has as good qualities.
Fibre-reinforced concrete. Addition of steel fibres (usually between 1% to 2% by volume) can appreciably improve their characteristics. Strength is not significantly improved, but significantly tougher and have greater resistance to cracking. The fibres used are usually from about ¼ inch up to about 3 inches with diameters of 0.01 inch up to 0.03 inches. While a reinforcing bar provides reinforcing only in the direction of the bar, randomly distributed fibres provide additional strength in all directions.
Recommendation at the moment: calcium carbonate with spider silk. Also, if we can get silk working it would give us some novelty vs. the other concrete projects we've found.
However: which silks have been sequenced? Is silk alkali-resistant?

How porous is concrete?
How fast will concrete soak up liquid?
Will a surfactant speed up this process?
How to inspect for micro cracks:
fluorescence
ultra sound
Surface tension
If surface tension is a problem a surfactant could be produced by the bacteria or mixed into the spray. See, for example, Which surfactants reduce surface tension faster? A scaling argument for diffusion-controlled adsorption, Ferri and StebeU.
Mixing bacteria into concrete
In a study done by Delft University of Technology (Jonkers et al., Application of bacteria as self-healing agent for the development of sustainable concrete), alkali-resistant spores were directly added to the concrete mixture prior to casting and remained viable for a period up to 4 months.
Incorporation of a high number of bacterial spores resulted in a decrease in compressive strength of less than 10% for 3, 7 and 28 days cured specimens. The incorporation of calcium lactate did not substantially affect strength (3 and 7 days cured) or even resulted in a slight increase (28 days cured) in compressive strength values.
Possible solutions to the loss of viability of the bacterial spores after 4 months are suggested in the paper.

Not only were we able to meet up with most of the UK iGEM teams but we also got a chance to present our project for the first time. This meant that we could start to prepare ourselves for the finals at Boston by receiving feedback on our presentation/ project from other iGEM teams at the meet up.
We also got to see what the other teams were doing such that we could organise a possible relevant collaboration. This meet up was very exciting and fun! Once our presentation was over, we asked the University of Westminster iGEM team to give us some feedback on our project. They mentioned that we should include some facts in our presentation to make the audience realise that each of our projects are important in society and the problem that they solve is an important one. Their feedback allowed us to improve the way we communicate our project to different audiences, especially those that do not have a strong synthetic biology background.
The feedback we received has really helped us rethink how we can present our project to the world in a better and clearer way. We now have a clear understanding that not everyone has the knowledge that we do about our project and the science behind it. Therefore, it is essential that we receive feedback from people who were listening to our presentation and act upon it by making our presentation clearer and easier to follow and understand. Through our iGEM journey we have found out that its essential that we focus on clear communication of our project.

International survey
To kick-start our iGEM journey, the team decided that we wanted to distribute an online survey about synthetic biology and ageing. We wanted to find out what people think about synthetic biology not just in the UK but globally. It would not have been possible without the help of the iGEM teams that helped distribute the survey on twitter and took part in the survey! The teams that collaborated with us were:
Imperial team
XMU-China
Edinburgh team
NRP-UEA iGEM team (Biowire)

Tuesday July 24th
On the protein engineering part we discussed with our professor the issues we had with the files. He gave us a helpful layout of the steps needed to convert files to the correct format as well as generate certain needed files. This took the rest of the day but we were able to load both ligands bound to LC Cutinase into Foldit successfully. Redigested B0034.
Wednesday July 25th
Ethylene glycol was ordered today. We did some more digest, double digest, and ligation. For the protein engineering part we now used Foldit to come up with our own mutations listed in the protein engineering page. We also further tested the previously made mutations in Foldit to helped substantiate our confidence in them further.
Thursday July 26th
We made forward and reverse primers so that the reductase could work in aerobic conditions. We performed ligations of K20600+B0034 (1), K20600+B0034 (3), reducates+psBIA3, vector controls (B0034 [1] and [3] and pSBIA3), and insert control K206000. For the protein part we had our mentors look over our generated mutations and decided upon seven different individual mutations.
Friday July 27th
Today was the day scheduled for the iGEM meetup! After doing some stuff in the lab (find out what everyone did), our team left around 1 P.M. for Genentech Hall at the UC San Francisco campus. There we interacted with teams from UC Berkeley, UCSF, and Stanford-Brown and presented our respective projects. The advice and critiques were helpful to us as it gave us a different viewpoint of how we can improve our project. We also socialized outside following the presentations, and it was an interesting experience for our team as a whole. Today we finalized the generated protein mutations and used a website called PrimeX to generate the SDM primers for all ten mutations.

I hop and hope too much as there is an perpetual voice echoing a big'ol optimistic 'Yes' in my heart. Synthetic biology, to me, is an amalgam of art and science: it has colors, patterns, and beauty that intrigue me.
I am magnetized towards creative and intellectual people. I am not genius — rather a genuine person who gets all the creative ideas, either artistic or scientific, from my own real dreams. I do archery, painting and photography, and like to go on long drives. I fear maths and therefore, love doing it. My thirst for learning new things and skills is never ending.

Human Practices
Overview
Have you heard about the environmental debate surrounding oil sands? In Alberta, this is a heated debate involving many groups and many perspectives.  Tailings ponds in particular frequent our media on a regular basis, often attracting much negative publicity within Alberta and also worldwide for their effect on surrounding ecosystems.  This is a controversial topic, where environmental groups and other activists who want to see change are pitted against industry leaders and political figures who value the economic importance of the oil sands.
Our project has a lofty goal: aiming to convert some of the toxins present in these tailings ponds into useable hydrocarbons.  Obviously, this would be a desirable outcome for many interested parties.  Before undertaking this however, we need to make sure of a few things.  We need to know that we are tackling a useful problem and that synthetic biology is in fact a tangible and realistic strategy to use.  We also needed to ensure that"
HKU-HKBU,2009,Team:HKU-HKBU#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," biology and physics also opened my eyes. I also had the honor to give a 20-minute academic repeort, titled Biological Network Analysis: on oscillation and synchronization, on the International Conference on Complexity and Disciplinary Sciences, which is an encouragement and also a good start for me. In this iGEM project, we worked as a team to realize our dreams to engineer something we always long for with the help of bacteria. I am glad to be a part of the team where I gained not only the knowledge and the valuable wet lab experience, but also the precious friendship. I believe this iGEM project will be a great treasure through out my life!
Yan-Lin LI
hailing from Hong Kong, is a second-year undergraduate reading medicine and surgery. He joined the iGEM team primarily because he sees synthetic biology as a powerful tool for inventing novel therapeutic strategies.
He has thus far taken up three roles in the competition: firstly as fund-raising manager, then as group leader of the Che-Z knockout (2443ompT) team, and now as leader of the Human Practices Advance team. Moreover, as one of the only two clinicians around (alas!), he is also responsible for imagining – and developing – the potential clinical applications of the Bacto-Motor.
Outside medicine, his other academic interests include philosophy, politics and economics and he has represented both Hong Kong and HKU at international debating competitions, advancing to the Octo-Finals of the Worlds Schools Washington DC in 2008. He is also editor-in-chief of Caduceus, the official journal of the Undergraduate Medical Society. While not preoccupied by other tasks, he enjoys classical music, jogging, table tennis and banter – where everybody gets a good laugh :)
SHENG Zi Wei Amy
I am senior biology student of Hong Kong Baptist University. Mainly working on wet lab, I, together with teammates, take responsibility of measuring the swimming speed and categorizing the trait of polar expression after bacteria being modified. When James, one of our members, introduced me to this group, I had zero knowledge of what synthetic biology means or what we suppose to do. However, had gone through papers and handled wet lab work, I have started to understand the significance of this subject and its bright future and moreover exhibit great interest to it. I attained from this experience not only practical laboratory skills and knowledge of synthetic biology but also friendship and teamwork spirit. Other interests of mine include traveling, reading, growing vegetables and eating them.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," concept has been generated in E.coli, since it is a well-characterized bacteria suitable for engineering. It became clear to us that the next step would be to transfer this genetic construct to a strain more suitable for a lung probiotic.
In order to achieve this goal we considered two main approaches. On one hand to extrapolate our system from E.coli to a new bacteria we proposed the use of shuttle vectors, plasmids compatible with two different species which allow us to move cellular machinery from one bacterial chassis to another.  Our basic selection criteria was therefore based on two premises: the selected bacteria should have a shuttle vector compatible with E.coli and it should be one of the species that are part of the lung microbiota.
After reviewing the available shuttle vectors on the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts we came down to two strong candidates: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
Although both organisms are well defined within the lung microbiota and have available shuttle vectors, the higher compatibility of P. aeruginosa for genetic manipulation would make it a better choice. Nonetheless there is one major drawback for the use of either of these organisms: its pathogenicity. Our initial strategy to cope with this limitation would be to begin with a lung-adapted isolate of P. aeruginosa that doesn’t produce virulence factors.
Another option within this approach could be the use of the part BBa_J153000. This shuttle vector was originally designed to work on cianobacteria that holds the potential to work with a broad range of gram negative . This would allow us to attempt to use non-pathogenic gram negative strains from predominant genus such as Fusobacteria or Veillonella.20
On the other hand taking into account the constant advancements in genetic engineering we could consider another approach with a lesser focus on shuttle availability. A great example of this would be the use of S.carnosus, a non-pathogenic strain for which a shuttle vector is currently under development and has successfully expressed hyaluronate lyase from E.coli.21
Our hypothesis is that our lung probiotic will reside naturally in the lungs of the patients (bronchi, bronchioles); on the mucus layer. As the osmotic pressure of the mucus is higher in the previously mentioned diseases we took advantage of this, by introducing an osmotic promoter in our bacteria and place the gene of interest, in our case, an enzyme called sialidase, under its regulation. Thus, when an abnormal osmotic pressure is detected by the bacteria, the gene expression of"

Missouri_Miners,2012,Team:Missouri Miners#Community_-_-_TEXT.html," and why being a part of our iGEM team is such a great experience, from late nights in the lab to having fun and learning at the Jamboree.
PRO Days
PRO is a one-day preview, registration, and orientation program designed for future first-year students admitted to Missouri S&T. One of the activities for students and parents is to attend an organization fair to familiarize the students with extracurricular opportunities on campus. We created a poster explaining the different aspects of the iGEM organization, and our team in particular. We also created and handed out recruitment brochures explaining in detail why it is so awesome to be a part of iGEM. We attended every spring PRO day and talked to students and parents about why we think synthetic biology is so important and how synthetic biology research can be applied across many disciplines. This not only served as a great recruitment tool for our team, but also helped spread the word about this exciting research.
Recruitment Meeting
During our first meeting of the school year, we had a Recruitment Meeting during which we informed interested students about what iGEM is all about and what our iGEM team does, including current research and other organizational activities. The recruitment meeting was advertised to new students through fliers and through email to students who signed up for more information at PRO days and other organization fairs. Attendance exceeded expectations, and many new students that attended became regularly attending members at general meetings.
Organization Fairs
Besides PRO Days, our iGEM team participates in a couple of different organization fairs on campus. At the beginning of the fall semester, our team had a booth with other S&T design teams at Miner-Rama, an involvement fair where student and community organizations meet with students on campus. This organization fair is especially useful to new freshman on campus looking to get involved in extracurricular activates.
Phi Eta Sigma, a national honor society for college freshman, also held a recruitment fair on March 1. We attended with our recruitment brochures, a poster explaining different aspects of iGEM and our team, and told participants about our upcoming Exploring Synthetic Biology event.
The student design teams on campus also participate in open houses for the university, and as a new member of the student design center, our team began participating in these open houses this year. Similar to a PRO Day or other organization fair, we set up a display, talked to prospective students about iGEM and synthetic biology, and handed out recruitment brochures.
These organization fairs were primarily used as a recruitment tool but also helped to spread the word about our team and"

Transformation of 2 Biobricks into E. coli XL1-Blue
Investigator: Jeffery Truong
Aim of the experiment: Transformation of Biobricks into E. coli for plasmid propagation for PCR with new RFC pre- and suffix primer in order to do protein fusions.
2 Biobricks from the distribution kit were used: First, LexA (BBa_K105005, Plate 3 Well 9E) in the pSB1A2 plasmid with ampicillin resistance and second, the heme oxygenase (BBa_I15008, Plate 2 Well 13J) in the pSB2K3 plasmid with kanamycin resistance.
10 µL of autoclaved H2O were added to each well on the distribution kit. The well immediately turned red which means that one does it right.
The now resuspended DNA liquids were transferred into a new ERG on ice.
CaCL2 competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells from the stock were gently defrezed on ice.
For each Biobrick 100 µL cells were used and pooled together with 2 µL of plasmid DNA in a ERG on ice.
Incubation on ice for 30 min.
5 min heat shock at 37 °C.
Each ERG now is transferred in a new ERG prefilled with 1 mL of LB-medium and incubated in a cell-culture shaker at 37 °C for 45 min.
100 µL of these cell suspension were plated on antibiotic selection plates (Ampicillin for LexA and Kanamycin for heme oxygenase).
The rest of the cell suspension is centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 60 s and the supernatant is discarded.
The pellet is resuspended with 100 µL for each ERG and is plated on another antibiotic selection plate
These 4 plates were put at 37 °C overnight

IDEA & DESIGN
Host cell selection
After literature research, we found that yeast was widely used in aging research for the                         following reasons:
● It has the process of apoptosis, which can accumulate ROS.
Like mammalian cells, yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) undergoing apoptosis                             show                             characteristic markers such as DNA cleavage, apoptosis-typical chromatin condensation,                             externalization of phosphatidylserine, ROS accumulation, and Cytochrome C release                             from                             mitochondria.[1][2][3]
● As unicellular organism and an excellent model of genetics, yeast is useful for oxidation                             research.[4]
● It has a short growth cycle and relatively simple culture conditions. The protocols of                             yeast are mature, too.
Thus, S. cerevisiae constitutes an interesting model for studies of the oxidation process,                         which makes possible experimentation not easily available in higher eukaryotes.
Therefore, we choose it as our host cell. [5]
Regulator
ROS accumulation
As mentioned before, we need to keep yeast under the stress of oxidation.                                 Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), known as free radicals, play a key role in the aging and disease by creating vascular oxidative stress. Particularly, ROS account for more than 95% of the total free radicals in the human body. In hence we simulated cell oxidation                         state through accumulate ROS to finish the test work. As we mentioned in Background part , ROS are mainly divided into                         four categories: hydrogen                         peroxide(H2O2), superoxide anion(O2-), hydroxyl                         radicals(OH-), and single-line oxygen(1[O2]).
Fig. 1 Here shows the mutual conversion relationship between ROS.
All of them are eventually transformed into hydrogen peroxide, in that case we simplify our                         work to accumulate hydrogen peroxide.

This will create the plates (B1) and media (B2) for the repressor tests because it makes TRP and URA dropouts.  Note the decision to include methionine within the plates but not within the media.  The rationale is that the plates will be used simply to allow for successfully transformed yeast to grow, while the media will be used to test different concentrations of methionine as needed.

The next few pages will guide you through the results of the characterization of our submitted parts. On this page, you will find short descriptions of our results, leading you to the final result. We hope you will dig deeper into the results of our systems. After the need to prioritize subprojects, the aim of our project was to get E. coli to express a self-designed nutritional protein, controlled by an inducible promoter. Furthermore it will express limonene synthase for the synthesis of limonene, the main part of lemon flavor.
Synthesis of self-designed protein OneProt
Figure 1: Western blot showing that the expression of OneProt can be detected.
Figure 2: Growth curve illustrating the growth of E. coli K12 MG1655 expressing OneProt using a wild-type as control. OneProt is a self-designed protein containing the correct ratio of essential amino acids and the correct ratio between the essential and non-essential amino acids. Because the protein is self-designed, we wanted to detect if the protein was expressed in E. coli K12 MG1655 and if it stresses the cells and affects their growth. In order to test if the protein is expressed, we made a Western blot, taking advance of the FLAG-tag on OneProt. The Western blot"

Victoria_Australia,2009,Team:Victoria Australia#Project#Materials and Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,", 9.2ml MQ water, 0.18ml EDTA at 0.5M and 0.018g bromphenol blue; made up to a volume of 15ml) and agarose gel (0.5g DNA grade agarose, 50µL TAE buffer, 2µL cybersafe to 20µL MQ water and 5µL of agarose gel).
The agarose was poured into the plate and cooled. In preparing the samples for the loading gel, 10µL of the YFP samples, 4µL of 6X DNA Loading dye and 10µL of distilled water were added to eppendorf tubes. 12µL of the samples were loaded onto the gel which was placed into the tank filled with TAE buffer. Electrophoresis was run at 120V for 30 min.
Electrophoresis run of the YFP plasmid
Mutagenesis of YFP
Mutant Strand Synthesis Reaction
The mutagenesis of YFP was completed using polymerase chain reaction. The control reaction was prepared as indicated below:
The YFP plasmid was diluted by a 1:17 dilution factor to obtain a concentration of 2.13 µL.
Lastly, 1µL of DNA polymerase was added. The reaction was done using 18 cycles with the following cycling parameters:
Primer 657 was diluted to a concentration of 24.1ng/µL using a 1:5 dilution and primer 656 was diluted to 27.1ng/µL using a 1:9 dilution. These dilutions were done to bring the concentrations of the plasmids to 125ng.
Following the dilutions the following was carried out:
5µL of 10X reaction buffer, 2.13µL YFP plasmid, 5.18µL 657 primer, 4.61µL 656 primer, 1µL of dNTP mix, 3µL of quick solution and 29.08µL of MQ water were added to a eppendorf tube making a total volume of 50µL.
