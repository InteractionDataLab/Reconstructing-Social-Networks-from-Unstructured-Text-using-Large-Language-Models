Then, we do BioBrick Assembly with the two plasmids constructed in order to insert PhaC gene into Pct plasmid and construct the operon; we do transformation in E. coli and mini-prep. Finally, we clone the operon into pSEVA224 and repeat transformation and mini-prep steps.
Parallely, we clone LDH gBlock into pSEVA2311 by BioBrick assembly, we transform E. coli and we do mini-prep.
We transform P. putida with our pSEVA2311 and pSEVA224, containing LDH and the PhaC-Pct operon respectively. We grow the transformed colonies and we induce gene expression (by IPTG and Cyclohexanone). We expect in this step to have PLA.
We finally extract the PLA vesicles from inside bacteria cells and we do PLA characterization experiments.
Tasks and associated protocols
Once in the bench, we had to face the complexity and stochasticity of biology and we could not follow straight the steps presented. Thus, we splitted the potential tasks and tried to work on them parallely. Figure 2 shows the schema of the general tasks.

Week 9: June 30th - July 4th
We began this week talking to Kirsten Jacobsen from the Public Health Agency of Canada.  Kirsten was a Policy and Practices judge from last years iGEM competition and reached out to our team to become involved in the project and get our team to present via video conference to a committee from the public health agency of Canada regarding our project and the safety measures that we take when working on these projects.   We are additionally looking into Biosafety policy of Canada and plan on using Kirsten as a resource. To learn more about the Biosafety laws in developing countries we also started looking at potential organizations that we can contact for more information.
Week 10: July 7th - July 11th
This week we also started contacting some organizations working with health care in developing countries. We contacted the Health Policy Project, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND). The Health Policy Project got back to us saying they are happy to answer our questions. So this week we started preparing a list of questions that we can ask the organizations that we contact.
Week 11: July 14th - July 18th
The list of questions for the organizations was discussed with all of the members of the Policies and Practices sub-team and sent to Health Policy Project. The questions we asked are: What are the regulatory requirements to get a diagnostic device to market in Ethiopia? What safety tests must a diagnostic device pass in order to be considered approved in Ethiopia? What policies are in place in developing countries such as Ethiopia regarding synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms? Do you think there is a need for a multi-diagnostic test that provides"

Today was that most magnificent of days – Master Plan creation day. With seven weeks to go we decided to formally set out what remains to be done in each aspect of the project, and a rough outline of what will happen when.
The meeting with Fraizer went well – he seems to have lots of good (and usable) ideas, and we’re hoping to meet with him again next week, hopefully at his studio.
Friday 11th
A very important day today, as we had the big meeting with the supervisors to assess how we were getting along with the gold criteria. It also served as the halfway point meeting to see how far along we are in general. It seemed to be quite productive. The bronze criteria are more or less in the bag, the silver criteria look equally sorted providing we can get the human practices stuff off the ground, and in terms of gold – we just need one of three done. We’ve sort of made progress on all three, though we decided we would make a much bigger effort to reach out to other teams for collaboration purposes.

Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," silico using the COBRA toolbox. In order to best characterize the growth phenotype (denoted by setting the biomass function as the objective in FBA) associated with uptake of the carbon source, separate simulations were operated per single source. This was carried out by setting the uptake of the carbon source of interest to -20 mmol/gDW-h (note the negative coefficient represents an influx of material into the system) while holding associated uptake rates of all other carbon sources at zero. The predicted specific growth rates were highest when grown on glucose or fructose. Based on the model, the PHB biosynthesis rates were proportional to the specific growth rates; thus, only the former is shown below.
The main proposed sustainable source of carbon is pot ale, by-products obtained locally from distilleries. The three main components that pot ale comprises are, from highest to lowest in abundance, acetic acid, lactic acid and propionic acid (Graham et al., 2012). Each component was tested independently (as their conjugate bases) at the aforementioned -20 mmol/gDW-h uptake rate; the results from the FBA showed that at equimolar amounts, propionate yielded the relative highest growth rate followed subsequently by lactate and acetate.
The results of pot ale utilization were initially dubious, which showed that the overall growth rate would be higher than with glucose. We deduced that the apparent outlier was due to the fact that pot ale was represented in the simulation by setting the uptake rates of each individual component (lactate, acetate and propionate) to -20 mmol/gDW-h. We then sought to normalize and weight the relative abundance of each compound in the pot ale. Using data on the relative composition of the by-product, the relative abundance of acetic acid, lactic acid and propionic acid were used as “weights” to compute the relative uptakes of the individual components, normalizing for the amount of material taken into the system per unit of pot ale.
In silico predictions of PHB production rate with various substrates
To affirm our predictions, we compiled experimental data on the growth of our strain in two conditions: a 3% glucose + M9 media vs. a 1% glucose + M9 media + pot ale. The pot ale was provided kindly by the local distillery in Edinburgh, UK.
Unfortunately, the time points along the growth curve due to the fact that the experiments were done several weeks apart and that our schedule did not permit as consistent collection of data. Thus, we may not be able to observe the various phases of microbial growth from the data"

The plates were then transferred to a shaking incubator (800 rpm), usually for 55 minutes. In cases where plates where run overnight they were left in the TECAM machine and the shaking function was used.
Each plate had a different arrangement of cell cultures. The layout of the plate and location of the cultures used in each experiment is listed below.
Experiment One
This test was carried out on Plate 1. The only recorded use of iLOV within iGEM is by the Glasgow 2011 Team, and it’s functionality within E. coli was not shown. As we are using it as a reporter protein for our promoters we wanted to make sure that it definitely functioned within the organism.
E. coli was grown in MYE media for 27 hours while its fluorescence and optical density was measured. We carried out this test with WT-Top10, iLOV-Top10, GFP-Top10 and pure MYE media.
Experiment Two
This test was carried out on Plate 2. E. coli was grown for 32 hours with the addition of a set, non-lethal volume of TNT (0-10 ul, with steps of 2.5 ul) at t =0. Over this time the optical density and the fluorescence of the cultures were measured. We did this test to examine how our promoters responded to TNT.

The BSim platform has already been used in a number of other projects! Read more about these projects here.
The original BSim package from the BCCS Bristol team competing in iGEM 2008 was designed primarily for analysis of the specific problem at the time i.e. chemotactic behaviour of bacteria and basic quorum signalling. Although it was robust and powerful, it was felt that adding new features required a very in-depth knowledge of Java as the biological and physical aspects of the program were very closely intertwined with performance and system related code. Motivated by the wet lab work and this year's project, we decided to take the best features of BSim 2008 and create a new, more modular platform, where only a basic programming background is required to create advanced simulations.
BSim 2009 has been designed from the ground up to allow for advanced agent-based modelling. All parameters used throughout the package demonstrate physical and biological plausibility and are fully referenced. By completely basing BSim on the literature, it is easy to ensure that all modules remain reliably synchronised and work correctly together, as well as minimising the effort required to create new simulations.
The main features of BSim 2009 are summarised below. For more detailed information on features, please see the extensive user manual
.
BSim is available as a standalone pre-compiled library which can be compiled against like any other Java library, or as archived source code (for more details please see here ). A brief tutorial for one method of obtaining BSim using SVN is also provided here .

That delay a certain cycle and oscillation will follow another pace, therefore, we change the phase. Just like the time difference we feel in our life. During the moment when somebody flies from Beijing to Boston, the plane orients the opposite direction of Earth’s rotation (like the counteraction to degradation), and consequently, he has to subtract 12 hours in his watch and get used to the new time (follow another pace and change the phase).

Project Scope
the ABCs of Automatic Biological Circuit Design
One ultimate goal of synthetic biology is to program complex biological networks that could achieve desired phenotype and produce significant metabolites in purpose of real world application, by fabricating standard components from an engineering-driven perspective. This project explores the application of theoretical approaches to automatically design synthetic complex biological networks with desired functions defined as dynamical behavior and input-output property.
We propose a novel design scheme highlighted in the notion of trade-off that synthetic networks could be obtained by a compromise between performance and robustness. Moreover, series of eligible strategies, which consist of various topologies and possible standard components such as BioBricks, provide multiple choices to facilitate the wet experiment procedure. Description of all feasible solutions takes advantage of SBML and SBGN standard to guarantee extensibility and compatibility.
The Campus
University of Science and Technology of China, or as we abbreviate it for USTC, locates in Hefei, east of China. It's typical subtropic continent climate here, as midsummer could be sizzling while you'll have plenty of snow to expect in winter. Like the higher education in China itself, founded in Sept 20, 1958, USTC is a young campus packed with vigorous and young faces. There are two major parts, the east campus where physical, chemical sciences and SGY locates, and the west campus where we are here endeavoring together for iGEM. Going against the prevailing trend of expanding enrollment, USTC is subject to our pride to be one of the very few USTCers for all these years.
Members of USTC_Software, in front of main building of School of Life Sciences
The main building of School of Life Sciences is among the most advanced and eye-catching buildings on campus. Another reason for young guys' eyes to be caught here is due to the breakdown of USTC's characteristic guy-to-girl ratio here :-). Usually young men here will willingly (or unwillingly, anyways it never matters) leave the front row for ladies"

Hi, I am Yijun ZHANG,and I am going to be a senior student majored in life science. I'm familiar with traditional bio experiments, for I spent my junior year in a lab working on cell biology. And as a member of our iGEM team, I know more about synthetic biology. During experiments, I was always surprised by the interesting results. I really enioy the procedure of genetically engineering our E.coli to achieve amazing function. Hope our creation will also amaze you all!
Hi, I am Mingyuan DU majored in chemical engineering and I am going to have my 3rd year in Tsinghua University. I am the main supervisor of our cute little story about the microorganism --- including the play, the characters, the designing and finally the video. After the whole process, I picked up my confidence and was finally able to speak out loud that I am a capable person who enjoys challenges and difficulties.
I'm Zijian GUO and I'm major in Fundamental Science of Chemistry and Biology. Now it's my final year of my bachelor degree. Everything related to biology and chemistry and their interdisciplinary turns me on and I want to be a scientist in the next 10 years. After that, I'm not sure. Maybe running a café? Cooking is just another version of experiment, isn't it? For this IGEM project, I focus more on the parts design and experiment. It is nice to have such a friendly team to work in. And the exploring during the project is as fascinating as you can expect. I hope that our story could catch your attention.
I am Shude LIU from Tsinghua University, institute of chemical engineering. I feel very lucky to be a part of our IGEM team---THU-E, which focuses on the in vivo evolution for microbial cell factory. I used to think that Darwin’s theory of evolution just happen naturally without the interference of human being. But through our project, I realized that the process can actually be accurately designed and controlled by us, providing a promising way to evolve overproduction microbe. And I strongly believe that one day we can make the process of artificial evolution to be continuous, making it more accurate and controllable.

Figure 3: Principle of the Golden Gate cloning method.
Since the small BsaI fragment cut can re-ligate with the mother strand, the assembly is a lot more efficient if the tube is alternatively placed at 37°C, when the BsaI cuts and then placed at 16°C for a ligation time, using a thermocycler. This technique drive the equilibrium towards the product formation.
Analysis of a classical synthetic biology construction
A traditional construct in synthetic biology is made of the repetition of the following elements:
Fig 4: Schematic of the different elements assembly in a standard synthetic biology device.
At the moment, GoldenBrick only allows the assembly of a single cassette at the time. In order to create the full system, the assembly of the different cassettes together have to be conducted afterwards with the biobrick assembly, Gibson assembly - that is very efficient to assemble long fragments - or ligation independant cloning [6]. Focusing closer on a single cassette, we can notice that we have four different kinds of junctions:
Fig 5: In a single cassette, we can notice four different kinds of junctions. If we want the repetition of the {RBS-CDS} unit to be possible, the prefix of the RBS have to be compatible with the suffix of the gene.
As we can notice on this picture, there is four different kinds of junctions in an expression cassette. In Golden Gate, the junctions are DNA overhangs that can be freely engineered thanks to the capacity of Type IIS enzymes to cut outside their recognition site, no matter what sequence is there. Therefore, we should engineer four different overhangs. The first overhang is dedicated to the ligation of the plasmid suffix with the promoter prefix (OH1). Similarly, the 5th one is dedicated to ligate the terminator suffix with the backbone prefix (OH5). In a bacterial device, the scar between the RBS and the gene (OH3) has to be precisely controlled because the distance between the two elements is critical for correct protein expression. This scar will remain the same than in the biobrick assembly, but it will be generated by a type IIS enzyme as for the other overhangs. Finally, the overhang that link the RBS prefix to the promoter suffix (OH2) and the protein suffix to the terminator prefix (OH4) have to be compatible to make the repetition of several {RBS-Protein} units in a single cassette (OH2=OH4) possible. We will see later"

To help new students in finding their directions, we made many ""iGEM guideposts"" and placed them in different corners of our campus. We wanted to provide convenience for others. Meanwhile, we could also popularize scientific knowledge.

The dormitory area of many students in our university is far away from the main campus. we have to cross a boring as well as dark tunnel to reach our lab or library. In this year, our university sponsored an event to beautify the tunnel. We participated in this activity and painted a part of this tunnel. Our graffiti showed a large plant cell and its organelles.

7. Risk assessment
We used rice as a bioreactor to produce astaxanthin, and hope the aSTARice can serve as a food in human's daily life, so we are very cautious about the safety of aSTARice.
We believe that risks are mainly embodied in the following two aspects: one is that the encoding products of marker genes might be potentially toxic and allergenic for human or livestock. Antibiotic genes might be transferred into gut microbes' genome of humans or animals, increasing the resistance of the microbes to the antibiotics, and which results in reducing the effectiveness of antibiotics in clinical treatment; the other one is that marker genes could be spread through pollens or in other methods into other organisms, which is called genetic drift. Genetic drift can transfer antibiotic genes to weeds or other plants, which is threatening the ecological environment now.
In order to reduce the side effects of antibiotic marker genes, we use a technique called selectable marker-free technique in the project, so the final aSTARice is a marker-free transgenic plants (MFTPs). We design a Cre-LoxP based side-direct recombinant system to knock out hygromycin phosphotransferase gene, minimizing the effect of the selectable maker gene.
In order to reduce the risk of genetic drift as well as the threat to the ecological environment, we add isolation area to surround the experimental fields. By isolating the transgenic rice, we reduce the possibility of genetic drift caused by the transfer of the pollen, sufficiently guaranteeing the safety of the project. What's more, we are also analyzing coding products by HPLC and trying to make sure that there is no harmful products in our rice.

Secondly, we assembled three Sensors and the agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of Sensor A,Sensor B,Sensor C is shown in Fig.1-5.
We verified Sensor A, Sensor B and Sensor C through Fluorescence microscope. The fluorescence photos are shown in Fig.1-6.
We also implant the sRNA regulation system in each AND gate to repress the former one, ensuring that the signal molecule must be added in a set order, keeping the system from activated by random or total testing. Another system, cell division inhibiting system will go into effect. As a result, only with the input signals (various molecules) in correct order can permit E. coli live as expected.
1.3 RESULTS
We use two circuits to carry three Sensors, circuit one is made up of Sensor A and Sensor B, circuit two is made up of Sensor C. We have constructed two circuits and verified the function of the first circuit. Two circuits are shown in Fig.1-7 and the agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of the two circuits is shown in Fig.1-8.We verified circuit one after 6h induction through fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) and fluorescence microscope. The results are shown in Fig.1-9 and Fig.1-10.
We verified circuit one after 6h induction through fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) and fluorescence microscope. The results are shown in Fig.1-9 and Fig.1-10.
Unfortunately, the FACS result show that although lower than the sample which add Ara and IPTG, the control also have very high fluorescence intensity，we asked Tae Seok Moon, an assistant professor in Washington University, he told us that pipaH* has a very high basal level, so it should be connected to engineered RBS to fine-tune expression from it. So we changed the RBS from B0034 to J61100 because the latter have the lower bound strength，the results are verifying.

ESBS-Strasbourg,2010,Team:ESBS-Strasbourg#Project#Strategy_-_-_TEXT.html," this protease has been very well studied, notably by the Tania Baker Team from the MIT.
Description
Basically, ClpXP is an AAA protease present in bacteria, consisting of two main components, ClpX and ClpP. The ClpX is a hexamer consisting of six identical subunits. It recognizes specific degradation tags of target substrate proteins, unfolds them in an ATP-consuming hydrolysis reaction, and uses additional cycles of ATP hydrolysis to translocate the unfolded polypeptide into an interior chamber of ClpP, where proteolysis takes place. ClpP is a multi-subunit serine peptidase, in which the proteolytic active sites reside within a barrel-shaped structure.
                      
How using the ClpXP protease ? : The question of the use of an adaptator
This question was really critical. We focused on different strategies before making a definitive choice.
The publication of Tania Baker [7] based on the ClpXP protease of E. Coli which degrades substrates bearing the specific SsrA recognition sequence, has been the starting point of our reflection. In this work Baker and colleagues designed a series of modified ssrA tags which have weakened interactions with ClpXP to engineer controlled degradation. In E. coli, the adaptor SspB tethers ssrA-tagged substrates to the ClpXP protease, causing a modest increase in their rate of degradation. In the absence of SspB , substrates bearing the artificially altered DAS-tag were stable, in contrast the degradation of substrates bearing these engineered peptide tags was 100-fold more efficiently when SspB was present.
Upon these findings our first idea consisted in using the native ClpX with the mutated tag and a modified SspB whose binding to ClpX should be controlled by light in order to control protein degradation.  Forcing cells to produce an inactive form of an adaptator seem to be a good solution to  be able to stop the degradation at a certain point. This could be realized by producing two parts of the adaptator which could interconnect them after light-induction by fusing them to proteins which had this capacity, for instance the couple Phytochrome/PIF.
However, the use of the adaptor-based system posed some major problems concerning the complexity. Subsequent to another finding of Baker et. al., we decided to fuse our phytochrome directly to the N-terminal of ClpX, as it is not required for the basic enzymatic functions of ClpX [7] .

Week 12
February 2018
After the discussion session with Karolis, we have decided we want to use microfluidic technologies as the base for our system, as it seemed to be an extremely efficient starting point - the high-throughput is already there, we just need to enable it. Also, this discussion has led us to discover the main concept of the problem we wanted to solve with our project – the barrier to high-throughput sequence to function information acquisition is the loss of that information once all of the microfluidic droplets are broken.
.
Week 13
After a short while we have determined the main goal of our journey – creating a method that enables the high-throughput biomolecule activity and sequence recording inside of each of the billion droplets and then quickly and accurately retrieving that information.
Designing the solution
Week 16
The first question we asked was - what is the object that we can write the activity information into? After hosting a discussion together with Vilnius University students and later analysing the current workflows of various microfluidic techniques we have quickly came to conclusion, that such object should be a thing that already contains half of the information we wanted to record - biomolecule DNA sequence.
.
Week 17
We have presented our earliest form of the idea to the researchers in the Life Science Center - the problems we’re currently facing in synthetic biology, the solutions we have right now and our idea of how we can solve those problems by building a new method based on droplet microfluidics.
More
We have received extremely positive comments about the idea we wanted to achieve. The comments were based on the future promise of what such system of activity recording could bring to the field of synthetic biology and multidisciplinary research. During the discussion, researchers have also shared some of their ideas on how it would be possible to record the activity into the DNA sequence. One of those we liked in particular - recording the activity into the DNA in the form of DNA modifications.

Week 19
After the discussion with the LSC researchers, we have explored literature and brainstormed the possible ways activity could be linked to DNA modification.In addition we have met with Justas Vaitekūnas that has in depth expertise with DNA modification research. Justas has told us about various of techniques which he uses to DNA molecules during his research. As we discussed the possibilities of this approach we have all came to conclusion, that even though we could modify DNA in some way, we still did not have the link mechanism between biom"

About Graphene
Isolated for the first time in 2004 by Nobel Prize laureates , Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, the allotrope of carbon known as graphene has gathered an steadily increasing attention by scientists and industries alike. A bidimensional crystal stable at standard conditions, its structure confers it a number of unusual mechanical, thermal, and electric properties that has placed it over traditional materials such as silicon.
Some of graphene's intersting properties are:
Strong
Graphene is one of the hardest material known. A single layer of this carbon structure can achieve a Young's modulus of 1.0 TPa ( Lee et al, 2008 ). This elastic modulus, which works as a measure of a material's stiffness, overmatches steel's by 5 ( Halliday, Resnick and Walker, 2001 ).
Thin
Graphene is regarded as a 2D material because it is made up of a single layer of carbon atoms. This means it has an effective thickness around 3 Å ( Cooper et al, 2012 ), that is about 300,000 times thinner than an average piece of paper ( Sherlis, 2001 ).
Conductive
Graphene's exceptional thermal conductivity (up to 5000 W⁄mK for a single sheet of graphene) could improve performance and reliability of electronic devices ( Singh et al, 2011 ).
Stretchable
Thin graphene samples can fully adhere and follow the topography of an elastic substrate. This means that these kind of samples are highly sensitive to tension, thus they are easier to deform ( Cooper et al, 2002 ).
Transparent
Graphene only absorbs 2.3% of incident light, indicating that it is a good candidate to build transparent electronic components such as electrodes, polarizers, and ultrafast lasers ( Tsakmakidis, 2013 ).
Graphene Production
Graphene´s quality is important since any deformations produced by impurities, structural disorders or wrinkles can directly impact in its properties, resulting in a material with poor electronic and optical applicability.
Nowadays, there are two major bottlenecks when talking about production of high quality graphene:
First, its mass production, since it is"

About Us
The Lethbridge Entrepreneurial iGEM team members have vast experience in previous iGEM competitions. In this last year alone, Isaac Ward, Erin Kelly and Mackenzie Coatham acted as advisors for the Lethbridge High School iGEM team. The High School team engineered E. coli to produce the peptide hormone Oxytocin and its precursor protein.          They were extremely successful, winning Best New Biobrick - Natural, Best Wiki and the First Place Green Brick at the High School Jamboree.
Harland Brandon is an advisor to the Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM team, who have also been quite successful this year. At the North American Regional Jamboree in Toronto, Lethbridge Collegiate won Best Wiki and First Place in the overgraduate division.
All members also have experience in research labs outside of iGEM, in both neuroscience and biochemistry labs.

Brochures
To circulate synthetic biology knowledge and inspiration, we demonstrated key ideas in the discipline in a booklet and handed out the booklets to more high school students. Two students e-mailed us to express their interest in synthetic biology and consulted to us about how to be admitted by Tsinghua University.
What deserves to be mentioned is that most participants of our human practice is from College of Information Technology and we had a wonderful communication through the human practice. They asked us many questions and we also got some inspirations from them. What impressed us most is that a student from department of computer told us that the circuit switching and packet switching in computer network when transmitting information. We got a great inspiration from his words after we asked him for details about the two terms. Then we thought that circuit switching is that transmitting all information through a certain line but the packet switching is that dividing the information into pieces and transmitting different pieces through different lines. Both of the two methods have merits and demerits. Then we thought that why we could not combine both of them and then we designed our experiments that transmitting all information through two certain lines respectively in order to reduce the noises and uncertainty. And the experiments confirmed our views in some degree.
So you can see that we had a very successful human practice and we applied what we got from human practice into our experiments successfully. It helped with our project greatly and met the requirement of gold medal undoubtedly."

Exeter Mathematics School
On Tuesday 17th October 2017 Anna, Jake, Laura and Rachel delivered the first of a series of presentations on responsible research and innovation to the Exeter Mathematics School.
This presentation was delivered in front of a full audience, of approximately 20 sixth form students. The feedback showed that the majority of the audience found it useful (95%) and that 90% believe RRI should be included in the education system. Prior to the presentation, the majority of the students said that RRI was related to scientific integrity and preventing the environmental impacts in research and making innovation that is sustainable. This shows there is a basic understanding of what RRI is, but there is confusion with regards to how it differs from ethics, and the flexible process it is. This suggests there is a lack of exposure of this topic up to the sixth form level. However, although 90% suggesting RRI should be included in the education system, it often came with the proviso that it should be introduced at university level due to the complexity and the material being less relevant to students not seeking a career in science. Since the students already have an understanding of ethics in science, this is a good platform for students to learn about RRI at university.
At the end of our presentation we opened the floor up for questions and received a number of thought provoking responses. One member of the audience asked a series of questions relating to 'if we felt RRI was more appropriate for research that produces a product instead of research for the sake of science'. To this we said that responsible science should always be at the forefront of any researchers mind. However there is a significant difference between applied research and curiosity lead science. Although it is ultimately the decision of the research about when is best to employ the framework we believed that RRI becomes increasingly more important when the innovation is introduced into society.
University of Exeter - Biosciences
On Monday 23rd October 2017 Anna, Jake, Laura and Rachel delivered the second of a series of presentations on responsible research and innovation, this time to second year Biosciences students at the University of Exeter.
This presentation was presented to an audience of approximately 25 second year bioscience undergraduates. The feedback found that 92% found the presentation useful or better, with the remaining 8% showing indifference, however 100% believed that RRI should be included in the education system. The audience showed a similar belief in what RRI means to the previous presentation at the Mathematics School, with the majority mentioning ethics and environmental sustainability. This shows the students have not"

People Risks
Risks in terms of key personnel in our company have been outlined and contingency plans developed. These can be found on our management page .
Systemic Risks
Finally, systemic risks are an important category to consider. In terms of FREDsense Technologies, this could involve drastic changes to government-mandated regulation in the oil and gas sector. As our market opportunity is largely due to significant changes that affect regulated monitoring in Alberta, this could drastically affect the usefulness and viability of our products. Although this is extremely unlikely, as trends seem to suggest that regulation will increase in the industry, it is still important to consider. In the event that this occurred, we would shift our focus to target other more stable markets. Again, as much of the research and development activities of FREDsense focus on developing our versatile detector platform, transitioning into another market using this would not represent a serious setback in terms of timelines.
Risk Factor Analysis
In order to start designing a comprehensive strategy to minimize our potential risks, we have done a risk factor analysis. We have identified some of the key risks that our start-up could face as well as the type of risk and likelihood of occurring for each. We then came up with possible mitigation strategies and their relative cost. Although this likely does not cover all of the possible risks that we could face, starting our risk assessment early will hopefully help us avoid making critical mistakes.
* Relative costs variable due to new market. Markets requiring high sensitivity of analysis or specific regulatory challenges could invoke significantly high costs both in terms of financing and time. Versatility of platform would allow for relatively easy transition, thus we have made an assumption of low cost.
SWOT Analysis
In order to better understand our position in relation to risk, we performed a SWOT analysis. Here we identified four key areas: our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats as shown below.
Key Strengths and Weaknesses
Several key advantages can be seen in our SWOT analysis. These include the versatility of our technology platform and the significant advantages our products can offer over existing technologies. These strengths are things we need to maintain, build and leverage. Through development of our first generation product, we will be optimizing our platform in order to facilitate the development of next generation products.
Despite our strengths, we also need to be wary of our venture's weaknesses. These include the primarily technology-focused background of our key members and the high costs that we will incur in bringing our first product to market. These"

Justification and happiness
Working with GMO’s leads to thoughts about justification: how can one morally justify the methods and the results? Bioethics handles the questions by supplying the foundation for the discussion. It derives from theories about normative ethics and medical concerns and has then specialized in the questions which rises in working with modifying organisms. In the field of bioethics there is different ways to justify the work and different types of arguments, depending on what area one works with and what problem one tries to solve.
In our project we have focused a lot on antibiotic resistance and plastic pollution as a problem in the community and environment. The general argument for justification we use, is an appeal to utility. This means that the work we do aims to increase the overall happiness and utility, which are seen by utilitarians as the most important factor to value actions by. This also makes us ‘proactivists’ which means that we look upon new technologies with a positive mind KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik.  In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
For more information on the Precautionary Principle, click here. For more information about bioethics and our justification, then click here.
Theory and Bioethics
Bioethics are defined in different ways according to the subject one is applying it to. A definition that suits that view is Battin’s who sees bioethics as a hybrid consisting of philosophy, medicine and law BATTIN, M. P. 2003. Bioethics. In: WELLMAN, R. G. F. C. H. (ed.) A Companion to Applied Ethics. Blackwell Publishing Ltd. . That definition is now 13 years old and it still fits if there is added a long list of subjects to go with it. Bioethics are ethics about flora and fauna – and the hard questions that emerge in the humane world. Questions e.g. when - or if - a fetus is a person or whether it is wrong to use the nature – bacteria for example – to help the human race thrive.
Theories in normative ethics
One of the interesting aspects of bioethics, as a field, is that there is no dominating strain of normative ethics. The arguments are both deontological in nature as well as utilitarian"

Simulation Results
Figure 8. Simulation of the IPTG-lac repressor system.
We infer that the situation of TALE will be similar with IPTG. When TALE protein binds on the plasmid, the expression of lacI will be repressed. Consequently, the concentration of RFP will be increased. If no TALE proteins  are expressed, the concentration of RFP will be very low.
Figure 9. Situations that TALE successfully express and not express.
From the simulation, we can conclude that RFP can be a signal of whether our TALE has successfully expressed, moreover, the concentration of RFP, which shows as the fluorescence intensity, has positive correlation with the quantity of TALE protein.

Cultured in bottles:
After 4 hours culturing in 37℃ in bottles, we used 500μM IPTG induced in 16℃ for 8-12h. We used McAc 0 and 20 to wash off the bulk proteins, and used McAc 200 to wash off aimed proteins.
 
Figure 1. The expression of inJanus-m
We finally can use McAc 0 and 20 to wash off the bulk proteins and use McAc 200 to wash off aimed proteins.
Figure 2. The expression of sJanus-m
The concentration of IPTG, temperature and time we used in sJanus-m’s expression are same to those of inJanus-m, except that we used TB liquid culture medium rather than LB to raise bacteria to get more proteins. 
We also expressed sJanus successfully in E.coli (data not provided). And Nankai helped us to express inJanus in pichia pastoris, which you could see in detail in (COLLABORATIONS) .

1.   About FsC
Protein pre-expression FsCUse pET-28a as expression vector and pre-express FsC, FsC-sJanus, FsC- sJanus-m in BL21. Analyze the result of SDS-PAGE to infer whether protein FsC, FsC-sJanus, FsC-sJanus-m express after induced by IPTG.
Figure 3. The results of SDS-PAGE. M is Protein marker. a is sample of FsC which is non-induced. b is sample of FsC which is induced.
We can tell the difference (in red circle) between non-induced and induced. The amount of protein after induced is larger than non-induced and molecular weight is about 25kDa which is target protein’s molecular weight. So we infer that FsC can express in E.coli BL21.

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," glycoprotein that mediates epithelial cell-specific intercellular adhesion and involves cell signaling, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. EpCAM has been detected in most adenocarcinomas, and is also found in metastatic tumors, malignant effusions and cancer stem cells.
Next, we choosed the ssDNA aptamer as an intermediary for downstream signaling of proteins. It is a single-stranded DNA that specifically binds to a target molecule. Theoretically, the corresponding aptamer of any protein can be screened by SELEX technique. And we choosed EpCAM's aptamer--SYL3C. [1]

At the same time, we also used the competition method to facilitate our design of hardware. As shown in the figure, according to our assumption, the upstream EpCAM would compete with our designed aptamer and its partial complementary chain. After that, some complementary strands would be competed and freed, coming out and going to the next module to get the signal amplified.
Figure 2. The principle of Sensor.
For this module, we also modeled the molecular docking model of aptamer and protein, and partially predicted the number of bases in the complementary strands. Click to learn more.
Amplifier
In this module we used the Cas12a protein to amplify the signal. Cas12a (also known as Cpf1) was originally discovered as a replacement for Cas9. [2] But this year's discovery showed that it had a new function of being activated by ssDNA and realizing trans-cleavage. [3]
Figure 3. The principle of Amplifer.
As shown in the figure, when some of our upstream complementary strands are released to the Cas12a protein after competitions, recognized by the specifically designed crRNA and finally complemented with it successfully, the Cas12a protein will be activated, and non-specific cleavage will occur.

“The project seemed like a great opportunity to get some laboratory experience and I hoped for an educational experience by participating in an official research project” - Sigrid, 17.
It was important for the team not to exclude anyone from getting the opportunity to learn a lot during the summer and being a part of our team. This is reflected in the background of the three high school students, who are enrolled at three different high schools and had various experience with laboratory work and biotechnology in general.
“I would like to experience the laboratory work in projects like this and improve my competences” - Tobias, 19
Common for all of them, though, was the eagerness to learn, their enthusiasm about the project and their ability to ask questions and challenge us on our basic biotechnology knowledge and skills!
We asked Sigrid, Tobias and Rasmus after the summer: “What was the best part about joining the DTU iGEM team?”
“The best thing about my participation throughout the summer, is the insight that I’ve gotten about the research process in science and what I’ve learned about how to genetically manipulate microorganisms, which is awesome! It’s now more clear what I want to do later in my education.” - Rasmus, 16.
“It has been a good opportunity to learn by doing and pick the brains of the students who have been part of the project. We were allowed to work on our own, resulting in a greater experience and understanding. My participation in the project has contributed to a change of my future plans concerning my education” - Tobias, 19.
“I was pleasantly surprised by how much I was allowed to participate in the experiments. It has been so much fun to try new laboratory techniques and improve my experimental skills on a project with more freedom than the regular high school experiments.Working on the project has definitely already helped me in my biotech classes, as I learned a couple of things over the summer that have been very applicable in my regular education” - Sigrid, 17.

Ruiling is a junior majoring in biology at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Devoted to iGEM for two years, she has got lots of training from lab work to project design. Besides, she really treasures the precious and memorable experience of working with all her teammates and instructors. About them, the future is still very long. To be short, she is the leader of the team this year.
“Deadline gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall have no breakfast, play no games, watch no films. I shall wear no ccolumnns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the alarm of the clock. I am the watcher for the schedule. I am the fire that burns against the laziness, the light that brings the energy, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the team of UCAS. I pledge my life and honor to the Deadline’s Watch, for this ddl and all the ddls to come.”

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Foundations_-_-_TEXT.html," alternative sigma factor networks. The σF/PF2 system allowed us to have tight transcriptional control of genes in allowing transcription to only occur in the presence of σF whose translation was regulated directly by the external input signal. Thus, this part of the system is responsible for direct response to the oscillatory input signal.
hrpS, hrpR, hrpL:
hrpS and hrpR are positive transcriptional regulatory proteins originally discovered in Pseudomonas syringae that interact together to drive transcription downstream of a PhrpL promoter sequence [6]. The cooperativity of hrpS and hrpR was key in designing a system that acted as a logical AND gate [7]. We leveraged the fact that both proteins are necessary to see downstream transcription to design our system to require two simultaneous inputs (in our case these inputs were temperature variation above a specific frequency threshold AND below a different threshold). The hrp regulatory sequences worked as the signal processing component of the circuit.
When both hrpR and hrpS are present, they dimerize to form a complex (we will refer to this complex as hrpR/S). Only when hrpR and hrpS are BOTH present in the system can they form the hrpR/S dimer, which functionally acts as a transcription factor. The complex binds to the PhrpL promoter sequence, and induces production of the downstream gene. In our system, sfGFP is downstream of the promoter, and is only produced when both hrpR and hrpS are present in the system.
Figure 5. AND gate dependent on hrpR/S complex, as described by Wang, Kitney, Joly, and Buck (2011).
sfGFP:
“Superfolder” green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) is a GFP variant with the primary added advantage of strong folding capability even when fused to poorly folded protein product. Additionally, sfGFP folds 3.5 times faster than normal folder GFP, and is reported to be one of the fastest folding GFPs studied thus far [8,9]. Furthermore, its relatively long half-life makes it easily measurable over long periods of time. These factors made it a prime candidate for incorporation into our system as a reporter because its quick maturation makes it ideal for studying expression dynamics, and its long half-life allows readings to be made on an hourly time scale.
sfGFP was chosen as the reporter because one of the goals of the project was to quantify and subsequently model the amounts of protein expression when the system is exposed to different rates of variation of temperature. Utilizing a"

The 3D-printed cuvette brace offered space for LED and photosensor to be attached. The space for the cuvette is slightly larger than the size of cuvette, leaving extra space for vibration. During the measurement, inlay the cuvette into the fitting hole in order to fix it.
The 3D-printed shell is a box with four interfaces attached to the brace. The baffle plate covers and protects details of the system, leaving a hole for the cuvette.
Processor
Beetle
We chose a small MCU - Beetle based on Arduino Leonardo as processor. It is very small in size, only 20mm by 22mm. In addition, it has a microUSB which can be burned directly, and it can also be connected by wire directly, which is very convenient for debugging.
Filters
We use reden filter paper as our filters, which is usually used in photography. It is not as good as professional filter but it is cheaper and easy to obtain in China.
More info: link1 link2
Power Module
For portable purposes, we use both batteries and power cords for power supply. Specifically, we use a 150mAh battery, a power management module suitable for lithium battery, and a micro USB interface for charging. It is connected to a button, which is clicked for start and double - clicked for shutdown.
Photosensitive Sensor
TSL235R
The same as Team Aachen, we choose this photosensitive sensor for its small size, which is only 4.6*2.6*4.6
LED
We use 605nm and 485nm LED, which variance is less than 5nm.
Temperature Sensor
LM35DZ
LM35DZ  is a cheap and fine temperature sensor, we use it to remind the users to put the yeast in a proper temperature for cultivation.
Display Screen
In order to display the results visually, we choose to use the display screen to demonstrate the results. We choose a small display screen,0.96 inch, which uses the IIC communication protocol

Microbiology and Immunology 3rd Year
Why iGEM:
The first time I herd about iGEM was though a friend who attended one of the information sessions from the year before, I was curious so I decided to check it out.  I was astonished with the creativity, freedom, and quality of the projects and I told myself that I need to be a part of this experience
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I would love to work on my wet lab skills and learn the in’s and out’s of designing biological systems. Since this is my first experience with iGEM and synthetic biology I am excited to soak in as much information as I can.
What inspires you:
To put it simply, good music, good friends, and good cheer.
Desired Impact on the World:
I think microbes are fascinating and for the time being I see myself transforming the world through creative research. But who knows, I’m sure iGEM will allow me to open my mind to new possibilities within science, business, and policy alike.
Hobbies:
I love beer, craft beer to be precise, and I love to share it with friends.

Fisal Elstone
Major and Year:
Integrated Sciences, Graduated May 2014!
Why iGEM:
I joined IGEM last year because it remains a unique undergraduate experience that forces teams of students try to solve problems in a multidimensional, collaborative manner. This multidimensional approach seems reflective of how problems are solved in the working world and there are few opportunities to work on projects like this in an undergraduate degree. I was also drawn in by the incredible imagination and success of past teams! Needless to say, I really enjoyed the IGEM experience and hence I decided to return.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to gain an appreciation and a broader sense of what is possible as a undergrad in todays scientific community. From the project itself I hope to improve my wetlab skills as well as gain more exposure to the academic/industry interface.
What inspires you:
Honestly IGEM really inspires me; it’s quite remarkable to see passionate young scientists working towards ambitious projects and collaborating with other students from around the globe. I am a big fan of the Jamboree in particular.
Desired Impact on the World:
I have always wanted"

What are your plans after university?
I hope to come back to my country soonish (although I said that 5 years ago already), and work in the Biotech sector. I get quite amazed by the stuff that are done in the field of green Biotechnology so I will probably try and make some company in the field believe that “amazed people” are good assets to have!
Why did you join iGEM?
Winter days in Stockholm are looooong and dark, you need to look for things that keep you inside and warm…I knew some bacteria had to be incubated at 37º which is quite a standard temperature in Spain, so I decided to give it a chance and feel like at home every time I am near the incubator! …And I actually do really hope to be some-little-how contributing to the scientific world :)
The zombie apocolypse breaks out-where do you go first?
Let me quickly see the Mediterranean Sea once more, and once my friends and I get infected I assume we will not be allowed in the labs anymore, so we can spend some solid amount of time seeing the rest of the world!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of"

When we used our optimized self-made cell extract, in vitro sfGFP production was superior to commercially available cell-free expression kits.
We demonstrated that our CFPS reaction has the potential to work under field circumstances. It is robust against various substances and works near room temperature. After lyophilization, we could not observe any living cell in several tests, so we can say that we created a cell-free environment.
We verified the observations from Pardee et al. that CFPS works on different types of paper. With freeze-drying or lyophilization, storage was possible, and reaction start could be triggered by addition of water.
Paper-based CFPS was a key feature in our biosensor project and thus CFPS was integrated into an application-oriented context. Paper-based CFPS paves the way to a new age of biosensors with great potential for field usage. This new generation biosensors are storable, extensible, safe, reliable and can be used by everybody. Of course professional biosafety tests have to be performed prior to a field usage of such a biosensor.

University of Calgary Collaboration
Members of the University of Calgary iGEM team, and members of the Queens Canada team were selected as  winners of the Canadian Reduced Gravity Experiment Design Challenge (CAN-RGX), a Canada-wide competition run  by the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS), in collaboration with the National  Research Council, and Canadian Space Agency. This provided an unpresented opportunity to collaborate, and  facilitate discussions on genetic engineering, engaging students in STEM research and competitions, and  biomedical sciences education in Canada.  Members of the University of Calgary team and Queen’s Canada teams  have met up multiple times, and had skype calls to share ideas and troubleshoot problems, including  strategies to synthesize complex gene fragments, accessing university funding, STEM research at Canadian  universities, laboratory techniques, check-ins on each others progress, the difficulties of performing life  sciences research in zero gravity, and plans for helping to share the fantastic learning opportunities that  iGEM and CAN-RGX provide for ambitious science students. We have had nothing but great experience working  alongside the University of Calgary Team, and we wish them success at the 2018 iGEM Jamboree!

Makerere University
After being graciously awarded an Opentrons OT-2 automatic pipetting robot, we were eager to find other    teams that we could share protocols and tips with. Speaking with iGEM Makerere, we both had a lot of    questions surrounding wet lab protocols, dry lab modelling, and practical applications of our respective    projects that could be answered by the other team’s diverse knowledge and unique experiences. For    example, the Makerere team stated that a metabolic by-product of the degradation of plastics by microbes    is ethylene glycol, however they couldn’t decide on a practical use for this by-product. As Canadians,    we know ethylene glycol well, as it is the major component of antifreeze for windshield frost in the    winter! We suggested that their by-product could be used in cryop"

Less than 2% of clinical centers in the world who are conducting research in Brazil and, according to local scientists and clinicians, the country is losing potential studies for other countries due to their regulatory requirements (Folha de S. Paulo, 2014). Clinical trials need to have the endorsement of two distinct organisms (CONEP, National Commission on Research Ethics, and ANVISA), a process that can extend over more than a year, unlike the three months in the USA and the European Union
Unlike many OECD economies and a growing number of middle-income countries, Brazil only provides regulatory protection of clinical trial data submitted to fertilizers, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals for veterinary use. Pharmaceuticals for human use are not covered by existing regulations (Pugatch Consilium, 2014).
RESEARCH, PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATION
In Brazil, according to a study held by IPEA (SIGLA) in 2008 (Mendonça and Freitas, 2008) 290 research groups linked to R&D&I activities in biotechnology were identified. The agricultural, biological and health sciences are the most important, accounting for 79% of the identified groups. The main biotechnological applications listed by the research groups are agriculture, human health and animal health. Data from the Brazilian Center for Analysis and Planning (CEBRAP) indicated that 57% of searches are funded directly by the Federal Government, and 46% of the total is linked to federal universities. States are responsible for approximately 31% and 26% coming from universities. The research and organizations are clustered in the Southeast, primarily in the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, where it usually is focused research groups, located in the most prestigious universities, leading to the formation of companies dedicated to biotechnology with various forms of collaboration with research groups.

A proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Property Rights
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""No one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and  extend the parts info,"

The p416-TEF1-GFP plasmid was used as it was for measuring expression levels of the pTEF1 promoter and saved us a bit of work with constructing the plasmids. For the rest of the study, p416-TEF1 was used.
The promoters for the study were extracted from the genome of S. cerevisiae IMX581. The genomic extraction was performed according to “quick genomic extraction” protocol. The promoters were amplified with PCR from the genomic extraction. For primer sequences, see the constructs page .
The p416-TEF1 plasmid backbone was cut with fast digest™ XbaI and SacI restriction enzymes from ThermoFisher according to “Assembly of promoter study” protocol When p416-TEF1 is cut with those enzymes, the pTEF1 promoter is removed from the rest of the plasmid backbone, which is then ready for insertion of the new promoter along with GFP.  The plasmids were assembled using a three fragment Gibson assembly with the plasmid backbone, the GFP gene and the various promoters. The p416-GFP plasmids with the different promoters were transformed to chemically competent E. coli by heat shock. After growth over night colonies were picked from the E. coli plates. They were streaked onto new selection plates and inoculated into liquid LB media with ampicillin. After a second overnight growth, plasmids were extracted from the E. coli. Correct plasmid assembly was verified with restriction of the plasmids followed by gel electrophoresis. The Gibson assembly and the plasmid restriction verification was carried out according to the “Assembly of promoter study” protocol. IMX581 was transformed with the plasmids using electroporation according to “yeast electroporation” protocol.
The S. cerevisiae IMX581 with the fluorescence plasmids was taken from plate and cultured overnight in SD-ura media with 2 % (w/v) glucose. When measuring expression levels on acetate, the cultures that had grown overnight in glucose were centrifuged, washed and re-suspended in SD-ura acetate 0.5 % (w/v) and then left to grow for 24 hours.  After overnight growth, samples were taken from the cultures and viewed with fluorescence microscopy. Excitation/emission was 485/520 nm. Pictures of the samples were taken (see results below).

Rationale and Aim
The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team that hamper the success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Reporter) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by inserting two different sensitivity tuner constructs between the processing units of the Sensynova platform; BBa_K274371 and BBa_K274381 .
Background Information
Both selected sensitivity tuner constructs were made and submitted to the iGEM registry by the Cambridge 2009 team. They were chosen as variants to the empty processing module present in the Sensynova platform due to the fact that, although they have been included in the iGEM distribution kit since their submission in 2009, they have yet to be successfully implemented into a team’s system, as far as we are aware. The 2007 Cambridge iGEM team built 15 different constructs that amplified the PoPS output of the promoter pBad/AraC detailed by image below taken from the Cambridge 2009 team's wiki.
Figure 1: Cambridge 2007 Amplifier System
The 2009 Cambridge iGEM team then re-designed these constructs to be PoPS converters, as image below taken from their wiki details, and generated a set sensitivity tuners corresponding to Cambridge 2007’s amplifiers.

SVA-NYC,2015,Team:SVA-NYC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the intention of Soiled to develop an alternative non-toxic and reliable method for processing soil samples.
Microfluidic cartridge and portable compatible device
For our project we ultimately decided to work with colors of the landscape, both of which are instrumental to the fields of art and science. Color is a subjective sensation in which photons report to the brain in your visual system. Placed side by side colors are mixed by the eye itself as impression, as demonstrated in Claude Monet’s work.  As artists, the notion of applying color as a means of depicting a landscape is nothing new, so naturally we were intrigued by the potential of using colorimetric analysis of soil nutrients to generate color profiles of locations sampled.
By replacing the toxic chemical based laboratory standard of soil analysis with a colorimetric biological analog we can provide a safer alternative. We will genetically engineer E.coli K-12 to express various chromoproteins in the presence of molecules that pertain to soil and plant nutrition. Our plan is to produce a microfluidic chip that will house the necessary reagents, biological or otherwise. Any harmful materials that cannot be replaced will be minimized and sequestered within the device to limit the user’s exposure to potential biological and/or chemical hazards. The microfluidic cartridge will be loaded into a portable device and integrated with compatible technologies, such as a phone and it’s case. The “color data” can be captured and measured by the phone’s camera, eliminating human error. This data will be instantly uploaded into an app that provides accurate feedback regarding what crops are ideal for the current soil conditions and what measures need to be taken to adjust soil for desired crops.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook#iGEM42_-_-_TEXT.html," Thus we had to go directly to the jamboree results page and add the right awards to every team in 2011. This was done directly in the JSON file an the RData-file was updated imediately.
Bug-fix: NA-values
The award filters match the full team list to retrieve the names of the teams to keep in the dataset. These are then taken from the already reduced data set, which produces empty rows in the data for those teams, that match the award filter and were already removed the data-frame by another filter prior to the award matching. The naming of those empty rows is ""NA.number"". Thus in order to remove these empty rows those row-names containing ""NA"" were removed. This was a really bad idea, because we spend lots of time trying to find out why our tool doesn't like the UNAM MEXICO teams. This bug was fixed by adding a dot to the regular expression and separately removing the first empty row, which would exactly match ""NA"".

In all the figures the GFP expression and the biomass concentration are expressed in fluorescence unit (FU) and light scattering unit (LSU) respectively.
Figure 3 presents the characterization for the rationally designed arabinose promoters. When uninduced (left part of the figure) the background GFP expression level for strains 1b and 3h is slightly above the background in original promoter (black line) which indicates that these promoters are less tight. In case of strains 2a and 4d the basal expression level is comparable to the original promoter. From the right part of the figure we can see that the induction didn't influence expression in strain 4d which implies that unknown mutations abolished arabinose regulation in that promoter. In the case of strain 2a induction is maintained, however its level is much lower than that of original promoter. The mutations increased the promoter strength in strain 1b and 3h when compared to strain 300. These results seem to point, as could be expected, towards the -10 playing a more important role in strength determination than the -35. The -35 apparently requiring to be ""bad"" for the stimulatory effect of AraC bound to arabinose to be optimal.

Figure 4 presents the characterization for the arabinose promoters changed using SPL. At the uninduced state (left part of the figure) the basal expression of all promoters is at the same level as that of original promoter. In the induced state however, the differences in the levels of GFP expression varies significantly with some of the promoters being more active and others less active than"

Idea
That's What We Are Going to Do
The greenhouse effect is a well-known phenomenon describing the synergy of several gases in the atmosphere of the Earth, which leads to positive as well as negative consequences. Without greenhouse gases the Earth would be a very cold place and life would not be possible the way we know it. Nevertheless, due to increasing emission of gases like methane and carbon dioxide the effect is further enhanced and thus causes global warming.
Among other things, the greenhouse gas methane is a product of naturally occuring enteric fermenation of cows. Because the consumption of dairy products and meat is increasing, mass husbandry is widely spread. Hence, the emission of methane attributed to cows rises to unnatural dimensions.
Since most people are not willing to change their daily nutrition and reduce their consumption of several products significantly (see our survey ) an elimination of methane emissions caused by cows would be useful. However, former approaches merely regard either the methanotrophs responsible for methane production or the substrates they need.
Our project idea is to reduce global methane emission right at one of the sources, the rumen of cows, without affecting resident organisms. Our idea is to provide the digestive tract with a specially modified microorganism, named E. cowli, which is planned to metabolize the methane before its emission and, therefore, prevent the enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming.
Approach
Our project at a glance: The isolated sMMO genes from M. capsulatus are transferred into the vector pSB1A3 and introduced into E. coli. The resulting E. cowli is then encapsulated in alginate beads. The beads can be administered to the cow and degrade methane.
To reduce the methane emission caused by cows, we needed a microorganism which is able to metabolize this greenhouse gas right after its production in the rumen. Therefore, our project is based on the enzyme complex methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from the bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus, the model organism for obligate methanotrophic bacteria, native to multiple habitats such as soils and the oceans.
The sMMO is a multi-enzyme complex consisting of three subunits: a hydroxylase (MMOH), a reductase (MMOR), and a regulator (MMOB). The hydroxylase itself again consists of the three subunits α, β and γ. Hence, the complete complex encompasses"

Finishing up the concentration dialysis
8:11AM: withdrew 100uL from the cassette. It seems too dilute.
Ended up withdrawing the silk from the cassette at around 11:00AM... That's about a 21 hour concentration... Why did it not gel up? Is it because of the slightly less concentrated PEG (100g in 1000mL instead of 900mL water?)?
Ended up being 16% w/v.
Spinning Tamura
In any case, we spun 250 uL of it. Because this is fairly dilute silk, we could only add Tamura in a 1:750 Tamura:Silk ratio. Final dope concentration is 15% w/v.
Spin at 10 uL/min, into a 70% v/v EtOH bath
It suuuuuucks.
We got kind of frustrated. Switched to a 90% v/v Isopropanol (IPA) bath.
IPA seems to work very well
We indirectly measured the rate at which the silk comes out of the PEEK tubing by timing the rotation of tweezers as we collected the thread around it. We found 12 tweezer rotations in 26 seconds, where each ""rotation"" is a 180 degree turn. This translates to 7.3846 mm/s."

By attending this class, besides teaching, we also learned a few things. We detected that several students were interested in science. High schools manage these topics in a simple way in order to invite the student to look more about it. The problem is that not every student knows where to get close to receive more information. Analyzing this situation, we decided to keep attending high schools with the same approach throughout the semester. We want to spread science a little more with every visit, maybe one day one of these students is the one teaching us the new opportunities synthetic biology is creating for humanity.
MEXMUN
After receiving a great response from high school students, we felt very satisfied to share moments with young people and decided to do another activity that involved youth. We looked a way to reach alumni from different parts of Mexico and we found MEXMUN, a Mexican Model of the United Nations.
Model of the United Nations (MUN) can be defined as the simulation and representation of the United Nations System in which junior high school, high school, and college students participate as one country in a committee and discuss topics of interest for this international agency.
In Mexico, the MUN that involves students from different educational institutions at a different educational level is called Mexico Model of the United Nations (MEXMUN). Here, students from all over the Mexican Republic attend to
represent a country in a specific committee as a delegate. Delegates chose a country and prepare themselves to be the debate and discuss proposals with real information of that given country.
In MEXMUN 2017, this event hosted 663 delegates, 35 schools and 16 committees in Spanish, English, and French, making this event the country's largest model. For us, spreading knowledge is one of our main goals. We want to make people think out of the box and imagine scenarios where synthetic biology can aim to  environmental  alternatives and solve serious humanity problems but we also know that if it isn’t used correctly, things can go out of control and make everything go wrong.
For this MUN we wanted to approach students and help them see how synthetic biology can be used or misused. Our objective with this topic is that students search for information on how every country is dealing with this new emerging technology in order to keep youth updated.
That's why we emailed Arturo Martínez, General Secretary of MEXMUN 2018, and asked him a space for iGEM Tec-Chihuahua in this year’s edition"

Biobrick: Red Fluorescent Protein measurement (FAILED)
Goal:
Measure the expression of the Bba_J04450 biobrick in transformed dH5α cells. This is done by measuring fluorescence.
Procedure:
1. Incubated dH5α, J04450 transformed cells were dilluted 1:100 with LB
2. 200 µL, 5 replicates of LB, LB with Chloramphenicol and 5 dH5α dillutions made from different batches were applied to a 96 well plate
3. Tecan plate reader was used to measure absorbance at 588 nm and fluorescence at excitation 584 nm and emission 607 nm with the following parameters:
Temperature: 37,0°C, varying from 36,5°C to 37,5°C
Kinetic cycles: 750
Gain: 40
Z position: 18055 µM
Shaking: 300 s
Orbital shaking amplitude: 3 mm
Results:
The wells dried out, presumably due to us choosing not to use a lid on the plate, and the measurements were therefore aborted by the machine.

Quantification of reaction in paper ticket.
In order to quantify the results of our paper ticket assay, we utilized ImageJ software to select the reaction wells and measure the raw intensity of the fluorescence.
​
We took a photo of the ticket under UV light and made sure that the fluorescence signal was not saturating and saved as a .tiff or .png file. Small adjustments were made, such as rotating the image so that the ticket columns are level or to label the photo (Title: Date/Column numbers).
The protocol for using ImageJ was as follows:
1. Open photo in ImageJ program.
2. Open “Analyze” menu and select “Set Measurements”
3. Ensure only “Integrated Density,” is selected.
4. Hit “ok”
5. Select Oval tool. (This is more preferred method)
6. Create an Oval around the first test well. Be sure all pixels of the well are encompassed. Be sure to measure each individual well.
7. Open “Analyze” menu, and select Measure. Quick keys: Ctrl+M
8. (New window will open containing the Raw/Integrated Density measurement)
9. Use arrow keys to move the original Oval to the next well in line within that column.
10. (Repeat this process until all 16 wells have been measured)
11. Save the window containing Raw/Integrated Density Measurements.
12. Export data to Excel.
13. Organize and and label each column.
14. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each individual column separately.
15. Highlight each column head and all four Raw Raw Density numbers at once.
16. Select “Insert” menu. In the Charts menu, be sure to use scatter plot.
17. Remove vertical grid lines.
18. Title Chart.
19. Ensure x-axis is labeled only with 1-4.

Some of these concern local circumstances, while others contain national and even global issues. We as the municipality can only go so far on our own. So, we are entirely dependent on the help of local agents. It makes me so happy, when the students of the city, have taken on the mantle of developing new green technologies that solves global issues, while contributing to local city growth”
Peter Rahbæk Juel - Mayor of Odense
The core philosophy of our Integrated Human Practices has been to incorporate local experts in the development of our project. We wanted to examine how results produced in the laboratory, could be used to shape a product that corresponds with the green values of Odense.
We sought the advice of experts in other fields, e.g. expert in plastics to design the best possible exterior of our device. Furthermore, we met with business developer Ann Zahle Andersen to investigate the core value of our product from a business perspective.
We believe that Human Practices have played an essential role in our iGEM project. Everything from the design of our prototype to ethical considerations have been influenced by the people we engaged with.
Interviewing Smart City Odense
For the possible implementation of the PowerLeaf in the local environment of Odense, we decided to reach out to Kristina Dienhart, project manager of Smart City Odense. Smart City Odense is a project within Odense Municipality, that seeks to combine urban planning with new technologies and open-data toward creating a smarter, more sustainable city.
This made us aware of necessities essential to Odense and its citizens. She gave us feedback that we integrated into numerous areas of our overall project.
Changeability - From Mrs. Dienhart’s point of view, one of the most advantageous attributes of our device is the potential for changeability in the size and shape of the design. We had yet to consider the PowerLeaf as a device not limited by physical dimensions. This has been the most significant element we took with us from the interview. Changeability is a necessity to a city planner, as various laws and aesthetic considerations need to be taken into account, when altering or creating an urban environment.
Accessibility - She also discussed accessibility with us. The citizen will not use our device unless it is easily accessible. This means that the overall design of the PowerLeaf, regardless of its aesthetics, always needs to be designed with a user in mind. Reflecting on the advice of Mrs. Dienhart, we decided to reevaluate the means of implementation of the PowerLeaf to ensure that the need for accessibility and user"

The goal of our inaugural meet-up was to provide an opportunity for all Singaporean iGEM participants to get to know each other, network, and spark fruitful discussion on potential collaborations. This meeting was the first official platform for all three teams (NUS_Singapore-Sci, NUS_Singapore-A and NTU-Singapore) to share with each other our respective team projects, and discuss possible avenues for collaboration. Hearteningly, members from all three teams felt the meet-up was fruitful, and we made many exciting plans for collaborations!

On 18 July 2018, NUSGEM was privileged to host 2 members from the Jiangnan iGEM team!
The Jiangnan iGEM team members were in Singapore for a summer exchange programme, and they chanced upon our project. They took the initiative and wrote to us about the possibility of a meet-up to share our respective team’s iGEM experience, and learn more about the problems we have encountered, and how we managed to overcome them.
Without hesitation, we agreed to meet up with the Jiangnan iGEM team members! In fact, we were all so excited about the meet-up that we planned an engaging day of activities for our fellow iGEM-ers!
Firstly, we invited them to the BioMakerSpace, which is where our NUSGEM team carries out most of our experiments. At the BioMakerSpace, we brought them on a lab tour, which culminated in a fruitful sharing session on our projects, where we even exchanged solutions on the problems we faced. After the laboratory tour, we brought them on a NUS campus tour, visiting the various libraries (there are more than 6!) in our school, as well as the biofoundry in SynCTI (Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation).

The radius of gyration, which measures a protein’s compactness, indicates that both proteins are stably folded over the 1 ns production run. The plot shows reasonable variation and, along with the RMSD plots, show that both proteins are very stable in explicit solvent solution (Figure 5).
Analysis of the overlaid proteins showed only slight difference after alignment (Figure 6). Closeup of the mutation site shows that the longer side chain of aspartic acid causes the displacement of a loop due to steric hindrance with Leu318 (Figure 7). This displacement translates through the rest of the protein, accounting for some of the variance in RMSD.

This part was designed by Uppsala-Sweden 2011 and is a reporter that constitutively expresses the cjBlue chromoprotein. 2017 Team NYU Abu Dhabi tested this device by observing the development of color in agar and broth cultures.
Experimental Validation
2017 Team NYU Abu Dhabi attempted to express cjBlue in DH5α using composite part BBa_K592022 . Our assembly and transformation protocol were followed in order to obtain the part. All initial, intermediate, and final products obtained throughout the 3A assembly were digested with EcoRI-HF following our digestion protocol and run on a 1.2% agarose gel to confirm that the constructs were of the right size (Figure 1).
However, no blue colonies were observed after 24 hs of incubation in agar and no blue pellet was obtained after centrifuging an overnight LB broth culture at 7000 rpm for 5 min. The reason for the lack of expression remains elusive.
