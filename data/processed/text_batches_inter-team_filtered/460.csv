Testing stamping technique
07.07.2015
Investigating optimal stamping technique:
Pressure (slide 467): 3 stamps StrepCy5 (50 ug/ml) → without pressure (just put on the slide)/pushed very soft/pushed hard - all incubated for ~30s
Incubation time (Slide 303): 3 stamps StrepCy5 (50 ug/ml) → 1 minute / 5 minutes / 30 minutes - all stamps without pressure As can be seen in the platereader pictures, no differences between different pressures or incubationtimes is detectable.
Stamping with different pressures (constant incubation ~1min): Top → no pressure, bottom right → minimum pressure, bottom left → high pressure
Stamping with different incubation time (constant pressure (no pressure): Top → 1 minute, bottom right → 5 minutes. bottom left → 30 minutes
Stamping pIG15_1501 Salmonella antigen
01.07.2015 This experiment focuses on trying to see whether our salmonella antigen (pIG15_1501) is bound by our salmonella antibody (pIG15_1301). pIG15_1501 (Salmonella antigen) eluation 1 was taken from the -80 freezer. When melting the ~10mg/ml tube, we observed that the antigen appeared to be denaturated, hinting that the storage conditions were not tolerated by the protein. The supernatant was used nonetheless, hoping that some protein might still be correctly folded. The antibody (0,5 mg/ml) was diluted 1:2 in PBS.  A plasma-activated slide was used for measurement. A DiaCHIP stamp was incubated with undiluted antigen supernatant. An iGEM stamp was incubated with StrepCY5, an antibody-shaped stamp was incubated with GFP (200µg/ml) for 30 min. After blocking the slide in BSA, a fluorescence measurement was performed to control for correct stamping. The StrepCY5 stamp showed hardly any fluorescence in the plate reader. This indicates bad stamping (wrong pressure, hardly any pressure was applied this time) or faulty StrepCY5.
Anti-Salmonella showed stong unspecific binding to the whole slide, however no binding to the antigen was detected. This doesn't come as a surprise since the antigen appeared to be denaturated. Anti-G"

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Project-content_-_-_TEXT.html," around 10 % between 1990 and 2012 the emissions associated with agricultural activities did not. This is mostly due to the intensification of livestock farming. Methane is set free in the course of digestion in ruminant animals like cattle and emitted into the atmosphere. Therefore, by increasing livestock production methane emissions are increased as well.
Methane is formed in a process called methanogenesis which, for example, takes place in the rumen of cattle. However, the methane is not further utilized by any of the microorganisms living in the animal’s digestive tract nor by the animal itself, so it gets exhaled to the atmosphere and thus contributes to global warming. Read here what has been done in the past against these emissions, or see below to find out how exactly methanogenesis takes place.

The Origin of Methane
Methane from biological sources can originate in various different environments like peat bogs, deep-sea hydrothermal vents and the digestive tracts of animals. Despite this variation there are certain common aspects: All biologically formed methane originates from methanogenic archaea and all these methanogens are strictly anaerobic organisms [1]. However, there is not only one mode of methanogenesis. Some methanogens perform hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis which mostly relies on the reduction of carbon dioxide while hydrogen usually acts as the electron donor. The methylotrophic methanogens, in contrast, are additionally able to use a variety of other compounds for methane generation, for example certain methyl compounds. Lastly, in acetoclastic methanogenesis acetate is used as a substrate for methane formation [2,3].
Hydrogenotrophic methanogens comprise, for example, the order Methanobacteriales and species like Methanobrevibacter ruminantium. Methanosarcinales is the most important order of the methylotrophic methanogens with species"

Background
    Allergy, also known as type I hypersensitivity reaction, is defined as hypersensitivity to substances commonly recognized as harmless, resulting in inflammatory reaction, and symptoms like asthma, rash and running nose, severe allergy can be lethal. These typically harmless substances are called allergens. Allergens are everywhere, people may get exposed to allergens in various ways: direct oral ingestion of food allergens, breathe in airborne allergens like pollens and dust, skin exposure to allergens like latex and the fur or feather of home pets, injection of drugs, or some components in insects' poisons, etc. These years, money spent in combating with allergy is mounting up to astronomical figures. Allergen test is a powerful method to deal with allergy. One will try to avoid exposure to his/her allergens in daily life if their allergens are identified, and their chance to develop allergy will be reduced. That's why most medical centers around the world provide allergen test services.
    As diagramed in figure 1, when a kind of allergen somehow enters the body fluid of someone for the first time, the allergens are captured by antigen presenting cells (APCs), then T cells' recognition of the epitopes presented by APCs, and induces series of signal transduction and cell differentiation events. The overall result is, some of the B cells differentiate into plasma cells, producing IgE specifically targets on different epitopes of these allergens.
Figure 1. The basic mechanism of developing allergy. A: Antigen presenting cells present allergens to T cells via MHCⅡ. B: T cells is induced to differentiate into Th2 cells. C: With the help of Th2 cells, B cells differentiate into plasma cells, secreting specific IgE targets on the allergen. E: IgEs bind to FcεRI receptors in the membrane of basophil granulocytes and mast cells. F: The presence of the allergens induces the crosslink of FcεRI receptors, leads to the release of"
ShanghaitechChina,2016,Team:ShanghaitechChina#Biofilm_-_-_TEXT.html,"System
We want to attach enzyme to biofilm, so we turn to a widely applied linkage system, SpyTag and SpyCatcher, originally discovered from Streptococcus pyogenes. By splitting its fibronectin-binding protein FbaB domain, we obtain a relatively small peptide SpyTag with 13 amino acids and a bigger protein partner, SpyCatcher, with 138 amino acids [6]. The advantage of this system lies in the following three aspects. Firstly, they can spontaneously form a covalently stable bond with each other which guarantee the viability of the permanent linkage. The second point is quick reaction within 10 min, which will stand out by its efficiency in industrial application. Besides, the whole process proceeds in mild condition (room temperature), thus set lower requirement for reaction both in lab and future practice. Therefore, we design to leverage this advantageous system to achieve the binding of biofilm with specific enzyme.
Design
Appending SpyTag to CsgA subunit is a traditional and hackneyed approach to modify biofilm posttranscriptionally. Here, we challenge to attach larger part, SpyCatcher, to CsgA to enrich the versatility of biofilm platform. For one thing, we intend to pioneer new approach. For another aspect is that we concern SpyCatcher is too large that might jeopardize the biological activity and function of the enzyme. After comprehensive consideration, we decide to append SpyTag and SpyCatcher respectively to CsgA subunits and enzyme, and successfully prove their feasibility and stability.
Construction of SpyTag-mCherry
The construction of SpyTag-mCherry, PART BBa_K2132003 , (with SpyTag lying at the N-terminal of mCherry) basically involved two PCR rounds for adding the SpyTag to mCherry. Then the sequence of SpyTag-mCherry was linked to the pET22b(+) backbone between the restriction sites of NdeI, XhoI. This led to the easy induction with IPTG. For more details and the sequencing data, please click the pdf here.
The characterization of  SpyTag-mCherry is below.
Characterization
As figure illustrated, His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag mutant incubated with mCherry-SpyTag show a clear biofilm-associated mcherry fluorescence signal, which indicating the accurate conformation and function of the SpyTag and SpyCatcher linkage system.

Human Practices Overview
Our project encompassed three areas within human practices: research, impact, and outreach. Each allowed us to better understand our project as well as help the community become a part of our experiments. We met with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), lawyers, conventional farmers, professors, environmental scientists, global agriculture specialists, bioethicists, organic farmers, biotechnology companies, and entrepreneurs to change our project based on regulations and professional opinions. We then gathered the thoughts, opinions, and concerns of community members, raised awareness of GMO foods, and invited the community to engage in conversation on a hot topic.
Engaging Experts: GMOs, food, water, drought, and salinity affect much of humanity. Such a far-reaching project required discussions with professionals, ethicists, farmers, and more. Check out our site visit and interviews from professionals who assisted our endeavors.
Responsibility: Developing our science requires responsibility, listening to the farmers, and hearing public concerns. We spoke with hundreds of community members through surveys, discovering their fears and investigating mitigation of public disapproval of GMOs.
Public Engagement: iGEM values and goals led us to reaching out, holding public meetings, and creating a video explaining our project and its importance.
Education: The next generation of scientists must be interested. We held science days at museums and libraries, allowing children to learn more about our project, plants, and synthetic biology.
Collaborations: We collaborated with many teams throughout the course of the project, creating exchanges of information, ideas, and time. We participated in meetups, provided ideas for Human Practices, and even had troubleshooting sessions.

The product may be different from the reactant. It is possible because the reactant may be a complex, such as complex of LacI tetramer and plasmid with promoter LacI (we call it pLacI:LacI4 below). Only the products of the replication reaction will be repressed with a certain rate. In this example, pLacI:LacI4 would not be repressed since it is not among the products of its replication. Via MoDeL language, we design a template reaction with no reactants, two modifiers and one product. The two modifiers are template species containing a certain plasmid backbone (say pSB1A3), and binding state is allowed for both. The product is also a template species containing pSB1A3, however, it has only one chain and no binding is permitted. Hence, modifiers have Chain-Node structure ANY--pSB1A3--ANY, while product has its structure ANYUB--pSB1A3--ANYUB. The listOfTransferTable makes parts transfer from part ANY of either modifier to its corresponding part ANYUB of the product. The reaction rate is <math>-k_{g}C_{mod1}C_{mod2}/C_{max}</math>, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the same as that defined in the replication reaction, <math>C_{max}</math> is the max concentration of plasmids containing pSB1A3 as backbone, and <math>C_{mod1}</math>, <math>C_{mod2}</math> are concentrations of modifier1 and modifier2, respectively. The negative sign in the rate law indicates a repressed effect to the replication of the product.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#News#Alberta Events_-_-_TEXT.html," of the U of C students quickly engaged the audience and drew more and more people to our booth. As team members explained each of the four components of the project, handouts were given out as a supplementary document to those interested in learning more about the successes, goals and achievements of iGEM Calgary’s project.
Later that night, after wrapping up the poster session, the team went back to the hotel to practice for the next day’s PowerPoint presentation. This presentation delves deeper into each of the four components and explains the science behind the project.
On Saturday, by a random draw, the University of Calgary was chosen to lead the PowerPoint presentations. Following the presentation, the entire team went up on the stage to answer questions from the audience. After the three teams had the opportunity to showcase their projects and answer questions, the judges briefly provided general constructive criticisms to all three teams. After lunch, the audience reconvened in the theatre to honor Mr. Jon Lovink, the guest speaker of the event. After his motivational speech, the judges divided themselves among the three teams to individually comment on specific areas of improvement and achievements.
Following another brief break, the awards ceremony was held back at the theatre. Nervousness and anxiety filled the room as each person awaited to hear the results. After the judges reviewed the judging criteria, the University of Calgary was awarded first place for an excellent overall presentation and teamwork. The judges were highly impressed with the amount of effort that was put into making a creative and informative wiki, well-organized handouts and a powerful presentation. A picture session with the aGEM trophy and other aGEM participants immediately followed the ceremony.
After dinner, the teams rejoiced and celebrated their hard work and successes. Although the U of C iGEM team proudly made its mark in Alberta, the race doesn’t end here; the team is now working twice as hard to make U of C stand out at the iGEM Jamboree.

the part plu0840 device is composed of arabinose inducible promoter pBad BBa_I0500 , toxin protein plu0840 coding sequence BBa_K1668006 and composite part mCherry BBa_K1668011 . Here we use the device to tandem express toxic protein Plu0840 and the reporter mCherry in E.coli BL 21(DE3).
Sequence and Features
Characterization
OVERVIEW
We construct the device plu0840 to tandem express insecticidal toxic protein Plu0840 and reporter mCherry. The 72kDa insecticidal toxic protein Plu0840 is used to kill termites in our project.
The exact mechanism of insecticidal toxin protein Plu0840 remains to be revealed. In a 2007 research, scientists first expressed a GST-plu1537 fusion protein in E.coli BL21(DE3) with pGEX-4T-1 vector. The results showed that Plu0840 had weak oral toxicity against two kinds of moth(S. litura and S. exigua)
We clone and standardize the gene into standard plasmid pSB1C3. After confirmation of digestion and sequencing, we transform the plasmid into E.coli BL21(DE3) to achieve better expression level.
We observe that transformants have obviously turned red and figure out the expected protein band in SDS-PAGE. According to in vivo experiments on termites, the toxin effect of Plu0840 is comparatively weak than Plu1537, which is consistent with the research before.
In conclusion, we have successfully cloned and expressed the Plu0840 toxic protein in E.coli BL21(DE3). The Plu0840 is weak toxic to termites.

The metal solution in the syringe was titrated into the peptide solution in the cell, and interactions were measured. Raw data were corrected by subtracting the heats of dilution, and collected data were fit with a one-site binding model using the Origin-7™ software.
ITC Results
The results from the ITC experiment to determine binding parameters for peptides 1x-, 2x-, and 3x-HHTC-Re alongside the predicted structure (QUARK Ab Initio program) follows [2]. This program uses Monte Carlo simulations and knowledge of atomic force fields to construct the most probable structural conformation of a protein from just the linear amino acid sequence.
Figure 3: ITC data for the three HHTC-Re peptides. The binding affinity (Ka) was assessed to determine the strength of the interaction, and the results follow: 1x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.55 ± 0.21) x 106 M-1; 2x-HHTC-Re Ka = (3.73 ± 0.53) x 105 M-1; 3x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.50 ± 0.05) x 105 M-1. Figure design credits to Jesica Urbina.
The binding affinity values in Figure 3 are largely comparable to one another, and we do see a linear trend between the number of HHTC-Re repeats and injections taken to reach saturation, which means that each peptide can bind a linearly increasing amount of copper proportional to the HHTC-Re repeats. This validates our hypothesis underlying our construct design for our fusion proteins, allowing us to bind multiple metals on the same biomolecule. In Figure 4, we can see how the specific subunits maintain proper folding (predicted by QUARK), supporting the notion that they would retain their original functions.
Figure 4: Quark ab initio model of 2x-HHTC-Re with chitin binding domain. Domains within the fusion protein have been annotated to display the conformation and spatial orientation.
After confirming the copper binding of the individual HHTC-Re x n peptides, we then needed to assess whether our fusion protein could bind copper and chitin, and whether it could do so when already saturated with the other substrate. Figure 5 depicts two experiments a) Raw data and b) isotherm for 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD + NaDg and Cu. In this experiment, N-acetyl D-glucosamine (“NaDg”; analogous to"

Plasmids strategy
We are building a system containing TetR and LacI, that control the expression of a selection gene. The sequential use of these two repressors allows us to have a direct activation of the selection gene when TetR binds its recognition sequence.
The selection gene is either RFP or a lysis cassette. RFP allows direct recognition of correctly assembled plasmids, which is also useful to see if the transformation has been efficient. Furthermore, it is an easy way to detect TetR binding. The lysis cassette will be useful for chemostat cultures, allowing us to recover DNA from mutants in which TetR binds to a sequence (either consensus sequence or modified one). We hope that the chemostat chambers will allow high-throughput in vivo selection of our mutants.
We need several plasmids to build our entire system. We chose a 2-plasmid strategy that looks like this:
The TetR plasmid containing TetR under a constitutive promoter
The reporter plasmid containing a reporter gene (either RFP or a lysis device) and a LacI inverter for tetR.

Salt taken up from solution
Salt Uptake
The most promising Salt Vault we created is capable of taking up X times more NaCl than the native wildtype. This Salt Vault with a dry mass of X g/L sequestrates X % NaCl of a      media containing 0.6 M NaCl (35,1g per Liter), which is equal to the average salt content of sea water. A dry mass of X g/L is roughly equal to the concentrations of bacteria in      industrial wastewater treatment plants. Being specific for certain ions, the Salt Vault purifies the water only from wished solvents, in this case NaCl, making it more efficient      than reverse osmosis. With the vision of a microbial supercollector, a huge range of specific pollutants could be removed from differing wastewaters.
Salt Vault and Membrane Technology
The use of a genetically modified organism raises the question how to separate the yeast from water. The answer is membrane technology - the much more energy- and maintenance-efficient micro-      or ultrafiltration, which guarantees complete separation of the yeast from the purified water.

While membranes for reverse osmosis have an average pore size of 0.4nm, membranes capable for separating yeast are either microfiltration membranes with an average pore size            of 0.4µm or ultrafiltration membranes with a pore size of 0.04µm [1]. Yeast cells have a diameter of 2-10µm, meaning that microfiltration could be used for separation. However,            ultrafiltration is well-established in wastewater treatment plants using membrane technology to hold back microbes like antibiotic"

Creating and designing iGEM wikis can be a difficult and time consuming task. We developed the Wiki Wizard as we believe that teams would benefit from an easier way to create and design their wiki. The Wiki Wizard is a content management system (CMS) that allows the user to create and edit pages easily. It includes functions such as: name spacing pages and files, referene list for a page, and a preview of the wiki that can be seen by clicking on the ’Team main page’ link in the menu. Most importantly, the Wiki Wizard allows users to create wikis that are in compliance with the wiki standards specified by iGEM.
You can find it and an installation guide here:  GitHub
Wiki creation
With our wiki wizard you can choose an existing theme, upload a theme made by someone else, or create your own theme. The tool is based on Flask and it uses the Jinja engine for loading of templates. By default, the Wiki Wizard uses a bootstrap theme and creates pages corresponding to the standard iGEM pages.
Content
Page
In the Wiki Wizard, a page is a container for one or more sections in which the page content is written. A page can also be assigned an image, template, position, name, and url.
The template determines the overall layout of the page.
T​he image is a setting that themes can use for page specific images.
Position determines the order of pages in the menu unless the menu is specified in menu (see below).

In his postdoctoral work, he focused in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy targeting the cell-surface glycans axis of immune modulation.
Delving into the world of unnatural amino acids was a first for our iGEM team, so naturally we had a lot of questions about how to proceed. Han Xiao gracefully answered these questions and provided us with insight into the various problems we could face during our project.
With his help, we were able to best determine the critical elements of our experiments. We identified the steps which would require the most care and precision, as well as which transformation strategies to pursue.

Professor Lang conducts research in the interdisciplinary area of chemical biology, applying concepts from organic chemistry to develop new tools to study fundamental biological questions. Her research focuses on the targeted chemical synthesis of new artificial biomolecules (amino acids, proteins, nucleotides, oligonucleotides) tailored to investigate and manipulate complex cellular processes in in vitro and in vivo biological systems.              During the European meet-up hosted by the iGEM Munich team, she presented her works on UnAAs and their use in enzymology. We then had the opportunity to meet Pr. Lang and to receive her advice concerning our project, after showing her our poster.
This was a great boosting event for us. We liked her comment: “There’s no reason for it not to work”! Her comments on our general design also helped us progress further in our project.

We met Mr. Serp to get advice on an idea we had about using graphene to functionalise cellulose. Thanks to his advice, we have been able to modify our project to optimize our chances of success. Initially starting with the use of oxidized graphene in our project, we have, as he suggested, changed to non-oxidized graphene. He also helped us to optimize our functionalisation protocols with the assistance of Jerome Volkman, an organic chemist. They were kind enough to               allow us to experiment in their laboratory to functionalise graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Indeed, we succeeded in adding an alkyne"

The teams were able to successfully follow our protocol and ended up with the desired circuit. In the process, they also had a great time. According to an email from the University of Pittsburgh they “had a lot of fun gathering preliminary data” and enjoyed the novelty of the new assembly. Below is a photo from the University of Pittsburgh's gel once the transcriptional units had been created.
Figure 1. Results of the gel electrophoresis from the University of Pittsburgh. Each synthesized transcriptional unit was the expected size.
UVirginia also appreciated the ease and simplicity of our 3G assembly method. They especially liked that the reaction volumes were small so that reagents were conserved. The team was able to successfully characterize two different RBS variants of a circuit they had built with mscarlet with different RBS parts. Below is the graph of their results. As demonstrated, both circuits have fluorescent in line with their s characterization.
Figure 2: UVA circuit testing results: Each dot represents the relative fluorescence of an independent biological replicate compared to the geometric mean of B0034. The line represents the geometric mean of 3 independent biological replicates.
Both teams also gave us invaluable feedback in helping us determine that the CDS of our sfGFP 3G part was nonfunctional. We were able to quickly resolve this issue. UVA also helped us tremendously by sending us some of their own parts to place on 3G backbones. Our team hopes to eventually create a library of 3G parts for all iGEM teams to use for rapid DNA assembly.

UVA loved our cute packaging: “I just received the kit! I have to say that its very aesthetically pleasing, with a nice note on the back as well.” Thanks, University of Virginia and University of Pittsburgh for all your help!

Iron Frog
SuperHero, Mascot and Frog
Iron Frog has joined iGEM Evry 2013 team to support the Iron Coli Project. However, its true identity remains unknown . Some pretends that it always yells “Yes, call me Iron Chassis” , while other rumors says that its catchphrase is “I’m not an Iron Chassis, I’m a free frog !” .
The only certain fact is that it likes French wines.

May festival
We joined an annual meetup which became to be an official event of iGEM at the Tokyo University. Our team introduced our last year’s and this year’s projects. At the meetup, we made a presentation with a poster to the visitor. The age group of visitors were so wide from students of elementary school to senior. So, the event was contributed to recognize the existence of iGEM. We were so surprised at other team’s power of idea though iGEM Japan had the meetup at May 20th. It was so excited to exchange idea and point out each other about the project with other teams.

In summary, with novel and efficient methods to create human iPSC, the futuristic vision of personalized medicine and in-vivo tissue regeneration has entered the next stage. Only to mention a few perspectives: from organ transplantations without the risk of severe immune rejections, via pancreatic cell recovery for diabetics, to therapies of certain myeloma types - great hope is being raised by the above mentioned technologies.

Tissue engineering
The idea of engineered tissues emerged in the mid 1980s to solve the problem of donor-shortage. Nowadays, the field of tissue engineering unifies the work of many life-sciences disciplines, e.g. developemental biology, synthetic biology, systems biology, nanotechnology in terms of scaffold production and many more. Engineered tissues can take many forms, from simple aggregations up to whole organs there is a cornucopia of possibilities. Newly grown tissues can be constructed from donor cells given by the patient leading to great compatibility making the lifelong uptake of immunsuppressiva unnecessary.  But these developments are still in their infancy, although first clinical tests generated promising results [5] .
“… in the near future, human tissue - such as skin or heart - could be renewed by stem cell reprogramming. Theoretically, signaling pathways can be elegantly routed by introducing RNAs - one of them coding for a dCas9-effector - into cells of a patient..."" - Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Driever"

Düsseldorf
The iGEM team Düsseldorf is participating in iGEM for the first time this year. This newly formed team consists of highly motivated mostly undergraduate students. Their big challenge is to overcome all issues of the first participation in iGEM. They had to establish iGEM at the Heinrich Heine-University Düsseldorf https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/startseite.html . Due to the Bielefelder experience in iGEM, they asked us about advice during the beginning of the season. Because the Bielefeld-CeBitec teams participated in iGEM since 2010, we have already a lot of experience with the competition. There are many former participants we can ask for help on things like: “How to write the wiki efficiently and well?” or “How do we register?”. Therefore, we gladly agreed on helping the iGEM team Düsseldorf getting started. They visited us on 10.02.2016 in Bielefeld for a tutorial about Gibson assembly.
Another topic of this discussion was the assembly of BioBricks, especially we talked about what has to be considered in"

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"

Problems with the approach
Looking at figure 1, we can see that there is an element of cofactor inhibition of the enzyme that this model does not take into account. In order for the enzyme to convert DHT to \(3\alpha  - diol\) (or vice versa), the specific cofactor of the reaction has to be connected to the enzyme, transforming it so it can bind only to the substrate or product. As we will see later, in order for a Michaelis-Menten reversible reaction to occur, both cofactor levels need to be high and at a certain ratio. The fact that this assumption may not be correct is one of the main reasons we chose to overproduce NADPH as a part of our project"

Therefore, we decided to describe our general feeling after having met the experts and discussed the above-mentioned topics. It now appears essential to us that future scientists should be taught how to discuss their work, how to share it with other experts as well as the general public in an interactive way. Also, some form of self-questioning should always be entertained by the scientist as he/she is working, as captivating as his/her work can be. This should also include an open mindedness to criticism coming from experts in other fields such as humanities. From our point of view, the scientist should not be the only one able to foresee the consequences of his/her research. Though “ignorance of the law is no excuse”, setting up courses about the current state of legislation in the fields of research that young scientists will be exploring could help them put things into perspective. In a few words, it is all about making Science a little less about technicalities and a little more about social awareness.

Highschool students' visit
Start of the day
Since iGEM is encouraging young students to get into the lab and engage in innovative ideas using synthetic biology, our aim for this day was to get this mindset across to highschool students. In order to do so, we contacted three different schools in our region. The Gymnase d’Yverdon, Collège de Candolle and Gymnase du Bugnon keenly sent us students interested in biology and eager to find out about synthetic biology.
In fact, we found out that, even though the students had advanced biology courses, the material taught does not always include synthetic biology. Throughout the day, we did our best to show these students a different side of the field of biology and convince"

Introduction
We design and develop a software tool, iGame, which supports database written in MoDeL format, to perform task of automatic modeling. Actually, automatic modeling is a database-dependent network-searching-and-developing process from the initial conditions. Besides the database, users are required to provide initial environment condition, such as initial plasmids with biobrick parts. iGame will generate the network of the biological system in SBML standard. Please refer to User_Interface to know more about input and output of iGame.
Algorithms for automatic modeling will be shown in the following sections. An overview is as follow:
Section Algorithm flow chart gives an overall description of the general framework of our algorithms;
Section Special reactions and volume strategy tells details about the methods and strategies our program utilizes to handle with some special reactions;
Section Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme provides details of sorting as well as weighting scheme and their functions;
Section Structural pattern match of template species provides details of the core algorithm of iGame: how to find matchings between template species defined in database and species existed in the bio-system;
Section Generation of products based on reaction templates describes the mix-trim-split method to generate products.
Algorithm flow chart
Before stating our own algorithm, we will first make an analysis about the difference and difficulty brought by introducing a new language system. The general algorithm idea is common: find out all species and reactions between them. Ignoring the efficiency of program, the most obvious method is doing the following recursively until no more species is generated:
find reactions between species have been found and generate products as new species
Similar idea applies to our program. Some modifications must be made because in other software tools, reaction-searching is name-based. However, in our program, it is structure-based. Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which"

Now that we completed the design of our detection tool, we needed to look at how we could make the sample preparation as simple as possible for a farmer, as farmers like to do most things themselves.
We try to do most things by ourselves to prevent high bills from the veterinarian.
Tjerkje Poppinga (dairy farmer)
In the case of mastitis, the pathogen is present in the milk of the infected cow. By hitting the books and optimising existing protocols, we came up with an easy method to prepare a fresh milk sample for the detection tool. To know more about which methods we came up with, look at our sample prep design page where we describe this extensively.
Finally, our integrated human practices strategy helped us to think a step further about our design, regarding, for example, the costs involved in our device and what it should actually look like; what kind of ‘kit’ will it be and what will it contain? We also looked at the feasibility of our device in the context of whether or not farmers would actually be allowed to use such a device and what needs to be done considering legislation to make this possible.
Only veterinarians can prescribe or change antibiotic treatments.
Engeline van Duijkeren (veterinarian)
Stakeholder interactions shaped our final design and made it feasible to transform our detection method into an application, resulting in a toolbox with which the farmers can perform the resistance test themselves on-site, instead of being dependent on slow lab processes. Simple, cheap and safe methods - for example the hand-powered centrifuge and boiling method during sample preparation, together with an optimized readout - make our device applicable for rapid frontline diagnostics. We developed our toolbox to detect the most relevant multiple antibiotic resistance genes, expanding the impact of our product to achieve better animal and human treatment strategies, see our applied design page for more info!"
Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#humanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," of the commons” in Science in 1968, the negative arguments he gave against the commons have tarnished it. Hardin postulates that one pursues its own interest and as a consequence if a resource (e.g. a pasture) were to be exploited freely by anyone, it would rapidly be destroyed as everybody would try to take the best slice out of it. Hardin concludes : “Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.”
However, Elinor Ostrom's (1933-2012) work, which led her to win the Nobel prize in economics in 2009, broadened the economists' mind on this particular topic.
The new commons
Ostrom emphasizes the fact that Hardin “was actually discussing open access rather than managed commons” (Hess & Ostrom, 2006). Using this argument among others, she pointed out the weaknesses of Hardin's thinking : contrary to his theory, a lot of resources have been responsibly managed as communal goods over many centuries in Europe, before being privatized through the “enclosure” movement from the 15th to the 18th century.
Her study made her precise the commons' concept. Throughout many examples, she ended up characterizing it as a “jointly owned legal set of rights”. Besides, in contrast to Hardin who offered only two solutions (privatization or nationalization) to the supposed “tragedy of the commons”, she distinguished this form of property and management of resources from both traditional private (market, companies) and public (planning, State) economic approaches: each community managing a commons fixes its own rules by defining a governance frameworkl and some “bundles of rights”. The latter which specifies the access, withdrawal, management, exclusion and alienation rights are distributed to the different actors exploiting the resource in order to manage it jointly, and efficiently according to a defined hierarchy.
Ostrom insisted on the uniqueness of every case of commons she (or her students) studied. Nevertheless she succeeded in identifying a set of founding principles each sustainable commons fits.
“clearly defined boundaries should be in place
rules in use are well matched to local needs and conditions
individuals affected by these rules can usually participate in modifying the rules
the right of community members to devise their own rules is respected by external authorities
a system for self-monitoring members’ behavior has been established
a graduated system of sanctions is available
community members have access to low-cost conflict-resolution mechanisms""
Conclusion"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," proposed, that there are many ways to further optimize the pathway and direct the flow towards a high product titer.   Hence, implementing many variations of this pathway into V. natriegens and testing them in a fast manner promises a wealth  of knowledge about pathway optimization and general principles of metabolic engineering.
Figure 2: Pathway we have chosen for our metabolic engineering efforts.
The first relevant enzyme in the pathway is the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc) that catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. It is involved in fatty acid biosynthesis,consisting of four subunits in E. coli, a biotin-carboxylase (BC), a biotin-carboxyl-carrier-protein domain (BCCP) and two carboxyltransferase subunits (CT) (Jansen et al.2004) .     During catalysis, a biotin molecule is first linked to a lysine residue in the BCCP domain.   Via ATP-hydrolysis the BC domain carboxylates the biotin, which then induces a conformational change and brings the carboxy-group into close proximity of the CT domain. Finally, the CT domain transfers the carboxy-group to the acetyl-CoA, leading to the formation of malonyl-CoA (Lee et al.2008) The subunits are organized in four genes in E. coli (Rathnasingh et al.2012) , however, in other organisms like C. glutamicum the genes are located in two operons (Gande et al.2007) .
Figure 3: Mechanism of ACC
The second relevant enzyme in the pathway is the malonyl-CoA reductase (Mcr), which is involved in CO2 fixation by the 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle in thermophilic bacteria (Alber et al.2002) .    It is a 132kDa large, bifunctional enzyme with alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase function. The C-terminal domain catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of malonyl-CoA into 3-oxopropanoic acid, while the N-terminal domain catalyzes consecutive reduction of 3-oxopropanoic acid to 3-hydroxypropionate (Liu et al.2013) .

Stage 1
The initial stage of the collaboration focused on determining what goals we would aim to achieve over the course of the summer. A key component of this meeting was a discussion regarding transferring the BostonU team’s biological protocol onto a chip. If possible, we wanted to automate their entire testing procedure on a single chip and have five samples prepared for plate reading simultaneously. The second objective of the collaboration was to have this design incorporated into the MARS Repository and be accessible for iterations or adaptation even after the collaboration ended. With this in mind, we moved on to the design and test stage.
Stage 2
Before beginning the design stage, we wanted to ensure that our microfluidic chips could be read within a plate reader. Following a consultation with the synthetic biologists working in the BDC, there were no obvious detriments to using polycarbonate inside a plate reader. In order to test this, we milled a mini chip with the same well spacing and depths as a 94 well plate. This was inserted into a 3D printed skirt and placed inside the plate reader. GFP was filled inside the milled wells of the chips in various patterns and the plate reader’s results analyzed for any discrepancies. The results indicated that the chip could be read accurately toward the center of the chip with increasing inaccuracies at the periphery. This was incorporated in the future designs.
The initial designs for this chips focused on a few key features:
Using shared inputs to decrease the chip’s complexity
Utilizing valves in order to create a complete seal between chambers
Determining how to measure volume of liquid dispensed
Avoiding leaks to prevent contamination
After a number of iterations, another meeting was held with the BostonU Wetlab team in order to discuss progress on the design. It was concluded that performing all five tests on a single chip would not be feasible given the time constraints. As a result, their biological protocol was adapted to suit the limits of our chip design abilities. This included cutting down the samples run to a single test.
The final design integrated a chamber designed to fit the dimensions and depth of a well from a 96-plate reader. It also utilized our new metering primitive in order to ensure accurate ratio volumes of liquid would be dispensed while running the protocol. In order to make the design easier to use for the BostonU team, the control layer’s inputs were shared as much as possible.

High resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy
In order to obtain high resolution confocal fluorescence images from our receptor constructs, Neuro-2a (N2a) mouse neuroblastoma cells were transfected with the respective plasmids according to standard protocols. Shortly before the end of the project, Christoph came up with the idea to include a trafficking signal to the C-terminus of the receptor proteins that is described to increase the surface presentation of receptors by sorting them intracellularly towards the cell membrane, the sequence being KSRITSEGEYIPLDQIDINV GG FCYENEV* (consisting of the trafficking signal, a two amino acid linker, an ER export signal and the stop codon, DNA sequence aagagcaggatcaccagcgaggg cgagtacatccccctggaccagatcgacatcaacgtg ggcgg cttctgctacgagaacgaggtgtaa) [22] . The sequence was inserted into the previously assembled receptor BioBrick using PCR-based cloning. After the transfection of the receptor plasmids, cells were stained with the following dyes for confocal fluorescence microscopy: Hoechst dye for the nuclear staining at 405 nm; Alexa488-bioting to stain biotin binding proteins; mRuby3 which is a part of the receptor and is expected to show a membrane localization and Dy634-antiA3C5-Fab. Staining was followed by three washing steps with PBS. Subsequently, cells were mounted on a confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica). The results for each fluorescence channel are given in figure 11.

Dilek Gülsima Usluer (Belieber): I am Dilek Gulsima Usluer and I am a four year student of Molecular Biology and Genetics department of Istanbul Technical University. I am working in both wet lab and human practice divisions of ITU_MOBGAM team. I always believe that there are too many things to do and much more things to learn in the world of science. This is why I wanted to be involved in an IGEM project. With the help of IGEM competition, I have met with a new field of biology, synthetic biology. I have also learned how a project can be constructed. Moreover, experiencing the team work with such a lovely team was priceless. I think IGEM competition is worth to try even if you are not deeply interested with the field of synthetic biology. As I said above, there are too many things to do and much more things to learn.
Güleycan Lütfullahoğlu: I am Güleycan Lutfullahoğlu. When we started this project, I was a second grade student, with a little knowledge, but now, I am starting third grade with much more experience. We, second grades, take part mostly in the human practice project, making videos, arranging meetings and making street interviews. It was a lot of fun to observe the reaction of people about synthetic biology. It was also a lot of experience for me to take part in the lab as an assistant as much as possible. It was so nice to contribute to the team this year and I am also looking forward to enjoying  the next year with much more knowledge.
Güliz Otkıran: I am appreciated IGEM to provide us to contribute our vision,  keep alive our scientific attention and promote the science and give oppurtunity to explore the project source which grows year by year, however I found  the fees as restrictor to motive the youth to science. To introduce myself microbiology, immunology, human genome, evolution and neuroscience  are the topics that interest me more. Other than these, any kind of art, especially painting and drawing, comics, anime, heavy metal – not the element but music one – , far eastern cuisine and classical literature novels are enough to entertain me in my social life.

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Seminar_-_-_TEXT.html," the project of the iGEM Evry-Genopole team. So, during summer, we enthusiastically spread a survey to around 500 contacts that our regional associations have. Indeed, how could we not respond to the solicitation of these students, when their project aims to improve the life quality of hemochromatosis patients, who have still no pharmaceutical treatment, and are bled like in the time of Molière? What a fortunate initiative!
The 4th of September 2013, I had the pleasure, as President of the FFAMH (French Federation of Hemochromatosis Patients' Associations), to be invited to come and meet with this very nice multidisciplinary team. They were very motivated and willing to go as far as the iGEM final in Boston. They were asking for advice, and they presented their project to us.
The seminar of the 18th of September was a great success. The most renowned researchers in the field of iron metabolism were present: Dr. Gaël Nicolas from Cochin Institut, Pr. Pierre Brissot - coordinator of the Center of reference of rare iron iron overloads -, Dr. Marie-Paule Roth from Toulouse Inserm. The specialists were given the floor before the project was presented by the team to the physicians, researchers and patients invited to this exceptional day.
If some of the aspects of the presentations were sometimes too hard to understand for the patients, particularly during the presentation of Dr. Marie-Paule Roth about the link between HFE gene and hepcidin, the presentations enable us to understand that despite the discovery of hepcidin - key regulator of iron homeostasis - no pharmaceutical firm tried to produce this complex molecule yet. The presentation of the microbiome by Dr. Nicolas Pollet, introduce us to an unknown world. We were far from imagining that our digestion system contained between 500 and 1000 different bacteria, and that they impact our health. We ignored also that the bacteria love iron very much…
So, thinking of a bacterial treatment in substitution of bloodletting, this was to us a very innovative perspective.
As, in the FFAMH, we never thought about bloodletting in the perspective of a new treatment, we learned something important through the survey: the more the patients are experienced with their disease, the less they are ready to change their treatment.
The FFAMH thanks these students very much for their interest in hemochromatosis, and wishes them the success they earned in Boston.

Problem 1: Geometry of microneedles
TIP:
Insertion force can be independent of the wall thickness
Fracture force increases with increasing wall thickness and increases with wall angle, also independent of tip radius
Side opened microneedles instead of standard tip microneedles – prevents tissue clog during insertion
High needle density can increase fluid flow rate
Sharper needles require less force for insertion, but has reduce needle tip strength
Microneedle needs to be 10-15 um but shorter than 50-100 um to avoid pain
Best option: small tip radius, large wall thickness
BODY:
Cylinder: eliminate stress concentrations, stronger needle structure, better self-adhesion
Problem 2: Material for microneedles
Single crystalline silicon: high resistance to bending, can be fragile
Metal – greater strength, but thin metals are soft
Problem 3: Application/removal
Application: Elastic nature of skin creates possibility of non-uniform contact of the array with the skin - an issue for correctly metering dosages
Has to find out which area of the skin where the least strain happens
Removal: Leakage when microneedle patch is removed

Future design testing:
Test the proposed design with skin (animal skin?)
Change diameter of hole - how much more different is the flow
Heat of finger - enough to stimulate it?
Diffusion works?
Failure load (at what pressure does the needle break?)

Following transformation and plating we selected several colonies of each colour that showed good colour intensity and reasonable size. These were then sequenced to determine which promoter they were using. Promoters meeting the above criteria were: Pr-3 (amilGFP, RFP, not AmilCP), Pr-Lac and Pr-Tet (all 3 colours). Since Pr-3 was not found among the blue isolates we Chose are original construct under Pr-2 and the calculated RBS. The resulting colour cassettes have been submitted as BBa_K879311 (red), using promoter 3 and the B0034 RBS, BBa_K879313 (yellow), also using promoter 3 and the B0034 RBS,  and BBa_K879222 (blue), using promoter 2 and the RBS engineered for amilCP.
                       
Fig 1. Colour quality. Shown is the range of colour development  for our submitted parts, BBa_K879222 containing amilCP (blue), BBa_K879313 containing amilGFP (yellow under visible light/green under UV light) and BBa_K879311 RFP (red) under different growth and light conditions. Each pigment gene is driven from a constitutive promoter. Complete descriptions can be found under Parts . The pellet colours shown in the bottom-right panel are derived from the overnight cultures shown above. Note that amilCP is not a fluorecent chromophore- too bad!
Our first attempt at switching colours on and off
For our first try at colour regulation we placed the RFP gene onto pS1C3 under the control of the synthetic LacI inducible promoter previously described by Sidney et. al (2007). Here the LacI operator has been trimmed to 17 bp that sits between the -10 and -35 region of the promoter. The gene for LacI was positioned downstream of RFP using the standard biobrick assembly method. LacI and was expressed constitutively from a moderate strength promoter (Pr-3 see Figure 2 in Parts ). When we examined colour expression of this construct in either liquid culture or as colonies on plates, the results were very disappointing. In the presence of the recommended concentrations of IPTG (0.1mM) only pale pink was observed. The colour was only slightly improved in the presence of 1.0 mM IPTG! A closer look at the literature"

5.2 Function-topology maps
The rewirable circuit can be user-defined. First, we define the functions that are used to solve some problems. Be sure that these functions can be represented by some quantitative features. For each function, you should construct a fitness function based on the quantitative features. Then we enumerate the completed topological space. For each topology, a lot of parameter sets are sampled using the Latin hypercube sampling method. We calculate different fitness functions for each topology and get a function-topology table.

What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Over a lifetime there are only so many moments where you can join a force of good and become a part of something greater than ourselves. There is a divine message in the code of life - Mankind will be united, we will see past our differences, diseases shall be cured, species shall be saved, Mother Nature shall be defended. In the name of synthetic biology shall we march bravely down not the easiest path, but one that’s true.
Which historical figure would you prefer to be haunted by?
My past self. So I can be constantly reminded of my mistakes, as well as the times I’ve bathed in glory.
What did you work on during the project?
Apart from providing the team with moral support and good mood, I helped organize the team through my position in the administrative group. I also organized team-building events. Academically, I helped to make the first version of our codon optimization algorithm, and led the genome-scale modelling efforts.

How do you want your remains dealt with when you die?
Forget about burial or burning. I want to have my name (or possibly nickname) engraved in the forehead of my skull, and then have it preserved in a glass case. That way I will still be among my descendants, so they always can consult me.
What did you work on during the project?
I programmed the microfermentation platform, helped with exploring codon optimization theory. I helped the other members establish a mathematical understanding and interpretation of genome-scale modeling and phenotype phase planes. I wrote the code for extending the genome-scale model of Y. lipolytica with the beta-carotene pathway.

UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," had a bug part in this mess…
We threw away antibiotics, plates, cells, LB, transformation buffer, glycerol…everything!
It was really hard to eradicate it, but finally we won and get back to normal…
(T7 and B0010 in platform were confirmed by sequencing)
Week 12 (08/06 – 08/12)
My tests continue with even more likeable results. Our interpretation seems to be correct. Ross also confirms my protein is being expressed by fluorescence.
It’s time to start to amplify the confirmed Parts, giving priority to those in the Submission vector. We set August 15th as the deadline to finish reamplifying.
To avoid confusion and mistakes, I transform a Part a day, so I always have to do overnight cultures or minipreps of different constructs on any day of this this week. By Friday I have one left to do, which I leave for next week.
To use a relevant expression, this week we set a milestone of our project: we start to put cells on marble samples. I put induced and not induced cells of 1025, 1035 and empty grown for 4h in both MOPS A and B on a marble slide and cover it with a gel matrix Ross optimized. We leave it overnight. I also immerse half of a marble piece in induced 1035 cultures.
Truth being told, for me it’s a bad week. My Mac is sick. I need to go home to know what’s wrong, but I think the hard drive failed or the RAM got corrupted. In the meantime Sheref lends me an old Mac from his lab.
Too bad I can’t install nor Lightroom nor Espresso, the software I need for      photos and to build the website. I still have my iPad, so I can easily keep tracking my experiments and write this very journal.
On Thursday I have a meeting with Cristina and Sheref to update them on      my results and decide if I need to gather more data to put on the presentation for the Jamboree. It’s not the case, we decide. I should focus on experiments on statues from now on. We also make an outline of what will be my thesis.
The same evening I jot down a more detailed outline with OmniOutliner      and I am happy with the result. Next month is gonna be a tough ride.
My presence in the lab at 4.45am in the morning of Monday was totally useless, because even this time my attempt of construction of K731600 miserably failed. I cannot stand this part anymore.

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#Submitted_-_-_TEXT.html,"6K ori are only replicated in pir+ or pir116 E. coli strains. Once a receptor with high sensitivity for a screened substance is found, the plasmids are isolated and transformed to e.g. E. coli TOP10. Because the R6K ori does not work in this strain because it is not a pir+ / pir116 strain, it is easy to separate the mutated virA BioBrick from the screening plasmid.

Reporter constructs
The reporter constructs are similar to the virA screening construct (compare fig. 2) but instead of the antibiotic resistance they carry a reporter gene. The amount of produced reporter shows the activity of the VirA receptor and the vir promoter, respectively. If the original vir promoter is too weak, we will use Cambridge's sensitivity tuners to increase the output signal of our biosensor ( Cambridge, 2007 ).

The characterization constructs are like the reporter constructs but a virA gene under the control of a constitutive promoter is assembled before them. These constructs are used to characterize the natural, unmutated VirA/G signaling system and the vir promoter, respectively. The natural system is induced with acetosyringone and the readout is measured to determine the behaviour of the VirA/G signaling system.

Primers for the PCR are provided (primer sequences can be found here ). This PCR product is sent for     sequencing. The received sequence can be copy pasted to our     decoding program.

Characterization of the BioBricks ( BBa_K1913011 ) B12 biosensor and ( BBa_K1913012 ) guanine biosensor from the iGEM team Wageningen 2016
The aim of the Wageningen iGEM 2016 project is to construct an Escherichia coli strain that effectively kills the mite Varroa     destructor within a bee hive. One step towards this goal is the     design of a system that regulates gene expression upon presence of     the V. destructor mite, which is indicated with an increase of     vitamin B12 and guanine concentration. Vitamin B12 and guanine     riboswitches are used to design two constructs that provides E.     coli with a plasmid that regulates gene expression based on the     vitamin B12 or guanine concentration. For the design, the sequence     of the btuB gene vitamin B12 riboswitch of E. coli and the sequence     of the xpt-buX operon guanine riboswitch were used. The sequences     have been elongated with fifty amino acids downstream of the     riboswitch in the original genomic sequence of B. subtilis and E.     coli to potentially increase the     stability. It is followed by the sequence of the TetR"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Killswitch#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html," inducer compound is not present.  The frequently used lacI promoter has similar problems when not used in conjunction with strong plasmid-mediated expression of lacI.  This can be seen in our electrochemical characterization of the UidA hydrolase enzyme ( BBa_K902002 ) shown here.  Tight control is not only a problem for kill switch application, but for any application requiring strict regulation.  As such, we decided that expanding the registry repertoire of control elements would be useful for our system as well as a variety of other applications. Therefore we added a new level of regulation in addition to the promoter, a riboswitch.
Introducing the Riboswitch
Riboswitches are small pieces of mRNA which bind ligands to modify translation of downstream genes.  These sites are engineered into circuits by replacing traditional ribosome binding sites with riboswitches. The riboswitch is able to bind its respective ligand to inhibit or promote binding of translational machinery (Vitreschak et al, 2004). Riboswitches can be used in tandem with an appropriate promoter to enable tighter control of gene expression. Given this opportunity for control, and that ligands for riboswitches are often inexpensive small ions, these methods might be a feasible solution for controlling the kill switch in our industrial bioreactor.
Figure 1: A simple diagram illustrating the riboswitch and the three metabolite, magnesium, manganese and molybdenum, we have tested.
We explored 3 different riboswitches, each responsive to a different metabolite (magnesium, manganese or molybdate co-factor) that would be inexpensive to implement into a bioreactor environment.  Additionally, we also investigated a repressible and inducible promoter, responsive to glucose and rhamnose respectively.
The general approach taken to build the system was constructing the promoter with the respective riboswitch followed by the kill genes.
Magnesium riboswitch
The magnesium riboswitch that we looked at is repressed in the presence of magnesium ions. This system has two control components – a promoter and a riboswitch. Normally the magnesium (mgtA) promoter ( BBa_K902009 ) and the magnesium (mgtA) riboswitch ( BBa_K902009 ) are activated if there is a deficiency of magnesium in the cell (Groisman, 2001). The sequence of the mgtA promoter and riboswitch was obtained from Winnie and Groisman. A lack of magnesium activates other genes in E. coli to allow influx of"

This is a review of several enzymes shown to be effective in degrading biofilms and/or destroying bacteria
There are two main types of enzymes used to degrade biofilms: proteases and amylases. This is because biofilms are primarily a mixture of proteins and polysaccharides.
The list of effective enzymes in this review could help us supplement our list of potential enzymes to use

Set up overnights (O/Ns) of cholera in 4 mL LB at room temperature, 30 C, and 37 C. All samples set up without shaking and with control blanks. We will see which environment provides the best biofilm growth.
Last year's team only cloned in two enzymes to test for biofilm degradation, Cytr and AmyA. We took samples of the plasmids containing those  enzymes and prepared them for sequencing. Used pIB85 (forward) and  pIB86 (reverse ) primers. There are four samples to be sequenced. For each sample, 2 μL of plasmid and 1 μL of primer was used. The prepared samples were sent to be sequenced for us to determine if our plasmids are ready to go.
Streaked cholera on LB plate in 30 C incubator.
Possible additional enzymes to test:
Subtilisins - produced by Bacillus sp., are serine proteases that hydrolyze adhesins. Shown to remove biofilms of several bacteria, but not yet tested on cholera specifically.
Dispersin B - produced by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Combining with proteases, DNAases, and glycolytic enzymes enhances biofilm removal.

As China is a large country with 1.3 billion people, China actively researched on ways to use biotechnology to produce efficient crop field and increase the yield. The most famous instance is the super hybrid rice developed by Dr Yuan, Longping in 1975, which significantly increased the income of Chinese farmer and moreover, has successfully supported 1/5 of the total world population with only 7.2% cultivated area in the world (Gan, 2009).
Medical science biotechnology
Chinese also used biotechnology in medical science to help developing medical treatment and public health. From 1959 to 1965, numerous Chinese researchers focused on synthesis of bovine insulin and successfully accomplished their research. The paper about artificial synthesis of bovine insulin was published to Science in China in April, 1966. This is a hallmark of synthetic biology in China, since the research is a symbol of the era when China started to synthesize protein manually (“新中国档案: 我国首次人工合成结晶牛胰岛素蛋白”, 2009).
Chinese government also invests a large amount of money on medical science to create new, efficient and safe genetic drugs and vaccines. Nowadays, genetic drugs and antibody drugs are replacing the less specific chemotherapy to cure cancer patients. Along with his trend, the rising consumption power and health awareness of the public stimulate the government to actively develop the vaccine market.
Biological pharmacy industry
The import and export volume of China's biopharmaceutical products was US$ 377 million in 2007. This value represents 48% increase from 2006. In 2007, the import volume reached US$ 336 million and the export volume was US$ 41 million. The growth rate of export volume in 2007 had declined from the level of 58% in 2006 to 26% in 2007. Although the export of Chinese biopharmaceutical industry constantly kept a high growth rate, the volume was still very small compared with the import volume. This sharp contrast indicated that China's biopharmaceutical products accounted for a very low market ratio in international market (""Market report on,"" 2009).
Biotechnology Industry Funding
Chinese government plays an important role in providing funds. The current funding for R&D of Synthetic Biology in China is mainly through the government's National High-tech Research and Development Project, National Program on Key Basic Research Project, and National Science Foundation of China (NSFC). Chinese government officials plan to grow R&D spending from 1."

Math Book : CRISPR Interference
Overview

Sensitivity
We decided to create a model of the CRISPRi system for two main reasons:
Identifying the parts of the network that could be targeted by our lab team to improve repression efficiency
To approximate time-series mecA repression data for use in modelling the overall vulnerability of a S. aureus population
Model Formation
After a literature review we were able to construct the CRISPR interference system network. The targeted single guide RNA (sgRNA) associates with nuclease-deficient Cas9 protein (dCas9) to form a complex that binds with the DNA complementary to the sgRNA target (Qi et al., 2013). The bound complex prevents transcription elongation by RNA polymerase, repressing YFP mRNA expression (Bikard et al., 2013). The chemical network is shown below:
Using standard mass-action kinetics, the network simplifies into the following set of differential equations:
We chose the model kinetics to be largely first-order; this decision was supported by the findings of several recent studies (Sternberg et al., 2014, Qi et al., 2013). To simplify the model, we assumed that the formation of the dCas9-sgRNA complex is in made a quasi-steady-state. That is, we assume that the association/dissociation of dCas9 and sgRNA occurs on a faster timescale than the other reactions in the network (i.e. transcription, translation and the binding of the complex to the DNA), allowing us to assume that the complex is always at steady-state, relative to the other time-dependent species concentrations. This same assumption was made in previous modelling efforts, e.g. (UCSF 2013).
Under this quasi-steady state assumption, the differential expression for the complex is given by:
Our model then simplifies to:
This is the same assumption made by previous teams.

E. coli Producing Propane
Figure 2. Propane production pathway
Our propane pathway is based on the research done by Dr. Pauli Kallio et al. and Menon et al. . Right after we decided our topic we got in touch with Dr. Pauli Kallio from the University of Turku. He was very excited about our project and eager to help. We were able to get Kallio’s groups plasmid maps from him and decided to use these as our starting material. As they had already tested this pathway, we could be sure that their genes were functional in E. coli.
Our chassis organism, Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), was chosen because it’s a strain that produces the T7 promoter when induced with IPTG. This is the strain that was used in Kallio’s research and was available at our lab. In addition to the regular BL21 (DE3), Dr. Kallio was kind to send us a BL21(DE3) with YjgB and YqhD knocked out when we realized that producing some knock outs ourselves would be too expensive and time consuming. YjgB and YghD are E. coli’s endogenous genes which produce butyraldehyde consuming enzymes. This means that they compete with our pathway’s final enzyme, ADO, which uses butyraldehyde as its substrate.
Figure 3. Propane Plasmid 1
We had been warned about the pathway’s vulnerabilities: it consisted of 10 different enzymes and in earlier research it had been built with a minimum of three different plasmids. The stress for the bacteria was high. We thought that one way of reducing this stress was to use just two plasmids for the propane pathway.  We then moved forward to design our complete constructs. We used Kallio’s group’s constructs as a basis, and arranged the genes similarly. The arrangement of our first plasmid is the same as the original one. It starts with a T7 promoter and an additional lac operator. The T7 polymerase is IPTG inducible in our BL21 (DE3) strain, but we wanted to make sure there were no leaks in our system before the actual induction. That’s why the promoters adjacent to the genes are induced by IPTG. Following the promoter, we have the YciA, Sfp and CAR each with their own RBS and a T7 terminator. We chose to use the same RBS's and terminator sequences as Kallio's group, as they"

Sequence Cutter for Sample Simulation
We generated DNA in sizes that are also expected when sequencing with Oxford Nanopore technologies ( Li et. al., 2018 ). The code takes as input a fasta file containing DNA, the amount of cut sequences that need to be generated and a minimal length threshold that can be set to prevent sequences below a certain length being generated. When using this code, pay attention to the fact that it assumes the origin of the sequence as being human. In this case, an exponential distribution can be assumed. See Li et. al., 2018 , for distributions as a result of other organisms. The output sequences are generated at a certain point in the gene and for a certain length. The starting point of the sequences is determined using a random distribution normalised to the length of the input sequence. The length of the sequences is determined using an exponential distribution normalised to the length of the input sequence, with the sequences below the minimal length treshold removed from the list. Then the starting point and sequences length are both randomly sampled for the amount of times as output sequences are required, creating the output sequences. These are saved into one fasta file of multiple sequences. See sequence cutter at the bottom of this page for the code .
Alignment and Scoring
Based on the reference sequences, we align input sequences in two steps. First, we align the input sequence with a selection of the natural human human EPO and its 6% misread ( Loman et al., 2015 ) versions to see whether the sequence is the natural EPO or a breakdown component of this. Subsequently, if we find the sequence is non-natural human EPO, we add a second step in which we align the input sequence to the doping EPO sequences in the database . In each step the average scores are compared and the machine learning algorithm k-nearest neighbors ( Torgo et al., 2010 ) is used to classify the outcome scores. These scores are determined based on a combination of two main alignment algorithms: the Smith-Waterman Algorithm and the Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm that were build in the BioStrings package in R ( Pages et al., 2018 ). Both determine local and global sequences alignment respectively.
Smith-Waterman Algorithm
The Smith-Waterman Algorithm ( Smith et al., 1981 ) is a dynamic programming algorithm that guarantees to find the optimal local alignment within the scoring system used. One starts with the two sequences that need to be aligned, that are put on the axis of the empty scoring matrix $H$. Then a series of 4 subsequent steps follows"

Hello everybody, my name is Jan Kampf and I am pursuing also the MSc/PhD program in ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" at the Georg-August University of Goettingen. I received my Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biology in 2011 at the Faculty of Biology of the University of Goettingen as well. For my bachelor  thesis ""Insights into Mammalian SIRT6 Function in Cellular Stress Response"" I  worked at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Goettingen. During  my time as a bachelor's student in the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry   I had the opportunity to work in an environment with people from various countries   raised in different and diverse cultures. It was a great time for me and motivated   me to spend a period of time working again on a project, which allows earning   experience in autonomous efforts and planning of our project. So I am really looking   forward to our iGEM project for the opportunity to work independently in a team of   young students as well  as the opportunity to present our work and the results to a   multicultural audience and the exchange of experiences during the time of the iGEM   project of the other teams.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html," the PetroBrick yielded only 87% complementarity. Based on this, there were two possible justifications for only having the acyl-acp reductase ( AAR ) gene and no aldehyde decarbonylase ( ADC ). Either the parts registry did not have the proper PetroBrick (containing both AAR and ADC ) in the assigned well in the 2012 kit plate sent to us, or we had extracted from the wrong well in the kit plate, assuming that it was the well containing the PetroBrick . It was determined that the latter was true. As such, the transformation for the PetroBrick had to be redone, and if gene sequencing yielded positive results (high complementarity), we would try the production media protocol once more in an attempt to get hydrocarbon production.
Week 10 (July 2-July 6)
The main goal this week was to repeat the transformation and verification steps that were done previously with AAR for the PetroBrick (submitted by the University of Washington). This involved transforming the PetroBrick into E.coli, colony PCR for verification of a successful transformation, followed by mini-preparation and restriction digest. Results were submitted for gene sequencing. If the sequencing results come back as being successful (showing a high rate of complementarity), we will proceed forward with the production media protocol in an attempt to produce hydrocarbons.
Week 11 (July  9-July 13)
The sequencing results sent in for the PetroBrick did not yield a high complementarity rate, therefore were unsuccessful. As such, we were not yet able to proceed with the production media protocol to attempt to produce hydrocarbons because we are not certain as to whether the PetroBrick part has been isolated. It was then decided that the colony PCR would be redone with a new colony, followed again by a mini-preparation and restriction digest before gene sequencing occurs. If the sequencing results again yield a low complementarity rate, it can be deduced that the PetroBrick sent to us in the 2012 kit plate does not contain a proper functional PetroBrick .
Week 12 (July  16 -July 20)
It was decided that the decarboxylation team would be split up into three individual components, a) to strictly work with the PetroBrick , b) transformation and isolation of the aldehyde decarbonylate ( ADC ) and c) culturing the Nocardia strain NRRL 5646. With regards to the PetroBrick , the sequencing results were once again unsuccessful and yielded a low complementarity"
Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"-human ones, the SynNotch system first realized orthogonality of biosensors used in cancer cell therapy.
However, receptors like CAR and SynNotch can only recognise antigens on cell surface. According to data of tumour markers published by National Cancer Institute (NIH), the 35 mostly used tumour markers in clinical practises include 21 which are mainly inside the blood. Because of the fact that the cell therapy biosensors mentioned above can only target cell-surface antigens, and that the range of these antigens is limited, all of these systems are actually circumscribed in both researches and clinical trials.
To break the limitation, we decide to develop a cell-therapy transducer system that is able to recognise free ligands. By importing a totally orthogonal signal transducer, we successfully extend the range of recognisable tumour markers to both cell-surface and free antigens.
To demonstrate our work, we choose non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for a specific case of application. NSCLC morbidity has been increasing to top in the world these years, occupying 85% of diagnosed cases of lung cancer5. However, screening for NSCLC by CT has a high misdiagnosis rate, not to mention the fact that the relapse rate and mortality are both considerably high. As a consequence, it's urgent for us to develop a new method for its treatment.
We want to find certain antigens to indicate development of NSCLC. And the first one, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is a broad-spectrum tumour marker, with the sensitivity to NSCLC of 85%5. By representing the level of angiogenesis, which is a critical stage for tumour to develop and metastasis, VEGF can be a reliable indicator for lung cancer.
85% sensitivity is ideal, but still not enough. That's why we also look at a more straightway marker, D-Dimer. Being the smallest fragment from degradation of fibrous protein, D-Dimer can be an ideal indicator of NSCLC development6, thus help us to design a cell therapy treatment to prevent NSCLC from relapse.
By recognising VEGF and D-Dimer, our system – the Synthetic Transducer Engineering Platform (STEP) – can be activated for treatment of NSCLC. The detailed design and its application can be viewed in the project design and applied design pages.

Our Dry Lab team focused on analysing enzyme kinetics theories, such as the well-know Michaelis Menten kinetics. One of the main aims of the dry lab was to characterise the dynamics of the system, making sure enzyme delivery was suitable.
Enzyme kinetic simulations were run to model our system. These are some of the general findings:
For lower values of [S0], the rate of formation of the product is directly proportional to the amount of [S0]. However, for higher values of [S0], rate of formation of product saturates at a maximum rate.
Michaelis-Menten approximation only holds for very small values of [E0].
Increasing K3 values will increase rate of formation of product.
And finally:
Michaelis-Menten assumption can be applied to our system because for us, KM >> [E0]
Conclusion
Engineering of bacteria to produce proteins is by no means a new development. However, due to the way in which we have designed our chassis to manufacture a protease resitant strains of the enzymes, as well as the unique method for the production and delivery of small peptides, we believe that The E.ncapsulator offers a novel approach to polypeptide production.

Virginia,2013,Team:Virginia#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html," probably being the most widely known.  When present on E. coli, Ail confers a phenotype of attachment and invasion, though invasion is primarily limited to epithelial tissue. These qualities already make Ail an attractive protein for enhancing minicells role as a delivery vehicle, but they are not the primary reasons we chose to use it. Ail was also found to have both structural and functional homology with outer membrane proteins like Rck of Salmonella typhimurium, which grants high-level serum resistance. The serum resistance Ail grants to E. coli helps prevent the activation of the complement cascade—a primary defense mechanism of the immune system. The binding of complement proteins to bacteria usually spells their end: it triggers inflammation, draws phagocytic cells, facilitates phagocytosis, induces cell lysis, and coordinates opsonization by antibodies. By protecting our minicells from destruction, we can improve the chances of successful payload delivery and simultaneously reduce the risk of septic shock.
The Ail plasmid we used for this purpose, pVM102, was a courteous gift of Dr. Virginia L. Miller.

IpxM Strain
With our FtsZ biobrick, minicells can be created in virtually any strain of E. coli. This allows us to choose strains that are best suited for a minicell’s purpose: safe delivery of contents. The use of traditionali E. coli strains is naturally limited in that regard, due to the toxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of their outer membranes. LPS is a crucial part of Gram-negative bacteria’s structural integrity and also plays a protective role against certain chemicals and immune effectors. However, it is"
