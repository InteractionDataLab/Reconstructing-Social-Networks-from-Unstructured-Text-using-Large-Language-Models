Reagents for Darwin Toolbox
We will offer smartly sized reagent kits around the needs of individual citizen scientists and classrooms. Examples include a collection of primers to identify common foods, or kits that follow lesson plans. Our kits are built around quantities that matter to individuals and the convenience of having all reagents in one place.
Furthermore, we are exploring a cradle-to-cradle approach by incentivising our customers to safely store their waste material such as old gels and recycle them by trading them with us for fresh supplies.
Background
The manipulation of DNA to create new genes or genetic elements relies on two key processes. Firstly, the amplification of DNA by a process known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and secondly by the removal and reorganisation of DNA segments, digestion and ligation. These two processes make up the process known as DNA cloning.
An explanation of the principles behind PCR can be found here or, alternatively, here . The key enzyme in PCR is polymerase, an enzyme which joins individual nucleotides together into long strands of DNA. There are a wide variety of polymerases that exist, all with slightly different attributes, but Taq polymerase has been a reliable workhorse for research labs for many years, and the Quickload® Taq 2X MasterMix solution provides the a simple and cost-effective tool to begin your PCR reactions.
To cut out segments of DNA, a restriction endonuclease is needed. A restriction endonuclease reads a DNA strand and cuts at specific points, allowing you to reliably excise the region that you need. A detailed description of this process can be found here . The enzymes EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI,,and PstI are a set of restriction enzymes used for BioBrick cloning. BioBrick cloning is a standard of DNA cloning used within the synthetic biology community as it can be used to reliably build novel genetic circuits with relative ease. Further information on BioBricks can be found here . Once DNA fragments have been cut, they can be joined to one another using a DNA ligase enzyme. A ligase enzyme joins two fragments of DNA together by forming a phosphodiester bond between them, fusing them together so that they cannot break away. The"

Once you generate specific questions, you can get a lot of value from an hour-long meeting with an expert: ""here are the critical things I saw, and here's what I'm confused about."" That's the best way to be efficient.
I got to help do a license, manage IP strategy, and design a clinical trial.  There is enormous potential to learn about a wide variety of fields in a new start-up. You don't have to be the expert in each area, but if you can ask the hard questions at the interfaces and can get the right advisers, then you can be a successful leader.
iGEM: What about intellectual property issues?
CL: When I was the Chief Technology Officer, I was doing all of the pitches as well as managing the Intellectual Property portfolio.
I spent a year understanding 500-1000 papers or patents in the field, and we had to identify key differences between their ideas and ours. The space is busy, but then again most valuable spaces are busy and it is the entrepreneurs responsibility to carve out their space.
iGEM: Are there other ways to use AMPS? What recommendations would you give to our team going forward?
CL: To start off, you should think about peptides or proteins that are bigger than what is chemically synthesizable. What would be cool to make a surface for? What could you want to do with a protein bound to a surface? But you can't just keep brainstorming about the technology, you really need an unmet need to pull you in the right direction.
""...you can't just keep brainstorming about the technology, you really need an unmet need to pull you in the right direction.""
The first thing my cofounder did was drag me to the hospital and get me to start talking to the nurses. I had to become an investigative reporter, an engineer asking questions. But I had to do it, because often the unmet need is outside your area of expertise.
I'd also think hard about ""why microbial production""? When would your peptides be cheaper? Are they super-complex peptides that you couldn't produce otherwise? Are there powerful ways to use the bacteria as a living system? From a commercial perspective, think really hard about the unmet need that only you can address.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," customers are probably not willing to pay a higher price for environmental produced solar panels.
The manufactures do not have the knowledge and the production facilities to produce the MLAs by themselves.
The efficiency is not determining for most solar panel manufactures. It is important that the return on investment and the eventual price are good.
The quality of the solar panels is very important. The encapsulation layers have to be strong and protective enough.
The complete report can be found here .
Final users
We believe that it is important to not only take into account what the needs of your direct customers are, but also what kind of needs the customers, one chain further in the supply chain have. After all, they eventually will indirectly have an enormous influence on the requirements of our final product. Therefore, we have done a final customer analysis as well. Based on the analysis it appears the solar energy market is dynamic and growing market. There is an increasing demand for environmental friendly and renewable energy sources (Centraal bureau voor Statistiek, 2015) . However, currently the total photovoltaic capacity is only sufficient to supply 1% of the world's total electricity consumption. It is expected that the total demand of solar panels will increase even further in coming years therefore (IEA, 2016) .
To analyze what the opinions and needs of the final consumers of solar panels are, we formulated, likewise for the producers, a standardized questionnaire that we have sent out to users and possible users. Both the opinions individuals and companies have been analyzed. The template questionnaire can be found here .
We have interviewed over 50 possible final customers.  Based on their opinions the needs of the final customers have been formulated.
The main key points of the analysis are:
Final customers are not prepared to pay a higher price for solar cells because they are more environmental friendly.
In most cases final customers do not in particularly think about the environmental aspects of the solar panels itself.
If the price is comparable, most final customers would buy the most environmental friendly solar panels. However, they do not want to spent too much time figuring out what the most environmental friendly type is.
The complete report of analysis with quantitative data can be found here .
Product idea
The context
The global demand for energy is highly dependent on fossil fuels. Nowadays, gas, coal and oil provide 80% of the total demand (World Energy Council, 2013) . Those gases are associated with the emission of among other things carbon dioxide, which make them extremely environmental unfriendly. Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is the main pollutant that is warming earth. In the past 150 years people"

BBa_K205004
Name: MerT
Standard: 23 Assembly in BBa_J63010
Source: Professor David Wilson, of the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University.
Function: MerT facilitates the transport of Hg(II) across the bacterial inner membrane, and enhances uptake of mercury from the environment. In combination with MerP, a periplasmic mercury binding protein which ferries mercury to MerT, these two proteins can greatly increase the intracellular accumulation of mercury. MerT is part of the endogenous Mer operon which many bacterial species use to detoxify various forms of mercury.

Without the -N flag, the line in the above example distribution list:
P 0.08
means that 8% of all amino acid residues in the matching protein are expected to be proline residues.
With the -N flag, the line in the above example distribution list:
P 0.08
means that 8% of amino acid residues that belong in the set {ADEGIKLPRSTV} (the amino acids with defined frequences) in the matching protein are expected to be proline residues.
Example:
java -jar CompositionSearch.jar prot.fasta freqs.txt out.csv -N
-X$$
This will cause the program to completely disregard certain amino acid residue symbols in the proteome, regardless of use of the N flag.
The default value of this set of characters is 'X,' often used to represent unknown amino acid residues. Therefore the flag -XX is equivalent to normal behavior. Note that the set of characters being ignored is replaced by the -X flag, so it is always advisable to list X when using this flag.
Example:
java -jar CompositionSearch.jar prot.fasta freqs.txt out.csv -XX*-
This will cause the symbols X,*, and - to be ignored in the proteome.
Cellulose Pathway Modeling
Flux Balance Analysis
Modeling allows for efficient experimental design by optimizing specific conditions before testing with in vitro methods. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is used to optimize the growth medium for the bioengineered Gluconacetobacter hansenii to yield bacterial cellulose to be used as biomaterial for a biodegradable drone. FBA is a mathematical method used to examine how metabolites relate to each network and makes predictions for the growth of an organism and product output. It is a direct application of linear programming to biological systems that used the stoichiometric coefficient for each reaction in the system as the set of constraints for the optimization.
Sample pathway, stoichiometric matrix, and constraints vectors.
Flux Balance Analysis is perfomed under steady state conditions and requires information about the stoichiometry of metabolic pathways, metabolic demands, and strain specific parameters. At steady state, there is no accumulation or depletion of metabolites in a metabolic network, so the production rate of each metabolite in the network must equal its rate of consumption [3]. FBA will be used to optimize the growth conditions of G. hansenii in order to maximize the product output of cellulose. The exchange reactions determine the metabol"

Shape-Shifting modelling
Modelling tasks for the shape-shifting team were identified:
Model cell shape using cytoskeleton structure
Model cell growth
Limit the growth of the cell by a certain shape (star or triangle)
OPTIONAL Change the membrane rigidity parameters and run the simulation again.
The shape of the cell is influenced by membrane fluidity and structure of the cytoskeleton. As cytoskeleton is present in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The former cells have no cell wall, so it is reasonable to assume that the shape of the L-form cell would obey similar rules as eukaryotic cell would. It has been determined that cytoskeleton behaves as an isotropic fluid. Therefore it's realsonable to rely on two-phase flow modelling frame (Holmes, Edelstein-Keshet, 2012).

Innoculating Plants with L-forms
Aim and Methods:
The seeds that were planted on July 17th were checked and it was observed that the cabbage seeds had begun to germinate. This meant that they were ready to absorb L-forms. We soaked 5 cabbage seeds for 3 hours in 5ml of L-form solution and another 5 seeds in 5%(w/v) mannitol solution to act as a control. The seeds were then washed with distilled water (to lyse extracellular L-forms) and replated on Murishage and Skoog agar plates. This was done following the Production of L-form containing Plants protocol from stage five onwards.
Groningen Plasmid Mini-prep
Aim:
To isolate the groningen plasmid.
Methods:
We performed a mini prep of the Groningen 2012 integration plasmid DNA grown in E.coli overnight at 37  ̊C. The purity was tested using NanoDrop . We confirmed the insert size by first cut with fast digest XbaI and BamHI and then running the product on a gel to confirm the presence of the plasmid in the purified pDNA.
Results
This was done in 8 micro centrifuge tubes. The purity of each was tested using a NanoDrop.The average purity of the 8 tubes was 324ng/µl.

BioPharma P. What Are Humanized Monoclonal Antibodies 2015 [cited 2015 08/08] (Link) Currently only few antibody-based treatments are available. Cancer cells have antigens on their surface which can be cancer specific or present at a higher concentration than on normal cells. These can potentially be targeted by  antibodies. Reference: Berger M, Shankar V, Vafai A. Therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies. Am J Med Sci. 2002;324(1):14-30.
The hope is that human-like antibodies against cancer antigens will be able to activate the immune system that in turn will eliminate the cancer. It is no surprise why scientists, researchers and doctors are interested in this sophisticated molecule. However, the available methods for producing antibodies are less sophisticated and elegant, ethically speaking, and stains the reputation of antibody production.
Industrial production of monoclonal antibodies using the hybridoma technology
Figure 3: The Hybridoma Technology.
The hybridoma technology, illustrated in Figure 3 , was originally developed by Kohler and Milstein in 1975 Reference: Payne WJ, Jr., Marshall DL, Shockley RK, Martin WJ. Clinical laboratory applications of monoclonal antibodies. Clin Microbiol Rev. 1988;1(3):313-29. and relies on an animals ability to generate antibodies against a foreign molecule. The animal of choice in production of monoclonal antibodies is typically a mouse or a rabbit. This production method involves 6 general steps; Reference: Hnasko RM, Stanker LH. Hybridoma Technology. Methods Mol Biol. 2015;1318:15-28.

Neil Chitrao
Neil Chitrao is truly the towniest of all Ithacan townies. That’s right...don’t be fooled by his so termed “frattire” consisting of Vineyard Vines button downs and salmon shorts. Beneath it all is a true Ithacan native who enjoys sharing historical tidbits about the rise of America, knows just about every species of bacteria, and can successfully accelerate his vehicle from 0 to 20,000 mph in just a little under 3 seconds. When he's not driving around town jamming out to the authentic music of his people (ie.“Indian Summer"", ""Star Spangled Banner”, or Ithaca’s famed rap song ""Our Town""), Neil can be found working hard in the iGEM wet lab, bringing bacterial cultures to life simply by charming them with stories pertaining to the joys of living in America (and more specifically Ithaca, NY). So whether it be planning a fun-filled iGEM All-American BBQ or putting in late hours in lab (has anyone really ever seen Neil sleep?), Neil Chitrao is our resident iGEM superhero who can simply do it all.

Interview in Peking University Shenzhen Hospital
On June 17, 2017, we had an interview with Dr. Boran Cheng, an expert in the Department of Oncology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital. From the communication, we learnt: 1) Current primary treatment of cancer is surgery; 2) Early diagnosis significantly improve the survival rate of patients; 3) Gene therapy and immunotherapy may cure cancer in the future. About CRISPR/CAS9 system in the treatment of cancer, Dr. Cheng believed that it is a promising therapy, but there will be a long way to go for its development.

The native fragments of the PCRs are as expected 351 bp long as can be seen in Figure 8. We always used the same template concentration and the same primers to ensure the comparability between the DNA polymerases. As can be seen in Figure 8, all Taq based polymerases are able to incorporate the unnatural base pair in the DNA.
The best results were apparently achieved with the Go Taq G2 DNA polymerase (Figure 8 B). All lanes with the UBPs show clear bands and no mutations to T or A. The M.A.X restriction digest showed there are some mutations to C or the antisense strand mutated to G and was paired with a C, which caused the completed recognition site of MnlI.
Every PCR product of the UBP_target fragment was digested because of the second MnlI restriction site, but differences can be shown between the M.A.X target mutC and the UBP_target PCR product because of the distance between both restriction sites.
The digested PCR products of the BioMaster-HS Taq PCR polymerase and the Allin HiFi DNA Polymerase show more mutations to A than the other polymerases. But also, the TiTaq polymerase seems to miss incorporate the A instead of isoG. Moreover, the Phusion DNA polymerase proceeds to miss the incorporated G while the Q5 DNA polymerase does not show any bands containing the UBPs. Both polymerases have a proofreading function in contrast to the other polymerases.

1 uL of J63001 contains 15.5 ng while J63002 contains 17.6 ng.  Note that J63001 has a length of 744 bp, while J63002 has a length of around 2292 bp.  Thus, the normalized amounts of J63001 and J63002 per uL are 17.6 ng/744 = 0.023656 and 15.5 ng/2292 = 0.006763.  Thus, a ratio of 0.023656/0.006763 =3.498 natrually exists when one uses the same volume of insert and vector.  If one uses a volume ratio of 3:1 between insert and vector, the ratio of DNA amounts will end up being 10.494, which is even better.

Note: New technique for making agar plates involves placing flasks that have just come out of the autoclave into a water bath at 55 degrees Celsius without a stir bar.  This will help to cool down the flasks as well as to maintain them at a temperature that is good for pouring and also for adding antibiotic.

In general he did not have  many problems getting luxAB genes from Vibrio fischeri’s genome by PCR. We sent luxAB from V. fischeri to Edinburgh as a PCR product.
The PCR reaction yielded a DNA band of the expected size of luxAB genes which are supposed to be (~2100bp).Besides there were resulting unspecific amplification products.
Once Augusto got luxAB genes from genomic DNA he purified PCR product with High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit by Roche and then he tried to ligate them with different plasmids, all of them containing constitutive promoters. The general protocol followed is this:
1.Digestion of the plasmid with SpeI and PstI in order to ligate luxAB genes in front of the promoter carried by the plasmid.
2.Digestion of the PCR product with XbaI and PstI.
3.Dephosphatation of plasmids to avoid re-annealing and false positives after bacterial transformation.
4.Overnight ligation
5.Bacterial transformation with the ligation left overnight and culturing on selective media.
The different plasmids that he used as vectors are the following ones: •J61002 carrying constitutive promoter J23101 •J61002 carrying constitutive promoter J23102 •J61002 carrying constitutive promoter J23106
He also used plasmids without constitutive promoters (of course these plasmids were digested with EcoRI and PstI or SpeI) such as:
•pSB1C3  •pSB1T3 •BBa_I51020
Because none of these ligations were successful we thought that it could be due to issues with our plasmids from the iGEM DNA submission so we decided to ligate luxAB genes into a commercial plasmid, Augusto tried the ligation with
•pBluescript II KS (+/-) restricted with EcoRI and PstI
However none of these ligations were successful, whenever they resulted in probable colonies, an analysis revealed they were always false positives, it seemed that some other smaller alternative PCR product was being ligated into these vectors.
Because we thought there was some smaller unspecific PCR product with bigger chances of ligation than actual luxAB genes, we decided to make a PCR and then a gel band purification; the resulting purification would contain only luxAB genes so it should avoid the ligation of unspecific products to the vector, nonetheless these ligations never"

Here’s the Gist…
An alarm clock that releases a banana smell when cavities are about to form.
Get started.
How to do it?
Test it!
Our result~
Reference
Before we get started:
Every system needs a fail-safe, and ours is no exception. While designing our previous components, it occurred to us that we need a contingency plan in case our Control and Cleanse sections failed, or were overwhelmed. At this point, our patient would probably require external help, in the form of a dentist check-up.
This problem is, however, more complex than you might think. For example, many people are unaware of the extent of their tooth decay until they start to feel severe pain – at which point it is too late for preventive measures! Many people also live in areas far from dental coverage, and a visit to the dentist becomes a significant investment in time and expense.
Most importantly, for people needing Long-Term-Care, or disabled persons, who are a significant target user of HOPE (see [Project Overview] for more information), timely dental checkups become even more of a challenge because it is up to the caretaker to discover and report the decay.
For this reason, we have decided to develop a system to detect tooth decay as it is happening, and to send out a warning message to HOPE’s user.
So how did we do it?
Right now you probably know the main microbial target of our project, S. mutans. However, aside from S. mutans, there exists numerous bacteria that also play a role in tooth decay. One of them is a closely related species in the same genus: Streptococcus sobrinus.
So what makes S. sobrinus so special? For starters, it is a very good indicator for tooth decay – even more so than S. mutans, its main cause! Also, like S. mutans, it is present"

Skype Conversations
In order to collaborate with other teams we scheduled some video conferences via Skype.
This gave us the chance to directly exchange information with iGEM Peshawar, for example . The discussed topics were amongst others talking about the progress in the lab, comparing notes inside and outside the lab and looking for possible collaborations.
Skype made it possible to get in touch with people from other far away countries with other talents than us and help each other in solving problems that accrued during our working journey and motivating each other.
Talking with you was very informative and great fun. Hopefully we stay in contact after iGEM! See you at the Giant Jamboree in Boston!

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," inside the lenses are not viable anymore, our biolenses will be allowed to leave the ML-1 lab. We have tested tree methods, respectively diffusion limitation, autoclaving and UV-sterilization. Based on the extensive analysis we have concluded that UV-sterilization is the best solution. This is the only method that is proven to fully sterilize the cells without destroying the shape.
Introduction
When our biological lenses will be implemented in real world applications, they will leave the ML-1 lab. Current (European) ML-1 safety regulations do not always allow the use of GMOs outside the lab. To determine what the requirements would be in the Netherlands, we have had a discussion with Boet Glandorf, risk assessor from the Dutch national institute for public health and the environment (RIVM). She told us that under strict conditions, it is allowed to use genetically modified organism outside the lab. For example, there are specific rules and requirements about the products the micro-organism may produce, the possibilities of horizontal gene transfer and the origin of the inserts and vectors. One has to apply for a license and when you meet all the requirements, the RIVM can adopt the use of the micro-organism outside the lab. The RIVM often works together with parties that apply for a license to adapt the micro-organism or the product in order to meet all the requirements.
Based on our safety analysis, we can conclude that the microlenses are not associated with significant risks. However, we still expect that we cannot apply for a license to use them outside the lab. This is mainly because we express our genes on a plasmid with antibiotic resistance, which should probably be substituted by chromosomally integrated genes. Because of the potential danger on widespread antibiotic resistance, the RIVM does not allow products with a micro-organism with a plasmid with antibiotics resistance. Furthermore, although there are possibilities to use living genetically modified organisms outside the lab in the Netherlands, this is not the case of all countries. Therefore, we have researched the possibilities to make the micro-organisms metabolic silent or more preferably not viable anymore. We need to find a method to sterilize the biolenses without destroying the shape or optical properties.
We have tested three methods to sterilize the biolenses:
Limiting diffusion
Autoclave
UV-radiation
Limiting diffusion
We hypothesized that as a consequence of the polysilicate layer, the nutrient supply becomes limited by diffusion, which can eventually result in cell death. When we can guarantee that cell death occurs"

When getting to know Dr. Scott, we found out he was a member of the iGEM team Berkeley 2011 which is why he did not only give us significant advice for our project, but also told us about his experience with iGEM, further increasing our enthusiasm for iGEM and the final Giant Jamboree.
We would like to thank Dr. Scott for this amazing skype interview and the great input he gave our team. We hope - with the gained iGEM experience and future research we will do a great job and one day will also be able to help other iGEM teams and play a role in their interesting projects.
Interview with Shraddha Shitut
Shraddha Shitut (Sh) is currently working as a postdoc at the Leiden Institute of Biology and institute of Chemistry in the Netherlands. In her PhD she worked on cross-feeding in bacteria resulting in a publication ""Metabolic coupling in bacteria"" in bioRxiv 114462 with which we found many similarities to our subproject ""Auxotrophy"". There she describes the establishment of a co-culture working with unidirectional cross-feeding with amino acids like lysine, histidine and tryptophan. We asked her for advice and wanted her to give an opinion on our approach.
TD: Hello Shraddha! We are iGEM team Duesseldorf 2018 (TD) and want to know, if you would consider giving us an interview and advice for one of our subprojects. For this year’s project we are working on establishing two- and three-way co-cultures between Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus. One of our approaches is establishing a cross feeding of amino acids between a leucine-auxotroph E. coli and a lysin-auxotroph S. cerevisiae; they are producing the needed amino acid for each other. What is your first impression about our plan?
Sh: It is an ambitious plan. If we only consider the 2-way interaction between the modified E. coli and BY4742 you need to remember the additional auxotrophy in BY4742 and provide Histidine in the medium. This may affect the dependency of the auxotrophic E. coli strain. In my experience in some situations the auxotrophy can be fulfilled even by the presence of other amino acids"

BIT,2018,Team:BIT-China#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," about our own project and                                 started to think a new way to let public understand our project.
Public Engagement
We always want the public to learn more about synthetic biology and iGEM. We believe that if                                 you want to promote something, you should publicize it in a way which is closer and appealing                                 to the public. At the age of big data, using the popularity of new-media industry to spread                                 ideas is more convenient, more extensive, and more effective. Therefore, we decided to film some videos to promote synthetic biology and iGEM.
Videos about synthetic biology
In order to spread the knowledge of synthetic biology to the public and to publicize our                                 projects, we have taken several beauty blogger-style videos about synthetic biology and                                 published them on several video platforms (Which are most used by young people in China). We                                 believed this kind of way to popularize science is effective. In the video, our team members                                 introduced the knowledge including the pipette and the plate coating in vivid form and humorous                                 tone. The videos are very popular and get many positive influence.
Video about iGEMer
We always want to promote the influence of iGEM, and let more people know how important iGEM is                                 for iGEMers. So we filmed a video to show how an iGEMer find herself by attending an iGEM                                 team(BIT-China) and published it on several video platforms. The video is based on the mv of Taylor Swift`s Delicate. This video not only shows a growing road of an iGEMer, but also let                                 more people learn about iGEM.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.

Advantages and Disadvantages
Although biobrick assembly is not a new technique, the format of it and its wide use, particularly by iGEM teams, has lead to several assembly standards being developed and      the technique generally has been updated and progressed with time. Standard assembly, requiring inefficient gel extraction, could create difficulties with small promoters and      ribosome binding sites which might not show up easily on a gel. 3A assembly was introduced (fig. 1). All it required was the upstream fragment, downstream fragment and      destination vectors to have different antibiotic resistance (‘3A’) so only transformed cells with the correctly ligated destination vector will have resistance to the antibiotic     of choice. A rare issue with this is that an undigested vector containing the upstream or downstream parts can be taken up by the cell along with the correctly assembled vector,     so resistance is still conferred. This is considered unlikely and can be tested using the fragment vector antibiotics and sequencing.
A feature of the assembly method is the inclusion of a ‘scar’ where the two fragments have joined at the X-S sites. The scar sequence is 6 bp long, but was 8bp in the      original method before being updated (Shetty, Endy and Knight 2008). 8 base pairs will, of course, introduce a frame shift which is why the method is obsolete, but the 6bp scar      instead creates a stop codon . For the purposes of most synthetic biology this is not a problem, but could become a difficulty if two proteins needed to be combined. The      development of the BglBricks standard (Anderson et al 2010) has circumvented the issue by changing the scar sequence to code for innocuous amino acids. For BioBricks, the      inability of XbaI and SpeI to recognise the scar gives a permanence to ligation of two biobricks which could be a disadvantage if a mistake is made in assembly, but otherwise is     a strong advantage: you can’t accidentally undo earlier work when forming a large construct.
Personal findings
Most of our genes were synthesised in vitro so the restriction sites were easily included that way, and the steadily falling price of gene synthesis could be argued to be in      the favour of maintained use of biobrick assembly - it is easy to obtain a gene with the required sites this way. A small extra requirement for us was including restriction      sites in the primers designed for using PCR to get the"
TU-Delft,2013,Team:TU-Delft#Sensing_-_-_TEXT.html," to sense the auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) produced by S. aureus.
Diagram of the Part
In this sensor test-construct AgrC and AgrA are expressed, after which AgrC can act as a receptor for AIP. After binding AIP, AgrC will phosphorylate AgrA which then starts acting as a postitive transcription factor for pP2 [2] . Therefore, upon induction by AIP, the construct will give a GFP signal. This is tested using the following experiment.
Figure 2: Part:BBa_K1022100
Experimental Set Up
Cells are induced with 0.1 % Arabinose (to induce pBAD) and AIP, and with only AIP. AIP Induction is done at O.D 0.5 with 10 µM AIP. 3 hours after induction fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is used to check for GFP signal. The controls are BL21(DE3) cells, AIP receiver GFP containing BL21(DE3)without any induction and a strain constitutively expressing GFP. The AIP used to induce the cells was synthesized by Eurogentec.
Full protocol
The cells induced with arabinose all died, which could be seen by the fact the signal given by the FACS. FACS gives a fluorescent signal for every cell passing the reader, live cells give a higher signal than cell debris. From the fact the arabinose induced cells showed a lower signal than the BL21(DE3) control we concluded these cells were dead. This cell lysis could be due the fact AgrA and/or AgrC is toxic in high concentrations. The detection of AIP by E. coli without induction of the Agr genes is explainable due the fact pBAD is a bit leaky, making low levels of transcription possible. Apparently only a small amount of activated AgrA is required to give a measurable level of GFP.
Earlier work on the detection of AIPs by Gram-negatives has been done, but with unclear or non-convincing results [3,4] . Often the outer-membrane of E. coli was seen as an obstacle for the implementation of auto-inducing peptide sensing systems in Gram negatives. In the AIP sensing experiments preformed by the iGEM Cambridge 2007 team a FepA construct was used as this is known to make the outer membrane more permeable [8] . Although, after intensive literature research we found a molecule very similar to the AIP molecule used in these experiments, that is known to pass the outer membrane."

Lund,2017,Team:Lund#Modeling#ParameterEstimation_-_-_TEXT.html," have chosen to set the concentrations of all species             to zero except for the gene content which is set at 83.2 nM. This can be calculated by the relation $c =             \frac{\text{C}_\text{P}}{\text{N}_\text{A}V}$ where $\text{N}_\text{A}$ is Avogadros number, $\text{C}_\text{P}$ the copy number and $V$ the cell             volume. The latter two parameters can be found in table 1.
Math stuff
To derive relation (1) we start by setting up the differential equations. We have that two species $a$ and $b$ can react irreversibly to yield             $c$. We get the following reactions:              $$\ce{a + b ->[k] c}\tag{3}$$             $$\ce{a ->[\lambda_1] \phi}\tag{4}$$             $$\ce{b ->[\lambda_2] \phi}\tag{5}$$             $$\ce{c ->[\lambda_3] \phi}\tag{6}$$              where $\text{a}$ corresponds to the GFP1-9 fragment and $\text{b}$ to GFP10-SR-GFP11 (SR = sulfite reductase). The product $\text{c}$ is the associated GFP. Since the             reactions were carried out in vitro, we assumed that no degradation occur, i.e $\lambda_i = 0$. By balancing the masses we get the following             equations:              $$\frac{dc}{dt} = -\frac{db}{dt} = -\frac{da}{dt} =  kab\tag{7}$$              These can be reduced into a single equation by noticing that $\frac{dc}{dt} + \frac{db}{dt} = 0$ and $\frac{dc}{dt} + \frac{da}{dt} = 0$. It can now be seen that             the sum of $c$ and $b$, and $c$ and $a$ is constant. These relations can be solved to yield              $$b = b_0 - c\tag{8}$$             $$a = a_0 - c\tag{9}$$             $$\frac{dc}{dt} = k(a_0-c)(b_0-c)\tag{10}$$              Here, $a_0$ and $b_0$ are the initial concentrations of $a$ and $"

Discussing the road to Mars
Stanford-Brown-RISD
The supervisor of the Stanford-Brown-RISD (SBR) team, Lynn J. Rothschild, approached us back in the early days of the team with a project that quickly got everyone's attention: Using the mycelium of fungi to help NASA with building a base on Mars. Her own team was also participating in this, but they decided to concentrate on providing the substrate for the fungal materials by using cyanobacteria. Therefore, we have been meeting multiple times over the course of the project, discussing in the beginning what was needed to accomplish the result and which ideas we each had. Furthermore, any problems we had and potential solutions were also brought up.
Fig. 2a - Lynn visited us at DTU.
Lynn Rothschild visited us a couple of times, where she was very helpful in guiding us through what the SBR team was doing and giving us suggestions on what we should be focusing on.
Fig. 2a - The DTU team having a skype meeting with three members of the Stanford Brown team. Fig. 2b - Kyle standing with Lynn and three members of the Stanford team.
Both of our projects rely on the idea of using fungal bricks, and without consulting each other, we discovered that we each had been testing on which substrate to grow it on. We then agreed to send DTU grown bricks to the US, so that they could verify their results on our bricks. The delivery of bricks happened when our supervisor Kyle visited their team.
The importance of modeling the project was also a focus of both our teams. Both teams have created models that describe different stages of the project. Our models can be linked together to describe the whole process from growing the mycelium from a single spore to figuring out how the biomass develops, from how long it takes for a fungus to fill out a form to describe the mechanical properties of the fungus needed to design the final structure on Mars. The illustration below shows the connection between our models.

From plastics to the power line
Polyethylene is the most widely used plastic and arguably one of the most versatile materials to ever be synthesized. Its practicality and convenience however, have come at a great environmental cost. Polyethylene takes millennia to decompose, leaching harmful microplastics into the environment. We approached this pressing issue from a synthetic biology perspective, making use of E. coli engineered with genes encoding for laccase to degrade polyethylene into smaller alkane chains. Our team recognizes the opportunity to further advance this project by addressing another key issue – energy. Using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain’s inbuilt extracellular electron transport mechanism in tandem with genes responsible for alkane metabolism derived from Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans, we will generate electricity from the metabolism of degraded polyethylene, hoping that it will one day help in solving the world’s growing energy needs. Thus, our project serves as an integrated effort to simultaneously solve two crucial problems.
To achieve our goal of electricity generation from plastic degradation, we separated our project into three independent but interconnected modules. The first stage, the PE degradation module, focused on creating a genetic construct that would readily synthesize and secrete Laccase in order to degrade the polyethylene into smaller alkanes. Once fragmented, the alkanes would be processed by our second stage - the alkane metabolism module. This module plans to introduce alkane uptake and metabolism pathways into Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 so that it can process alkanes and channel the electrons obtained from its cellular respiration. The third and final module was the physical construct of the microbial fuel cell. We housed the Shewanella within a microbial fuel cell of our design to characterise and optimise the electricity generated. The following is a schematic to describe the flow of the project.

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html,", we designed a special series of cards with the theme of synthetic biology for the campus fair.
We plotted and organized the whole HP together with XMU_software, another iGEM team from our university. And we assisted XMU_software to finish the theme fresco on Furong Tunnel. We thought some good ideas when brainstorming human practice together and everyone tried his best to achieve our goal.
In a word, we did a series of various but clear-thematic activities this year which not only improved our project greatly but also an alternative popularization of synthetic biology.
Lecture
What is synthetic biology on earth? Most people will present a confused expression when hearing this subject. Before the lecture we made a survey, finding that in fact nearly 70% of the respondents didn’t understand the meaning of the term. Fortunately through our lecture, we got our audience across to the basic principle and a general situation of synthetic biology. The lecture was held in the chemistry lecture hall, Xiamen University on July 7th. And there was no empty seat in the hall, which was far beyond our expectation. Lots of students even stood the whole lecture. The lecture has five parts, including introduction of synthetic biology, iGEM, iGEM-XMU , iGEM-HS program and our following activity——campus fair.
Synthetic biology is a newly-developing subject. Our iGEM-XMU team used simple words with vivid pictures to illustrate the generation and development of this discipline. What’s more, we introduced some basic knowledge of genetic safety in an interesting video. These unfamiliar words such as bacteria and gene got across well in our lecture. And pointed to the worrying biosafety in the lab as well as in the public, we introduced some basic knowledge and principal related to biosafety. Some high school students talked with us about genetically modified food and transgenic technology after the lecture. As we expected, these students are just like seeds we sow to help synthetic biology and genetic engineering well understood by the public. More important thing is, this younger generation could accept synthetic biology, genetic engineering and other advanced science and technology under a promise of a correct understanding of biosafety and ethical problems related with transgenic technology. It would be really beneficial to the whole society we hope.
In addition, we introduced iGEM, including the start, development and goal of this competition to have the high school students know why we are crazy about it. After that we presented some excellent projects, from biosynthesis to software, to stimulate them to enjoy this game. Every program included has its specialty, from bacteria with fluorescence to E.coli"

Our next step in the following months is to include Members of European Parliament, MEP (European Deputies) in future round table discussions!
Victor Dillard science entrepreneur. Desktop Genetics, world expert in CRISPR-Cas9 technology combined with AI, listed as an under 35 innovator by MIT review
Thomas De Vlaam science entrepreneur, CEO and founder of Amylon Therapeutics, next generation of RNA Therapies, targeting neurological genetic disorders

Corrie Gielen, CEO of Christal. His company has developed probiotic cleaning products combatting resistant hospital bacteria and struggled with regulatory limitations
Almost every category was represented, which helped making the discussion more fruitful and interesting. We learned that the European legal frame is quite complicated and, as it evolves more slowly than the research, it may keep us                 from using technologies that are already available and functioning.
On the other hand, it also protects us from potential dangers
As students and young world citizens, we want to raise awareness on this topic and we realized that the lack of communication between private and public sector is one of the main obstacles of a fluid and efficient working system,                 especially in the field of Biotechnologies and Law.
The round-table event was very successful and all the participants were eager at doing more events like that in order to better analyze all the aspect of the problematic.
The topic is very wide and we are ready to develop it more and more!
General public was actively involved in this Round-Table!
100 people were present in the room (sold-out) and more than 500 followed the event on livestream from many different countries!
We were very glad to pair up with Young Change Maker http://www.youngchangemaker.eu : a large organisation whose aim is to interconnect non-scientific people with young researcher.
Their help was essential to us for the organization of the conference!
Young Change Maker’s mission is to highlight and help young people with innovative ideas that could have a big impact"

New electrocompetent cells of E.coli BL21 and E.coli Nissle 1917 were made according to the same protocol used for E.coli Top 10 and a test transformation with both strains was performed. Transformation efficiencies of 2,3*108 cfu/ml for E.coli BL21 and 3,7*108cfu/ml for E.coli Nissle were reached.
After receiving all of our gBlocks we chose Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) to perform a digestion and attempt to insert it into the pSB1C3 iGEM submission vector. Digestion with EcoRI-HF and PstI was performed followed by ligation into the vector. The ligation reaction of TH and pSB1C2 was transformed into TOP10 but no cultures were seen the next day
Simultaneously PCR was performed on TH and the iGEM vector to construct a multimer. Following PCR the reaction was analysed on a gel to identify the presence of a multimer which would be expected to remain in the well. Unfortunately no DNA was identified in the well.
In order to clone our gBlock of TH into a vector we attempted A tailing with Taq polymerase to insert it into a TOPO vector and achieve higher cutting efficiency. A tailing was performed followed by ligation into TOPO and transformation into OneShot competent cells. Colonies were observed the following day and overnight liquid cultures were incolulated. Miniprep was performed on overnight cultures.
The plasmid preparation of TH TOPO was digested with EcoRI-HF and PstI to test whether insertion had occurred. After analysis via gel electrophoresis no insert was found and we decided to repeat TA cloning using TH as well as another gBlock Tyrosinase (TYR). TA tailing of gBlocks was performed followed by ligation into TOPO and transformation into One Shot competent cells. Transformed cells were plated on LB agar Kan, colonies were seen after one day on TYR TOPO and after two days on empty vector control, no colonies were seen on TH TOPO.

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Medals_-_-_TEXT.html," for moving forward.
When ReaGent (from Ghent, Belgium) integrated their views into the team we benefited from sharing global perspectives.
We spoke to patent attorneys at Maxwell's Patent and Trademark Attorneys, whose feedback we fed into the design of our Winsulin construct so as not to encroach on any existing patents
Our communication with Dr Narcyz Ghinea from The University of Sydney , an expert in access to high cost medicines, assisted us with data on where the money for clinical trials is sourced from, giving us the idea of a potential use of government grants for this open-sourced project
 
EDUCATION AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
 
Engaging with the wider community was a huge focus of our project – both by alerting them to the issue of insulin accessibility and to the massive potential found in synthetic biological solutions
 
Key Activities:
We participated in the Synthetic Biology Australasia 2017 conference by presenting a talk on our project, opening up a discussion with the Australasian synthetic biologist community
We partook in the National Science Week at the Australian Museum by running a stall for the Joint Academic Microbiology Seminars (JAMS) group. This event was organized to educate school-aged children on the possibilities of science, especially the biological sciences
We participated in the Northern Sydney Science Hub, an event held to educate the public on the variety of microorganisms, and to break the stigma of perceived uncleanliness surrounding them
We invited students from the Mount St Benedicts School into our labs to teach them some basic biochemical and microbiological techniques, to inspire them to consider undertaking a STEM degree
We also joined a weekly meeting with Counter Culture Labs to gain feedback on our project, as their lab aims towards a similar goal
Our social media presence has been maintained throughout the year, through Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter, allowing us to access the broader community and the community of insulin users alike with our work, and to receive useful feedback at the same time
 
 
MODEL
Our modelling approach was multi-faceted to address the complex issue of insulin accessibility, which we broke into three main divisions: production, physiological activity and economic status
 
To characterise the experimental/production of insulin, we analysed three expression systems: cytoplasmic, periplasmic and secreted
We interrogated the yield of folded protein predicted by each model, which allowed us to gain insights into the best way to optimize protein production
For our physiological model, we identified a link between the thermodynamic and computationally predicted properties of insulin analogues and their action profiles
We used this to predict characteristics of our novel insulin"

ITU_MOBGAM_Turkey,2013,Team:ITU MOBGAM Turkey#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," thanks to our team leader and the team spirit, so, the stressful and funny year was started . This year, we have learned not only about synthetic biology but also thinking for new ideas, working as a team, overcoming stress…sooo thanks to iGEM =)
Dilek Gülsima Usluer (Belieber): I am Dilek Gulsima Usluer and I am a four year student of Molecular Biology and Genetics department of Istanbul Technical University. I am working in both wet lab and human practice divisions of ITU_MOBGAM team. I always believe that there are too many things to do and much more things to learn in the world of science. This is why I wanted to be involved in an IGEM project. With the help of IGEM competition, I have met with a new field of biology, synthetic biology. I have also learned how a project can be constructed. Moreover, experiencing the team work with such a lovely team was priceless. I think IGEM competition is worth to try even if you are not deeply interested with the field of synthetic biology. As I said above, there are too many things to do and much more things to learn.
Güleycan Lütfullahoğlu: I am Güleycan Lutfullahoğlu. When we started this project, I was a second grade student, with a little knowledge, but now, I am starting third grade with much more experience. We, second grades, take part mostly in the human practice project, making videos, arranging meetings and making street interviews. It was a lot of fun to observe the reaction of people about synthetic biology. It was also a lot of experience for me to take part in the lab as an assistant as much as possible. It was so nice to contribute to the team this year and I am also looking forward to enjoying  the next year with much more knowledge.
Güliz Otkıran: I am appreciated IGEM to provide us to contribute our vision,  keep alive our scientific attention and promote the science and give oppurtunity to explore the project source which grows year by year, however I found  the fees as restrictor to motive the youth to science. To introduce myself microbiology, immunology, human genome, evolution and neuroscience  are the topics that interest me more. Other than these, any kind of art, especially painting and drawing, comics, anime, heavy metal – not the element but music one – , far eastern cuisine and classical literature novels are enough to entertain me in my social life.

Education
This year, we had the opportunity to cooperate with an international school in Hong Kong to introduce the idea of synthetic biology to high school students. We had roughly around 30 students from The Independent Schools Foundation Academy (shorten ISF Academy) visit our school. These were grade 10 students who will be determining their IB subjects in November. The school eagers to expose these students into various areas of studies to allow them explore their field of interest. Our team’s goal was to introduce students to synthetic biology as the newly emerging field of study in biology, hoping to give those potential future scientists some inspiration.   We delivered a talk to the students introducing the basic concept behind synthetic biology as well as its application. We also managed to introduce iGEM and present this year’s project “Finding Pneumo”. We tried to explain the principle behind our construct, and it was pleasing to see students’ enthusiasm to learn. In fact, we were surprised how much they understood considering they are only grade 10 students in high school!   After the talk, we invited students to visit our lab, giving them a snapshot of how a college biology lab looks like. Moreover, we prepared a few small lab activities such as ____ for them to have some hand on experience in wet lab. We emphasized that while the lab work can be fun, safety should be the first and far most important concern.

Here is the description of the potato: it is a potato!
It was great to interact with these high school students. They all had potentials to be great scientists and researchers, and we are excited to think what this young future generation has to offer in the near future.

Wednesday 17th
This morning we discovered that the RFP insert did not really fluoresce. At least not in red. We picked colonies to grow overnight in order to check whether something went wrong in the ligation or if the biobrick was not working. This could be done on Thursday through an agarose gel of the recombinant DNA.
In the afternoon we went back into our groups from yesterday.
DIYbio
We headed for the Biohackspace in Hackney and started doing manual. We 3D printed the parts and soldered everything together to make a spectrophotometer. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work. But being in the Hackspace was definitely worthwhile.

We made a mini prep of our bacterial cultures and digested the final plasmid again, this time with SpeI and XbaI to check the insert. We then did the anticipated gel-electrophoresis. The result was that the ligation worked as we got the expected bands on the gel. Our conclusion to why the fluorescence did not work is that something was wrong with the biobrick...

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#ConsortiaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," now, we are going to test TyrA- +GFP, TrpA- +RFP, MetA- +YFP, and also wildtype with the fluorescent genes. Recently, we switched backbones for the 13M RFP to Psb1C3, for we do not know the provenance of our current psb1C3 with rfp (we suspect it might be on the lac operon, as per the registry guidelines), and we also put the GFP on the psb1C3 instead of a kanamycin resistant plasmid, because we were transforming into kanamycin resistant auxotrophs.
Just for qualitative fun, we are trying to grow the ArgC- and the ArgE- together in M9 to see if anything results, with negative controls for both. We also tried growing a wildtype with a TrpB auxotroph with rfp to look for qualitative red fluorescence. The fluorescence calibration experiment must be done before we can do these sorts of things quantitatively.
We miniprepped 4/6 of the biobricks that we ordered from the registry. We intend on sequencing them in the near future. We, lacking LB amp plates at the time, plated one on an M9 plate, but we now think that the strain the registry sent us is auxotrophic for something. We replated on LB amp after making new plates. The last one that we ordered did not arrive.
Joe made M9 plates with and without 1 mM arginine, and it was found that the two arginine auxotrophs grew as expected.
We bought a fridge for our new office, but have yet to fill it. If anyone with extra snacks reads this and wants to help, our fridge is currently underfilled.
Overnight cultures have been set up to make competent cells out of DH5a, K12, and IGTS8.

ChatterPlant in a first private community for a primary social test.
Participative process to perceive public awareness.
ChatterPlant in urban orchards, restaurants and public spaces.
Popular legislative initiative to present a draft bill to change current GMOs legal framework.
This step-by-step solution is projected to last about 20 years; it is a long process. It is difficult to change society and all those kinds of movements require time to go deep into society. In spite of the difficulties that will be faced on the journey to change society and improve plant understandings, there is a firm belief that society can indeed be changed.But we strongly believe in it, not only because the change in the social criterion  we are proposing, but because in the project evolution that urban environment will cause in our device.
HUMAN PRACTICES CONCLUSIONS
Throughout this process, several ideas were developed and transformed into a SynBio solution thanks to the social, legal, and incorporation methods analyzed. ChatterPlant was built based on the knowledge and concepts obtained from the different investigations as well as our own ideas. Once ChatterPlant was developed, its implementation and acceptance in society was considered. To correctly proceed with the endeavor to integrate Chatterplant into society,  a step-by-step product integration workflow was designed through a pilot project .
Following actions have been done in order to  establish a bi-directional workflow between current society and our project:
In-depth analysis of social stakeholders necessities, taking into account greenhouse supervisors, high-quality restaurant chefs and the opinion of GMO lawyers through several interviews.
Public survey in order to know the public opinion on GMOs and self-regulation plant growth systems.
Improvement and enhancement of ChatterPlant objectives in order to fit the project feature requirements of stakeholders requirements.
Design of ChatterPlant’s pilot project to normalize and establish the consumption of  GMOs and effectively implement ChatterBox in current society through a step-by-step strategy.
There is a great deal of controversy around the sciences ChatterPlant has been bassed off of. This project is an innovative idea for sustainable agriculture, capable of being integrated into society through plant communication. We hope that through our efforts to educate the public on transgenesis the bias surrounding this issue will decrease.

Technology & Entrepreneurship
In this chapter of the report we have analyzed what happened with the iGEM project after the Jamboree. We have asked the iGEM teams multiple questions about this in our survey. Figure 1 summarizes the results.
Figure 1: Summarization of what happened with the iGEM project after the Jamboree. Data is based on our survey.
We have analyzed how the iGEM results can become more publicly available. Currently, interested people have to visit the wiki of a team to find any information. The formats of the wikis are all different and there is no overview where all the (interesting) projects can be found. Therefore, we think that iGEM should find a way to make the results and projects more easily accessible. One of the possibilities to do so, is to start an own journal. To make this possible, writing a publishable article could become a possible gold medal requirement teams can meet. Teams that meet the requirements and receive a gold medal will then be published in the iGEM journal. This would give external parties an easy way to see what the results are froms the ‘best’ iGEM projects.
Another option could be to make it obligatory for teams to write an abstract about their project. Those abstracts can then be bundled and published as well. To make this bundle with abstracts uncluttered, we advise to use a standard format for those abstracts. The use of standard formats will be discussed in more detail in the paragraph Sharing & Community.

Community, Sharing & Responsibility
iGEM is a multifaceted competition in which students are encouraged to rise above themselves and thereby develop numerous new skills. The many different facets of the competition ensure both the toughness of the program as well as simultaneously developing a new generation of all-round engineers. Hereby establishing a strong, renowned science community.
One of the things this new generation of scientists could really benefit from, is being an active part of a widely recognized community within the scientific world. The community enlarges personal networks and could also help new scientists in their future career. iGEM has grown for the past decade to a total of 16,000 members. To increase both numbers and individual activity of these members, we have proposed some strategies.
To strengthen the community even more and to ensure its continuity, new members need to be attracted. Here our main focus was on attracting new iGEM participants and keep them connected in the i"

Market Research
In order to understand what types of products are available or that are in the testing phase, our team did some research to look at how we could design our product to improve upon the issues in the products we found.
The above table shows a comparison between Coagu.coli and blood coagulants that are currently in the market. As you can see, most of these products are not available to be used yet, and are not affordable. Looking at each coagulant more specifically though, we can recognize the faults present in each:
QuikClot:According to the official QuikClot website, this coagulant intercepts in the natural blood clotting cascade at the very beginning. It uses a substance known as kaolin, which starts the clotting process with the activation of factor XII. Since this factor is located at the start of the clotting cascade, this product will not be as “quick” as the name suggests (Z-Medica, 2014). QuikClot has also been known to be troublesome to remove from a wound after application as the material can become too hard if it is left too long in the wound. Bleeding can also resume after removal (NurseAmyandDrBones, 2015).
VetiGel:This coagulant seems to be the best out of all the others. It is fast and affordable. The only problem is that it is not yet ready to be revealed in the market for human use, and has only been focused on being used in veterinarian clinics on animals (Weller, 2014).
Tisseel Although this factor has not been included in the table, Tisseel is known to be made from substances made of human plasma, which “can contain infectious agents”(Center & Evaluation, 2014) and transmit diseases. Looking into the other faults that this coagulant contains, Tisseel is not available to be used in a home setting by an individual. Instead, it is supposed to be applied"

The gene of the C4 carboxylate transporter DcuB, which exchange fumarate against succinate, has a size of 1341 bp. We amplified the genome area of the dcuB gene with primers ( dcuB_del_kon1 and dcuB_del_kon2 ), which bind 530 bp upstream and 520 bp downstream of the dcuB gene. When using the E. coli KRX wildtype as a template the resulting PCR product has a size of 2391 bp, which could be demonstrated by agarose gelelectrophoresis.  However the E. coli KRX knockout strain ( E.coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF ) showed a 4046 bp PCR product analyzed by agarose gelelectrophoresis.

However, developing biosensors takes a lot of time and resources, and most do not make it to commercial use. By creating a toolkit, where devices can be combined and reused to make your own biosensor, Newcastle iGEM team aim to ameliorate these issues.
“The limits of my language means the limits of my world” -Ludwig Wittgenstein
Quote of the Day, August 10, 2017
Humans’ ability to use language to communicate is arguably one of our most important defining characteristics.  As an English Language and Literature student, I love investigating how and why we adapt language to different situations. When offered the chance to join Newcastle University’s 2017 iGEM team, I saw the opportunity to explore language use in a context I had yet to properly consider- in the world of science.
I-What?
iGEM: International Genetically Engineered Machine, August 9, 2017
iGEM is a worldwide competition where teams from university, high school, and community labs use synthetic biology to address a real-world challenge (synthetic biology being an area of science where engineering principles are applied to biology, making new systems). Alongside lab work, where team members use genetic engineering techniques to create a biological system, it is also important to consider whether the project is ‘good for the world’, thinking of it in a social context.  Ethics, safety, sustainability… in short, how does the project transfer from the lab to life? This area of iGEM is called Human Practises, also concerned with how the public engages with the project, and with synthetic biology as a field.
It’s easy to think of science and humanities as wholly disparate disciplines, but iGEM, and in particular the questions raised in Human Practises, provides the perfect opportunity to show how important it is for them to interact, and exhibit the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach. Our Newcastle iGEM team is made of students with really diverse backgrounds- biological sciences, computer science, agriculture… to name a few! As an English student, I can hopefully offer another new perspective.

Katie Bodner
is a sophomore at MIT studying biological engineering. Her research interests span drug delivery, neurobiological systems and tissue regeneration, but she is especially excited by synthetic biology. Katie is interested in the biomedical applications of synthetic biology, specifically in ways in which we can make cancer therapeutics easier to engineer by designing circuits to detect and destroy cancer cells. iGEM interests her because of the unique opportunity to design a project with extraordinary applications such as cancer therapeutics or biochemical synthesis along with other undergraduates who are also passionate about synthetic biology and under inspirational faculty mentors. After MIT, Katie hopes to pursue her Ph.D in Biological Engineering and reach her goal of improving the lives of those affected by unfortunate diseases and carcinomas.  Katie is also the assistant sports editor of The Tech newspaper, a sister of Alpha Phi Sorority and a Resident Associate Advisor to freshmen in Maseeh Hall, an undergraduate dormitory.
Nathan Kipniss
is a member of the class of 2014 at MIT studying Biological Engineering. He decided to participate in iGEM not only to conduct interesting research, but also to develop the ways of thinking required by original work. Previous to iGEM, he studied host-pathogen interactions and systems biology research at the Broad Institute under the direction of Dr. Nir Hacohen. His research interests include systems biology and regenerative medicine. After undergraduate studies at MIT, he then hopes to pursue a career in biological engineering that will solve medical problems. While not in lab, Nathan is a cellist in the MIT Symphony Orchestra and the secretary of Simmons Hall.
Felix Sun
is studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (course 6-2) as a member of the MIT Class of 2015.  He is participating in iGEM because he thinks engineering biology can solve a wide range of problems, in areas ranging from health care to energy to food.  For him, iGEM is an opportunity to experience the excitement firsthand, and to evaluate synthetic biology against his own EECS-related interests and abilities.  This will be Felix’s first biology-related research role.  Outside of iGEM, Felix is a member of the Experimental Study Group, a unique and storied learning community at MIT.  He sings in concert choir, helps run the Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament, and works for the online math enrichment site Art of Problem Solving,"

Communication with Assistant Professor Randy Stockbridge from the University of Michigan
One thing our team learned in the lab is that science isn’t always predictable and our experiments were certainly no exception. We made an unexpected observation from our experiments characterizing the growth of the ∆-crcB knockout E. coli, (basically wild-type E. coli with the fluoride channel knocked out):
∆-crcB can grow on high concentrations of fluoride (1-2mM) provided there is a wild-type strain growing on the plate next to it.
Our mentor helped us hypothesize some reasons why these observations could be occurring. For the first observation, we hypothesized that either the growing E. coli are secreting an essential metabolite, or, there is a fluoride scavenging mechanism in E. coli.
To seek helpful insight as to our observations, we emailed Randy Stockbridge, an Assistant Professor from the University of Michigan who has expertise in fluoride toxicity/protection mechanisms in E. coli, who told us everything she knew about fluoride toxicity. We learned that it is intimately linked to environmental pH, meaning much more fluoride enters the cell when the pH is low (HF crosses the cell membrane more readily than the fluoride ion). Dr. Stockbridge suggested we try doing serial dilutions on plates that were highly buffered to see whether there was a possibility that the phenotype is pH linked. Her prediction turned out to be spot on! Our updated results illustrated that buffering the plates results in a delayed growth of the delta-crcB strain on 1mM F when grown near WT, compared to the unbuffered plates.
Interview with Hydrogeologist and Water Quality Specialist Laura Craig
Q: On August 8, 2017 our team had a skype conference call with Laura Craig, the author of “Recommendations for fluoride limits in drinking water based on estimated daily fluoride intake in the Upper East Region, Ghana” - an important document for our team during the early stages of project development. Ms. Craig has a background in water resources and water quality. She also lived for a year in a rural community in Ghana where she observed daily life and worked on finding cheap ways to remove excess fluoride from drinking water. To see the questions and answers of the interview, continue reading below.

Overview
To better our project, we have done four bravo jobs as our human practice.
First, we shared the beauty of synthetic biologyour, a topic which we presented and promoted in front of our schoolmates and also to those in Taipei American School. Enthusiastically sharing our ideas, we met up with some of the iGEM teams in Taiwan and China, taking part in the conference and sharing knowledge.
Second, we cooperated with other team to combine different technique that would improve our project. We help NTU-Taida characterized their BioBrick devices, the ACE (BBa_K1157020) and CEA (BBa_K1157021).
Third, we determined to build up an easier way in doing experiments for those who are not that familiar with the basic experimental techniques. We have made some videos of doing experiments. They are the way we teach students how to conduct wet lab experiments.
Fourth, we tried to make our project a practical application to the environment. We had lots of interviews with experts concerned and beekeepers. More importantly, we have gone to bee farms and help the beekeepers to check if their bees were infected by Nosema ceranea. We also created primers to identified Nosema ceranea. This provides a fast and precise way to find out Nosema ceranea besides barely using microscope.
Our wish is to change the world in a tender way and make others soaked in the overwhelming astonishment of biological wonder.

""Should We Edit the Genome?"" Forum Collaboration with Duke University
The Building With Biology tools and information have been utilized by many for its unique approach to teaching and spreading information about Synthetic Biology.
We reached out to Duke University iGem and together, we organized a forum using tools from Building With Biology. At the forum, we discussed a rather relevant and hotly-debated subject: Should We Edit the Genome? When, Why, and How Much? .
CRISPR refers to gene editing techniques that can cut and edit DNA at precise locations. With these systems, researchers can permanently modify cells and in the future, may be able to correct mutations in the human genome to treat different diseases. CRISPR uses the Cas9 enzyme to cut DNA strands, and can be matched with ""guide"" RNA (or gRNA) strands that can lead them to the target sections of DNA.
Although our project does not specifically utilize CRISPR technologies, we understood the significance of this new technology and its applications. Through this forum, we were able to gain a more complete understanding of CRISPR technology and the ethical and societal implications of its use.
The program for this forum was as follows:
- 10 minutes: Introduction and welcome from Duke University professor about CRISPR technologies.
- 10 minutes: Background Information
- “What is CRISPR”? 90 second video by Carl Zimmerman.
- 50 minutes: Read through and discuss applications of CRISPR technologies, and ultimately decide whether or not to implement the application, and restrictions on the application.
We were delighted to facilitate this discussion and hear the opinions of the public on the societal and ethical impacts of using CRISPR technologies. A common opinion that was voiced throughout the forum was that at this time, gene editing should not be used for clinical reproductive purposes, especially because the risk cannot be justified by the possible benefits. Many countries have passed legislation banning the genetic modification of the hunan genome, but in 2016, the United Kingdom licensed the use of CRISPR on embryos. When we touched on this, the general consensus was that this decision could push science to uncharted territories, including ""designer babies"".

Current Synthetic Biology designs are generally small scale and produced manually, using large amounts of specific domain knowledge. The development of automated computational tools that utilise Computer Intelligence has the potential to extend the scale of possible designs, providing the framework for genome-scale engineering.  Work on the automated design of simple devices will be the basis for research into the full or partial automation of the full Synthetic Biology process. Important to this will be investigating the role of programming languages in defining high-level design specifications, how they can best abstract the complexity of the underlying biology, and how they can usefully incorporate computer intelligence algorithms and representations of genetic parts.

I am a PhD student in synthetic biology. At crossroads between molecular biology and engineering, synthetic biology is a science trying to crack the code of life by building it. I want to understand how DNA governs many facets of biological life forms from microscopic regulations at the cellular level to such macroscopic phenomena as senescence, cancer, intelligence and self-awareness. I want to pursue research on building cellular machineries that can perform “simple” defined tasks. Ultimately, I want to design a framework genome that would serve as a platform for programming microbes or cellular machines.  In fact, building such a synthetic genome is a reality still far into the future. Currently, I am set out for an interim research goal: given a mathematical model of a synthetic genetic circuit, determine the what and how of in vivo measurements in terms of resolving discrepancies between the model and the world. This research calls for other enabling studies such as microfluidics, molecular quantification and directed evolution. I have background both in computing and biochemistry. I have worked on various projects involving robotics, artificial intelligence, process control, neural cell recording, animal behaviour measurement and molecular biology.

3. Project Design
3.1 Introduction
In this part, we will illustrate how we designed our project in a Q&A way.To help you understand our project better, this section will be divided into 3 parts: Plasmid Design, Equipment Design and Test Design.
3.2 General Design
3.2.1 Q: WHY choose to control the locomotion of C.elegans?
A: At first we wanted to make out something FANCY for people can see, so controlling the locomotion of C.elegans become the first choice. Besides, this work has some potential in treating paralyzed animal, even maybe treat people in the future. Right now, there are already researchers successfully made paralyzed mouse move it leg muscle again.
In all kinds of expressions of locomotion, the study of forward and reverselocomotion serves as an entry into understanding theworm’s motor circuit. And we also tried to control the turning of C.elegans. If we can make the worms go forward, go back and turn left or right, we may create something like Snakylines, which is fancy and attractive.
3.2.2 Q: HOW to control the locomotion of C.elegans?
A: At first we have to find neurons or muscles which are related to the movement of C.elegans. Next step is trying to activate or restrain these neurons and muscles by expressing channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) or its improved versions. As we have illustrated in project background, ChR2 is a channel which is located at the cell membrane. When use appropriate light toirradiate the worm, the particular tissue will be activated or restrained, and then the whole C.elegan will be controlled by the light.
3.3 Plasmid Design
3.3.1 Q: How to express ChR2 at the certainneurons and muscles we want?
A: We use specific promoter to drive the ChR2 at the specific tissue. Besides, we also tried to use cre-loxp system for 2 promoters which can overlap at one single neuron. This may be a good way to express at single neuron. (Unfortunately, this experiment failed at last.) After reading papers, we choose 5 promoters at last.
Pmyo-2: Encodes a muscle-type specific myosin heavy chain isoform. Myo-2 is expressed in pharyngeal muscle. We supposed that we can use pmyo-2 because it expresses specifically in pharyngeal muscle, which may lead worm turning when irradiated by appropriate"
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," existing ecosystems, BeeT must be engineered to die if it leaves the beehive. To accomplish this we made use of an optogenetic kill switch and a Cas9 kill switch.
The optogenetic kill switch is the unification of two different genetic systems: a toxin-antitoxin system native to E. coli (MazEF), and an artificially-created promoter system activated by light (pDawn). The toxin MazF is only expressed in the presence of light, because MazF is regulated via pDawn. The antitoxin MazE is constitutively expressed, to protect the cell against leaky expression of MazF. This means that in the darkness of the beehive, where blue-light irradiance is close to zero, no toxin is produced. This allows the cells to remain stable. However, in sunlight toxin production takes the upper hand and the cell dies. Figure 9 demonstrates that the pDawn promoter system works. Alongside pDawn we tested pDusk, a promoter system activated in the absence of light. This promoter system did not provide a strong enough response to be useful for our intended purpose.
Figure 9. Response of pDawn- and pDusk-expressing E. coli to intense blue light (equivalent to the component in direct sunlight) and total darkness. Left: cell pellets. Right: fluorescence over OD600. Fluorescent protein mCherry is used as a reporter.
The artificially-created promoter systems pDusk and pDawn were modelled in Matlab together with the MazEF toxin-antitoxin system. We fitted the model to literature data and can conclude that our model describes the system’s behaviour in the wet-lab well for pDusk and pDawn. Within our parameter estimation procedure for the extended pDusk + const. mazF and pDawn + const. mazE systems, we found two parameter sets which satisfy the conservative constraints. This is described in the optogenetic kill switch modelling section . The results from these two sets can be seen in the animated Figure 10. With increasing light intensities, the response of MazE and MazF is plotted. This gives us an indication on where in parameter space our focus should be for future studies and how the model should be extended with further wet-lab experimental data. In addition, Figure 10 indicates that it takes a few hours for the MazF toxin to take the upper hand in the pDawn system. Backed up by literature data, we can assume that the beekeepers can open their beehives"

Approach 2
Overview
ComR approach details
Still with the aim of creating a rapid UV-response system, we elaborated a second approach based on a regulation pathway, the ComR and ComS system, originally found in Streptococcus thermophilius. Our goal is to produce a UV inducible promoter.
ComR and ComS mechanism
The ComR and ComS system controls natural competence and allows quorum sensing in S. thermophilius.  ComS is a small peptide encoded in the genome. After synthesis, it is matured and extruded from the cell into the medium. The peptide’s import allows other cells to sense the signal. When a basal level is reached it will trigger a competence in the whole population.  Indeed, once reimported in the cell the ComS will be able to bind ComR protein. This will allow the formation of a ternary complex (peptide-protein-DNA) with a specific DNA motif (ComR-box) and trigger the downstream gene’s expression (See schema here below).
Our little trick?
The ComS’s mature sequence is LPYFAGCL. An aromatic’s substitution by an alanine would block the binding to ComR. Hence our objective is to synthetize this peptide while replacing the tyrosine by a tyrosine-ortho-nitro benzyl (tyr-ONB). This should indeed prevent the binding unless there is some UV exposure and the ONB or photocage is released. This will result in the gene’s expression controlled by the ComR box’s  induced by exposure. Using a red fluorescence protein should signal the UV exposure.

Successful cultivations of Escherichia coli KRX with oprF and gldA in our Microbial Fuel Cell.
NADH overproduction for the gldA strain improves extracellular electron transfer mediated by NADH and resulting in an 20 % increased bioelectricity output.
Escherichia coli KRX with oprF shows 100 % higher voltage and electric charge than E. coli wild type. Electron shuttle-mediated electron transfer across the membrane is greatly improved by heterologous expression of outer membrane porin oprF.
Our preferred riboflavin production strain, E. coli KRX equipped with <bbpart>BBa_K1172306</bbpart> , was thouroughly characterized.
The overexpression of Riboflavin synthase beta subunit RibE, which belongs to the rib-gene-cluster <bbpart>BBa_K1172303</bbpart> . was examined by MALDI-TOF MS/MS with a Mascot Score of 906 against the NCBI database.
We proofed the production of riboflavin qualitatively through LC/MS measurement.
Measuring the fluorescence of supernatant samples from our riboflavin production strain together with riboflavin solutions of known concentration enabled us to make predications regarding the amount of riboflavin produced by our strain.

Lack of better chassis
Nowadays, Synthetic Biology studies are limited by a few numbers of chassis, such as bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).
One of the major problems of drug therapies are the side effects: other non-target tissues can be affected, causing discomfort or even causing the appearance of another syndrome. A treatment directed at the diseased location without affecting surrounding tissue, may be more effective and cause side effects of lower intensity and less severe.
A problem-solving approach
A brand new chassis!
The protozoan Leishmania is a good new chassi:
1) It has the ability to infect macrophages (Selvapandiyan et al., 2004);
2) It has the ability to express proteins with proper post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and disulfide bonds;
3) It has the ability to deliver those proteins inside macrophages.
Leishmania: relax, it is biosafe!
The visceral Leishmania donovani strain with the virulence factor Centrin-1 deleted (LdCen1) has very low risks of contamination, and its virulence reduction has been evaluated and confirmed with different animal models, such as mice (Selvapandiyan et al., 2006), hamsters (Selvapandiyan et al., 2009), and dogs (Fiuza et al., 2014).
The genetically targeted and defined attenuation reduces the risk of reversal to virulence, a concern generally raised for attenuated organisms that are created by random genomic mutations.
LdCen1 deletion specifically attenuated the amastigote stage of the parasite that replicates inside macrophages, and has no effect on the growth of the promastigote form (Selvapadiyan et al., 2012).
In addition, we propose a kill switch system based on the genetic control of enzyme 3'-nucleotidase/nuclease, which is crucial for the purine rescuing on the promastigote form of Leishmania, the one which is spread by the sandflies, aiming to keep the modified parasite from spreading. The enzyme's synthesis would be regulated by a Tetracycline repressor and so the Leishmania would be cultivated in the presence of Tetracycline.

We propose the use of an optimized visceral Leishmania strain to direct IFN-β to specific macrophages associated"

WASTEWATER TREATMENT
Demand
According to Polyferm, a Canadian polymer company, bioplastics are not in high demand due to high cost of production. If they were produced at a cost and efficiency similar to petroleum-based plastics, demand would increase. To rephrase, there will be a demand for bioplastics once an efficient large-scale process is developed. This application would thus only make sense if our E. coli produce PHB with high efficiency.
Cost
The cost of implementing pure cultures into current wastewater treatment systems is extremely high, as this process would require new, separate systems. Currently, the Pine Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Calgary processes about 1 million cubic meters of waste per day. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and PHB yield were assumed to be 1000 mg/L and 0.11 kg of PHB per kg of COD, respectively, for our calculations. We estimated that 28,100,000 kg of PHB would be produced per year for wastewater treatment facilities in Calgary. With a price of $5 per kg of PHB (Choi & Lee, 1997), we estimated revenues of $140-141 million.
Impact
There is limited impact felt by the average consumer, and municipal taxes may actually increase to account for the costs in implement this system. However, if successful, this system could help PHB become a desirable alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics. PHB is also a higher-value product than the biogas already produced in wastewater treatment plants.
