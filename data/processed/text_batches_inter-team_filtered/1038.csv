Stuttgart,2017,Team:Stuttgart#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"avored products such as soft drinks and candy (2). The (L)-Limonene form has a more harsh fir-like odor with a lemon-note (2). For our project we choose an enzyme-cascade, beginning with acetyl-coA and leading to the product (L)-limonene. This biosynthetic pathway was designed and inserted in E.coli (Fig.2).
Figure 8: Limonene fragrance pathway from E. Jongedijk and K. Cankar et. al (E. Jongedijk and K. Cankar et. al 2016).
Extracellular expression of Esterases, Lipases, Keratinases and fragrance molecules
(Choi und Lee 2004; Mergulhão et al. 2005)
In our project we aimed to secrete the produced enzymes.     We used E. coli, a gram negative bacteria with two membranes that needed to be crossed from the enzymes. E. coli naturally doesn’t secrete high amounts of proteins which forced us to add a signal peptide to achieve secretory production of the enzymes.     With this additional step we aimed to save valuable money and time in the production process of our biological tube cleaner.
In principal, the secretory production of recombinant proteins has several advantages. These include:
easier downstream processing (no cell disruption and easier protein purification)
correct protein folding (avoidance of the formation of inclusion bodies) to keep biological activity
less protease activity in the periplasma and in the media than in the cytoplasma –> no protein degradation
better access to the substrate  higher enzyme activites
better disulfide bond formation in the periplasm because of the non reducing environment
There are two main mechanism that are used for secretory protein production, type I and type II mechanism.    Type I is a mechanism consisting of one step across the two cellular membranes without a periplasmic intermediate.    One disadvantage of type I mechanism ist hat the signal peptide remains attached so an additional cleavage step is required to obtain the mature protein.    Type II mechanism can be divided in three submechanisms: SecB-dependend pathway, SRP pathway and TAT (twin arginine translocation) pathway.    Type II is a two step mechanism.    The non processed proteins are attached with a a signal sequence and exported to the periplasm.    The premature protein is processed into the mature protein by cleavage of the signal peptide.    The SecB pathway is the mostly used way for the extracellular production of recombinant proteins."
TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Project#Appendix_-_-_TEXT.html," main types of land mines: Anti-personnel (AP) mines and anti-tank (AT) mines. Anti-personnel mines are specifically designed to reroute or push back foot soldiers. These mines carry enough explosive material to kill or disable their victim. They can be activated by pressure, a tripwire or remote detonation.
Additionaly, There are three main types of AP mines that can be divided as following [3]:
Blast mine: This type of mine is usually buried only a few centimeters beneath the surface and is activated by a pressure plate. It is designed to destroy an object in close proximity and to break it into fragments to cause secondary damage.
Bounding mine: This type of mine is propelled to a height of approximately one meter when triggered, before the main charge is ignited. In this way, it damages the vital parts of the victim instead of the legs.
Fragmentation mine: This type of mine releases sharp fragments in all directions when activated. It is able to cause injury at distances up to 200 meters away and kill at closer distances. The fragments used in the mines are either metal or glass. Fragmentation mines can be bounding or ground-based.
Anti-tank mines function in a similaressentially the same way as AP mines, but the pressure needed to detonate them and the amount of explosive material is several times bigger. AT mines are capable of destroying tanks or armored vehicles and kill the people in or around it [3].
USE OF LAND MINES
Land mines as we know them today where first used during the first world warFirst World War as defense against tanks. These mines where very large and easy to detect. Often enemy soldiers would remove the mines for their own use. To prevent this, the first anti-personnel mines were developed[4]. The use of land mines as an important offensive and defensive weapon started in World War II [5]. The use of land mines reached its peak in the Cold War, especially in the conflicts in Vietnam and Afghanistan[6].
The use of land mines provides military strategist with the ability to provide a defensive barrier around vulnerable sites and utilities, channel enemy troops into a unmined area where themselves would be vulnerable to attack, deny the enemy access to utilities they might need, even after those placing the mines have withdrawn, and assist in surprise attacks and ambushes[5]. Originally, land mines were laid in clearly marked fields. However, the use of land mines shifted from use against military targets to use against civilians, in order to terrorize communities and prevent population movement. For this purposecase, mines were placed at random locations without any specific pattern [7].

Modelling
We created simplified molecular models of YAP1P:SKN7 and MSN2/4 regulation during oxidative stress response
We created two molecular models of the regulatory mechanisms of YAP1P:SKN7 and MSN2/4 transcription factors which focus on the main species involved in their regulation when the Gpx3 protein (ORS sensor) quantity increases. These models are depicted below in the figures 5 and 6.
Figure 5. The molecular model of the activation of Yap1p and Skn7p. Gpx3p = thiol peroxidase, Crm1p = Karyopherin for Yap1p export from nucleus, Pse1p = karyopherin for Yap1p import into nucleus, Trx = thioredoxin, YFP = yellow fluorescent protein.
Figure 6. The molecular model of Msn2/4p activation during the oxidative stress.PKA = protein kinase A, P = phosphate, Msn5p = karyopherin involed in exporting Msn2/4p from nucleus, TRX = thioredoxin, cAMP = cyclic AMP.
We simulated the Yellow Fluorescence Protein (YFP) production during stress with a mass action model in COPASI software
We ran a series of simulations on a range of different values involved in the model of YAP1P:SKN7 mechanism, including kinase activity, plasmid quantity, Yap1p degradation rate, transcription factor concentrations and promoter binding rate. Below (figure 7) we show a plot of the overall behaviour of the protein production given our model and parameters.
We support the model in which Not4 is responsible for Yap1p degradation
During the run of our simulations, we observed a tight relationship between the degradation rate of Yap1p and the Not4 activity rate. We support the validity of the model suggested in (Glushan et al. 2012) since this model reflects a prediction of protein which fits our estimations and expectations. We show a plot (figure 9) below, which shows the behaviour at which the Yap1p:Skn7 complex stabilizes in dependence of Not4.
We support the findings that transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7 participate actively in the initial stress response mechanism of the cell
According to our results on protein production, our cells show a specially high initial response, shown as an exponential function. This response maintains until the quantity of plasmids gets saturated and the protein"

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," principles that any lab with a plate reader can use. The procedure involves the measurement of GFP expressed by E.coli DH5α which has been transformed with plasmids expressing GFP, each of which has a different promoter or ribosome binding site. The measurement involves the use of a plate reader but, optionally, a flow cytometry measurement could also be performed for more data to support the standardizing procedure. Our team was more than excited to provide flow cytometry data but we couldn't get the appropriate calibration beads on time.
Materials and methods
All plasmids used have the standard pSB1C3 backbone which has the high copy number pMB1 Origin of Replication resulting in 100-300 copies in each cell. The plasmids also have the Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene which detoxifies the antibiotic chloramphenicol providing resistance and therefore a selection ability of transformed bacteria when grown in LB-agar plates with it. The negative control only has an extra TetR promoter while the all other constructs have a promoter site, a ribosome binding site, GFP and two terminators built in them. The GFP gene is the same in all constructs (E0040) but the promoters and the ribosome bindings sites vary. The promoters were recovered from a library screened by Chris Anderson and each of them has a different strength. Three different ribosome binding sites were used; the first being a weak one based on Ron Weiss thesis (BBa_B0032), a strong one based on Elowitz repressilator (BBa_B0034) and the bicistronic design element Number 2 (BCD2) (BBa_J364100) designed by Mutalik et al (Mutalik et al. 2013).
Plate reader measurements
The first step is to obtain a ratiometric conversion factor to transform absorbance data into a standard OD600 measurement through the use of LUDOX-HS40 (provided by iGEM) as a single point reference. This ratiometric conversion of 600nm absorbance into OD600 normalizes variances in data obtained from instruments with different sensitivities. The absorbance at 600nm is measured in both ddH2O and LUDOX and the corrected absorbance is calculated by subtracting the water reading. The Reference OD600 defined as that measured by the reference spectrophotometer (0.0425; value provided by iGEM) is then divided by the corrected absorbance and the result is the correction factor. By multiplying the absorbance at 600nm measured by each instrument, with the correction"

In 1796, the term ""vaccine"" was introduced when Edward Jenner found that cowpox virus could be used as vaccine to prevent smallpox, a global epidemic disease. Before smallpox vaccine was found, around 400,000 people in Europe died of smallpox every year. Many more people were blind or disfigured due to smallpox infection. However, this life-threatening disease has been completely eradicated after development of the vaccine more than 200 years ago. The discovery of vaccine also helps to ensure that infectious diseases, such as poliomyelitis, measles, and hepatitis B, are under control.
Nowadays, researchers are still struggling to find more suitable vaccines for other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Huge amounts of resources were invested to develop and improve vaccines production. Because most vaccines are used in developing or undeveloped countries, the cost of the vaccine should also be considered. The value of vaccine industry is highlighted in Investing New: “the global market for vaccines may only comprise about 2% to 3% of the total pharmaceuticals market but this sector has, and continues to experience a stellar growth rate of 10% to 15% per year versus the 5% to 7% seen in the overall market, according the World Health Organization (WHO). Totaling just US$5 billion in 2000, today the global vaccine market is worth an estimated $24 billion and is projected to rise to $100 billion by 2025.”
Acknowledging the importance of vaccines, the CGU_Taiwan 2016 iGEM team wants to know more about the vaccine industry. In the meanwhile, we would like to understand whether Leijuvant , the new concept of adjuvant, will provide a new approach in vaccine research and development.
Our goal:
Vaccine development is a lengthy process from bench work to market. It involves intensive research in biotech company‘s R&D Department, clinical trials in hospitals, and public education. We contacted all three major groups in Taiwan to get a complete picture of concerns and regulations on vaccine development as well as the current market demand.

Our project is Flavorator. We show its system working  under real-world conditions  in India . Because India has a problem about storage of foods.   We want to spread Flavorator  to the world , and we thought that our Flavorator can solve such as its problem. This is why we choose India.
According to Assocham that is Joint Chamber in India ,  30 percent of the total harvest of agricultural crops in India have been discarded by lack of refrigerated storage facility .  Refrigerated storage facility is insufficient in the retail market in rural areas and suburbs.In 2011, Refrigerator penetration  in the cities is 43.8% , and the villages is 9.4%(fig1). The penetration  in rural areas is much smaller than the city . Its cause is considered that  supply of electricity are not yet ready. To solve this problem, there is a need for method of preserving  food products that do not require electricity in rural and suburban markets. Our Flavorator does not require electricity. So, we considered that it is used in situations such as the India, and designed Flavorator.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#SiruiNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  There is a huge difference between what we designed for the Balsamiq prototype, and what is designed as the paper prototype for the video.  I think it might be a good idea for me to go back and document everything, for later.
The idea of ""shutters"" that we've used is finally clarified.  Ready for the video tomorrow!
Tuesday, 6/26: Created a paper prototype video for the MoClo planner.  The youtube link is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPr-D4vAGAM Doing this again reminded me of the process last year, when we did a video as well for G-nomeSurfer pro.  I remember struggling a lot with narrations and talking about gestures while explaining the design.  But now, making the video and creating the narration seems simple and almost second-nature.  :)
Wednesday, 6/27: We got some feedback from Traci today on the design for the MoClo planner.  She would also like us to include in the primer designer component the reverse complement sequence created for the reverse primer.   Also, I guess we also forgot some really important information for primer designer that we included in the Optimus Primer design last year- stuff like checking for different kinds of dimers, secondary structures, melting temperatures, etc.  We will have to add that for later.  Also, including the destination vector in the primer designer would be important, but that's something we'll focus on more when the primer designer is being implemented.
Also, I started looking more into Eugene today; I think Orit wants us to look at Eugene and use that as part of the back-end for the MoClo planner.
Thursday, 6/28: Continued looking more into Eugene and getting familiarized with the terminology.  It seems that there is great flexibility in the language when it comes to syntax and definition.  Something to focus on for the future, though- do ""permute"" and ""product"" really do what we think it does?  It seems that permute might be useful for creating Level0 and 1 modules for the MoClo planner.
We took down observations in different wet labs.
Friday, 6/29: We met the MIT 2012 iGEM team today, and had social hour with the BU team as well.  We went to an interesting physics lecture talk by Professor Walter Lewin, which was taped by NHK, the Japanese national broadcasting station.  Members of the team visited the MIT iGEM wet-lab.  We'll be back to visit team meetings in"

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

We deside to constructe two composites that can produce Cph8, termed c-Cph8 and enzymes we need, named c-PCB, seperately.
C-Cph8 basically contains BBa_R0010, BBa_S03419 and BBa_B0015. The combination of BBa_S03419 and BBa_B0015 first succeeded at the beginning of August. The sequence report suggest the correct sequencing information of both BBa_S03419 and BBa_B0015. Sadly, problems came to our experiments when we tried to recover the BBa_R0010’s seed conserved by ourselves. The seed we conserved on that day was somehow polluted so that we failed to extract the correct and available plasmids. So we just finished the construction of BBa_S03419 and BBa_B0015, termed BBa_S05053, which contained an RBS, BBa_I15008 and the terminator BBa_B0015.
C-PCB is expected to produce the two vital enzymes, ho1 and pcyA that catalyze the procedure of conversion of haem into PCB. We planned to combine BBa_J13002, BBa_I15008, BBa_K081024 and a reporter protein(mRFP) together. When we finished the combination of BBa_K081024 and BBa_I13507(mRFP), we were astonished to find out mRFP was expressed without Cph8. Meanwhile, the combination of BBa_I15008 and BBa_J13002 failed. The good news is that the sequencing report confirmed the sequences of BBa_13002, BBa_K081024 and BBa_I13507 were seperately right. Unfortunately, the inversion of BBa_I15008 succeeded but we lost the correct seed due to an accident. As a result, we finished the combination of BBa_K081024 and BBa_I13507, termed BBa_S05054 automatically by partsregistry.org.

Modifying and Improving the Existing Biobrick
1. Previous biobrick: BBa_K190031 of 2009 iGEM Groningen
    The new part: BBa_K2262015
     The metallothionein (BBa_K190031) is a fMt(BBa_K190019) under control of a low constitutive promotor (BBa_J23109). We failed several times in replicating the ligation of these two parts. After sequencing these three plasmids,                         we found BBa_J23109 has two Spel restriction sites in the prefix.(Figure 3.) Figure 4 shows the electrophoresis of BBa_K190019 when its plasmid was cut by XbaI and PstI and Figure 5 shows the electrophoresis of BBa_J23119                         and BBa_J23109 when their plasmids were cut by SpeI and PstI. Thus, we decided to modify the biobrick by ligating fMt(BBa_K190019) with another constitutive promoter, BBa_J23119.(Figure 6.)

Perception of Synthetic Biology
Government
Synthetic biology is not a great interest for the government. The  5 major fields in science that the government announced to actively develop are logistics and supply chain management enabling technologies; nanotechnology and advanced materials; and textiles and clothing. Synthetic biology was not included in this category (""Hong Kong the,"" 2013).
Also, due to the conspicuous achievement of economy and business sector, science is not the major focus of the Hong Kong government. According to the 2013 Policy Address, there are only three plans slightly related to science field. One of them says that the government will provide software and hardware support for the industry, academia and research sectors to foster co-operation and examine the patent system of research and development results. Since development of innovation and technology is elevated to a very important strategic level in the National 12th Five-Year Plan, Hong Kong, which has a close relationship with China, will also provide more platforms for scientific research collaboration between the Mainland and Hong Kong. This may help improve the people’s awareness to science and may focus more on the sophisticated field like synthetic biology (""HKSAR the 2013,"" 2013).
According to the speech during the Synthetic Biology 4.0 meeting by Mr. John C. Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong in 2008, the government aimed to make technology a key pillar for shaping Hong Kong as an advanced knowledge-based society. He also mentioned that since the connection between Hong Kong and Mainland China is very close and China is a potential market of new technologies, Hong Kong would like to play an important role in promoting scientific research in Asia. Moreover, Hong Kong has the advantages of free-flowing ideas, strong protection for intellectual property rights and solid law basis. These can provide a fertile environment for creativity and innovation. Therefore, Hong Kong has the potential to develop innovative science and technology (""Press release,"" 2008).
Public
The public awareness on synthetic biology of Hong Kong citizens was surveyed by the  HKUST iGEM 2011 team. The result showed that 44.48% of the respondents reported that they had heard about synthetic biology. The aspects of synthetic biology that the public was most concerned were the scientific processes and techniques (25%), the possible risks (20%) and the claimed benefits (17%). The moral and ethical issues received less attention (9%). The respondents’ overall impression about all the newly developed technologies and the focused biological technologies were both more likely to be positive, but close to"

Urban Tundra team meets the Honourable Deron Bilous
Although Alberta hosted many successful iGEM teams over the years, much of that success was not well known in Edmonton. Our team was completely student-run in beginning, having raised the registration fee ourselves as well as finding lab space to perform our experiments. While it did build a lot of character and work ethic, having to build an iGEM team from scratch was very difficult and not ideal for future teams. We wanted to inform the general public and students all over Edmonton about iGEM and the amazing field of Synthetic Biology, in the hopes of inspiring the next generation of iGEM teams and other synthetic biology ventures within Edmonton. UrbanTundra pursued this goal in a variety of ways.
Community Outreach
We visited three different middle / elementary schools in the Edmonton area, all in various parts of the city. We performed experiments and team-building exercises, like strawberry DNA extraction and cup-stacking  with the students, as well gave introductory presentations on genetics and genetic engineering. Synthetic Biology isn't in the standard Science curriculum of Alberta, and genetics is not introduced until high school. So, for many of the students we presented to, our session with them was their first time hearing about the field of Synthetic Biology. Our campaign's main demographic includes students aged 8 to 14. Our hope was that these students will take interest in genetic engineering as they come into high school, and form iGEM teams of their own.
Media
We were featured in an article in the newspaper the Edmonton Examiner where we discussed the foundation of our team, how we discovered iGEM, what iGEM is, and how we came about our research idea. As well, we explored the implications of our research project and the future of space exploration. This really helped promote our team for our crowdfunding campaign on Experiment.com, and showed people across Edmonton that student-run research initiatives can be successful. Hopefully, this article can bring more awareness to the public about student groups"

Therefore, measurement at a single wavelength was insufficient to determine the identity of the carotenoid; we might need to use “456nm:474nm” ratio instead. It would be interesting to see the effect of mixing different amounts of lycopene and β-carotene, and whether the “456nm:474nm” ratio can indicate the relative percentage of lycopene and β-carotene. In the current project, we were unable to obtain pure lycopene due to high cost of purchase.
In terms of inducing β-carotene production, 1mM arabinose, acting on Pbad promoter, was able to produce a level of synthesis close to that under constitutive promoter. In the non-induced population, there was probably a small degree of “leakiness” and basal level of gene expression (leading to some β-carotene synthesis). In future experiments, it might be helpful to move the pigment-producing devices to low copy plasmids and reduce the effect of such basal expression.
One possible design using our devices is to construct a system where lycopene is constitutively produced and CrtY, which converts red lycopene to orange β-carotene, is controlled by external stimulus. Hence, the red cells will turn orange upon sensing the specific external stimulus, and this change in colour serves as the signal output that can be detected visually and measured quantitatively at low cost.

H2O2
Outline
We created the circuit below.  Every experiments are added the same concentration of H2O2. With reporter succeeding to the promoter, we could figure out whether the result was caused by promoter or not. And then there is the terminator we would test. After the terminator is the T7 polymerase which would open up the subsequent positive feedback. Besides, we used the other  fluorescence protein as our second reporter. By testing the fluorescence from the second reporter, we could know how much proteins would be expressed on this site. Our control is the similar circuit without positive feedback below.
Methods
Before the experiment, we placed 1 ul bacteria liquid into 2 ml LB and put them into incubator for experiment on the next day. After growing the bacteria, we sucked a few liquid we cultured before, testing the OD value respectively. If the OD value is lower than 0.5, put the liquid into incubator again, repeating the step until the OD value is up to 0.5. In every well, we add mixture of M9 buffer and H2O2. The concentration of H2O2 is 1mM where is the best range where ROS promoter could switch on. Then we put control and experiment sample which have been cultured overnight and have the same OD value into wells. Then measure the OD and fluorescence value of samples through thermo varioskan flash. After using thermo varioskan flash , put 96 wells back to incubator for another 1 hour. Repeat the measuring and culturing steps for 10 points. At last, analyze the data with wavelength of green and red light.
Result

Test the lethal dose of ethanol to honey bees
Introduction
In the midgut of the bees, where filled with ethanol, there is a big problem that whether Bee. coli could survive the ethanol before the bee died. To find the answer, we have to understand the persistence of the bee to ethanol.
Background
Harnessed honey bees readily consume 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% ethanol solutons.
95% ethanol will also be consumed as long as the antennae do not make contact with the solution.
With the exception of 95% ethanol, consumption as measured by contact time or amount consumed does not differ in animals that consume 1%, 5%, 10%, and"

Ø One thing that is uncertain is whether the AANAT could be secreted with endogenous secretion systems, and if they can, whether it could retain its enzyme activity. We chose two pathways to test out, the Sec, or general secretion pathway, and the Tat pathway. The Sec pathway is what wild type ecoli mainly use to export stuff, however we weren’t sure whether it would be suitable in our situation. The main difference between the two pathways is that the Sec pathway transports unfolded protein through the inner membrane, which folds in the periplasm while the Tat pathways transports folded proteins. We will use GFP as a proxy for AANAT and overexpress the two different pathway signals. For Sec, we will use the endogenous MalE signal while for the Tat we will use a modified TorA signal that was created by Kyoto 2012. For the Tat pathway, we also want to test a modified version, also by Kyoto 2012, which includes a phage shock protein to increase transportation efficiency. We also want to test out whether we can increase the transportation efficiency not just through the inner membrane, but through the outer membrane as well. To test this, we will put a Kil gene on inducible promoters in both constructs. The Kil gene increases efficiency by causing “rips” or “holes” to appear in the outer membrane. This could cause the AANAT to “leak out”, but also at the same time, it can kill the bacteria if over-expressed.
And finally after testing the secretion efficiency, we will test for AANAT activity with a colorimetric assay.

PROTOTYPE
It is estimated that about 95% of nanoparticles (NPs) used in consumer products end up in wastewater (Mueller & Nowack. 2008). Our goal is to apply our biofilm and Proteorhodopsin (PR) bacteria in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove most NPs before the effluent is released into the environment.
WASTEWATER TREATMENT
What is the process?
Figure 5-1 Typical wastewater treatment process. Figure: Yvonne W.
When wastewater enters a plant, the first step is to remove coarse solids and large materials using a grit screen (figure 5-1). The water can then be processed in three main stages: Primary, Secondary, and sometimes Tertiary Treatment (Pescod 1992). In Primary Treatment, heavy solids are removed by sedimentation while floating materials (such as oils) can be taken out by skimming. However, dissolved materials and colloids—small, evenly dispersed solids such as NPs—are not removed here (Pescod 1992). Secondary Treatment generally involves the use of aeration tanks, where aerobic microbes help to break down organic materials. This is also known as the activated sludge process (Davis 2005). In a subsequent sedimentation step, the microbes are removed and the effluent is disinfected (often by chlorine or UV) before it is released into the environment. In certain WWTPs, wastewater may go through Tertiary Treatment, an advanced process typically aimed to remove nitrogen and phosphorous, and assumed to produce an effluent free of viruses (Pescod 1992). However, Tertiary Treatment requires additional infrastructure that is expensive and complex, limiting its global usage (Pescod 1992; Malik 2014).

Figure 1: ThreaDomEx prediction of domain boundaries of the spAimR (x-axis) Position of the amino acid in AimR sequence (Vertical axis) Domain conservation score.
Although the automatic annotation system suggested that AimR consists of 3 domains, visual inspection of the graph suggests (i) an N-terminal region of low domain conservation, probably a loop (ii) a major N-terminal DNA binding domain (iii) a connection lowly conserved domain, probably a loop again and (iv) a major conserved C-terminal domain. This is perfectly in line with the experimental structure [2]. Based on these results, phAimR was split into 2 parts: one from 1-191 and the other from 192-378. These domains were rerun using I-Tasser and compared to the experimentally verified protein structure. The results are shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Overlay of experimental phAimR and predicted structure by running the two domains separately. We show near perfect overlay between the predicted and the experimental structure.
Visually, the splitting of AimR into its two major domains has vastly improved the prediction quality, with near perfect overlap. Next, the degree of overlap between the AimR domains predicted by I-Tasser was quantitatively compared to the experimental structure by calculating the root mean square distance (RMSD), which should be minimal. The results for I-Tasser and CHmodels are shown in Figure 3. The results show that I-Tasser produces a model that is very close to the real experimental structure, confirming the visual observation from above.

In summary, the modelling team finds that I-Tasser, while computationally expensive, is the best protein structure prediction tool for new AimR homologs. Our results also show that prediction accuracy can be improved drastically by predicting the structure of the DNA and peptide binding domains of the AimR homolog separately.

Plasmid-Sensing Logically and Adjustably Cell Killer
Monitoring Plasmid Numbers
Kill the Slacker
In the procedure of large-scale industrial
production, due to the random distribution of
plasmids in the process of bacteria proliferation
and division, the bacteria containing less
plasmids will gradually become the
“slackers”.
Generally, we aim to avoid these undesired
bacteria become the dominant population.
There is no efficient way to prevent the birth of
plasmid-free bacteria and the applied ways are
only limited to the laboratory-use.
What about equipping the bacteria with a
plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer
(P-SLACKiller)?
Here is killer’s basic rule:
Kill the slackers (Plasmid number is below the
threshold);
Save the workers (Plasmid number is above
the threshold).
Worker-P：Cell containing our P-SLACKiller.
Surprise! We can guarantee the microbial
population structure stay optimal now!
Our team divide the project into 4 parts as below.
Why not click and have a look?
Our P-SLACKiller
Plasmids are losing, and the production efficiency is decreasing. Let’s equip the bacteria with a plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer (P-SLACKiller) to kill slackers with less plasmids among bacteria!
Threshold Device
In what situation can the bacteria be judged as slackers? There must have a threshold concerning plasmid numbers. Let’s find it out and adjust it accordingly.
Killer Device
For the slackers, they should be able to turn on the self-killing switch. We tried toxin proteins to produce the lethal effect.
Optimization
The executor killer should be stably maintained, so we integrated killer device into the genome. Moreover, we mutated promoters to adjust the threshold.

Thus we have covered hundred of miles to the city of Bordeaux by joining a scavenger hunt, based on questions about biology and iGEM projects, with team of Bordeaux , KU_Leuven , EPLF-Lausanne , Paris-Pasteur , Aix-Marseille and Toulouse . The meet up gave us a unique opportunity to present our respective projects in a popularize fashion so it could be accessible to an audience unfamiliar with the principles of synthetic biology in the premises of Science Museum in Bordeaux ( Cap Sciences ). A theatre expert gave us a constructive feedbacks and valuable advices about our presentation. Besides popularization activities, we participated to a discussion about the project of the iGEM Pasteur team and answered a survey helping them to consider impact of the throw of plastic waste in the oceans. Finally our team conducted a debate about biosafety and how it is important to consider it in each iGEM project.
7th September - Meet up Leuven
The iGEM team of KU_Leuven invited us to join the synthetic biology and ethical Symposium hosted at KU Campus of Leuven (Belgium). It was a great opportunity for us to present our 2015 project in front of an audience composed of scientists and other iGEM teams ( TU Eindhoven , Amsterdam and KU_Leuven ). We also have had the chance to attend conferences covering various aspects of the synthetic biology such as the functionality of a minimal synthetic organism, Cell-Free living, or even further by an introduction to the entrepreneurial opportunities offered by synthetic biology.
21st August - Skype Aachen
We had a chat with both the iGEM Aachen and a Community German lab to lead a reflection on biosafety in experiments and more precisely on potential applications of our SafetE.coli project among iGEM community but also for external labs. The experience was an opportunity to present the principle of our physical containment system and to raise questions about its use limits. Moreover, the debate led us to get valuable informations about determining vital cellular concentration using a measurement capacity applicable in our physical containment system .

Next, we test the effect of mazF. We transformed the constructed PcspA-mazF plasmid into BL21, added 1 mM IPTG to the plate, and cultured at 16℃ for 16 h (Figure 11A). We then cultured BL21 transformed with the PcspA-mazF plasmid overnight at 16℃. After diluting to OD=0.2 on the next day, the cells were cultured at 16℃, and the OD value was measured every hour for 9 hours (Figure 11B). From Figure 11 below, you can see that our kill switch can work at low temperatures. Although some engineered bacteria still survive, we believe they will be effectively killed in the absence of nutritional support.

5 ml Overnight cultures of 5 of the cultures derived from the transformations two days ago were made in SD-U medium with ampicillin.
Day 9
Cryo Cultures and Plasmid Isolation
We prepared cryo cultures with 1 ml of yesterday´s overnights and isolated the plasmids from the remaining culture. As an alternate first step the yeast cell walls were lysed with beads by vortexing cultures in buffer with them for 30 minutes instead of the bacterial lysis buffer.

Comparing its spectrum with the one provided from the database seems to be (z)-11-hexadecenal, a desired pheromone,  which is being produced by the plant itself using an endogenous alcohol oxidase. Nevertheless as it is produced with a low yield, the FAO1 of C. tropicalis search is still in progress.
The rest of the samples were prepared for the GC-MS analysis.
The samples were weighted, introduced in the vial and added with EDTA and CaCl2.

Results of the replicae analysis are shown below:
In this replica, the sample with the TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos construction shows a huge production of (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol.
In this replica, the sample with the TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos shows a higher abundance of (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and z-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate.
In order to verify that the analysed compounds are the desired pheromones, we acquired standards for (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate and (z)-11-hexadecenal, and indeed, the analysed compunds were the right ones.

We had problems to amplify the FAO1 gene, so in order to obtain it we performed a colony PCR. Using this method, it is possible to amplify a fragment directly from a colony rather than a DNA sample.

Prospect:
Time control and other issues can be explored and verified through a large number of experiments and finally be improved and optimized.
This technology can avoid the cost of purchasing expensive instruments. As a POCT detection instrument, it has a certain prospect for development. It can be portably used in remote mountainous areas because of the traffic inconvenience. It can also be used at home in the detection of the tumor markers, such as Alpha fetal protein, CA724, CA15-3, or the early detection of Hepatitis B virus.

ShingSun is a modern production enterprise, which owns independent intellectual property rights by independent innovation and development, with the goal of producing suitable domestic and foreign modern clinical laboratory instrument. Firstly, we introduced the project, the design and the function of our hardware. After understanding the whole project, the Chairman Fu from ShingSun provided valuable advice for our shortcomings, and a new insight, which is Precision Medicine. Our current detection is based on the protein level, if the disease detection can be successfully achieved from the gene level in the next step, this will be a big step forward in the field of Precision Medicine.
Current problems:
The accuracy of protein detection is too low. Gene chip is not mature in clinic.
The persons who do not receive training feel it difficult to operate.
Prospect:
It would be better if we use microfluidic device and the develop our device toward POCT; We can set one or a few kinds of disease as the detection object, and focus on the faster, more accurate and more convenient detection. We can set small hospitals and clinics which cannot afford large instruments as our target client, and monitor the diseases fast and cheaply.

Background
Overview
On April 20th, the 12th International Conference on Gastric Cancer was held in Beijing, China. The experts at the conference disclosed the number of newly discovered cases of gastric cancer in China in 2017—680,000, which accounted for 50% globally.
Background Information
Suan Jianbing, a kind of fermented pancake, is a staple food in Shandong Province, China. Recent research has reported that this dietary habit will probably increase the risk of gastric cancer, and the carcinogenic rate is 260% higher than people with a normal diet. This appalling number is largely due to nitrite, which is generated in the fermentation process.
It is not the only case in Chinese cuisine. Salted Pork is a popular food in Zhuanghe, Liaoning Province, where residents like to add it to most of the dishes. All the families prepare home-made salted pork at the beginning of every winter. They put the pork in a large jar, spread a layer of large grain salt on it, and then preserve it for a whole year. During the process, a large amount of nitrite is formed, which may induce cell concretization after the chemical reactions with bacteria and increase the risk of gastric cancer.
Fig 1. Gastric Cancer in China
Another example is found in Changle, a coastal city with high incidence of gastric cancer. The investigation has found out that most gastric cancer patients have shrimp oil and cured fish in their diet. Some even use shrimp oil to cook three meals every day.
These cases reveal the danger of nitrite. Yet the nitrite itself is highly toxic. Nitrite reacts with amines and amino acids to produce N-nitrosamines that are carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic. These compounds are formed by the reaction of secondary a"

This graph shows the obvious effectiveness of introducing LacI binding sites into a high-copy plasmid (when the copy number ~ 10^2). Also, it shows that If X is high the effect of introducing tandem repeat is greater(by comparing Z/Y = 100 and 1000).
With Larger/Smaller k Than That of LacI
For reference, we write some graphs with larger/smaller k, to apply to other transcription factors.
If k==10^6:
If k==10^7:
If k==2.4 * 10^8 (LacI)
If k==10^10:
These graphs show that as k is increased, the effect of introducing binding sites becomes bigger.

Cardiff_Wales,2016,Team:Cardiff Wales_-_-_TEXT.html,"ind project was significantly influenced by our conversations with experts involved in many areas that are important to consider for this type of diagnostic tool. These included a diagnostic biologist, an ethicist, Cardiff University safety officers and a retired nurse who specialised in the treatment of STIs. These interactions are highlighted within our human practice pages.
In addition we aimed to improve the function of the Vibrio Fischeri LUX operon, initially submitted to the Standard Registry of Parts by Cambridge in 2010 (a project which we termed FUEL ). We aimed to characterise the stokes shift of the LUXoperon light output in the prescence of the mKeima RFO-varient in both coregulation and coexpression experiments conditions, with potential applications in physiological imaging and more complex circuitry.
We have  undertaken collaborative work with Oxford, testing the efficacy of copper chelation utilising fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and WashU, to whom we provided analysis of ATP synthesis by their PCK and PGK constructs.
Finally we have taken the opportunity to engage with the public in a variety of outreach activities where we have highlighted the general potential of synthetic biology as well as discussing the specifics of our own project.

Results: Binding of anti-phyA to phyA was not observed in RIfs. Yet, at both measurements was faced some problems: much of the protein was washed away from the spotted spot. → We have to take lower concentrations for spotting (100-400 ug/ml) Anti-tYFP to YFP binding could not be detected aswell: Actually, this wont work on PDITC since all of the expression mix proteins also bind to the spot, compete with the (already low concentration) YFP for binding → almost no YFP can bind to the spot.  We have to repeat experiment for cellfree expressed YFP/GFP with specific surface (e.g. Ni-NTA)

They characterized the alx system with both the promoter and the pH riboswitch, while we did it only with the riboswitch, this gave us an oppurtunity to compare the effect on pH sensitive regulation by the RNA thermometer and pH riboswitch.
University of Sydney
University of Sydney has helped us to troubleshoot the problems that we were facing with ligation. They suggested some ideas that aided in the improvement of the protocol that we followed and also pointed out some of the possible mistakes that we could be making while ligating  our parts. We were also provided with a protocol for troubleshooting ligations and transformations which enabled us to  optimize our protocols. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE PDF.
Indian iGEM Meet-up
We had the chance of meeting all the other Indian teams at the All India iGEM meet-up held at IISER Pune. Each team presented their project, received valuable feedback and explored various avenues of improvement. It was also good to know about the projects that the other teams were working on which helped us to consider the possible platforms for collaborating with them.

The result shows that the colour has changed besides plasmid with lipase (Figure 11), showing that LipB2 gene is correctly expressed in BL21 E. coli.
         Linking and setting the groups Experimental group:plasmid after digestion + target gene + T4 DNA Ligase + buffer Control group: plasmid after digestion *Experiment conducted under 16°C
1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

Figure 11  LipB2 gene in BL21 E. coli
Mathimatical models
    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0."

Beijing_Normal,2008,Team:Beijing Normal#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," at a concentration more than 0.1mM will induce the activate PpcbC and thus increase gene expression downstream. The activated threshold of PpcbC is relatively high, so this pathway will be activated when main PCBs degradation above has began.
3. Control on the amount of PCBs molecular that enter the cell.
As dihydrodiols (first step product) and dihydroxybiphenyls (DHBP, second step product) are very toxic to bacterial even after short incubation time, we design a feedback repression pathway use sRNA components— sodB and rhyB. Part of sodB was fusion with bphA and biosurfactant pathway and will be repressed by rhyB[4] which is under the control the promoter Ppcb. As only when rhyB molecules is much more than sodB fusion mRNA, it will play a role of repression, only the high concentration of DHBP will arise this reaction. This design will control the amount of PCBs molecular that enter through the membrane.
4. System guarantee
In our design T7 amplification system is used to amplify the signal. T7 polymerase is added downstream the main degradation pathway. When T7 polymerase is translated, it will activate the T7 promoter and downstream reporter gene, YFP. Then the signal could be detected. This system could be used to test the function of the degradation pathway.

Team USTC
UTSC has been one of our traditional collaborators.
Focusing on the establishment and improvement of a online synthetic biology community this year, USTC, as potential users of our bio-hub, offered us opinions and needs in application design and homepage design. For example, they suggested adding an online forum named ""iGEMers' Notebook"" in which iGEMers can exchange important information and ideas concerning this competition .They also helped them with biological problems they came across, such as the biological background of comparative sequence analysis.
In return, we share them with some useful tricks. And we also help them in website making and modeling, which speed their work greatly. Besides, we held the annual Science and Technology Week and Science and Technology Exhibition, which spread the synthetic knowledge to the public."

Lab Report + New milestones (all)
Volker wrote a timetable on the whiteboard: Which experiments will be done when? --> Photograph!
Thaumatin
Milestone from last week: Comassie Gel, Integration starting?
No band for Thaumatin visible on SDS-PAGE
To Do / Next Steps: IEC (Ion Exchange Chromatography), New gels with new cell lysates (bigger batch), mass spectrometry of protein
Limonene
Milestone from last week: Assays @ Schwab?
Limonene (produced in vitro by citrus limonen synthetase) could be detected in GC-MS, Smell test was performed (different cultures of yeast smell differently!)
To Do / Next Steps: Take culture supernatant for GC-MS (--> in vivo experiment), new versions of smell tests, toxicity tests, luciferase assay to detect the pyrophosphate which is formed during the reaction, purify a larger amount of enzyme, compare expression of limonene synthase with and without consensus sequence (--> cell lysate --> western blot) , mass spectrometry of protein
Biobricks: With and without consensus sequence, different promoters/terminators
Caffeine
Milestone from last week: large scale expression of all three enzymes, All three cassettes finished
Three 1 L batches (1 per enzyme) are currently being done --> expression of each enzymes
Big expression cassette (all 3 enzymes) not finished, all other parts are done.
To Do / Next steps: Harvest cells/enzymes, purify/isolate enzymes, perform enzyme assays, detect caffeine @ prof. Hoffman, mass spectrometry of proteins
Coumaryl
Name will be changed to xanthohumol. Emphasize the fact that other products (such as resveratrol) can be produced if the first 2 enzymes of our pathway are combined with other parts from the registry
Milestone from last week: New Cloning + Western Blot
New cloning steps are finished, all mutations are removed (all except PAL, which still carries some mutations), BioBricks are complete.
The mutations of PAL can be explained: probably due to a natural occuring difference between the organism from"
UC_Davis,2012,Team:UC Davis#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we used the spectrophotometer and the OD600 readings were over 1, which signifies we overgrew them. The error came from placing the cells in the 37 °C room instead of at room temperature. Oops. So we then remade the component cells for the MG1655 strain and extracted genomic DNA from the MG1655 and DH5α E. Coli strain. Luria Broth was made, and we incubated the starter culture and made inoue transformation buffer. We miniprepped the parts that were transformed yesterday, and sequentially digested B0034 and B0034+E0240 at the E site with plans for the X site to be digested on Wednesday. The PCR products from yesterday were ran on a gel to confirm the products, and then a purification was run, and the process was repeated twice. In the area of protein engineering we looked over the Swiss-Model generated 3D structure and confirmed its realism. The energy diagram showed that LC Cutinases sequence fit quite well into the model of 3VisB. We also performed an overlap of the two models, the newly generated LC Cutinase model and 3VisB’s model, in order to check how well they matched. We received an RMS value of .78A, quite good. Minipreps ran B0034, J23100, B0034+E0240, B0034+C0012, R0010, K20600
Wednesday July 18th
Today genomic DNA from DH5α and MG1655 was purified and we restreaked DH5α cells from yesterdays sample. The purified PCR from yesterday was also put on a gel and extracted. Some of our team members also began working on the modeling of the cutinase enzyme using computer software to see how we could optimize degradation. More research was done in regards to making sure we had all the materials and that the assays to be conducted were also looked into and finalized. A gel was also ran of the purified MG1655 and DH5α genome. Going further with our generated model of LC Cutinase we wished to create the two ligands with which it would interact, PET and pNPB. We did this in SMILES (a structural file generator). We then looked to fit these ligands into LC Cutinase’s active site in pymol and load that file in Foldit. Ran gels on minipreps and performed gel extractions and purification.

Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

We then digested them using BamHI and KpnI. The gel screen of the digestions was inconclusive, but we decided to proceed with the ligation regardless. We also made liquid cultures of ‘’PpkiA’’ and ‘’TxlnD’’.
We miniprepped the overnight cultures of pAK13CQ colonies and regrew new cultures for pAK13CS and pC13DJ.

No pC13DJ grew, but we were able to run a PCR of all pC13CQ and pC13CS colonies, and a PCR cleanup of pC13I. The PCR showed that pC13CQ cultures 1,2,4, and 5 were all good. The ligation was likely at fault for failed pC13CS, as those appeared to have only ‘’PT7’’. We also electroporated and plated pC13DJ, pC13DP, pC13CV, and pC13BD without any arcing!

Part III: Collaboration with UBC : IP issues encountered by iGEM teams
Introduction
The University of British Colombia team was also interested in intellectual property issues. They sent to each team a survey to understand what kind of IP issues are encountered by iGEM teams? Do IP issues hinder iGEM project? What level of IP knowledge have iGEMers?  We were glad to see we were not alone on IP planet, so we contacted them to share our works. UBC has accepted to give us their survey results and in exchange we commented their poll and their FAQ, we also answered their survey. 281 iGEMers had answered the survey when we treated it.
This collaboration enabled us to broaden our reflexion to iGEM teams' issues.
Teams and IP experience
Firstly, we studied former iGEMers' experience with IP . In a graphic we summarize the answer to two questions:
Do you have a past experience regarding the IP ?
Was your past experience in the context of a past iGEM project or outside of it ?
Only a few iGEM participants experienced dealing with IP issues. However, it would have been interesting to know their age in order to know if both data were bounded.
Besides, a patent experience seems to be often linked to a different project than the iGEM one, the reason probably being the special functioning of the iGEM contest in which most of the tools needed (such as the plasmid vectors) are provided without any intellectual property rights. Outside of iGEM, of course, such tools are obviously not freely supplied, which may result in a patent experience if the materials used are under a proprietary license.
Nonetheless, these answers do not reveal what these past experiences are. To test our hypothesis (iGEMers acquire IP experience outside of iGEM because patented materials are not used) we got interested in the nature of iGEMers' IP experiences.
Nature of the IP experience
In this study, those who had an IP experience had to explain what its nature was. The results are that most of them (46%) had already used patented materials before. However, 15% gave up actually using them, which shows how patents can impede research and innovation : getting a license may be dissuasive, especially in France where the Research budget is limited.
The next answers are related to the current iGEM projects. The poll shows clearly that patents"

By communicating with the doctors from West-China Hospital Sichuan University, we learned that most of the patients did not understand the knowledge of hyperuricemia, resulting in poor compliance and therapeutic effects in the course of treatment. Moreover, through the statistical analysis of the questionnaire survey from hyperuricemia patients, we found that the understanding degree and attention degree of the disease in patients with hyperuricemia were very scarce and they were in need of more education. Therefore, based on the above two reasons, we have made handbook to publicize knowledge of hyperuricemia to the public, and increase the understanding and attention to hyperuricemia.
Our handbook included what is hyperuricemia, the causes of hyperuricemia, relationship between hyperuricemia and gout, prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia, food purine content list, as well as our team and the introduction of our project. On the day of the scientific exhibition in the Chengdu library (see below), we sent out nearly 500 handbooks to passers-by, and answered to their questions patiently and detailedly. We sincerely hope that the public can strengthen the understanding and attention to hyperuricemia, which is not only beneficial to the therapeutic effects, but also is more conducive to improving the health level of the whole nation.
CCiC 2017
From August 26, 2017 to August 28, 2017, team SCU-WestChina went to the fourth Conference of China iGEMer Community in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University in Fuzhou, Fujian. During the three-day feast, iGEM teams from different provinces and cities interacted with each other to discuss their own projects. Guo Wen introduced our project design and achievements this year to the people, which has got everyone's attention and high recognition. In addition, we were present as observers to listen to the first generation of young scholars in China who participated in iGEM, and the reports of outstanding scientists in related disciplines. We also attended the speech of iGEM HQ members and senior judges from the United States and participated in the face-to-face exchanges with them. We learned about the projects of other teams and asked them questions or communicated with them. All of these have enriched our knowledge, broadened our thinking, and had the potential help to our project.
It is especially worth mentioning that the judge of this conference Zhang Haoqian, who is also the senior predecessor of iGEM, expressed great interest in our subject. In addition, we had a separate in-depth discussion and he gave us a"

Modeling: Optics
Background Information: How Fluorescence Works
Fluorescent molecules absorb light of a certain wavelength - the excitation wavelength - and emit light at a longer wavelength - the emission wavelength. This longer wavelength corresponds to lower energy photons, which means that part of the excitation light's energy is dissipated. In addition, energy is lost along the path of the light rays: when passing through mirrors and aperatures etc. Overall, energy losses due to the poor quality of optics for fluorescence microscopy may result in the total inability to detect fluorescence in biological samples, which is often very weak anyway.
For OpenScope, we have designed a module for epi-fluorescence imaging (epi meaning ""from above""). The pathway of light is illustrated below:
The excitation light from the LED passes through the excitation filter and reaches the dichroic mirror (which itself is also a type of filter - an interference filter) at a 45° angle. The dichroic mirror reflects light of that particular wavelength that is then focused onto the sample through the objective. Emitted light from the sample passes through the emission filter to eliminate all wavelengths save those in the range of fluorescence emission. The dichroic mirror is transparent for light with the emission wavelength, so that it reaches the camera CCD.
Overall, the purpose of the filters is to maximise the excitation light reaching the sample and the emission light reaching the CCD, whilst minimising the amount of excitation light reaching the CCD. Hence the question that arises is:
How do you choose the appropriate filters for the particular fluorescent protein that you need to image?
Key Features
In summary, features of a good filter set (three filters required in total in this setup) are:
High light intensity at excitation wavelength reaches the sample
High light intensity at emission wavelength reaches the CCD
High contrast on CCD: emission light intensity much higher than background levels
Minimal stray excitation light"
