Thank you to Zach Holmes for freelance engineering the ACME Stomach Masher.
Thank you to Kate Harper, Jackie Heilbronn and Jackie Glenn for assisting in the printing for the various merchandise required for the Dundee iGEM team.
A special thank you to Erin Stanbridge for being highly organised and arranging all our travel and visa paperwork for the events that we’ve attended throughout the course of iGEM. We don’t think we’d make it to Boston without you.
Thank you to Dr Jacqui McElhiney and her team at Food Standard Scotland for guiding our project into what it has become today.  We'd also like to thank Katherine Allan at the Veterinary Medicines Directorate in the Department for Food, the Environment and Rural Affairs for guiding our project into a real-world application.
PiCLS Symposium for giving us the platform to practice our iGEM presentation. We really appreciate the opportunity to do so and received valuable feedback with regards to the presentation, allowing us to improve upon it for the Boston jamboree.
We would like to thank IDT for giving us 10,000 free bases for synthesising gBlock Gene fragments. This made our summer so much easier, one less PCR makes all the difference.

I spent this summer working in the wet lab and I received help from all other wet lab members in order to finish experiments and to plan our constructs. When I was attempting to produce the full length colicin control constructs, Rachel and Chris helped me with cloning and to verify the constructs through gel analysis.  I received a lot of help from the advisors Fatima, Alex and John when completing a new procedure or when I had any questions.  I was involved in creating the Bactifeed and received a lot of help from John as he had experience in this area allowing me to carry out these experiments well and receive good data.
Fatima Rehman
Whilst working in the dry lab, I got a lot of help from Lucas for the mathematical modelling. He would give me different tasks to focus on, to help me build my knowledge within MATLAB – we then went on to carry out mathematical modelling. Professor Davidson also assisted and guided me throughout the modelling stages. He pushed us to improve ourselves with our presentation, with his vast knowledge and experience of iGEM. Fatima helped me in the lab when I was carrying out my plate reader experiments, helped edit the presentation and also helped me improve my presenting skills.

Stocked primers VF2 and VR: storage stock (100µM) and working stock (10µM).
Colony PCR of transformants from yesterday with primers VF2 and VR followed by gel electrophoresis. Gel picture yielded no bands. This might be attributed to a fault in the transformation.

María
Transformation of same BioBricks as on 5th July using a different transformation protocol since we believed that the negative result was due to a mistake during transformation.

María
Finally, the plasmids containing K1149051 and BBa_E0840 yielded a few colonies. However, the ones containing the promoters did not. Thus, we believe that the distribution kit plate containing the promoters is defective and the mKate ligation also featured some problems.
11th July 2016
Lycka
To test whether the distribution kit might be the problem, transformation of BBa_J23113 in OneShot® TOP10 chemically competent cells (Invitrogen) to make sure the transformation process is not the cause of the negative results. Also, a plasmid containing a construct from last year's team (CsgA) was used as a positive control.
For the mKate construct we will obtain the backbone from another construct instead of the linearized backbones from the iGem distribution kit.

8.1 ColicinE2 Plasmid Map
Overview
Our goal is to engineer a synthetic toxin-anti-toxin system from the wild type Colicin E2 (Col E2) operon. This synthetic toxin-anti-toxin system is species specific, allows for population-level suicide, complete genome degradation, and will function on a tunable delay . The Col E2 toxin, called the activity protein, is a DNase, meaning that it cleaves DNA, which targets related species of E.coli. The Col E2 anti-toxin, called the immunity protein, binds the Col E2 activity protein with high affinity preventing the activity protein from acting on its own producing bacteria. Our idea is to clone the activity protein and the immunity protein on two different plasmids, called toxin and anti-toxin plasmids, so we can switch on the suicide mechanism by degrading the anti-toxin plasmid with the restriction enzyme system . To test our system, we cloned the immunity protein under the Lac promoter inside a medium copy plasmid. We tested our system by showing that this inducible system protects the cells from the Col E2 activity protein. The next step will be to place the activity protein under a constitutive promoter  inside a low copy plasmid; work which is ongoing.

Background
What are Colicins? Bacteria have developed mechanisms to kill other bacteria in order to reduce competition between themselves in the environment [1]. Some strains of E. coli produce lethal proteins called colicins which kill sensitive bacteria, including related species of E. coli. Colicinogenic cells contain specific immunity against their own toxin, and their colicins only effect cells containing specific receptors on their  outer membrane surface. Colicins are therefore classified by the receptor to which they bind to, for example, colicins E1-E9 bind to the outer membrane (OM) protein BtuB which mediates the entry of nucleosides, siderphores, and vitamin B12 in the cell. Colicins E1-E9 are also Group A colicins, meaning that they are translocated through the cell envelope by the Tol machinery, whereas Group B colicins are translocated through the cell"

Future work
To promote MoDeL for wide use as a standard, we need to refine the structure of MoDeL definition and extend its content to enable descriptions of more biological process. In the future, the new version of MoDeL will be proposed and new functions of iGame will be added.
Next version of MoDeL
MoDeL is young, to be exact, just born. There must be a long way before he can stand up and run by himself. At this stage, we have to take extra care of him. Knowing the drawbacks of MoDeL, we have already got a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in the next version of MoDeL. They are:
Enhance MoDeL to support description of intra-molecular reactions.
If it is applied, our software will become a useful tool to study the competition mechanism between intra-molecular and inter-molecular reactions.
More powerful substituents.
Only six kinds of substituents are far from meeting the demands of more accurate modeling and complex reaction mechanism. At present, substituent parts are limited to match only parts on one chain, and they are not allowed to represent a structure with more than one chains and trees. This needs the extension of definition of substituent parts by designing a unified format that can provide enough information.
Enable description of transcription and translation reactions.
Currently, transcription and translation are handled differently with other reactions. It is necessary to modify MoDeL to incorporate description of the two reactions.
Eliminate the inconsistencies.
In the current version of MoDeL, a bunch of inconsistencies exist. For example, the identifiers of compartments follow different restrictions from other global identifiers, and some components’ attributes are required to be a certain value. These problems make MoDeL not so elegant when looking at details. Work must be done to improve its consistency.
Be more independent.
Currently, some of MoDeL syntaxes are defined for specific algorithms of iGaME. Being a language for automatic modeling, cooperation with algorithm is reasonable. However, we believe there are too many compromises, thus causing a number of inconsistencies. In the next version, we are looking forward to a more independent MoDeL.
New functions of iGaME
iGaME grows together with MoDeL. In the one-year process of software development, we have achieved many of our goals, and found even more to be achieved. Looking ahead, we have the following wishes for iGaME"

We shared many details of the IGEM competition. Besides IGEM, we also discussed many frontier life science progress and appreciated their unique views.
We then showed them our lab space and facilities, including cell sonicators, ultra-centrifuges and flow cytometry. We explained the principles using analogies and metaphors. The IDPI ended around 6 pm and we can see through their eyes and faces that these high students were reluctant to leave. As one of the visiting students commented, this tour was 'so impressive and amazing'. We believed that the one day IDPI truly delivered the IGEM core value by arousing their curiosity to explore the secrets of nature. A few days after the visit, the teachers contacted us to consult us for building a biology lab. We really hope that this is the beginning of another amazing adventure!
Poster
During the investigation of intestinal diseases, we realized that IBD is a world-wide threat to human health with a great morbidity and severity. And we found that, unfortunately, public awareness intestinal diseases like IBD is insufficient.
Thus, we decided to introduce IBD and its hazard to the public. The symptoms, diagnosis and related information about IBD were collected.
A poster was designed by our team to show the public that IBD is threating our health, and we need basic knowledge about it. The poster includes the definition, morbidity, diagnosis, symptoms and potential causes about IBD. Our IGEM project Gutrio and the idea to utilize synthetic biology to treat IBD were also introduced.
We have introduced IBD to many communities, and wish more and more people to realize the severity of IBD.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.

It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.       An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question ""What is the meaning of my life?""      The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness,      or even a feeling of sacredness.

Calgary,2011,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journals#OLD ENTRIES_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria carrying the construct made previously were used to run a colony PCR and the products were kept for running an agarose gel to confirm them. cells from the colonies (two plates carrying the construct) were used to make an overnight culture.
Emily, Robert, and Patrick went to the town of Bassano, Alberta as volunteers for Let’s Talk Science. In exchange for helping do some of the labs, they introduced iGEM and microbiology research to students in grades 6, 8, 9, and 12.
June 2, 2011
We ran an agrose gel to confirm the products of the colony PCR, however the gel was old and had been exposed to light so the results were inconclusive. A gel was also run to test whether the restriction digested parts (used to make the construct) had been properly digested. the cell culture from the previous day was miniprepped, and the isolated plasmid (construct containing I732019, 1AC3, I0500) was restriction digested as was the stock of I0500.
June 3, 2011
The restriction digested parts from the previous day and the colony PCR parts were used to again run a gel to confirm their identities. This time a freshly made gel was used. Another colony PCR was prepared to be run over the weekend.
June 6, 2011 – June 10, 2011
June 6, 2011
A gel was run for the colony PCR performed over the weekend. Also all the previous stocks of I0500 were removed from the freezer and restriction digested then run on a gel. The I0500 that displayed complete digestion after 70 min was then selected to remake the construct made the previous week (I0050, I732019, 1AC3). The construct was then used to transform top10 cells which were plated.
Discussed plans for the week. A poster for the ISMOS-3 conference on Monday is required. Patrick is working on this.
June 7, 2011
Hardly any colonies could be observed on the plates from the previous day in the morning so the construct was remade again and TOP10 cells were transformed and then plated. Later in the day several colonies were observed on the plates containing the transformed cells from the previous day so the colonies were used to run a colony PCR and cultured overnight. TOP10 competent cells were also cultured overnight with the intention of generating new cells.

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Puppetshow_-_-_TEXT.html," the current working database implementation, output sample (e.g., a restriction digested part) information is stored with associated history.  This sample history comprises the individual samples that were utilized to create the output sample (i.e., the buffers and enzymes, etc.) as well as the associated protocols that were executed.  This entire flow has been implemented but is missing a viewer component that will allow users to visually explore the different histories of samples within the database.
Protocol Graph Editor
The concept of a protocol graphs focuses on an ideal and simplistic hierarchical representation of biological protocols.  The graph itself is a directed bipartite graph composed of protocol nodes, sample nodes, and connection arcs.  The bipartite label implies that protocol nodes can only connect to sample nodes and vice versa (sample nodes are input(s)/output(s) to/from protocol nodes).  With such a representation, complex biological protocols can be translated into a (potentially large) but scalable and useful graphical representation.
Avi Robinson-Mosher, a postdoctoral researcher in the Silver lab at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, has shown interest in a protocol graph editor.  We are collaborating with the Silver lab over data structures and database organization regarding the implementation and storage of protocol graphs.
Integration with eLabNotebook
The eLabNotebook application uses a protocol representation to display procedural steps for wet lab convenience.  Ideally, a layer of communication will coexist between PuppetShow’s database features and the eLabNotebook’s central server configuration.  Generated protocol graphs and associated reports, created by users in Trumpet or any software tools created by future iGEM teams, will be stored on an identifiable server.  The eLabNotebook will then pull and parse the information from the server to provide accurate, up-to-date information for the laboratory environment, thanks to PuppetShow's ability to transfer data between applications.
Integration with Trumpet
Trumpet already generates reconfigurable constructs in the form of Clotho “composite parts”.  This data model is already adaptable to the Puppeteer assembly flow, so it will be very feasible to execute protocols from Trumpet’s output.  This feature can be implemented as soon as a standard for implementation is finalized.
Protocol optimizer project
A potential project proposal involves the algorithmic assembly of protocols.  This procedure would be completed on an abstract level, where a sophisticated evaluation of available resources is used to generate optimized protocols.  The available resources would comprise samples within the database, both previously-created and newly-entered, that are paired up with protocols to provide efficient output creation.  The ingenuity"

Mutagenesis forward primer: CGCTATTATCGTCTTTATCACTAGCCGATCAGAGTTTGCGACTCTAAC
Mutagenesis reverse primer: GTTAGAGTCGCAAACTCTGATCGGCTAGTGATAAAGACGATAATAGCG
However, site-directed mutagenesis attempts were unsuccessful, so the gene was extracted in two parts using (i) comE forward primer & mutagenesis   reverse primer; (ii) comE reverse primer & mutagenesis forward primer. The two fragments were then ligated with the pSB1C3 backbone through Gibson Assembly.
PcomCDE
The promoter region of the comCDE operon only contains 67bp. By estimating the position of the transcription start site of PcomCDE, the total size of the   promoter region should be 89bp. We obtain the promoter region by oligo annealing. In designing the forward and reverse oligos, we added the XbaI cut site to the prefix and   SpeI cut site to the suffix at the two ends of the oligos respectively. The backbone pSB1C3 was used. PcomCDE was ligated with GFP generator (BBa_E0240), which   contains a RBS (BBa_B0032), GFP (BBa_E0040) and double terminator (BBa_B0015). The purpose of this construct is to measure the functionality of PcomCDE in the presence   and absence of phosphorylated ComE by green fluorescence. BBa_E0240 was obtained from 2014 iGEM distribution kit. The bacterial strain of E.coli used was DH10B. We have tried to   ligate PcomCDE with BBa_E0240, but unfortunately due to time limitation, we were not able to verify the sequence of our ligated products.

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project Idea#Pre study_-_-_TEXT.html," D ligands control multiple critical biological functions and play different roles depending on the type of the tissue targeted and on the mechanism(s) involved in the cellular signaling. These compounds, acting mainly through their nuclear receptors (vitamin D receptor—VDR), protect the epidermal melanin unit and restore the melanocyte integrity by two main mechanisms (reviewed in Birlea et al.33): controlling the activation, proliferation, and migration of melanocytes and the pigmentation pathways, and modulating the T cell activation that is apparently correlated with the melanocyte disappearance in vitiligo. The multiple effects of VDR on immune cells lead to the recognition of vitamin D as a potent immunomodulator.” - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo, p.19
“Experiments using normal melanocytes62,63 and melanoma cells64 of animal and human origin showed a stimulatory effect of vitamin D compounds on melanocyte differentiation and tyrosinase activity. Studies showed that topical application of vitamin D3 on the epidermis of mice increased the number of DOPA-positive melanocytes.65 Indirect data about the stimulatory effect of vitamin D on tyrosinase were provided by animal models fed with vitamin D, which in contrast with vitamin D-deficient animals showed a greater skin tyrosinase activity in response to UV irradiation.66” - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo, p.19
(“Opposed to its stimulatory effects on melanocyte differentiation, vitamin D was also reported to have an inhibitory effect on the melanocyte growth,67–69 an effect that was confirmed on several other cell types as well. As such, vitamin D has been shown to act as a regulator of replication in keratinocytes, and has been reported to coordinate the growth arrest in several types of cancer cells such as prostatic, breast, colon, leukemic, squamous carcinoma, melanoma, and Kaposi sarcoma cells.56,70,71 It may be inferred that while the stimulatory effect of vitamin D compounds on tyrosinase activity and the modulatory effect on T cell infiltrate may enhance repigmentation in vitiligo, their suppressor effect on melano- cyte growth would minimize or delay the pigment restoration. Therefore, designing new vitamin D analogs able to stimulate melanocyte differentiation and to enhance tyrosinase activity is of a particularly high interest in vitil"

Erik L became responsible for λ-Red in order to keep up with the assembly. He takes guidance from Erik Gullberg (supervisor) and together they lay down a good approach.  Evaluation
Sequencing result of ccaS showed an unwanted insert. It’s probably because of bad primer alignment during mutagenesis. Our initial conclusion was that the primers amplified the DNA of some contaminants. Theoretically, this shouldn’t have occurred, since we did PCR purification. The small DNA that caused the insert should’ve been removed.
Erik Gullberg thinks we might have taken a bad clone from the plate when doing mutagenesis to remove EcoRI. So he thinks we should take another clone post-EcoRI and tries it out again. The result of the sequencing reflects a very rare accident. Theoretically we should be able to do it again, without having the same problem. Otherwise, we are considering having Bioneer synthesize ccaS with codon optimization.  CA2B samples were gave poor results, it seemed like we accidently put two primers into the sequencing sample. This is probably due to stress.
Because of the work intensity and the stress people are starting to feel right now. Suggestions came up that we should move our weekly meeting on Mondays to Friday afternoon. Considering the current situation we decided to try it out next week.

Time: 2015.8.18.
Location: COFCO Institute of Nutrition and Health, Beijing
On August 18th, our team visited COFCO Institute of Nutrition and Health and communicated with their staffs.
COFCO is the world’s top 500 enterprises, and also China’s leading supplier in the fields of agriculture products, food products and service, which is committed to building the whole industry chain about oil and food. COFCO constructs the whole service chain of urban complex. Research Institute of Nutrition and Health in COFCO based on the life sciences, is committed to the health and nutrition, which improves the life of Chinese people.
It is the 3rd year for BIT-China to participate in iGEM, and the collaboration between BIT-China and COFCO Institute of Nutrition and Health has been three years. We did get plenty of help and advice from COFCO, contributing to the further more collaboration. This year we mainly collaborated with COFCO Institute of Nutrition and Health.
Our project, pH Controller, is mainly designed to solve issues related to industrial fermentation pH adjustment, which attracts many fermentation companies.
At the meeting, Chenyi Li, the team leader of BIT-CHINA, gave a presentation for project description and synthetic biology introduction. We promoted the concept of synthetic biology and iGEM to COFCO. As an internationally renowned food company, COFCO has raised many substantive recommendations for our project, especially in the actual fermentation industry. They issued explanations for conventional fermentation conditions, fermentation technology and problems occurring in fermentation. According to these recommendations, we made a preliminary verification of fermentation, which would effectively support our project. Tai An and other staffs of COFCO proposed some suggestions on how to apply our project in fermentation industry and showed great interests in learning about the application of synthetic biology technology in their company. After discussion, BIT-CHINA visited the biological lab of COFCO and had a group photo.

« It is a fascinating project, with curious and creative students. If I were them, I would pursue this work, regardless of the outcome of the competition. Who knows what it could lead one day ? It reminds me of the early days of the touchscreen. When engineers from CERN designed it for control systems of the accelerators in the 1970s, who would have thought that years later, a similar technology would be invented and become as commonly used? »

No respite for smartphones and other pads. As soon as they invaded our pockets and our living rooms, some already think about the next step. Sakura Nussbaum and her thirteen teammates, students in Bachelor of Life Sciences at EPFL, are some of them. « We are working on the design and the fabrication of a « BioPad », a touchpad working with the help of biological compounds, in this case bacteria that emit light when a pressure is applied on the screen », summarizes the young student. Their project is only at its beginning, but is no less encouraging.
When we put bacteria under mechanical pressure, they don't stay inert but react to limit the consequences. It is the case for Escherichia coli, a very common intestinal bacteria. A pressure on its envelope makes it produce protective proteins that rigidify its structure to limit this stress. The mechanism by which it happens is still uncertain, but Sakura Nussbaum and her teammates have studied it closer. They noticed that it involves a protein named CpxR, which role is to stimulate the production of these protective proteins. In the absence of pressure, CpxR is divided in two distinct and inactive parts. These parts reassemble in case of pressure on the bacterial"

Fun
  
  Besides programming, we still have a lot of fun in the free time. This is a joyful and colorful summer vocation.
Playing Cards
  Almost all our team members like to play cards, so it became a major entertainment activity during our free time. This is a kind of board game that is now very popular among young people of China. It is origin from the history of the Three-Kingdom-Era. Players are divided into different groups according to their identities in the game, and each group will do its best to win the game.  It was really a lot of fun when playing this game. Besides playing, we chatted lightly with each other, joked around and laughed a lot. Almost every evening, the school is filled with our laughter.
  We also played a card game called Uno. This one is much easier. After the mid of August, when the freshmen came to the campus, sometimes we played cards with them. Through this activity we became good friends.
Mountain Tanglang Hiking
  
  Four of us, Mubing, Junqiu, Zili and Xin went to climb Mount Tanglang at the beginning of the summer. Mount Tanglang is a mount, which is not far away from our school.
  July 15th, it was a sunny day with a little cloud in the sky. The weather was hot and a little humid, but we could feel the breeze through our fingers. There were lots of trees on the mountain, the branches and leaves formed a green curtain. Colorful butterflies flied above our head, their wings were shining in the sun. It was a beautiful summer day.
  It was really very tiring; we almost wanted to quit in half way. But finally we overcame all the difficulties, and climbed to the top. There was a booth from where we could see our campus."

Single Cell ODE Model for the Recombination Module
1 Overview
The ﬁnal module in our construct is the Recombination module. In this module, we use Cre recombinase to separate the         origin of replication from the rest of the plasmid. Plasmids whose origin of replication has been recombined out         are referred to as ”knocked out” plasmids.
In our model, we seek to model the knockout eﬃciency after some set amount of time has elapsed since the introduction         of Cre recombinase into the cell culture, which we deﬁne as
. That is, it         is the proportion of plasmids whose origin of replication is knocked out from the original set of plasmids. Here, we         start the simulation with Cre being constitutively produced from the Time Delay module at the same concentration.
The system of reactions generally follow the analysis of Cre recombinase in [1] and can be visualized as in the diagram         below.
In the construct, there are two lox sites on the plasmid which ﬂank the origin of replication. When both lox sites         are bound to two Cre molecules, the plasmid (S) can undergo recombination where the plasmid is cut and separates         into two plasmids (P1, P2), in which one has the origin of replication and the other does not.
As shown in the diagram above, the binding of Cre to the lox sites can be in diﬀerent orders. Notably, the binding         of Cre to molecules to a lox site is cooperative, meaning that the binding of the second Cre to a lox site is made         more favorable when the ﬁrst Cre has already bound to that site.
Once there are four Cre molecules on the same plasmid, the Cre recombinase can catalyze a recombination reaction to         produce a recombined product"

Enfin, nous vous présenterons une amélioration apportée à la bactérie pour en faire un vecteur tissulaire optimal.
Haut de page
Le vecteur tissulaire : Mycobacterium avium [1,2]
Nous avons étudié plusieurs types bactériens pour déterminer le meilleur rapport entre une faible pathogénicité, un tropisme intéressant et une bonne résistance au système immunitaire, afin de choisir au mieux le vecteur tissulaire.
Une tâche ardue, puisqu’en règle générale, un microorganisme qui résiste au système immunitaire est potentiellement dangereux pour son hôte. Il fallait donc trouver un microorganisme résistant mais ne possédant pas une haute pathogénicité pour l’Homme. Etant plus facile de réduire la pathogénicité que d’améliorer la résistance, nous avons déterminé ce dernier facteur comme prioritaire pour la sélection.
Nous avons tout d’abord répertorié les bactéries présentant une résistance au système immunitaire. Les quatre plus connues étant :
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis, agent responsable de la tuberculose;
- Legionella pneumophila, agent responsable de la légionellose;
- Listeria monocytogenes, agent responsable de la méningite;
- Coxiella burnetii, agent responsable de la coxiellose (fièvre Q).
Toutes les quatre sont bien évidemment hautement pathogènes, nous nous sommes donc penchés sur leurs homologues ou sous-espèces peu pathogènes pour l’homme.
Mycobacterium avium (M.avium) est la bactérie qui a retenu notre attention. Cette dernière appartient au genre des Mycobactéries, et plus précisément au Complexe Mycobacterium Avium (MAC).
M.avium est nettement moins pathogène que son homologue Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Les seules manifestations cliniques qu’elle peut induire sont: toux productive, fatigue, fièvre, perte de poids et sueurs nocturnes. Ces symptômes découlent de la colonisation du tractus respiratoire ou gastro-intestinal"

Retro-translating and optimizing for yeast (as explained above), we obtained the final sequences (see the registry for  more details).
Implementation
Due to time and resources limitation, we decided to simplify the construction (assembly) process as much as possible. The devices were ordered as a whole (as gBlocks gene fragments) instead of obtaining each constitutive biobrick part and then assembling them. Although this goes against the standard part base approach, it saved both time and money. We plan to obtain each constitutive part from the devices by PCR with suffix/prefix containing primers, as a contribution to the registry.
We decided to use yeast expression plasmids with repressible or constitutive promoters, to drive the expression of our devices. This decision was taken because such plasmids were readily available to us, they had adequate selection markers and they are a fairly standard approach in yeast genetics.

The google doc on which to share these summaries has been shared with everyone.  - Uros - trying to make a split CFP construct, trying to clone the 2 parts (C and N terminus) into the plasmid. The Cterminus part worked today for PCR. Need help with this part tomorrow. Adi and whoever else needs to be in lab tomorrow at 9 to help out. Uros will send out a thorough google doc of instructions. Made a final draft for the WT PUF alpha g for sythesis. Upon advice of a post doc made a draft for WT PUF and the split GFP tethering.  - Divya - PCR of WT PUF yesterday. Isiah ran the gel. That PCR procedure worked. Another PCR today was performed by Isiah according to a diff procedure. The gel was run by Divya and the PCR failed. - Anthony - transformed and plated yesterday’s ligation, started another ligation in case those don’t work.  - Angela - negative control for YFP is cloned, YFP construct is completed, sequenced and it fluoresced. Successfully used primer extension to clone Venus YFP into protet. Instead of using the biobrick E0030, we will use Venus from now on. Now we will be able to start looking at our designed RBS to see if it works. Will get primers on Tuesday or Wednesday. Takes 2 days to clone via primer extension.  - Bob - been helping several people out on all of the projects, but his main efforts are for the PHAT project. Wiki design question: for the lab notebook, we are split into the PUF notebook and the PHAT notebook. the PHAT section is structured in a continuous page where the tab buttons jump you to a different location on the page. The PUF section is structured so that every tab has a different page. Which format is preferred?  - Cara - PCR that Bob performed yesterday was run on a gel. Think it worked, but the ladder wasn’t really clear, so the digestions are being run with lots of controls. Will also soon be able to see if the BM3 site was accurately mutated to get rid of the PstI site. Do we need primers to send it out for sequencing? . Has the 2 primers for the outside of the 4CL:STS insert, but needs primers for the inside of it. Perhaps a colony pcr would be best. Use VF and VR2 standard primers. However, need to transform and plate to get the colonies necessary"

Beijerinck
History
Martinus Willem Beijerinck, born 16 March 1851 in Amsterdam, studied at the Technical School of Delft, where he was awarded the degree of Chemical Engineer in 1872. He obtained his Doctor of Science degree from the University of Leiden in 1877. At the time, Delft, then a Polytechnic, did not have the right to confer doctorates, so Leiden did this for them.  His thesis was called “Bijdrage tot de morphologie de plantegallen” and his promotor was Willem Frederik Reinier Suringar.
In 1884 all Beijrincks scientific work was rewarded, at very young age he became member of “Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen” (KNAW; The Dutch Royal Academy of Science)  He became a teacher in microbiology at the Agricultural School in Wageningen (now Wageningen University). Later M.W. Beijerinck was appointed Professor of Microbiology at the Delft Polytechnic in 1895, having previously been the head of the first industrial microbiology laboratory in the Netherlands, at the Delft Yeast and Spirit Factory. In 1897, his new laboratory was opened.
Beijerinck seemed to be a socially eccentric figure. It is said that he was verbally abusive to students, never married, and had few professional collaborations. His low popularity with his students periodically seemed to depressed him, as he very much loved spreading his enthusiasm for biology in the classroom.
Career
During his career, Beijerinck and his group were the first to isolate many bacteria and yeasts, and Beijerinck was also the first to recognise that tobacco mosaic disease was due to"

plu1537-device
The part plu1537 device is composed of arabinose inducible promoter pBad BBa_I0500 , toxin protein plu1537 coding sequence BBa_K1668007 and composite part mCherry BBa_K1668011 .
We use the device to tandem express toxic protein Plu1537 and mCherry in E.coli BL 21 (DE3). The gene plu1537 is for termite control and mCherry is a reporter.
Sequence and Features
Characterization
OVERVIEW
We builg the device plu1537 to express insecticidal toxic protein Plu1537 together with the reporter mCherry. The 14kDa insecticidal protein Plu1537 is used to kill termites in our project.
The exact mechanism of Plu1537 remains unclear. In a 2009 research, scientists first expressed the Plu1537 and purified it with GST tag. Consequently, Plu1537 showed its insecticidal activity against two moth species (Galleria& Spodoptera) larvae via hemocoel injection instead of oral feeding.
We clone and standardize the gene into standard plasmid pSB1C"

We performed EMSA for Tn5 and dxCas9 portion of the fusion protein separately. Figure 17A displays the EMSA of adapter. Loading of adapter on the fusion protein retards DNA movement on PAGE, which was observed as higher bands on figure 17A, lane 7 and 8. It indicates that mobility shift occurs when >1.5µM of fusion protein is present. We performed three different negative controls in parallel:
No adapter DNA was added (figure 17A, lane 2).
No fusion protein was added (figure 17A, lane 3,4, and 10).
Fusion protein was denatured by heat (figure 17A, lane 9).
None of these negative control reactions resulted in the band shift, confirming the specificity of our result.
With the same principle, higher bands observed on figure 17B, lane 5,6,14, and 15, confirmed the complex formation between sgRNA-loaded fusion protein with the target DNA. As a negative control, the same reaction was carried out without sgRNA. In this case, the dxCas9 should not be able to find the target DNA and complex should not be formed. The absence of higher bands on figure 17B, lane 7-11 confirmed this.
We performed integration assay based on the protocol. To amplify the integration products, we performed PCR with primers that anneal to the end of adapter DNA, and the beginning or end of target DNA. Figure 18 displays the PCR products on 5% TBE native gel.
We designed the sgRNA to target the second exon-exon junction of EPO cDNA (position ~200bp from total length 623bp). When integration of adapter DNA (length ~50bp) occurs, 2 fragments of ~250bp and ~470bp should be generated. Indeed, figure 18 lane 2 and 3 shows intense bands on position ~250bp and ~470bp respectively. This indicated the success of targeted integration by our fusion protein. Moreover, the absence of these bands and the stronger presence of other unspecific bands when sgRNA was omitted (figure 18, lane 4 and 5) or when Tn5 was used (figure 18 lane 10 and 11) confirmed that targeted integration is specific to sgRNA targeted fusion protein. Moreover, the absence of integration products on the other negative"

BIT,2015,Team:BIT-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Cre and Flp respectively. When the pH of environment reaches the P-atp2’s responsive range, Cre would express and recognize the LoxP sites at both side of strong constitutive promoter J23119 and J23119 would be inverted. Therefore the bacteria stop producing GABA and start the product of lactate. Similarly, when the pH of environment reaches the P-asr’s responsive range, J23119 would be inverted again. The bacteria will produce GABA again. Through the combine of multiple LoxP sites and FTR sites, we can realize multi-regulation and fine-regulation. To prevent gene from wrong inverting, we designed two kinds of sRNA to inhibit Cre and Flp’s function. When one of recombinases expresses, the sRNA for the other recombinase will be produced at the same time. The sRNA would inhibit the translation of the other recombinase and avoid the wrong inversion. sRNA consists of two parts, the scaffold structure MicC and a target-binding sequence. Target-binding sequence, an anti-sequence about 15~20 bp, can inhibit the translation through binding with mRNA. These circuits are used when the functional acid and the alkali are both medium.
○ Bxb1 circuit
Bxb1 integrase is a DNA recombinase ( details in project page ). In the primary state, the bacteria also produce alkali. Since the alkali is strong, the pH of environment could reach the responsible range of P-atp2 easily. It can lead Bxb1 to work. The promoter J23119 could be inverted persistently until the inverted efficacy reaches half and half. In this process, the bacteria produce the acid and the alkali at the same time, it can create a wave-motion of pH. And the pH of environment will stable finally. The final pH is influenced by the promoter sensing pH and the strength of acid and alkali. This circuit is applied when the functional acid and alkali are both strong.
○ FimE circuit
FimE is different from other kind’s recombinase. Its recognized sites on the upstream (IRL) and downstream (IRR) are not same. It means that after the recombination mediated by FimE happens, the sign sites would be exchanged, so that the new sign sites couldn’t be recognized by FimE again. So the recombination mediated by FimE is irreversible. Granted that the bacteria produce the strong alkali in the primary, the environment would turn alkaline quickly. So P-atp2 can correspond the change of environment and start the expression of"

Our first full-time month of working on our project did not go as smoothly as we had hoped: One Gibson assembly simply did not work, no matter what we tried. Sadly enough, this one happened to be our most important protein, the scaffold itself. Despite the setbacks we still made some progress and had some fun, we visited Paris to attend the European Experience Convention aimed at all Europe’s iGEM teams, organized by iGEM Evry and iGEM Ionis.
After we put the unfortunate July behind us, we recovered quickly in August. In just two weeks the seeds of our sponsoring bore fruit and the finances of our project was going smoothly! Our back-up plans succeeded and most of our DNA was successfully synthesized. We also reached the second to last Major milestone, meaning the decision to go to Boston became definite!. Lastly, we created a model to determine properties of our proteins with the lab data.
Due to our delay in July, we were not able to complete our labwork before our study year started again, so the pressure was on! We expressed and purified our proteins and started our first measurements. Preparations for our final presentation in Boston now also started.
During the busy month of October we wrapped up our data gathering and processed our results. Of course we also continued practicing our presentation, finalizing our poster and our WIKI like madmen to finish everything properly and in time. We are looking forward to attending the Giant Jamboree, meeting many other iGEM teams and hopefully win a prize to bring back home. See you in Boston!

Ethics & Synthetic Biology
We asked ourselves: ""are there any ethical questions concerning our project?"" After participating in an international ethical conference and dicussions with scientists, we got a clue of how far ethic reaches: It starts with the planning of a new project, leads to the decision what organism should be used and ends at an application in the lab, the environment or even in the human body.
... in discussion with scientists
To deal with ethical questions that arise with the application of our project, we visited scientists of our university. After asking them for potential applications of the uniCAS toolkit, we discussed safety matters and ethical problems.
Many of these scientists saw a great potential in our toolkit to be an efficient approach for gaining new knowledge in their field of research. A few of them also mentioned the future perspective of using CRISPR/Cas for gene regulation for therapy purpose. This, of course, can be controversial discussed:
“… yet, there are already a lot of commonly used drugs that yield the same effects, even though more indirectly: Via interactions with signaling processes that misconduct gene expression in certain cancer types ... ” (Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Driever, Developmental Biology)
A direct and therefore more efficient intervention of misguided signaling pathways could be achieved by introducing CRISPR/Cas9 to these cells encoded by RNA. Hence, the effect of this therapy approach would only be transiently. But, it has to be considered, how the agents will be able to find the target cells for entering and what risks this still entails:
“… leukemia has already been treated with comparable approaches. After all, you always need to assess potential off-target activities, efficiencies and – most importantly"

We had a good sequence for all of our samples. We made 2 ml cultures of these, to miniprep, make final plates, and glycerol stocks. Note, that for Zif 268, the linker between F1/F2 is 'TGEKP', as that was the sequence in the ultramer we ordered. The actual sequence is 'TGQKP'. If this proves to be a problem, we can always try using quick change to insert the appropriate codon.
Checking on the reporter strain
Our transformed bacteria with the 11.3 ul isothermal assembly product and 100 ng backbone grew. We picked four from the plate and are growing 2 ml cultures from time to miniprep and send for sequencing tomorrow.

6th iGEM Meeting"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above. However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence"

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"We gave the following definition for endocrine disruptor: Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere at a certain level with your endocrine (or hormone) systems. These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders.[Ref.]
To conclude these questions about air pollution and its impact on our society, we asked two questions about the solution we are developing. Respondents were asked to rate their interest on a scale of 1 (not interested) to 5 (I'm really interested). With an average of 3.89 / 5, it seems that our device meets a strong interest. We also asked the participants which scale seems most effective for combating air pollution. A very large part of the participants thinks the fight against pollution must take place at a local and then global scale. These findings have influenced our scenario, which you can find here. Indeed, we imagined a scenario where global foundations or health organizations take care of aether financing. The product will than have a life cycle on a local scale, between the consumer’s house and the local collect center.
In the overall study, we found that most people were interested in a solution using synthetic biology but that more than half did not think this branch of biology was safe. We observed similar conclusions in our European subsample. We have therefore conducted our investigations further to better understand this finding and to raise awareness among people with limited knowledge. We asked questions to evaluate the knowledge of people regarding synthetic biology and see if they would accept a solution based on it.
As can be seen, a vast majority of respondents, more than 69%, do not know the term ""synthetic biology"", while on the contrary, 97% of respondents think they know what a ""GMO"". The word GMO, associated with several scandals including food, is connoted very negatively in Europe. Looking at the third graph, we can see that the majority of interviewees do not have any problem with GMOs and consider that they are a great technical tool to address certain issues linked to health, environment or energy. What annoys most respondents is the fact that this is a new science that we do not have enough perspective to judge the effects. They are also concerned that GMOs are released into the wild and have an unintended effect. We realized the importance of communicating around the safety of our device and the fact that we produce GMOs, but we do not take them out of the laboratory.
We gave the following definitions on Synthetic biology: “Synthetic biology is a field in biology where biological functions found in living systems of nature, are used as solutions to address technical"

NU Models: Breaking Down Walls!
NU Models seeks to expand promoter and ribosome binding site characterization of E. coli to other non-model organisms chosen for their promise in other fields of research. All processes take place in a cell-free system to provide a consistent characterization platform. This information is useful in synthetic biology applications for healthcare, the environment, and industry as it provides a basis for DNA design in organisms other than E. coli that are more optimized for the needs of a given application.

As a part of the project, we reached out to experts on the matter of Panama disease, industry professionals and people who simply love bananas to know their opinion. We asked them on a range of aspects, from the purely technical to the environmental. Here the summaries of the four interviews are shown.

Interview with Luud Clercx
Luud is the head of the Task Force on Fusarium wilt Tropical Race 4, an organization within FAO to fight Panama disease.  He also works in Technical Assistance for Sustainable Trade & Environment (TASTE) and has ample experience in rural development. Luud explained to us how Panama disease is spreading and devastating banana plantations, and what he sees as the paths that will lead to the end, or at least mitigation, of this crisis.
How would you describe the crisis caused by Panama disease, and its consequences for farmers and developing countries?
""There are several situations that we have to distinguish.  In Asian countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, etc. it causes huge losses for the banana sector.  Although as a whole there is not a big drop in production, the consequences in Asia are disastrous, not only for big companies but also for small farmers and there is no effective control method against this soil borne fungus, so it’s a really big threat. We have the precedent of the Gros Michel banana, which was virtually wiped out during the past century as a commercial crop in"

We focused our outreach efforts this year on informing the general public and on determining public perception and understanding of the field of synthetic biology. In order to reach as many and as broad a membership of the community as possible, we spent three days at the Minnesota State Fair, one of the largest state fairs in the U.S. In order to understand public opinion, we designed a survey that was distributed at the fair and through various University of Minnesota classes. We also helped other iGEM teams, such at TU_Munich, by filling out their surveys! Please click on the images below to learn more!

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#SYNENERGENE#Application Scenario_-_-_TEXT.html," be used to collect herbicides, harmful chemicals, and could be used in consort with other iGEM projects such as the 2013 project of Nanjing or Dundee. As we expand this model to collect other resources the risks will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and modifications to our system should be undertaken to mitigate as many risks as possible.
“Playing God”: As with most iGEM projects, we will surely be accused of “playing God” in our desire to implement a system and assuming we have foreseen and planned for all the outcomes. Obviously this isn’t true, there are serious concerns with a project of this scale, and therefore we propose several questions to further critical examination of our system.  There is the concern that our system will work too well. That it could possibly strip the ecosystem of phosphorus. We apply phosphorus in the form of fertilizer because it can be the limiting nutrient for crop growth. However, if our system overperforms, we may strip enough from the aqueous environment that it may cause detrimental effects to the plants that rely on that environment.
Why our product?
Due to the wide variety of applications and our flexible three leveled business model our system is able to be implemented across a wide range of environments and levels of need. By capturing and concentrating a valuable compound out of the environment we at once provide an environmental service and monetary incentive for its widespread implementation. Our system will allow anyone to capture and monetize the resource around them, taking control of their own waste and environmental impact.
Future use and application
The core of our system was designed and engineered to capture, store, and extract a valuable compound from the environment. Besides an expansion in the number of locations and scale of implementation of our phosphorus system; the true benefit is the ability to easily change out the xerogel beads and embedded bacteria in order to capture other resources. We could easily see this being implemented with other projects such as Nanjing’s 2013 project which attempted to capture and breakdown pharmaceuticals in water. Or Dundee’s 2013 project which captured the toxins produced by algae to remediate the surrounding water. As humanity's needs expand, our system is ready to adapt, collecting and concentrating useful, harmful, or valuable compounds out of water systems. This will hopefully encourage and promote an economy surrounding reclaiming resources from waste streams.
In Summary
Our phosphorus reclamation module (PRM) has the flexibility required to operate in the myriad of environments identified as major contributors of phosphorus contamination in water. Our business plan facilitates use of our product over the widest range of clients from single"

Introduction
We thought that Human Practice means Social Responsibility we should fulfill as researchers and practiced the following projects. Our main purposes of them are a public relation (publication of our research and activity between researchers) and education for juniors (succession planning).
Specifically, we, team UT-Tokyo2010, accomplished these projects:
・Science cafe
・Lecture presentation for high school students
・Made an open source version of our research
・Submitted the story of iGEM to a little magazine for young researchers
・Hosted iGEM Summer Meetup (Japan, Kanto region)
・Collected general ideas about synthetic biology from a large number of questionnaires, in cooperation with team Japan,
・Made a poster presentation in ‘BioExpo’ , a big exhibition in which most of bioscience companies meet, and increased the publicity of iGEM
Science Cafe
The UT-Tokyo team held a science cafe in the university festival—May Festival(Gogatsu-sai) during May 29th and 30th ,2010.
Usually lots of the visitors who are not related to the university come to the May Festival, and so do people who seem not really interested in synthetic biology at all gather.
By holding the science café, we obtained a chance to discuss with unprofessional people deliberately and face to face. Some students major in biology, while most are not interested in it before coming. We have received various influences from them while affecting them a lot at the same time.
We cooperated with other teams in Japan (TMU, Osaka, Kyoto, Tokyo-tech) for holding this cience café, and this also led to make an opportunity to strengthen collaboration between teams in Japan.
What we have done in the science café is as followｓ：
・conversations with iGEM members Visitors can talk with iGEM members freely within a group of three or four person.
・the exhibition of posters which were used during the iGEM Jamboree last year and the ones which were newly made for the science café
・taking an attitude survey (descriptive survey) towards biotechnology

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," our visit, we have done further research to construct a prototype, compatible with real-life situations.
The important thing for us was to design a product which has a zero-waste approach; meaning that it would leave nothing behind. No greenhouse gas emissions or waste residues was to be released to the environment, causing pollutions. Thus, we’ve considered to make use of the carbon dioxide with a dry ice unit and a greenhouse. In addition, water that comes out as a byproduct is regained with our water purification unit.

Figures 7 and 8: The inside and outside structures of our product design.
Figure 9: The final drawing before 3D printing
Figure 10: Our product design, 3D printed.
Dryer: In order to kickstart the processes, the material needs to be dried first. A type of lignocellulosic material, brewer’s spent grain (BSG) is dried to a moisture content of 10% in an atmospheric drier.
Mill: After dehydration, the material needs to be shrinked in size; to maximize surface to volume ratio, facilitating the acid pretreatment that will later unroll. The matter will be reduced to 0,3-1 mm particles. A jaw mill is most commonly used, and this process along with drying prepares the material to acid hydrolysis.
Acid Pretreatment: Then, the acid pretreatment will take place. Na2SO4 is administered for hydrolysis to separate the complex lignocellulose into simpler lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose.
Enzymatic Hydrolysis: Enzymatic pretreatment will further break down cellulose to yield glucose by hydrolysis. The glucose produced will be forwarded to the fermentation plant, where E. coli will yield ethanol from it.
Fermentation: From the glucose produced in the previous step, our bacteria E.coli KO11 will produce ethanol.
Distillation: Ethanol yielded is then distilled to reduce its water content; and the water here too is canalised to the water purification plant, to be reused.
Dry Ice Unit: Carbon dioxide formed as a result in fermentation tank can also be taken advantage of by using it in a dry ice production unit.
Molecular Biology and Genetics Lab: Our bacteria creates its difference here; by the virtue of it being resistant to furfural.              To learn more on the lab process; you can visit here .

Sequence alignment
We previously got the secondary structures of the theophylline aptamers and classified those aptamer sequences into 3 categories. To find out the consensus sequences, we did the sequence alignment in each categories by Clastalw2 and the alignment indicated that the conserved sequences have varied length in different groups (Table 1)(Figure 2B). The alignment results are available in the supplemental data.

Then we compared the whole aptamer sequences and their conserved sequences. From this alignment, we identified that the conserved sequences have the same location in the whole aptamers and the aptamers do have the same consensus sequences except several complex long aptamers. Notably, the previous work by Gallivan has reported the same motif sequences (Figure 2).

The guide tree is a branching diagram(tree), assumed to be an estimated of a phylogeny, branch lengths are proportional to the amount of inferred evolutionary change (Figure 3).
From the guide tree diagram 1 and 2, we found that the sequences are similar to each other except sequence 5 and sequence 30. Actually, the sequences alignment also indicates the sequences have relatively long consensus sequences. In guide tree diagram 3, there are less sequences than diagram 1 and 2. And the consensus sequences are quite short since the comparatively long sequences in diagram 3 are different, especially sequence 27.

Our Project
Team
The first ever Washington University iGEM team is composed of nine undergraduate juniors and seniors majoring in Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering.  Under the leadership of Dr. Blankenship (Biology and Chemistry departments), our team plans to synthetically regulate expression of a light harvesting antenna, which we believe is a first for both iGEM and synthetic biology.  To learn more about our highly motivated and well-trained team, please click here .
Project Abstract
Improved Photosynthetic Productivity for Rhodobacter sphaeroides via Synthetic Regulation of the Light Harvesting Antenna LH2
Photosynthetic light harvesting antennas function to collect light and transfer energy to a reaction center for photochemistry. Phototrophs evolved large antennas to compete for photons in natural environments where light is scarce.  Consequently, cells at the surface of photobioreactors over-absorb light, leading to attenuated photobioreactor light penetration and starving interior cells of photons. This reduction of photosynthetic productivity has been identified as the primary impediment to improving photobioreactor efficiency.  While reduction of antenna size improves photosynthetic productivity, current approaches to this uniformly truncate antennas and are difficult to manipulate from the perspective of bioengineering. We aim to create a modifiable system to optimize antenna size throughout the bioreactor by utilizing a synthetic regulatory mechanism that correlates expression of the pucB/A LH2 antenna genes with incident light intensity. This new application of synthetic biology serves to transform the science of antenna reduction into the engineering of antenna optimization.   To learn more about our project, please click here .

Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!

If I rest, I rust.
Shubo is a junior majoring in biological science at UCAS.
He learns some experimental operation of molecular biology, some methods to organize material and data, and many routes from the lab to the school. He wants to make biological experiments more automated to liberate biotech hands.
He undertook most of the experimental tasks in the group of ammonia degradation. He spent most of his time adding samples. He also did some work of human practice, but mostly ended in failure.
Outside the lab he has little hobby in addition to watching anime. Learning and experimenting make him happy.

Duke,2018,Team:Duke#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"
In the last decade, there has been a phenomenon of cancer drug shortages, especially older generic drugs. Paclitaxel is currently on the shortage list, and docetaxel has often been used in place. However, docetaxel is five times more expensive, and paclitaxel shortages could cost an additional $11000 per patient with ovarian cancer in a 6 cycle docetaxel/carboplatin combined chemotherapy session. [13] These shortages can mean delay in treatment of a fatal disease; a 2011 Society of Gynecologic Oncology survey reported 98% of members who responded reported a delay in receiving cancer drugs, and 77% of those delays lasted a month or more.[13]  Along with the shortage is a trend of prices increasing for cytotoxic drugs, rising steadily by 10% or on average $8,500 annually from 1995 to 2013. [13] Globally, the most money is spent on anticancer drugs compared to other types of medication. [13] Unfortunately, the process that manufacturers use to decide prices is completely opaque to the public, which is a firing point for biomedicine activists. Because of the lack of transparency, approval and production of new drugs is unpredictable, so in turn it is hard for insurance companies to price policies. [16] This leads to huge out-of-pocket expenditures that can be very detrimental to less wealthy households, and in some cases can be the largest source of spending of family income. Our system would make pacitaxel and taxane derivatives much more available for clinical trials, which would greatly alleviate the shortage issue as well as stabilize the price, as the biggest barrier to smooth clinical trial phases is simply lack of supply. Additionally, the cancer drug market functions as monopolies. This is due to drugs being used in combination with each other because most cancers are incurable, and is reinforced when new drugs and improved drugs are produced that replace generic versions. [16] This could be especially essential to recognize the full potential of taxanes, as low doses have been demonstrated to be effective against non-cancer diseases as well, such as skin disorders, renal and hepatic fibrosis, inflammation, axon regeneration, limb salvage, and coronary artery restenosis. [16]
Our Project and Next Generation Taxanes
Today, the pharmaceutical industry is expanding on the production of taxane derivatives, and defining which taxanes are more effective for which cancers. For example, Cabazitaxel has been shown to be stronger against Prostate cancer than docetaxel. [13] These"

The iGEM Meetup hosted by Carnegie Mellon University
Carnegie Mellon was able to host an iGEM meetup on Saturday, September 6th at the Mellon Institute. A total of six teams and about 50 participants attended including a high school team that the University of Pittsburgh had been mentoring. The following teams were in attendance:
University of Michigan
University of Michigan Software Team
Pennsylvania State University
University of Pittsburgh
Montgomery High School
Carnegie Mellon University
The day started with each team presenting their respective projects while the other teams wrote down feedback and questions. We then transitioned to a Q&A panel of past participants and their experiences with iGEM. Some Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh advisors as well as some members of the Michigan teams had previously participated in iGEM and answered questions relating to the Jamboree, forming a team, picking a project, etc.
As the final part of the meet up, all of the teams socialized and discussed projects while rotating through the workshops we had set up. There were initially three scheduled workshops: poster, public speaking and wiki. However, the representative for the poster workshop was unable to attend. The presentation and wiki workshops were very successful in helping teams recognize their strengths, weaknesses, and working through any technical issues as far as the wiki. Professor Julia Deems of Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business specializes in communication. She was able to give each team feedback specific to their presentation on what they can do to make more of an impact at the Jamboree. The wiki workshop was led by Jonathan deWerd, a graduate student in biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, and he was able to provide feedback to any teams that had questions about putting together their wiki.
Over the course of the day, all of the teams were able to learn more about other iGEM projects as well as advance their own project further due to the conversation and feedback that comes from collaboration. We had great fun learning about what everyone else had been to this summer and we will definitely recognize the familiar faces"
Queens_Canada,2018,Team:Queens Canada#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," as it is the major component of antifreeze for windshield frost in the    winter! We suggested that their by-product could be used in cryopreservatives here in Canada. Above all, our teams agreed that because the distance between us would making sharing resources difficult, we could however proof-read each others work, give suggestions on standard operating procedures, and aid in general scientific dissemination. This has included presentations to each others teams, and providing feedback wherever needed. Ultimately, through various Skype calls and email exchanges, members of both our teams were able to    assist the other with different aspects of the projects. Our outreach teams often had calls together to share our plans for outreach events, and public dissemination of current science that it would be easy accesible to the general public. Our dry lab teams were able to collaborate with    various 3D modelling techniques in PyMOL, help with Opentrons OT-2 protocols, as well as wiki formatting.
University of Toronto
It's a warm feeling to have a great friend so close by. The University of Toronto, and Queens Canada teams became friends at the oGEM meeting (see above), and we continued conversations and support for one another all the way to the jamboree. The University of Toronto team were there for us for 1am cloning troubleshooting, theoretical conversations about synthetic biology, and selecting E. Coli strains. This friendship evolved into a collaboration when we provided the University of Toronto team with their Wiki, by providing the services of our graphic design and wiki teams. We developed graphics for them based off sketches they drew, which can be now seen on their homepage and throughout their wiki. In exchange, University of Toronto provided us with a gift of a pSB1C3 vector with a unique nucleotide sequence (UNS) flanking the Biobrick Prefix and Suffix. We are extremely grateful for this gift because it allows for easier Gibson Assembly, and therefore construction of biobricks. Gibson Assembely relies on overlaps of >15bp between the vector and the insert without majorly repetitive sequences. Since NotI is found in both the prefix and suffix, this can result in poor assembly of inserts. The UNS sequence designed and created by University of Toronto allows for PCR linearization of the vector, and then highly efficient Assembly. We are thankful to University of Toronto for their friendship and help, and we look forward to seeing them at the Jamboree!

Honors in Biochemistry (4th Year); Sub-project: Competent Cells
This is my first year being involved with the iGEM team.  As Biochemistry is one of my major, it serves as my primary interest to study the inner workings of life and I find synthetic biology and it's ability to play with these processes extremely interesting.  In my spare time I can be found reading up on current scientific advances, gaming, or drinking ridiculous amounts of coffee.  I hope to either pursue Synthetic Biology through a PhD or study Medicine in the future.  So far, iGEM has been an excellent opportunity to learn about the potential that biological systems hold for future industrial applications.  I look forward to seeing everyone in Boston!
Jacqueline Lee
Honors in Bioinformatics (3rd Year); Sub-project: Software
This is my first year in iGEM. I joined iGEM because of the opportunities it presented in learning about research, synthetic biology and the applications of computing science to these fields.  I am interested in mathematical modeling, genetics and molecular biology and I would like to pursue these interests by obtaining my doctorate and doing research into mathematical modeling of biological systems.  I am originally from Red Deer, Alberta and in my free time, I enjoy traveling around the Canadian Rockies doing activities such as backpacking, canoeing and biking.  I look forward to solving problems and working with and meeting new people through the course of this project.

A pair of colonies were chosen from each plate and each was placed into a test tube containing 5mL of LB medium and 5uL 1000x Chloramphenicol. These test tube colonies were then incubated overnight on a shaker at 37 degrees.
Day 3
Fluorescence Assay
A 1:10 dilution was made of each colony and the absorbance was measured at 600 nm using the faculty plate reader. These readings were used to determine the dilution required for the colonies to have a concentration of 0.02. A diluted cultured was made for each sample and placed on ice. Further culture samples were made and placed into a 37 degree incubator for six hours. Once this was complete the samples were placed into individual wells on a 96 well plate. The fluorescence and absorbance was measured for each well.

If a product would surface in the future, further risk assessments must be evaluated to see if an engineered product would be deemed safe to be orally ingested by a living host. Since an enteric diagnostic system based on bacteria is a novel approach there is little to be found in the literature about its applied effects.  In addition to internal reviews, it is common for an external entity (like a government) to perform reviews on the product, especially if the product is classified as a GMO. This is necessary to ensure that the product is safe before letting it hit the market.
Understanding Your Limits - a Burnout Guidebook
Mental health awareness is being brought into the spotlight in society, yet talking about it is still a taboo in many settings. For instance, in a project that you truly care for, the risks and warning signs might go by unrecognized. It is an art to find balance at work but in our opinion it is an essential part of success in the long run. Therefore, the Uppsala iGEM team has chosen to acknowledge the importance of understanding one’s limits by writing a guide-book on the topic.
The premise and purpose of the guidebook is that many iGEM teams in retrospect have admitted that the work environment during the iGEM competition oftentimes becomes stressful. Factors such as level of experience, responsibilities, ambitions and deadlines drive projects forward but at the same time easily lead to feelings of being overwhelmed and an increases risk of burning out. Though we’re speaking mainly of the iGEM competition here, the topic of stress at work is universally applicable. Therefore we wanted to address this topic by creating material that anyone who seeks guidance can relate to and use. We tried to make our guidebook as universal as possible to people both inside and outside of academia.
In this little book we have compiled some general background about stress, exhaustion, and burnout in order to explain the issue and show that these topics deserve your attention. This is followed by suggestions of some preventive measures that we have found suitable. Some parts of the book might be a repetition of old truths but we try to mix it up with a mix of unique advice and mindfulness exercises.
In the guidebook you can also find some statistics about stress levels in different iGEM teams over the years. This is a preview of the iGEM work environment report that the iGEM Uppsala association is working on based on the survey described further down.
Also, check out the chapter “The Importance of Authenticity in Organization” from the guidebook written by iG"
