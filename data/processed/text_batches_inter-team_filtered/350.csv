Peking,2010,Team:Peking#PromoterCharacterization_-_-_TEXT.html,", it was even below the threshold at which Hg (II) adversely affects the growth rate of bacterial cells. Actually, the hypersensitive switch behavior is postulated to arise from the unusual metal binding mechanism of MerR. Therefore, the molecular basis of the hypersensitivity switch will be discussed thoroughly in Bioabsorbent part of our wiki.
Aiming to analyze the PmerT promoter further, construction of merOP libriay (Random mutagenesis of the merOP) was also conducted.
Previous footprint studies [Lee, et al, 1993, Park et al, 1992] had suggested that there are three distinct domains within the palindromic merO. Mutants in domain I, which consists of the four highly conserved inner bases (---GTAC---GTAC---) of the seven-base interrupted dyad, generally allow constitutive transcription at PR. Mutants in dyad domain II, which located on either side of domain I, are semiconstitutive but support additional Hg(II)-induced open complex formation at PTPCAD (Fig. 5). In our project, we planned to analyze the behavior of merO thoroughly, and it could be expected that mutation at the dyad sequence would change the Ka of MerR-DNA interactions. Thus we mutated the semiconserved sites and left the conserved sites constant.
Fig. 5 The feature of MerR binding region, merT promoter. Semiconserved(alterable) sites are marked by blue box, conserved sites by red box, and start condon by green box. This dyadic region is located between the -10 and -35 hexamers of the structural gene promoter, PTPCAD, which is divergently.
The approach was generally based upon degenerate primer PCR, with the combination of a ‘DNA shuffling’ procedure, that was performed on the target DNA sequence; the resulting library of variants was then screened for the desired feature, and selected isolates are subjected to a repeated procedure.
We performed a degenerate primer PCR on the merTPCAD wild-type promoter region of the alterable sites. The resulting PCR fragments, each potentially containing one or more random mutation sites at a restricted location, were cloned into pSB3K3 and transformed into DH5 alpha competent cells, yielding approximately 100 colonies (Fig. 6).

USTC,2009,Team:USTC Software#Algorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," step, changing the velocity of (accelerating) each particle toward its pbest and lbest locations (local version of PSO). Acceleration is weighted by a random term, with separate random numbers being generated for acceleration toward pbest and lbest locations."" (cite from the website)
Why PSO?
In past several years, PSO has been successfully applied in many research and application areas. It is demonstrated that PSO gets better results in a faster, cheaper way compared with other methods. Compared to GA, the advantages of PSO are that PSO is easy to implement and there are few parameters to adjust. The most important reason we choose to implement this algorithm into our software is that this algorithm is easy to realize parallelization. Since the most time-consuming part in our scheme is the optimization of parameters for a given topological structure. If we cannot find a efficient optimizer, it is impossible to deal with systems contains more than five or six nodes. parallelization of the optimization process will be implemented in our next version.
Basic Formulas of PSO
First we must be clear with several concepts:
particle:have a position and a velocity, fly through parameter space
velocity: velocity of a particle in the parameter space
pbest: The best solution a particle has achieved so far
lbest: Best solution obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle
gbest: The best solution achieved by all particles so far
Parameters used in PSO algorithm:
Number of Particles:
learning factors <math>c_{1}</math>, <math>c_{2}</math>
inertial factor <math>w</math>
range of parameter and velocity on each dimension
optimization threshold
The particles update their positions and velocities with following equation:
<math>v[] = w*v[] + c_{1}*rand()*(pbest[]-postion[]) + c_{2}*rand()*(gbest[] - position[])</math>
<math>position[] = position[] + v[]</math>
where <math>c_{1}</math> and <math>c_{2}</math> are two learning factors, we choose <math>c_{1}=c_{2}=2</math>. Particles' velocities on each dimension are clamped to a maximum velocity <math>V_{\max }</math>. If the sum of accelerations would cause the velocity on that dimension to exceed <math>V_{\max }</math>. Then the velocity on that dimension is limited to <math>V_{\max }</math>. If a particle's position go beyond the range of parameter, we will set"
Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices2_-_-_TEXT.html," Group on Ethics and EU policies, and the Executive Management for Research and Innovation
Specifically concerning synthetic biology, a European project called SYNBIOSAFE approved by the European Commission has focused on ethics and safety of synthetic biology. In 2012, it published an article concerning the bioethical and biosafety attentions in iGEM competitions. These two types of frameworks help the researcher to answer to many ethical questions in the clearest way possible. Therefore, not only law may limit synthetic biology. Aspects concerning Politics, Economy, and Philosophy could influence the bioethics questions.
Why do we need Ethics commitees? Interview with Mr FAUCHER
On the 29th of July, Savandara and Charlotte had the possibility to meet with Mr Jacques Faucher, doctor, priest and founder of the regional Ethics commitee ""l'Espace Bioéthique Aquitain"". Mr FAUCHER generously accepted to come to our lab at the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology (IECB) in order to talk to us about the importance of bioethics in the field of synthetic Biology.
When Mr Potter, American oncologist and surgeon, invents the word ethics in the 1970's and writes his book Bioethics: a bridge to the future he pioneers the questions to come asking himsef questions which go beyond medecine such as: does life have a future on this planet? Questions which have lead to the conclusion that not everything that can be done should be done. Since the modification of a plant's genome or of a unicellular organism's genome is tolerated, what about the human genome? In other words, are there barriers to put on living organisms? Should we have the right to experiment on humans in order to widen our knowledge on the human body? In the case of human clinical trials, ethical aspects are judged on the quality of the scientific protocol. It would not be ethical to use humans as tests if researchers are not certain to have exploitable results. Furthermore, the question of consent also needs to be adressed. While we cannot ask an animal or a plant for their consent, ethical commites insist on having a proof of consent in the European Union. This is particularly important since Anglo-Saxon scientific reviews refuse to publish papers if the have not been approved by an ethics commite. We can ask ourselves if the importance researchers give to Bioethics is truly personal or if they do not regard it as only constraint for publication.
When it comes to bacteria however, what point of view do we have? Humans generally have a vision of the world which is anthropocentric, we"

To have adequate overlap between acr inserts and pSB1C3, we’d need to digest something with pSB1C3 backbone with XbaI and SpeI (poorly designed inserts on our part). We did this to J04450 and gel extracted this band. However, this means that there’s a risk of a) contamination with J04450 plasmid and b) religation of the sticky ends of XbaI and SpeI. That’s why we’re running the negative control above and are considering reordering some gBlocks to make Gibsons go smoother. Other option would be to get new primers to amplify pSB1C3 with the overlaps designed into the primers.

Improved gene circuit
I Introduction
    As stated in the Orthogonality test in experiment part, we failed to find the orthogonal gene circuit of the two warriors. We can just determine part of the two warriors as follows (Fig.1). From the experimental results(See details at Orthogonality test ), we know that warrior II just response to C4HSL secreted by warrior 1, but not 3OC6HSL secreted by himself.
Fig.1 Gene circuit designed from orthogonality test results
    However, we cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter we put inside warrior I.What can we do to construct an orthogonal gene circuit?
Note: In this text, we mean the same when we refer to response intensity of AHL promoter and killing effect of warriors, that is to say, if the response intensity of promoter to AHL secreted by warrior A inside warrior B is high---A may equals to B, it means that the warrior A can be effectively killed by warrior B and vice versa.
II Design of orthogonal gene circuit
    The problem now becomes how to block warrior II’s response to C4HSL secreted by itself. An intuitive answer to this question is that we could let C4HSL inside warrior I specifically stimulate the expression of an inhibitor, and then the inhibitor can inhibit the promoter of LacI.
    Considering this design principle, we designed the gene circuit of warrior I and warrior II as follows.(Fig.2)

This will be a quicker test because the plasmid already has a promoter and terminators. The primers for these are already order and will arrive on Monday. The primer includes the RBS, PUF binding site, and restriction sites. We are cutting with EcoRI and SpeI. o PET 4.3 is Amp resistant, the protet is Cm resistant. o We have to check the compatibility of the plasmids. Check this by looking at the ORI. If they have the same mechanism that will be an issue (competition and one will win over the other). o There are biobricks to make this as well, but our overall goal is for testing to be as quick and easy as possible. PHAT - Working on a gene operon to convert tyrosine all the way to picetannol. - We’ve found that the 2008 Rice team did tyrosine to resveratrol in yeast. But not all of their biobricks are characterized, so they may not be functional. But the 3 enzymes are in the registry. o Try to get these from the registry and try to put it in e. coli. These probably won’t be in the kit plate, so will order from the registry. o PCR the genes and build the operon ourselves. That saves the hassle of the MTA because Koffas might not approve putting his stuff in a biobrick. o Rao will still follow up on the MTA but it might not go through. Putting things into a public registry kind of defeats the purpose of the MTA in the first place. - The correct sequences have been obtained from Dr. Kim. All 3 BM3 genes are 3 KB (big!). So are 4 genes all going to fit in one plasmid? What options do we have to deal with this? How big is too big? o For a standard plasmid 10,000 is the max. After that you have to go to special plasmids (bac). The thing about bac is that they’re single copy. o Could we take the ORI from bac and put it in a PSB backbone? No, it’s not that simple. There are other factors. - If we assembly the operon, it will still be novel. - NEW IDEA – BIOLOGICAL ASSEMBLY LINE: we have an mRNA that is never meant to be translated, it is merely a scaffold for tons of PUFs.

NTU-Singapore,2009,Team:NTU-Singapore#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," Bio becomes more mainstream, is it not harder to control/contain lab experiments gone wrong? How can we alleviate this situation?
Tito : Community labs -- encouraging DIYbiologists to work in public spaces where they are supported by funding/education/proper facilities.
Q. Do you think the DIYBio community or anyone who wishes to carry out biological experiments outside of the usual venues, should be regulated, or guided/supervised in any way?
Tito : I think the same rules should apply that apply to academic labs.
Q. The DIYBio community is growing, definitely. Should it remain a obscure and cult hobby for real enthusiasts, or more mainstream [which will likely increase the possibility of bio-errors]?
Tito : It should definitely be a community that engages many different groups, focused on increasing public knowledge.
Q. Do you think DIY bio can contribute significantly to biotechnological advancements or will it remain a hobbyist pursuit?
Jason : [I think it will] contribute significantly to biotechnological advancement in the long-term.  Although I do think the hobbyist pursuit has value, particularly from an educational point of view.
Special Thanks
We would like to thank Tito for patiently answering all our questions! It was eye-opening, to see a DIYbiologist's views and motivations. We feel empathetic now, towards pursuing or supporting DIYbio with the same responsible and collected mindset as Tito.
Thanks Tito! We really appreciate your input.
Special thanks also, to Jason Bobe, for taking time out to do our survey. To hear from the founder himself is definitely a serious boost to the credibility of DIYbio in this discussion.

INPN + ModA
As we talked about INPN as display system, INPN is used to carry ModA. Briefly, we want fusion protein that INPN is integration with ModA, as result. Everybody knows, two kinds of proteins are liked with each other may lead to change of high levels of protein structure. And other problems together make constructing fusing protein difficult.
We had two methods to fuse two protein:
1. Fusing PCR
After we tried Gibson Assembly unsuccessfully, we started work on fusing PCR. To avoid change the senior structure of proteins, we decide add a linker between two protein, which is about 6bp. We designed our primer, did our experiments.But because of spending much time on Gibson Assembly, we did not have the certain results yet. And we still work on so far.
2. Gibson Assembly
We did the Gibson Assembly first. Gibson Assembly is a high-efficiency DNA end-linking technique developed by Daniel Gibson at the JCVI in 2009. The technique was invented and perfected as part of the genome assembly efforts at JCVI. The method uses three enzymes to join two or more sequences of DNA when they have overlapping end sequences at their joining point (~40bp). These overlapping regions can be easily added to the ends of any length of DNA by using PCR with primers which have added adapter sequences. Thus PCR followed by Gibson Assembly allows you to join any two blunt ended pieces of DNA. And"
Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#Synergene#applicationscenario_-_-_TEXT.html," estimates vary, like oil, phosphorus is a nonrenewable resource and, like oil, phosphorus production and supply will at some time in the near future fail to meet global demands. Therefore, as a means of bridging the gap between supply and demand better recycling or reclaiming methods must be established.
How does it work?
Our project focuses on providing the biological and mechanical designs necessary to remove excess phosphorous from water sources. Our solution uses a three part system to achieve this design goal. Capture, Store, Extract. The bacteria, embedded in xerogel beads to prevent their release, are engineered for an increased ability to take up phosphates. This “luxury” uptake is a system adapted from phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) which are currently used in waste treatment plants. Once inside the cells, increased expression of ATP dependent and independent polyphosphate kinases binds the phosphate into polyphosphate polymers. The endogenous system for storage in E. coli. The genes that would normally free phosphates from this chain are downregulated until expressed by a user defined trigger. The cells then release much of their phosphate and “dump” it into the surrounding media. The media can be transported elsewhere while the cells stay embedded in the exogel beads. This phosphate enriched media can be further refined to further valorize our product.
Patent & Business Plan
The patents we would issue on our system would be two fold. The first would be patents concerning the genetic pathways to induce luxury phosphorus uptake, store that phosphorus and release it on command. This would allow us to benefit from the retail value of our organism. We would couch this within the unique ability to capture, store, and release compounds from the environment in a more concentrated form allowing the patent to potentially cover more than just phosphorus. The second level of our patents would concern the way these engineered bacteria are housed within the xerogel beads, and the larger phosphorus reclamation module that allows them to uptake luxury amounts of not just phosphorus but other compounds that have increased value when concentrated from the environment.
Our business plan would have three levels to allow flexibility on our part and on the part of those wanting to implement this system. The first level of this model would involve our company directly owning and operating the system. This would allow us to collect the phosphorus to sell without competing interest from a stakeholder. This could be implemented in high phosphorus areas (where phosphorus could be easily collected and resold) or as a pilot program for cities or environmental groups to demonstrate how our system would work. The second level would allow us"

Yale,2011,Team:Yale#Notebook#Week2_-_-_TEXT.html," purposes we would be using MAGE to optimize the general secretory pathway in the EcNR2 strain (inactivating relevant genes, optimising RBS sequences of relevant geness, etc), and not tinkering with the AFP protein itself. We wondered how the optimized secretory pathway would be submitted to iGEM as biobricks. Would probably have to PCR all of the locuses that we target with MAGE, put them in plasmids, and submit them. Also discussed possiblity (as an addition to the experiment) of expressing AFP in fungi (tricoderma/neurospora).
In the morning 4mL of the overnight 50mL culture was transferred to the 200mL flask. OD was checked ever 30 minutes. After 1 hour and 45 minutes the OD was at 0.588 (ideally should be 0.55). Cells were transferred to 6 sterile falcon 50mL polypropylene tubes (35mL put in each tube). Tubes were stored on ice for 10 minutes. Cells were centrifuged in Strobel lab upstairs at 2500xG for 10 minutes at 4C. Medium was poured off and tubes were stood upside down on paper towel + kip wipes for 1 minute to remove remaining medium. Pellets were resuspended in ice cold TB buffer. 10mL buffer was added to all 6 of the tubes to resuspend the cells. Then the tubes were combined to make 2x 30mL tubes. The two tubes were centrifuged at 2500xg for 10 minutes at 4C to recover the cells. Medium was poured out, and tubes were stood upside down on paper towel for 1 minute to remove remaining medium. Pellets were resuspended by gently pipetting in a total of 20mL of ice coldTB buffer (2x10 mL). Cells were combined in single tube. 1.5mL DMSO was added and tube was mixed by swirling. Tube was stored on ice for 10 minute. 100 microlitre aliquots were put into chilled eppendorf tubes. Tubes were closed tightly and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in the -80 freezer to the bottom left.
Two tubes were set aside after being flash frozen. Contamination was tested by plating untransformed cells on an Amp plate. Competence of cells was tested by transforming a ""control"" plasmid containing Amp. 1ul of plasmid was added to 50microlit"

Part Extraction Standards
All information about the parts that are essential in experimental     setup of iGEM projects has been utilized. The information for the parts     available provided with all three 384 well plates in Spring 2010 distribution     have been standardized. Our standardization criteria have been discussed     in detail under Database Standardization. ER diagram has been generated     which simply describes the organization of the data. Around 70% of the     parts information has been fetched by the custom parsing code from XML     and Excel files provided by iGEM. Rest of the data had to be collected     and organized manually as the organization of these data cannot be standardized     to generate an algorithm. This step was one of the most time consuming     steps in our project. For each construct and Biobrick the information     collected was; Activity, Inducer, Activator, Repressor and Inhibitor     for promoters and Inducer, Activator, Repressor and Inhibitor information     valid for synthesized molecules (mostly proteins and RNA fragments etc.)
Combination
Rules (Image Combinations) In order to build our input/output relations     graphs first we run our algorithm on the real combination dataset which     contains all few thousand different possible combinations of the biobricks.     But after performing all combinations for the first few hundred biobricks     application’s rate slowed downed tremendously, which also become very     time consuming"

FEEDBACK
To further ensure Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells will survive under a                     high level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) automatically, we made a series of                     genetic transformation, which will be shown as follow.
Promoter screening
Overview
Overview                         As it was showed in the project, we needed to find a proper strong promoter to turn on the                         expression of dCas9, so we designed experiments as follow.
Specific Method
As Yap1 protein has over 70 downstream genes, we need to choose some gene                         that has known strength. Reports show that the downstream gene of Yap1 protein's mRNA level                         changes with and without H2O2. [1] Because we have no idea of                         the exact strength of these promoters, we chose both strong promoters and weak ones in this                         result and compared them with promoters that we have already known their strength. We tested                         downstream genes of Yap1 whose names were: ctt1, glr1, trx2, trr1, tsa1, sod2, gsh1, and gsh2, together with strong promoter gal1p and weak promoter msy1p. We                         obtained these promoters through PCR, and we ligated these promoters with GFP gene to                         express GFP protein and test their strength through fluorescence intensity. This is the                         first step to screen the proper promoter.
Construction of dCas9-sgRNA plasmid
Overview
After confirming the proper promoter, we started to construct the plasmid                         contains dCas9 expression cassette and the sgRNA one.
Specific methods
After obtaining the promoter strength, we started to construct the                         dCas9-sgRNA plasmid. To avoid bringing the yeast too much living stress (every plasmid will                         bring living stress to the yeast), we decided to construct the dCas9 and sgRNA gene together"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#HeavyMetals_-_-_TEXT.html," biosensor we used for in vivo characterization. Both the repressor (arsR) and the reporter (mRFP1) are under the control of the same promoter, which is controlled by ArsR.
We choose to work with the chromosomal arsenic operon of E. coli, which was used by the team from Edinburgh in 2006. This operon encodes an efflux pump which confers resistance against arsenic. The expression is controlled by the repressor ArsR, which negatively autoregulates its own expression. AsIII can bind to three cysteine residues in ArsR. The resulting conformational change deactivates the repressor ( Chen, Rosen 2014 ).
By placing a reporter gene downstream of arsR, an arsenic biosensor can be constructed. In this case, both the repressor and the reporter are under the control of the same promoter (Figure 2). In this respect, the arsenic sensor is different from the other heavy metal biosensors we worked with, as their repressors or activators are expressed constitutively. However, the genetic build-up of the arsenic sensor is well-established. Consequently, we decided to keep this deviating design.
in vivo
We tested an arsenic sensor with mRFP1 as reporter gene in vivo to confirm that the sensor is functional. Furthermore, we examined whether it is possible to detect the safety limit as defined by the WHO. The results are shown in figure 3. We observed a reaction approximately five hours after addition of arsenic. The safety limit of 10 µg/L could clearly be distinguished from the negative control and the fluorescence signal increased up to a concentration of 500 µg/L. The signal in the presence of 1000 µg/L was slightly lower than in the presence of 500 µg/L.
Figure 3: Time course of the induction of an arsenic biosensor with RFP for different arsenic concentrations in vivo. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
in vitro
Figure 4: Genetic structure of BBa_K1758300 , which was used for characterization of the arsenic sensor in vitro. The arsenic operator was placed downstream of the T7 promoter in order to control the expression of sfGFP in the presence of the arsenic repressor, ArsR.
E. coli is resistant to arsenic because it possesses an efflux pump. The cell extract is not protected by such mechanisms, therefore we tested the effect of arsenic on the synthesis of sfGFP. We observed no significant effect for the relevant safety"
HIT-Harbin,2013,Team:HIT-Harbin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM team. If the input is biochemical signal molecules and the output become electrons, B-POM can be coupled with Bio-electric Interface, that ephemeral processes in cells will be precisely measurable by simple electronic methods and analyzable by computer. B-POM is also helpful in yoghurt producing, where the control of pH is inaccurate. When B-POM is transplanted into yoghurt-producing bacteria, let hydrogen ions be the input and lacR be the output, and select the proper B-POM parameters, then the pH will be steady around 5.5. In short, our inspired and reliable device is promising in various fields.

Protein Purification - Nickel Affinty Chromatography
1mL of 50% His-Select Ni resin, was washed according to the Purification protocol. Clarified lysate of dxCas9-Tn5 protein was added to the washed His-Select Ni resin and incubated with gentle mixing for 60minutes at 4 ℃. The His-Select Ni resin was washed with washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, 5mM Imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1mM DTT, pH8), and eluded with with 6* 500μL (6CV) of elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1mM DTT, pH8) at 4 ℃, according to the Purification protocol.
Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the nickel affinty chromatography of the dxCas9-Tn5 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain. Sadly no picture was taken. The results showed that the fusion protein would not bind to the column material. It was decided to do another purification, but with a lower concentration of Imidazole.

Introduction of the meetings which SCUT-Champion-Park participated for IGEM
SCUT-NJU-SYSU three-university forum
This is the third time that our university participates in IGEM competition. Through the experience, teachers and administrators find that IGEM can help students improve the interest of the synthetic biology. So they support three teams this year. Most of our team member are the first time to participate in IGEM competition and have no experience. So at the beginning, we hope to communicate with some experienced teams.
In early April 2015, the students form Nanjing University came to Guangzhou. We took the opportunity to organize the first meeting. We hoped to exchange the experience and share ideas. Three teams from our school, Team from Nanjing University and Sun Yat-sen University participated in the meeting. In the meeting we introduced the design and progress of our project. Besides, we also talked about the human practice and web design. The meeting went to the highlight when we shared the experience of overcoming difficulties in the project. Guangzhou’s food is very famous in China, after the meeting, we invited the students from Nanjing University and Sun Yat-sen University to taste the local food. Through the meeting we made friends with each other. We also found that there are many young people making efforts for the IGEM across China. When we accomplish the project and get the prize, I think we would be moved by ourselves.
SCUT Champion Park goes to communicate with IGEM teams in Shanghai
Our team members go to Shanghai to communicate with the IGEM teams from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, New York University Shanghai, Tongji University. We shared the projects and appreciated the beauty of these universities.
In summary, through these meetings we shared the experience of IGEM including project design, wiki, human practice and so on. At the same time we gained friendship. The IGEM is a competition. We don’t regard each other as competitor, and we are friends. Thanks for the supports of our university, without its help we couldn’t have so much precious experience.
Introduction of the meeting about entrepreneurship which SCUT-Champion-Park participated
Innovation & Entrepreneurship Fair for College Students in Shenzhen
In recent years, with the increasing varieties and the widespread use, antibiotics has become one of the most commonly used drugs in China. Irrational use of antibiotics or even abuse is threatening human health. The food containing antibiotic residues, the intestinal flora in body will gradually have resistance to antibiotics, which will"

3. The syringe pump
Depending on the volume and supplier of your syringe of choice, the inner diameter varies strongly. This however is an important input parameter for the syringe pump to control the rate of bioink extrusion to a constant flow rate. The inner diameter usually can be found on the supplier’s webpage. We found a flow rate of 100 µL/min to be a good value to start experiments. Minor adjustments might be necessary depending on the exact velocity at which the tip moves across the biopaper. For our experiments, we were using a Harvard Apparatus ‘11’ Plus (70-2208) syringe pump.
Design and Integration
Engineering bacteria to form a patterned biofilm
Setting out with barely more than the idea of connecting cells to form a patterned biofilm, we had to think about how to engineer our bacteria to reach this goal in the most efficient way. As the first step, we started to think about possible designs of our biobricks.
Clearly, since CsgA is the protein monomer for amyloid nanowires, this gene will be on our plasmid. But which promoter to use? Inducible or constitutive? A constitutive production of the protein monomers would lead to a premature formation of nanowires which could eventually lead to clumps clogging the tubes and leading to losses in precision. For this reason, we chose an inducible Rhamnose promoter. However, coming to this realization we concluded that we also need a CsgA knockout strain to conduct our experiments with. Finally, for an efficient optical assay of our biofilm product we decided to incorporate fluorescence in the form of GFP or RFP inside of our cells.
However, next to the protein creating the nanowires, many others exist which are important: CsgB is a membrane protein which functions as the anchor on the cell and triggers the aggregation process of CsgA to a nanowire. Presumably, depending on the level of expression of these membrane proteins we can influence the amount of connections per cell. In this manner, we imagined to manipulate biofilm strengths according to the situation at hand. In order to investigate this effect, we designed the biobrick containing CsgB with a constitutive Anderson promoter of low, medium and high inducer strength. Since we wanted to investigate the interactions between CsgA and different levels of CsgB,"

Genetic Circuit
Elaboration
This is the genetic circuit for thermally induced genome deletion (Module 3).
This construct has two components. The first component controls the production of restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI.  The second component will ensure the production of Dam methylase, which protects the DNA.
Protein production and encapsulation occurs 28°C. In addition, protein cI is produced constitutively at 28°C. It represses the lambda cI promoter, hence only basal amounts restriction enzymes will be produced. At the same time, the production of Dam methylase will protect the E. coli DNA by methylation, and hence prevent cell death. Genome deletion would not occur.
When sufficient protein is being produced and encapsulation is complete, temperatures will be increased to 42°C. This results in the de-repression of the pLambda promoter and restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI will be produced. Dam methylase will not be able to protect the E. coli DNA from being cut and genome deletion would occur. This causes cell death and destruction of possible pathogenicity from E. coli.

They also received information on OSHA and the right to know hazards in the workplace.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?'
Due to the relative simplicity of the biological systems in our project and the benign nature of the fluorescent proteins they produce, we likely do not require any more advanced tools or methods for ensuring biosecurity.  Future work, however, will likely not be so simple - circuits will likely become very complex, and the roles they are supposed to perform will become increasingly important.  If our project had involved making large circuits for biomedical implants or bioremediation, we would have needed more effective tools for circuit analysis, to ensure robustness and to identify chances for failure.  As described by Schmidt (2009), other engineering disciplines have tools, like Event Tree Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis, for exactly this purpose, and perhaps iGEM could require teams to work through some version of them.  This would ensure that team members are engaged in thinking about biosafety, and would likely contribute to their understanding of the circuits they are building as well.

Cutting-edge in circuit design
In the field of synthetic biology, we have discovered and constructed lots of information processing elements. By modify exist element and combine them together, scientists have constructed many functional logic circuits. There are several important features that a successful logic circuit should have, such as orthogonality, scaleability and editability. Circuit design in eukaryotic cells is generally more difficult than in bacterium, due to their intrinsic complexity which makes it difficult to meet the features mentioned above.
 
Many big achievements in circuit design are made in prokaryotic cell, for example the biggest logic circuit report so far, consisting of 11 regulatory proteins and 38 additional genetic parts in total length of 21kb. No logic circuit in eukaryotic cell can be made this big yet. By using molecular chaperones to activate corresponding transcription factors, Voigt et.al.[1]
screened out 3 orthogonal AND gates and used them to construct a multi-layer circuit, demonstrating the high orthogonality and scaleability of their constructs. Some of the most flexible construct capable of performing multiple logic calculation are also made in prokaryotic cell. The construct Endy et.al.[2]
 
reported in 2013 is based on intergrase to edit DNA sequence directly. When a single directional transcription terminator flanked by intergrase recognizing sequences is inverted by intergrase, the transcription machinery will be able to move on and express downstream gene. Though placing these terminators properly, users can build many different types of logic gates easily.
 
Constructing a successful circuit in mammalian cell is a big challenge to synthetic biologists, but we don’t lack brilliant works.[3] To challenge the issue of proper circuit design in eukaryotic cell, many new and complex elements will be needed. RNA-based elements such as ribozyme, riboswitch and aptamer are intensively researched since early 21st century. Compare to regulatory protein, regulatory RNA have many unique advantages, such as quicker reacting time and easier de novo design. In 2008, Smolke et.al.[4]
successfully designed a powerful information-processing RNA device based on assembly of three components: sensor, actuator and transmitter, made of RNA aptamer, hammerhead ribozyme and linker sequence respectively. When aptamer sensor detect input drug, it will undergo a conformational change and affect the activity of ribozyme via a transmitter. This work is a very good example in RNA device construction because it provided a editable framework where we can make powerful parts through combining many different elements. Discovery of T"
OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015,Team:OLS Canmore AB CA#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Also, when we tried it with B. subtilis, the reason we didn't get very far with the 2013 team is because we never got the transformation into B. Subtilis to work after several repeats (but that's possibly because of issues with our protocol/technique, it's not totally clear)- in either case, obviously working with E. coli would be much nicer/easier. 2. Express in E. Coli, part I: You could potentially get around the issue of KerA getting trapped in the periplasm by inserting the Tat and Sec pathways in E. coli (which we are actually using in our project right now in a completely different context). You would remove the endogenous KerA signal peptide and add an alternative signal peptide, which could be recognized and cleaved by one of these two secretion systems (I forget which- one system cleaves the tag and the other one doesn't, sorry definitely another person on our team working on these systems know them better than me). You may also want to look at other signal peptides/systems- though I think Tat/Sec are the most famous and most efficient ones. Advantage: Gets around the issue of the stuff getting stuck in the periplasm. Disadvantage: This could be a little difficult to get to work, as getting recombinant proteins to secrete in E. coli is kind of a flip of a coin- sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. It also wouldn't be very novel, as it's already been done before: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf100803g- maybe you could improve on their efficiency though, not sure if that's good. 3. Express in E. coli, part II: Advantage: You could just not secrete the protein and instead lyse E. coli and purify the KerA later. This means you don't have to think about secretion systems. Disadvantage: The problem with this approach is that misfolding and the formation of big clumps of the protein called inclusion bodies within the acidic environment of the cytoplasm is common with overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli (http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v22/n11/full/nbt1029.html). So with this approach after lysis, you'd have to figure out the conditions for separating out the inclusion bodies and refolding the Keratinase properly. This type of an approach where you lyse then refold is well-documented with something long-known like insulin (I think this"

Presentation to the economy camp
We introduced our idea to a summer camp nearby and asked if they could let us present to their students topics about synthetic biology as well as our project. The camp contains mainly college students, and they agreed immediately. At first, we were unsure if what we talk about would intrigue their interest. However, we were thrilled to discover that they were very interested in the topic and attended carefully. Their reactions, such as questions on the practicality of our project, promoted us to think more carefully about the issue and make changes to our experimental design.

Our official wechat account was set up in June. Part of our goal, with this account, was to increase the public's understanding about synthetic biology and its positive influence on human life. Therefore, we've already posted many self-written articles, which consists of updates on our project and activities, background information about cyanobacteria pollution, and methods commonly used in synthetic biology to resolve problems. Far beyond our expectations, our wechat account was followed by hundreds of wechat users and articles were read thousands of times.

In this module, we first analysed the stability of d-AuNPs upon introduction of NaCl with and without single stranded DNA probe. Finally, we were able to visually differentiate between samples where target DNA is presence or absence.
2.1 NaCl Effect on d-AuNPs’ Stability
Design: We generated batches of dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles and tested their aggregation upon NaCl introduction to determine the optimal NaCl concentration.
Results and interpretation: Upon increasing NaCl concentration, d-AuNPs destabilize and aggregate, changing the color of the solution from red to purple. We scanned the visual light spectra from 450nm to 650nm for a range of 0mM to 333mM NaCl. The important absorbance wavelengths are 520nm (red color) and 620 nm (purple color). We calculated the ratio of 620nm and 520nm to quantify the expect of color changes (red to purple) (figure 5). We observed an increase in the 620/520 with an increase in NaCl concentration, indicating a color change from red to purple.
Figure 5. Influence of NaCl on d-AuNPs aggregation. At a concentration of 133 mM NaCl, the d-AuNPs start to aggregate; the peak in the spectra shift from 520nm to 620nm and the ratio 620/520 wavelengths start to increase indicating color change from red to purple. A) Spectrum of d-AuNPs solutions with NaCl concentrations 0, 167 and 333mM. B) Wavelength ratios of 620/520 of d-AuNPs solutions with NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 333mM. C) Visual outcome of the d-AuNPs solution with NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 333mM.
2.2 ssDNAp Effect on d-AuNPs’ Stability
Design: We tested the effect of single stranded DNA probe (ssDNAp) on d-AuNPs aggregation.
Results and interpretation: ssDNAp are known to stabilize d-AuNPs from aggregating ( Baetsen-Young, et al, 2018 ). We incubated the d-AuNP's with and without a ssDNAp and compared the d-AuNP aggregation at a range of NaCl concentrations. The stabilization effect can be observed on figure 6. The addition of ssDNAp causes a lower 620/520 ratio shift with increasing NaCl"

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," multiple sites and thereby cause multiple variations of the gene. The stepwise ligation method utilizes the strong chemical binding between streptavidin and biotin. The concept is to use magnetic beads coated in streptavidin, while the initiator oligo contains a biotinylated end at the 5’. This allows the magnetic beads to be continuously isolated from the solution with a magnetic rack and the supernatant can be removed. This controls a stepwise ligation construct that ends with a terminator sequence with one sticky-end that eliminates future ligations. Correct ligations will be controlled by the use of cap-sequences, which bind to the previous step's non-ligated constructs and end the possibility of further ligations at the failed ligations. In the end, the gene construct will consist of an initiator sequence, a coding region and a terminator. The initiator and terminator have specific primer sites, which makes it possible for pPCR of the whole synthesized gene sequence. The ICA method was used by the iGEM UCLA team 2015 to synthesize silk. During our experiment the used initiator contained a standard iGEM prefix and the terminator contained a standard iGEM suffix. These sites made it possible for the gene sequence to be inserted into desired vectors.
Assembling Silk Gene Fragments ( Top )
Silk from Nephila clavipes consists of the genes MaSp1 and MaSp2, which individually contains repetitive gene sequences. The genes have the same restriction sites in both ends so that the overhangs are consistent throughout the construct. This step by step ligation of the individual genes (e.g. MaSp1 AB + MaSp1 BC + MaSp1 CA), allows for custom designs of the silk gene both in length and in variation (e.g. 2xMaSp1:1xMaSp2). For a graphical illustration of the ICA Method, check out the video above.
The ICA method gives way for alternative constructs, where other genes can be incorporated in between the repetitive silk genes. This freedom of construction creates the opportunity for incorporation of bacteriocin genes into the silk construct, using the ICA method. Coloplast are already aware of the great qualities of recombinant spider silk and bacteriocins, however the idea of combining the two elements are completely new to them and they see a great oppertunity in it.

DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project improving araBAD_-_-_TEXT.html," of a little bit of inducer, a feed forward loop sets in. The transporters are strongly upregulated as they bring more and more arabinose into the cell until the inducer is exhausted in the immediate vicinity of the cell and the systems turns off. To circumvent this pitfall, researchers have created the strains which are constitutively permissive for arabinose entry, thus, breaking the feed forward loop. Such approaches, however, necessitate the introduction of many mutations inside a strain and is, therefore, difficult to implement in other microbes except E. coli where the strains already exist [2] [4] . Besides, if an intermediate level of induction is required for a system to be optimal, reproducibly adding the exact precise concentration of arabinose in the culture can be a significant hurdle.
We have approached the problem through another angle. If it is difficult to obtain reproducible results by changing the inducer concentration, why not try and change the promoter strength and systematically use a saturating amount of inducer? Our approach was, therefore, based on last year's iGEM DTU team work on Synthetic Promoter Libraries but applied to an inducible promoter. In the process we were also hoping to obtain stronger than wild-type, but arabinose regulated, promoters which could better match other induced systems like the Ptet promoter [6] or the propionate induced PprpB [7] .
Approach
Flowchart presenting the approach to improve the arabinose promoter.
Since control of the system is essential to the applicability of our system we attempted to modify the dynamic range of the arabinose promoter ( BBa_I0500 ) by two means:
rationally designing the -10 and -35 sequences of the promoter region since both the -35 (CTGACG) and the -10 (TACTGT) of the arabinose promoter are far from the consensus (TTGACA and TATAAT respectively) thus potentially explaining its weakness.
randomizing all nucleotides between the -10 and the -35 boxes as well as a few residues on each side thus creating Synthetic Promoter Library (SPL) similar to that described in SPL but without any modification to the natural -10 and -35 from BBa-I0500.
SPL require screening fo a relatively high number of colonies to obtain a representative idea of the promoter diversity generated. We therefore wanted to take advantage of the BioLector aparatus available on campus. Indeed, this highly parallel micro fermentor allows testing 24 colonies at a time with minimal human interference. As a consequence, we"

This method was first tested on CoA and butyryl -CoA standards but no peak for CoA or butyl-CoA could be seen using this mobile phase combination. The 0.1% formic acid was replaced with water to provide a higher pH to see if this would improve the chromatography. Again no peak was seen. We suspected that the compounds may have been sensitive to active sites within the HPLC system so the water was replaced with 0.1M ammonium acetate. This resulted in a sharp peak of reasonable retention for both CoA and butyl-CoA. The final parameters used are listed below

Extracts from cultures of E. coli containing the BioBricks for either pathway were analysed under these conditions but, due to the presence of many other peaks, it was not possible to determine if butyl-CoA was present. For this reason we decided use Mass Spectrometry (MS) to aid detection. Analysis was transferred to a Shimadzu single quadrupole LC/MS (Liquid Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer) instrument. The column used had the same stationary phase but was 2.0 mm in diameter to allow a lower flow rate of 0.4mL/min to be used, being more suitable for operation with the MS. The concentration of the ammonium acetate was reduced to 0.05M. The MS was operated in selected ion mode to increase sensitivity, monitoring masses 838 and 836 for +ve and –ve electrospray ionisation of the butyryl -CoA

Precautions:
When cutting the chip, complete it as much as possible, and repeating the cutting multiple times may cause the chip cavity error to become larger;
Check whether the layers of the chip are aligned before bonding. Use a small amount of tape when fixing to avoid the indentation on the surface of the chip.
When bonding, pay attention to the stability of the bonding temperature. If the temperature is too low, the bonding may fail. If the temperature is too high, the chip may melt.

SU-8 Based Processing Platform
The SU-8 flux detection chip can achieve detection requirements for 10 to 1000 samples. We made microchip chips based on solid particles. The principle of flux detection is very simple. The area is divided on the microarray chip, and the shape of the holes of each piece is different. Each shape of the hole can only accommodate the solid particles of the corresponding shape. Before the test, it is only necessary to process different samples to be tested into gel particles of a specific shape in a certain step.
If you need to detect the detection of multiple disease markers, it is more convenient to use the SU-8 chip. Figure (Fig. 4) is our production process.

Similarly, for line 2, when IPTG is put into the system, we write another four equations for the materials of line 2:
But the first inducer, arabinose, still exists in the system, so the first three equations are also work at this time. However, because sRNA[ipgC] will bind with mRNA[ipgC], we modified the equaitons for mRNA[ipgC] and sRNA[ipgC]. In other words, we used the sRNA model which we finished before to change these equations. Besides, when the first (Ara) and second (IPTG) inducers exist at the same time, protein[ipgC] and
protein[mxiE] will bind together to form mxiE-ipgC complex so that the transcription from the pipaH* promoter can be activated. So we also wrote two equations to describe the dynamic change of mRNA[sicA] and
protein[sicA] and one equation for mxiE-ipgC complex (px1):
Then we combined these equations to simulate the situation after the IPTG was added. Because ipgC proteins must form a dimmer when binding with mxiE to form the mxiE-ipgC complex, according to mass balance, we minus double px1 in the equations for proteins[ipg"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectIntro_-_-_TEXT.html," It is necessary for automation since behaviors of species (such as how it react with other species) must be determined by their structures instead of their names: it is impossible to construct a universal name-based reaction database applying for different systems. The next is Template . A species with a certain structure is a template species, and a reaction occurring between several template species is a template reaction. The introduction of Template makes it possible to describe a group of reactions with same structure-determined reaction mechanism. Finally, based on our Chain-Node and Template concept, we propose an XML-based Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL for abbreviation) to fully characterize Species and Reaction in templates with clear definitions of elements and attributes in XML fashion. It is a database language for next generation when automatic modeling is widely used throughout the world. To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea of our modeling system.
Though we have no enough time to achieve our ultimate goal completely, we have successfully developed a MoDeL-based, automatic modeling and simulation software. Our program falls into 3 major components. The first component is User Interface . Users could give their assembling of parts by drag-and-drop function and setup initial conditions as well. System behavior as output will also be shown there. The second component is database written in MoDeL , which is the kernel of our automatic modeling idea. The last component is our designed to support MoDeL language. It functions as a driver: completing system network based on users' input and data stored in our database to give dynamic analysis as output.

We performed CPEC assembly using 2.7 ul of the KH3/4 fragment and 0.3 ul of each of the T-Domain PCR products, which have been amplified some weeks ago. E. coli TOP10 were transformed with 5 ul of the CPEC reaction mix. The transformants were incubated at 37 °C over night. We picked colonies to inoculate liquid cultures for the preparation of plasmid DNA. The prepped plasmid were then used for co-transformed with each of the PPTase plasmids pRB15-18 as well as without a PPTase. The following table shows the transformants after four days at room temperature in the drawer.

We prepped colony ""3"" and performed the first bulk of cotransformations with it. Sequencing of the PPTase plasmids we used for the cotransformations were positive except that we found a point mutation in pRB16.3 which results in a stop codon right in the middle of svp. Therefore we will prepare the five other colonies except number 2 and screen 21 more colonies.
We prepped colonies 19 and 26 and cotransformed TOP10 cells together with pRB22. The shape of the colonies will show us whether the PPTase is correct or carries the stop codon.

We looked into protocols.io’s API , another protocol database, and contacted the team there to try and get access to the public protocols without the user’s login details. Their cofounder, Alexei Stoliartchouk, informed us that they are working on adding that ability but at the time of writing it had not yet been implemented.
We also looked into sourcing protocols from OpenWetWare . Despite having an immensely useful database the protocols are not in any standard format and thus very difficult to parse automatically. We talked with Michigan Software , who are looking into standardising a protocol format as part of their human practices work.
Testing and feedback
Several teams tested it at the UK meetup, including Judd-UK. Judd suggested the team lookup feature and the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), both of which we implemented soon after.
Judd also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step. We tried to implement this but found it wasn’t feasible as it caused conflicts with the part lookup feature. This was because the natural language processing algorithms tended to match the numbers to part IDs.
Future work
As it’s open-source (GPLv3 license) and available on Github , other teams are free to build other functions or improve the current ones. In the future all kinds of biological queries could be supported such as looking up particular reagents or safety instructions. It also has the potential to control future IoT lab equipment, such as WiFi-enabled centrifuges or electrophoresis power supplies.

Then worked on Sifteo for the rest of the day, mainly implementing the new animation where two E. Coli cubes, when they become neighbors, interact with each other. With the image set we previously had, the animation of an E. Coli looping around the screen was slow in the actual cubes compared to when I had tested it on the Computer Simulator (""Siftulator""). We had been afraid it was too quick, so Kim decided to make 5 copies for every one frame. Instead, it was too slow on the cubes because of its limited processing capabilities, so she just stuck with one copy of each frame, which kept the animation at the speed we wanted when we updated the cubes. Because we were able to free up the memory space, all the animation, including that of the surface, has become more fluid.  I've installed the program on six cubes for the two demos happening tomorrow.
Day 40: July 24, 2012
Kim presenting SynFlo to the first group.
I demonstrated the lab's Microsoft Surface to the same group.
Two demos: first with eight kids and the second with four kids.  I really liked Kim's presentation! The new way she presented and structured the information was definitely more engaging.  The first half of the first group turned out well, mainly because everything ran smoothly and I was able to explain our project properly. The kids were also more enthusiastic and were very receptive towards the cubes, which they continuously played with throughout the demo. They especially liked introducing the E. Coli to the surface environment. During the second half however, both programs, especially the cubes' program, started going haywire. The animation would run but would keep blinking from Sifteo cube's default display to the dripping animation. Because the kids kept on running the animations without waiting for the others to end/near its end, the cube may have gotten overwhelmed. Overall however, when Kim asked each group leading questions in the end about what they learned about synthetic biology, they definitely absorbed more than the group from the pilot study. With the second demo, while the cubes were running smoothly, the kids were more mellow. They were still engaged with the demo but they were not as excited as the first half of the first group.

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#results#background_-_-_TEXT.html,", in A. nidulans the parasexual cycle has been extensively utilized. Parasexual genetics involves examination of recombination in the absence of sexual reproduction.
The genetic analysis has produced a deep understanding of both the physiology of Aspergilli and the organisation of the genome (13). This research has advanced the study of eukaryotic cellular physiology and contributed to our understanding metabolic regulation, development, DNA repair, morphogenesis, and human genetic diseases (12). Furthermore, the recent sequencing of the complete genome of A. nidulans has created a tremendous potential to obtain insight into important aspects of fungal biology such as transcriptional regulation, secondary metabolite production and pathogenicity (14).
Gene targeting in fungi
Gene targeting facilitates precise genome manipulations, called site directed alterations. They are performed by deletions, replacements and insertions at a target locus. Gene targeting is achieved by transforming fungi with a suitable linear DNA fragment that contains sequences that are identical to the target site in the genome, see figure below. Fungi can integrate linear DNA fragments in its genome by repair of double stranded breaks (15).
Two mechanisms for repair of double stranded breaks ensure that a linear piece of DNA is integrated into the fungal genome; homologous recombination (HR) and non homologous end joining (NHEJ), also called illegitimate recombination (15). HR involves interactions between homologous sequences, whereas NHEJ involves ligation of the ends independently of DNA homology (16). Precise genome manipulation can often be tedious and time-consuming, because fungi appear to favour NHEJ over HR resulting in low gene targeting efficiencies (15).

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Mile High Meetup #1
September 25, 2016 at University of Colorado, Boulder
All three Colorado iGEM teams met up north-west of the Mile High City at CU Boulder’s campus. Along with CU Boulder and Denver Biolabs , we all gave practice presentations. It was a great opportunity to receive feedback and learn about each other’s projects. The conference was still a month away, so it a good chance to figure out how to build up from the foundations of our presentation.
Over burgers and beer at lunch, we learned that Inworks was having trouble preparing homemade competent cells with decent transformation efficiency. We shared our protocol with them to help them move their experiments along on the wet lab front.
Mile High Meetup #2
October 14, 2016 at Inworks
With less than two weeks before the Giant Jamboree, the Colorado based iGEM teams met up once again to debut much improved presentations. The Denver Biolabs team also invited community members to sit in, and they bandied questions that we hadn’t thought to address before such as “How can the sensitivity of quorum sensing mechanism be modulated?”.
While looking at the incredible lab space that Denver Biolabs has managed to put together, we discovered that the competent cell protocol helped greatly to move their project forward as they could start testing their proof of concepts.

Conclusions:

è     For parts 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8,   the expected bands were observed (ok)
è     Band pattern of part 5 resembles   that expected for parts 1 – 4 à this plasmid contains RFP   gene
è     In case of part 2, SpeI was   unable to cut the plasmid à no cleavage for SpeI single   digest + linearization for SpeI/PstI double digest à plasmid contains probably something else   (SpeI/XbaI scar at actual SpeI site?)
è     For cloning: terminator (part 7) and strong RBS (part 8) might be   difficult to extract from the gel, since they are very short à think of other cloning strategy without gel extraction (e.g.   “play” with resistances of plasmid backbones to digest backbone after cutting   out part…)

2 Goals
Medal Criteria
Gold Medal
At least two of the following goals:
✓ Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab.
The functional prototype is fully described on our Design page .
✓ Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.
We significantly improved the characterization of two inducible promoters in the Registry - the pCUP1 promoter (can be found as BBa_K945002 ) and the pGAL1 promoter (can be found as BBa_J63006 ).
✓ Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
We helped Team Chalmers Gothenburg model and simulate their system modules comprising a kill switch and a contaminant reporter. We also cooperated in a Multinational GMO survey .
✓ Choose one of these two options:
Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
We integrated several ideas from conversations and interviews with two experts in CTC diagnosis. As recommended we tested agglutination in microfluidic chips instead of tubes. Also, as was suggested, for signalling orthogonality tests in Module 2, we used GFP as the output signal instead of agglutination to make the result more obvious. See our Project page for more details.
Silver Medal
All of the following goals:
✓ Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected."

Thebest-haracterized chemoreceptor is TlpB, which is requiredfor chemorepulsive responses to acid, as well as the quorumsensingmolecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2) and H+.  TlpB is the first bacterial chemoreceptor of known function shown by crystallography to contain an extracellular PAS domain. Strikingly, a molecule of urea is found within the canonical ligand-binding site of the PAS domain, bound in a manner predicted to be sensitive to changes in pH.

Emily Goers Sweeney et.al. report that urea is bound with extremely high affinity andspecificity and is essential for the thermodynamic stability ofthe TlpB molecule. The urea-binding site includes an aspartategroup (Asp114), which we propose to be the key titratableresidue responsible for pH sensing. Mutational and biophysicalanalyses of the urea-binding site support a mechanism in whichthe urea cofactor, by binding in a pH-sensitive fashion, stabilizesthe secondary structure of TlpB and signals a pH response.

Introduction
Silk fibers produced by the arachnid Nephila clavipes (Golden Silk-Orb Weavers) produce unique mechanical and immunogenic properties (Vepari et al., 2007). The highly tensile and elastic properties of these fibers, coupled with the non- immunogenic and non-allergenic phenomena observed with spider silk, make it a suitable candidate for a wide variety of biomedical applications (Schacht et al., 2014). In particular, studies into the use of the spider silk monomers MaSP1 and MaSP2 with fusions to select molecules or interactive binding domains have arisen to study the potential for spider silk as a seeding and drug delivery mechanism (Humenik et al., 2011).
However, large-scale production of spider silk has been hampered due to the poor sustainability of Golden Spider farming and subsequent silk collection procedures (Schiebel, 2004). Recent explorations into the use of recombinant silk proteins through bacterial chassis and microbiological vectors have shown tremendous promise, but are still hindered by a wide variety of issues, including (1) relatively low yield of recombinant protein relative to the amount of cell culture needed, (2) a complex and time-consuming process in constructing and troubleshooting modular forms of the silk-binding site fusions, (3) harsh chemical conditions during the purification of recombinant proteins that lead to potential denaturation of active peptides, (4) GC-rich hindrance of mRNA transcript stability and translational termination, and (5) poor scalability of recombinant silk production absent the use of large, relatively expressive bioreactors for bacterial fermentation (Winkler et al., 2000; Prince et al., 1995; Arcidiacono et al., 2002).
Studies investigating the potential for co-spinning, a process in which the terminal domains of the functional N. clavipes silk protein heavy chain are fused with genes encoding functional binding domains, and subsequently are combined with native silk proteins to form crystalline fibers, have shown some success (Sponner et al., 2005"

Intro Mingdao CSMU-NCHU
 
Collaboration
This year, we are very happy to collaborate with a collegiate iGEM team, CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan. We are both from Taichung City in Taiwan and the distance between us actually are very close, that is, not far from 5km.
In the meetup, CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan knew our project design and the problem to get from IDT the synthetic gene expression vector carrying glucose transporter genes of Salmonella. They advised that we can try to clone the gene from the bacteria and then assemble with the promoter. However, in safety issue, Salmonella is recognized as Biosafety Level 2 organism, they helped us to contact a lab PI, Dr. Cheng-Yang Huang, in Chung Shan Medical University who has handled the bacteria. Luckily, the genomic DNAs of Salmonella has been prepared for their previous research and kept some stored in the fridge. CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan amplified the gene fragments we want by PCR using our designed primers.
And in the other way, we did them a favor by subcloning BioBrick parts. We have good training in the skills of gene cloning learned from our instructor, Dr. Phil Chen. We have actually completed total at least 28 basic and composite BioBrick parts this year. And due to the limited remaining time of iGEM competition, CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan sought help from us to subclone parts from the synthetic genes made by IDT.
MINGDAO
We helped CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan subclone one basic part of “F420-Dependent Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase” and one composite part of “T7 promoter & Lac operator and RBS from PET-29a”. We took two tubes containing DNA powder made by IDT from CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan. We dissolved the DNA and re-transformed E. coli DH5α with them. Then the two plasmids extracted from the bacteria have been cut by XbaI and PstI as inserts, and so did the pSB1C3 as a vector (Fig 1.). E. coli DH5α competent cells were transformed with the ligation products. The transformed E. coli  colonies were picked up and checked by colony PCR"

Fig 2.7 The fluorescent staining of yeast with FITC-Streptomyces. (left) S.cerevisiae EBY100 without target gene; (middle) S.cerevisiae EBY100 with BAP+BirA though galactose induction for 12h; （right) S.cerevisiae EBY100 with BAP+BirA though galactose induction for 32h.
Meanwhile, we would like to  quantify the expression of biotin compared with EBY100 by plate reader, and wonder when biotin can reach the maximum expression.
Fig 2.8 Expression level of biotin in different time point compared with negative controll. The red curve represents for the fluorescence of  EBY100-BirA-BAP as time  goes  by. And  the  blue curve represents for the fluorescence  of  EBY100 control.
As a result we can see the FI/abs600 of S.cerevisiae EBY100 with BAP+BirA is higher. At about 20h the expression of biotin is the greatest，and at about 30h the accumulation of biotin reached maximum level. And after 30h, the expression level of biotin achieved the highest amount.
Further, we want to know how many biotins are expressed on the surface of a single cell. Luckily, we found that we can confirm the expression of biotin and its expressing percent under Flow cytometer.
We use FITC-streptavidin to stain Saccharomyces cerevisiae and use 488nm exciting light to excite it and detect fluorescent signal at 525nm. As the result showed here, the fluorescent peak shifted towards the direction of stronger fluorescent, which means positive sample express more biotin acceptor peptide(BAP)  Compared with the results of empty sample, we can ensure that BAP is displayed on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Above the threshold, there are 48% of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the positive sample. While in the negative sample and empty sample, the percentage is only 28%.

Suicide Module
The suicide module is for removing the engineered bacteria from the digestive tract right after the examination, in a bid to eliminate the risk of, for example, interfering gut flora as much as possible. Considering that arabinose would serve as a safe and effective inducer of bacterial gene expression in the gut, we place the phage protein φX174E (BBa_K2500006),  which triggers bacteria cell lysis under control of arabinose operon, to achieve an arabinose-governed bacterial cell death.

Therapeutic module
The therapeutic module aims for a preliminary bio-treatment of CRC after its diagnosis. This module is to be introduced into another strain, which is employed for treatment only, together with the CRC targeting module and suicide module. As a minor part of our project, the therapeutic module mainly consists of a well established anticancer agent—a peptide derived from azurin (BBa_K2500002), used by ETH Zurich 2017. In order to produce the agent in a CRC specific manner, a nitric oxide responsive promoter (pYeaR/pNorV) manipulates its expression, since nitric oxide is an unstable molecule overproduced by CRC cells and polyps, with its concentration highest around these lesions [7] Reference 7[7]Cianchi, F., Cortesini, C., Fantappiè, Messerini, L., Schiavone, N., & Vannacci, A., et al.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmids are being cut to some degree. Additionally, the prevalence of PAM site destroying mutations within the mutagenized GFP samples supports the notion that the screening system is selecting for plasmids that can avoid cleavage. While we had hoped that these cleavage avoiding plasmids would contain mutations within the region of interest rather than at the PAM site, the findings presented here at least point to the potential for this system to be used in mutant screening. Incorporating a higher fidelity Cas9 gene into our system could greatly improve its effectiveness as a whole.
Future Plans
Going forward, we would like to continue to characterize our Cas9 based mutant screening system. We plan to collect more data on its implementation and effectiveness and would like to demonstrate that it can be used in lab to effectively aid in screening mutants. We also plan to make efforts towards obtaining a higher fidelity version of Cas9 for incorporation into our mutagenesis selection system. Comparing the effectiveness of this enzyme against the effectiveness of the normal fidelity variant could help to show that the system effectiveness increases with increasing Cas9 fidelity.
Our end goal for this project is to standardize the system such that it can be utilized by other laboratories as a tool to screen for mutants. We would like to develop sets of step by step procedures in order to guide iGEM teams through the entire process of mutating a protein in the region(s) of interest and screening with our Cas9 system. The hope is that we will be able to produce a simple and well characterized mutagenesis system that can be used to further the endeavors of future iGEM projects.

Background
UMaryland iGEM has focused its hardware project efforts to bringing low cost DIY lab equipment to expand synthetic biology to community labs, high schools, and developing countries. We have successfully built a thermocycler and an ultra low -80 C freezer, and this year we are expanding on this effort.
The UMaryland iGEM Lab-in-a-Box is a compilation of various lab hardware that allows synthetic biology research and education in settings with limited resources. It comprises of a microcentrifuge, incubator, shaker, and vortex machines in one box that is open source, compact, and customizable. While these parts will cost thousands of dollars to purchase, it can be built for under $300. The construction of the box requires no soldering, drilling, and uses all off-the-shelf and 3D printed parts to function, making construction and repair easy. With the lab"

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#testMarkus-1_-_-_TEXT.html," used with the worm buster to get a better overall result of our project. Our solution will not only be able to tell how large the treatments should be but also when they should be administered. This would guarantee the lowest amount of anthelmintics usage, and hopefully help combat the issue of growing resistance. Due to this fact, our model contributes a large improvement on the potential implementation of our project since it directly brings us closer to our ultimate goal, which is the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses.
Future Possibilities
The small strongyles’ larger cousin, Strongylus Vulgaris, is the most pathogenic parasite in horses, posing a significant threat [1]. They, like small strongyles, live in the grass and and infect the horse after being ingested [3]. During the different larval stages inside the horse, the parasite enters the intestinal blood vessels as a part of their life cycle [4,10]. Because of this, they generally can’t be targeted by deworming drugs or detection methods and can cause major problems for domestic animals [7].
Due to this, an efficient diagnostic tool that can be applied to grass samples are necessary to prevent ingestion of large strongyles. This is why we looked into the possibility of a second worm buster targeting large strongyles could be possible in the future.
Figure 6: Large strongyles.
Project Outline
Symptoms
Transcriptomics + Phage Display
Symptoms
When the worms migrate into the arteries they cause inflammation in the arterial wall and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms it may form an embolism which can detach and travel in the bloodstream until it reaches and blocks smaller blood vessels. This prevents oxygen and nutrient supply to surrounding tissues and may result in colic [13]. This can cause problems in the animals, with the worst case scenario being death [3].
Having these parasites is obviously a huge problem and there is great need for methods that can detect the parasites before ingestion, preventing infection. This makes the need for the second worm buster even larger.
Current Methods of Detection
To be able to count either small or large strongyles, the current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them.  The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs! This technique only makes it possible to detect strongyles after the infection which is a huge disadvantage! Other methods for detection, such as using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [11, 12, 16].

Rica presents our iGEM project to an interested group of new students.
We were very busy this weekend. While two of our members went to the German iGEM Meetup in Marburg we presented our poster and work to the new Master students of the Molecular Lifesciences: Microbiology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology and Developmental Biology study program of our University. Through that we inspired the upcoming generation to take part in next years iGEM competition and tought them ways to adress crucial problems to make the world a better place, using synthetic biology.
Marburg Meetup
Staying in touch with the projects of other iGEM teams is important to acquire an overview over the own progress. Therefore, we attended the German iGEM Meetup in Marburg from the 22nd till the 24th of June. Here, we had the opportunity to present our poster to other iGEM teams and thus collect ideas to improve our research process.

iGEM Leiden Wiki : Overview
Overview
The science behind the project
Martian soil is contaminated with a toxic compound, perchlorate, making human life on mars impossible. For our project we use bacteria, which contain a perchlorate reduction system, to eliminate perchlorate from Martian soil. There are several bacteria that can already reduce perchlorate, for example Dechloromonas aromatica. However the model organism E.coli is a better suited bacterium to work with in this project, since it is easier to handle. Since E.coli does not contain a perchlorate reduction system, we transformed the E.coli cells from the bacterial strain DH5α with genes encoding for the perchlorate reduction system derived from Dechloromonas aromatica.
Another aspect of our project is the influence of the gravity on mars on the bacterial growth. This is performed using an random positioning machine (RPM). The bacterial growth under normal gravity and the gravity on mars are compared.
Transformation of E.coli DH5α
Genes coding for perchlorate reduction were introduced in the E.coli DH5α strain. These genes used for the transformation are derived from Dechloromonas aromatica. With these genes these, perchlorate reducing bacteria like Dechloromonas aromatica can reduce perchlorate into chlorite (ClO 2 ) with perchlorate reductase 2 Subsequently, the bacteria can convert chlorite into oxygen (O 2 ) and chloride (Cl - ) with chlorite dismutase. The sequence coding for these genes were acquired from a gene database 1 and codon optimization for E.coli was performed.
The genes encoding for perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase from Dechloromonas aromatica are shown in the figure below:
Figure 1. The perchlorate reduction genomic island of Dechloromonas aromatica. This includes all the genes necessary for the reduction of perchlorate 3 .
Upstream of the FNR/RpoN promoter a group of regulatory genes is present, these genes were not used. The genes downstream of the RpoN promotor are the genes with which the E. coli cells were transformed. The genes pcrA, B, C and D were cloned into one vector, with the use of Gibson assembly. Secondly the genes DHC and QDH, the membrane-associated proteins were cloned together into another vector. Finally, cld and moaA will be cloned separately in two vectors.

USP-Brazil,2013,Team:USP-Brazil#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," via ethanol. In addition, we decided to study a modification on Pichia pastoris Mxr1 transcription factor [18] that should alter its interaction with PAOX1 by turning ethanol into an activator of the promoter [19]. If the rate of activation by ethanol stays below the rate of activation by methanol, the latter should be identifiable when the drink is diluted. It would then, be possible to create a color guide that would help one differ pure and contaminated beverages ( For more information, see the Modeling section ).
In addition to testing the PAOX1 that is native in Pichia pastoris, we have synthesized a modified version of this promoter with up to 33% more strength than the wild type promoter [20], according to the hypothesis that a stronger promoter should allow better visualization of the colorimetric output at naked eye ( For more information, see the Parts section ).
PFLD1
This second promoter has a high transcription rate when activated, just like PAOX1, but unlike the previous one is activated by methylamine or methanol [12]. Also, it is not repressed by hexoses, like PAOX1. Since an extensive search in scientific literature did not uncover any data on the regulation of PFLD1 by ethanol, this promoter represents a great alternative to PAOX1. If it is confirmed that they do not share the same repression characteristic related to this dicarbonyl alcohol, we could eliminate an issue in our project.
Mxr1 (methanol expression regulator 1) modified
Mxr1 (methanol expression regulator 1) is a key regulator, at transcriptional level, of methanol metabolism in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris [13]. It is a transcriptional factor that binds upstream of the MUT (methanol utilizing) pathway and peroxisome biogenesis gene´s promoters using its zinc finger domain. Among the MUT genes is the AOX1 gene that is regulated by the PAOX1 promoter.
The 14-3-3 proteins are ubiquitous, and have important roles in controlling a wide variety of cellular processes, like gene expression, metabolism, cell cycle and apoptosis. These 14-3-3 proteins are involved in the carbon source-dependent regulation of Mxr1 [14], which is inactive in ethanol and glycerol, but is active in methanol.
Our submitted Mxr1 is mutated in order to NOT be repressed by ethanol, as the original Mxr1 is. This is done by substituted the Ser215 of the protein with Ala, inactivating the 14-3-3 protein"
