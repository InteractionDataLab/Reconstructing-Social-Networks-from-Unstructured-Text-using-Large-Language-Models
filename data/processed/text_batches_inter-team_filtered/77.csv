UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,", also to discuss the current and future collaboration between member teams of this brand new Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance.
Firstly, we have a roundtable discussion. And this part will be reserved for every year’s conference. We discussed many topics, included but more than:
The continuation of Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance
The efficient methods of resource sharing, such as equipment and reagent
The cooperation of holding influential HP activities together
The cooperation of consulting with the experts or companies relating to law, ethics and other aspects.
After, each team presented a small souvenir as the symbol of their team, put it into the collection case we UCAS-China prepared for this conference. We UCAS-China team, as the advocator of this alliance and the organizer of this meet-up, were going to keep it for the following year and give it to the host team of next year’s conference then.
After a short break, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.  We invited Dr. Liu from IBP and our advisor also a former iGEMer, Meng Fankang to give advice and guide.
Thanks for all the teams attended as well as the support and engagement of all the iGEMers from BNU-China, NKU_CHINA, TJU_China, Tsinghua, TUST_China and UCAS-China.
In the following years, we plan to unite more iGEM teams, hold alliance conference each year in turns, pass on our significant Human Practice activities and collaborations, and show our steadfast spirits and creativity to the world.
Meet-up invited by PKU
On Aug 7th, Peking iGEM team invited UCAS-China and other 4 undergraduate teams to attend a meet-up, including   BIT_China, BNU-China , Tsinghua ,  and OUC-China .  During the activity, six teams gave presentation of their projects, shared ideas and had a great time. It’s the first time for UCAS-China team to attend a meet-up in 2018, we were glad to share our projects and inspired greatly by the fantastic ideas from other iGEM teams. Thanks for invitation from Peking team and all dear iGEMers who participated enthusiastically.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," inner cell membrane causes protons to flow through the stator-”channel”. This flux of protons causes the flagellum to rotate and allows the cells to swim. Each flagellum can harbor around 8-11 stator components.

Fig. 4: BL21 E. coli carrying different constructs on LB swimming agar after 12h incubation at 33°C. Cells expressing motB in puc18 under the natural promoter travelled approximately 0.85cm (radius) and those expressing yhjH swam around 0.68cm. The empty vector control and motA transformed cells travelled only about 0.5cm.
These genes code for proteins that build the stator part of the bacterial flagellum which generates torque by using a proton gradient that exists across the membrane (Fig. 3). Flagellum function depends on copy number of motA and motB (Van Way et al. 2000). Therefore we chose to test these genes, hoping that the number of stator protein copies might have a positive effect on motility (Reid et al. 2006). We first tested our strains with motA and motB constructs containing the natural 3’ and 5’ regions in puc18 because a strong overexpression might have counterproductive effects. High expressed motA might thereby lead to proton leakage and disturb the metabolism of E. coli.
Results
For these two stator-genes it was very hard to get reproducible data. However, after several rounds of testing on different swimming agars and conditions we were able to conclude that overexpression of motB often had a mild positive effect on motility of BL21 E. coli (Fig. 4). However, increased expression on motA seemed to have no or even a slightly negative effect.
We did not see very strong effects after testing these two candidates. A possible explanation could be that the number of functional stator elements at one flagellum could not be increased anymore or might just not have a significant impact. Furthermore the expression of motA and motB is usually regulated in concert and if out of balance, their expression might not cause any positive effect for motility. For future projects it might be interesting to test chimeric stator proteins that could harbor higher efficiencies or use other ions for torque generation.

1. Validated Part / Validated Contribution: Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part of Device of your own design and construction works as expected.  Document this characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry.  Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.  This working part must be different from the part documented in bronze medal criterion #4.
We have validated that our new standard BioBrick Composite Parts BBa_K1875013 , BBa_K1875014 , BBa_K1875015 , BBa_K1875016 , BBa_K1875017 , BBa_K1875018 , and BBa_K1875019 work as expected. Parts BBa_K1875013 through BBa_K1875016 are all guide RNA operator reporter vectors with a single binding site for dCas9-VPR. All of these vectors have a GFP reporter gene downstream of a miniCMV promoter. These plasmids were tested for both their capacity for activating gene expression as well as mutual orthogonality. BBa_K1875017 and BBa_K1875018 express the same reporter gene as the previous four parts and function under the same promoter; however, these parts have two and three binding sites spaced 24 bases apart for dCas9-VPR to attach to respectively. These two constructs represent the highest expressing double and triple multimerized constructs from a multimerization screen. BBa_K18750019 is a mutated form of  BBa_K1875016, with the 10th base of the guide target sequence being shifted from a guanine to a thymine, reducing expression.

DESCRIPTION
Shubenacadie Wildlife Park Microbiome Survey | Metagenomic Library and Isolation | Chemical Analysis
Cellulolytic enzymes have become a very interesting field of research for the potential production of microbial biofuels. Biofuels, such as ethanol, are fuels that microorganisms could create from simple feedstocks like cellulose. Cellulose is generally a difficult carbon source to degrade and therefore provides less available carbon for use as energy. However, using organisms, or proteins from organisms, that are capable of degrading cellulose we can make available many feedstocks for biofuel production. Producing biofuel from things like leftover vegetables, lumber industry by-products and waste, seaweed and other easily obtainable sources could provide an answer to the ever-growing problem of energy production.
The Softwood Lumber industry is particularly pertinent for Nova Scotia. In 2014, Nova Scotia exported roughly 668 Million dollars in softwood lumber products including pulp and paper products, primary lumber products and fabricated wood materials. The softwood lumber industry in Nova Scotia also harvested roughly 29,000 hectares of forest for the creation of softwood products. This industry produces many useful products as well as many useless by-products. Imagine taking these useless by-products and turning them into a sustainable form of energy like an ethanol biofuel through a simple biological reactor using E. coli and enzymes harvested from cellulose-degrading bacteria. This is what we are aiming to do with this year's project.
Our project will characterize the microbiomes from the North American Porcupines found in Nova Scotia forests and attempt to ""mine"" the microbiome for useful enzymes. A microbiome is the collection of microbes found in and on larger organisms. Humans have microbiomes on their skin, in their noses, in their ears and in many other places as well. The most important human microbiome, however, is the gut microbiome. It helps us digest many otherwise undigestable foods that we consume and provides many nutritional byproducts for us. The research in this area is new, but we are learning more and more of the importance of a healthy gut microbiome. Interestingly, the North American Porcupine eats mostly bark"

Meet Kieran
Hello, my name is Kieran McCormack. I am currently finished my second year of Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge, which allows for a nice contrast between the normal science world and the more defined synthetic biology world. I enjoy doing new activities and have found great joy from being an adviser on the team; whether that be through new friendships, communications or spread of knowledge. I have enjoyed learning about myself throughout this year, and hopefully I can continue to do so into the future.
You're so hot, you might be the cause of global warming ;)

I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines.

Paper Mill
To industrialize the proceeding of decontamination, our team visited a small-sized Paper Mill which is located in Jieyang, Guangdong Providence in August. This paper mill actually specialized in Wastepaper Deinking, but they still adopted chemical process which had caused fearful heavy metal pollution in the surroundings.
However, our alkaline cellulase is able to enhance the technique and reduce the pollution, for this reason our team decided to add it into the process of deinking. The enzyme must be more meeting the request of environmental protection than chemistry.
To ensure the proceeding of industry is GREEN. Cellulase should adapt to the alkaline situation and easy to get. Our team is making every effort to reach this aim.

Methods
The following protocols have been provided by iGEM. They can also be found in PDF version on their website .
OD600 reference point - LUDOX protocol
We used LUDOX CL-X (45% colloidal silica suspension) as a single point reference to obtain a conversion factor to transform our absorbance (Abs600) data from our plate reader into a comparable OD600 measurement as would be                       obtained                       in a spectrophotometer. Such conversion is                       necessary because plate reader measurements of absorbance are volume dependent; the depth of the fluid in the well defines the path length of the light passing through the sample, which can vary slightly from well to well. In a                       standard spectrophotometer, the path length is fixed and is defined by the width of the cuvette, which is constant. Therefore this conversion calculation can transform Abs600 measurements from a plate reader (i.e., absorbance                       at 600nm, the basic output of most instruments) intocomparable OD600 measurements. The LUDOX solution is only weakly scattering and so will give a low absorbance value.
Note: many plate readers have an automatic path length correction feature. This adjustment compromises the accuracy of measurement in highly light scattering solutions, such as dense cultures of cells. We don't"

Bacteriocins
Bacteriocins are lethal to bacteria other than the producing strain. As a group, bacteriocins are heterogeneous and are classiﬁed according to their molecular weight. The activity spectrum of bacteriocins can be narrow and conﬁned to inhibition of closely related species, or it can be relatively broad and include many different bacterial species. Bacteriocins are often considered more natural than common antibiotics because they are thought to have been present in many of the foods eaten since ancient times. This is one of the reasons why we have chosen bacteriocins over other antimicrobial peptides.
Colicins
Colicin G and Colicin H
Colicins are proteins produced by some strains of Escherichia coli that are lethal for related strains of E. coli. Colicins of strain CA46 (colicin G producer) and of strain CA58 (colicin H producer) should be the same, and indeed, the sensitivity patterns were nearly identical.
Only the triple mutant receptors fepA cir fiu was completely resistant to the colicins from these strains. (i) the production of colicin by colicinogenic E. coli cells is induced by SOS agents, as is seen with lysogenic phages, and is lethal for producing cells. (ii) the produced colicin is released into the medium late after synthesis (later shown not to be the case for all colicins). (iii) colicin kills sensitive cells according to single-hit kinetics. (iv) colicin is not active against the producing bacteria if there is presence of a specific antagonist protein called the immunity protein.
All colicins are organized into three domains, each corresponding to one step of colicin action:
The N-terminal domain is involved in translocation through the membrane.
The central domain is involved in binding to the receptor.
The C-terminal domain contains the active part.
The production of colicin by colicinogenic E. coli cells is induced by SOS agents. The produced colicin is released into the medium late after synthesis. And it kills sensitive cells according to single-hit kinetics, not being active against the producing bacteria if there is presence of a specific antagonist protein called the immunity protein, which is in our strains.
Escherichia coli strains CA46(pColG) and CA58(pColH) each apparently synthesized two generally similar bactericidal colicin proteins whose molecular weights were approximately 5 500 and 100 000. And indeed, the sensitivity patterns were nearly identical. They use the same"

Impacts on Environment
Deforestation
To clear the land for oil palms, rainforest often gets burned. Thereby, vast amounts of CO2 get released into the atmosphere. Additionally, carbon that is stored in the ground gets released when converting rainforest to oil palm plantations. This is particularly troublesome in peatland forests in Indonesia. The drainage of peatland leads to enhanced decomposition of organic matter and therefore CO 2 release and other negative changes of the land [17]. As a result, Indonesia is one of the world’s biggest producers of greenhouse gases [18].
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The two countries in which the most palm oil gets produced are Indonesia and Malaysia. They alone produce about 250 million tons palm oil per year. This corresponds to more than 14 million hectares of land that is used. Worldwide, there is an area of more than 21 million hectares used for palm (kernel) oil production (Figure 3) [16].  In order to make such huge amounts of land available for oil palm plantations, most of the time tropical rainforest has to be destroyed (sometimes former rubber plantations are used). Another side effect of the enormous demand for palm (kernel) oil is that rubber and cacao plantations can get driven into areas of former rainforest. All this deforestation goes hand in hand with many environmental problems such as soil erosion, air pollution, climate change, and species extinction [17].
Figure 3: The area used for oil palm plantations in million hectares.
Values taken from: FAOSTAT
Water pollution
There are many pesticides used on palm plantations like paraquat dichloride, glyphosate, glyphosate, triclopyr butotyl, glufosinate ammonium, diuron etc. [19]. Additionally to the health and safety issues regarding the workers [19,20] there are also concerns about the environmental impact. Pesticides as well as fertilizers and other chemicals can get into rivers and negatively affect aquatic ecosystems [17,20]
Impacts on Animals
According to Wilcove and Koh “oil-palm agriculture is the greatest immediate threat to biodiversity in Southeast Asia” [21]. On plantations, there is up to 99% lesser tree and plant diversity than in natural forests [17]. Also many mammals like the Sumatran Tiger, Sumatran Rhinoceros, Sun Bear, Pygmy Elephant, Clouded Leopard and Proboscis Monkey and, most infamously, the Orangutan suffer from the conversion from rainforest to monocrops [22"

The larger antigen-antibody complexes generated will disturb the                         distribution of the liquid crystal molecules so that they are no longer vertically aligned, and                         the transmitted polarized light passes through the disorder. The aligned liquid crystal                         molecules turn into color, reflecting the presence of excess β2-MG in the urine,                         which provides early warning of the development of chronic kidney disease.
Description of Product
Our products are presented in kit form, without the need for expert knowledge, and can be tested                         by following the instructions. This kit can be used both at home and in the hospital, and is                         portable and easy to operate. The test results of this kit provide early warning only for the                         occurrence of chronic kidney disease, warning patients of the risk of chronic kidney disease,                         and cannot be used as a basis for the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease.
The First Generation of Dr. Familict
Structure:
The kit is designed based on a liquid crystal cell. A polarizing plate is disposed above the                         reagent box, and the ordinary light that is incident on the reagent box through the polarizing                         plate can be polarized light; the inside of the reagent box is mainly composed of a glass                         carrier and a liquid crystal cell, and the two parts can be assembled into A test chip.

On the glass slide, we have optimized the corresponding concentration of DMOAP inducer and                         antibody. The substrate in the liquid crystal cell is also modified with DMOAP, and the liquid                         crystal cell is filled with vertically aligned liquid crystal. When used, the urine drop to be                         tested is first added to the glass slide and then the glass slide is assembled with the liquid                         crystal cell, and the complex formed by antigen-antibody combination can affect the liquid                         crystal alignment and produce corresponding image color change.

Loves music, buying and reading books (mainly in english since they're cheaper!) and manga, watching movies, TV series, anime, playing videogames, cooking, drawing, painting, dancing and singing (even if she's not good at it). Silence is one of the many things that bothers her, so she's always saying random useless facts to fill the silence, and gets unreasonably nervous when it's her time to speak in front of an audience.
Most of the people think she's not a very nice person at first, because of her shyness,but after getting to know her better she's an outgoing, funny and nice person. But not when she's angry...

NCKU_Tainan iGEM team
We had a face-to-face meeting with them in National Cheng Kung University. They interviewed us about their environmental protection project, and we also showed our project to them. With their suggestions, we found a new method to present our project more clearly through the collaboration, where we felt more connected with other iGEMers. We are sincerely thankful for their interview and hospitality.
CCU_Taiwan iGEM team
This year, CCU_Taiwan is joining iGEM for the first time, just like us. Under the same circumstances, we built strong connections and collaborations throughout this summer. We asked them for a favor to measure the concentration of MSMEG5998 in supernatant and pellet to test the solubility of our recombinant enzyme. This experiment played an important role in our project because the results implied the efficiency of Thioredoxin. We encountered some problems that needed to be tackled back then. CCU_Taiwan generously helped us redo the SDS-PAGE experiment and provided us with the data. In return, we helped them in plasmid construction. At the beginning, they planned to digest their plasmid with two restriction endonucleases simultaneously and ligated with a new part, but they failed. As a result, we told them our Double Digests protocol, and suggested that they use High-Fidelity (HF®) restriction enzymes rather than fast digest enzyme. Therefore, the problem was then solved.
The SDS PAGE Coomassie G-250 staining result revealed that the synthetic MSMEG5998 fusion protein dissolved more in the supernatant (13000Su) compare to the pellet (13000P) of the cell lysate, indicating that the solubility is great. This result matched with our experiment.
NYMU-Taipei iGEM team
NYMU-Taipei is the first iGEM team in Taiwan to have participated, and their teacher, Prof. Chang, has extensive experience in iGEM competition. We seeked some advice about forming an iGEM team, and how to integrate a project. In return, we gave them some information about some professors in National Taiwan Ocean University whose specialty were focus on question similar to their project."

A concentration of 15.1 ± 0.3 ng/L of E2 was measured in a sample obtained from a food production process, and 8.8 ± 0.7 ng/L in a sample from the Adriatic Sea[2].
In order to deal with this health and environmental risk, we developed an endocrine disruptor binder that works with our intein passenger system. The construct is based on the M421F mutated version of the estrogen receptor protein which was shown have higher binding affinities and stability than the normal enzyme[3]. These characteristics make it a well performing potential bionsensor as suggested by Ferrero et al.
We inserted ER in our Final Brick to standardise it and this can now be used to modularly characterise biomaterials through our innovative system. Materials characterised with our ER construct could be applied as filters to purify water from dangerous quantities of estrogen which is a very common pollutant. Together with our nickel binding construct, these are an example of how our plug and play split inteins system is not only a method that could greatly help in research, but it is also aimed at real world applications which could affect millions of people.

function can be facilitated. By doing so, we hope that we can assist other users to find and use those parts efficiently. Ultimately we want to facilitate the implementation of the philosophy of Part Registry, which is to get and give (and share), through a better organization of ncRNA parts in the registry.
This page was written in compliance with Part Registry's format for general Catalog Pages. Currently, the information is uploaded manually because we have yet to submit our suggestions to iGEM HQ. Upon approval, we will tag existing regulatory RNAs and complete the page. Being part of the cross-cohort ""Project Riboregulator"", the page is far from complete and is expected to take shape by Summer 2015. We welcome and encourage constant update and adoption of this page in the future.

This year, our Human Practices focused on the following areas.
      First of all, as the first time to participate in iGEM, we lack experience.             In order to be more effective in preparing for the competition, we actively             contacted with other excellent team, visited their school to ask how to prepare             for iGEM. These teams included: Peking, HZAU-China, HUST-China, FAFU-CHINA,             WHU-China (2015). In addition, we also participated in the 2016CCiC (Central             China iGEM Consortium), and exchanged ideas with the participants of the 30             other teams, receiving a lot of valuable experience and advice.  
      Secondly, in view of the overall design and experimental design of the project,             we contacted with Jiang Huifeng, a researcher of Tianjin Institute of Industrial             Biotechnology and Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Kang Peng, a Professor of             Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry CAS . And we went to the laboratory             to study the related mature theories and experimental techniques of Blue Leaf.  
      In addition, because it is the first time for us to participate in this             competition, the students around and teachers from other schools of our             university didn’t know much about synthetic biology and iGEM. In order to promote iGEM and synthetic biology, we conducted three preach activities.
      Finally, as the sponsor and the main planner, we jointly organized             ""Talk with LanZhou, Talk about iGEM"" online live sharing activities             with LanZhou iGEM team. We used network live platform which is very             popular and mature at present, beyond the limitations of traditional             lectures. In the live, conversation was taken place between LanZhou             iGEM team members and online audience, to introduce their project.             LanZhou iGEM team members answered the questions asked by the audience.             In just one hour, we got 1100+ hits, which has made a very good publicity             display effect."

A long-term residue will also make the bacteria microbial tolerance, which may cause a double infection.
Whereas，Currently antibiotics (including tetracycline) detection methods are more complex. Not only the instruments are very expensive, but also the cost of detection is high, which brings many inconvenience to the sample detection. Our group hopes to use synthetic biology to provide a simple, reliable and efficient method for the detection of antibiotics. And we hope it can serve testing organizations and the ordinary families to ensure their food safe.
Project Proposals
Our group constructed the tetracycline inducible expression system. And through plasmid mediated, the system was transfected into Escherichia coli TOP10 and GS115 Pichia pastoris. It can generate a rtTA transcription activation factor in cells. RtTA combining with tetracycline antibiotics can activate the fluorescent protein expression system, which can instructs the tetracycline class of antibiotics by fluorescence detection.
rtTA: combined with rTetR (reverse TetR) and VP16 transcriptional activation of regional. RTetR derived from the mutation of the 4 amino acids in TetR.
The fluorescent protein expression system: TRE (Tet-responsive element), PminCMV (minimal CMV minimal promoter promoter) and fluorescent protein gene composed of it.

Improved Plug-in environment that allows users to add even more expanded functionality to Clotho. This will include more extension points where plug-ins can be integrated and a set of more fully featured interfaces for existing extensions.
Helping Out In The Lab: Assembly Algorithms
One of the initial algorithms we added to Clotho was an ""optimal assembly"" algorithm that can take in a list of goal composite parts and return a list with the minimum number of steps required to build those parts - a particularly useful feature if the goal parts utilize many of the same basic parts as subcomponents. The UC Berkeley wet team used these tools on a collection of 496 goal composite parts. Had no overlap been found (e.g. using naive methods), 5961 total parts would have to have been made. The program generated an assembly tree that required only 1283 total parts be built, reducing the number having to be assembled by 4678 parts. This assembly took just over 4 minutes to complete using the algorithm - if this same process were attempted by hand, it would take multiple people over 3 days to complete!  This saved the wet team perhaps weeks of work as well as helping them save on the cost of the reagents required for the thousands of reactions that would have been necessary.
PoBoL: BioBrick Data Sharing Made Easy
A diagram representing the basic structural concepts behind PoBoL
PoBoL stands for ""Provisional BioBrick Language"", and is the name given to a technical standard for BioBrick data in synthetic biology databases.  Put simply, our implementation of PoBoL is encapsulated in the Clotho Data structure. We indicate that this is our version since it adds objects which are not part of PoBoL. These include collections of BioBricks and composite information (right and left children and order). One of the big issues current facing synthetic biology is coming up with a parts standardization. We hope that Clotho can help to raise and solve issues in this area by being a deployment vehicle for ideas. Since we have created Clotho in a highly modular way, it can be the test bed for a variety of part standardization ideas.
For more information on the PoBoL standard, check out www.pobol.org
Increasing Collaboration Through Better Access To Database
A common theme with all scientific exploration is: ""How will the technology you are developing have a positive impact on society"". I think most people agree that Synthetic Biology has tremendous potential to be a force for good in the world"

In our experiment, HepG2 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate. After one day incubation gradient concentration of sodium palmitate from 0 mM to 1.0mM, and 2.0mM were added into each row. After adding the sodium palmitate, we have incubated the cells for 24 hours and 48 hours. MTT reagent was added and formazan formation was observed and measured.
Results
From the MTT assay, we can conclude that after 24 hours of incubation with palmitic acid, around 45% of cell viability can be maintained even at 2.0mM. For 48 hours incubation, cell viability is very different. To maintain 50% cell viability after 48 hours incubation with palmitic acid, we cannot exceed 0.32 mM of palmitic acid.
Transfection and Fatty Acid Uptake Rate
The ACE proteins for glyoxylate shunt were fused with fatty acid-induced promoters. The promoters were induced by introducing variable concentrations of sodium palmitate to trigger greater expression. To observe the difference in fatty acid uptake rate for constitutive and inducible system where enzymes expression were triggered, we also did a parallel transfection of BioBrick containing constitutive promoter to see the variations of FA uptake rate.
To get the uptake rate of FA, we decided to quantify FA concentration in medium time by time. We are right now making our determination to use FA quantification assay kit, Sigma Fatty Acid Quantification Kit from TIN HANG TECHNOLOGY LIMITED.

For both coarse grained structures, an elastic network was applied with a cutoff of 0.5 nm such that the beta-barrels of the proteins are maintained.
Fig 2 The molecular system. Left image represents  the fused Lpp_OmpA+anti_GFP inserted to a DOPC lipid bilayer while the coarse grained structure of GFP is presented on the right.
To set up a calculation, the system having the simplest and least variables containing configuration was chosen:
Lipid membrane, containing DOPC lipids only
GFP molecules surrounding the membrane
Lpp_OmpA+Anti_GFP (transmembrane protein + globular protein with affinity to GFP)
Common parameters for martini were used for minimization and equilibration, and the model was setup to run for about 10 microseconds with berendsen temperature coupling and Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling. The system runs at 300 K and a pressure of 1 bar.
The building process is documented on the project’s github page
Results
Binding between anti-GFP and GFP was visualized over time in Fig. 3 to validate that the model functions as expected. Fig. 3 shows that binding occurs after roughly 1 ms and is quite strong as expected.
Fig 3 Distance between GFP and anti-GFP measured over time. Strong binding occurs over roughly 1 ms of simulation.
The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) was computed over time using GROMACS and plotted in Fig. 4 to show OmpA unfolding over time. The entire event takes place over a time scale of roughly 1 ms.
Fig 4 OmpA unfolding visualized over time by computing the Root Mean Square Deviation from the starting conformation. Unfolding occurs roughly over a time scale of 1 ms.
Due to a strong tendency to shield charged residues within the remaining barrel structure from interacting with apolar lipids tails, a part of the transmembrane OmpA stays anchored in the lipid bilayer Fig. 5. The figure shows clearly that red and blue (charged) side chains are kept within the remnants of the beta barrel and only apolar and slightly polar side chains are exposed to the lipid environment.
Another observation is that the end of the unfolded beta-barrel is sticking out of the membrane, and contains many charged side chains"

Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#PowerCell#Cyanobacteria_-_-_TEXT.html," the triple covalent bond between the two nitrogen atoms, although the reaction is oxygen-sensitive and can only take place in an anaerobic environment.
Nitrogenase 1
Heterocysts on an Anabaena filament ( http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/103690 )
For this reason, most diazotrophs separate the processes of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation temporally – that is, they photosynthesize in the day and fix nitrogen at night. Anabaena 7120 has a different way around this problem. It forms long filaments of cells containing two different cell types, normal (vegetative) cells, and heterocysts.
Heterocysts are specialized cells, visibly larger and darker than the rest, and form thick cell walls which house an anaerobic intracellular microenvironment where the nitrogenase can perform nitrogen fixation.  The nitrogen-containing products are exported to adjacent vegetative cells via plasmodesmata, through which photosynthesized carbon products return. Normal (vegetative) cells carry on with photosynthesis. The two cell types then share nutrients up and down the filament, thus providing each cell with all the nutrients it needs.
Anabaena can live in aerobic conditions, fix nitrogen and photosynthesize sugars.  They are able to produce almost everything they need, making them capable of living on very minimal media—clear water with a few trace minerals.  It follows that we can harness their self-sufficiency to provide for more dependent organisms, such as E. coli.  All we have to do is enforce some compulsory generosity, and although Anabaena won’t be as well-fed as it was as a selfish microbe, the E. coli it is supporting will have a food source where it otherwise would have gone hungry.

INSA-UPS_France,2017,Team:INSA-UPS France#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," maintain low level of V. cholera agent if the water reserve is contaminated again because of people use. Thus, new methods of prevention and treatment have to be developed.
This is why our system has been designed to treat water in most cases. By improving prevention methods and water treatment, we aim to act in favor of universal access to drinkable water based on frugal innovation integrated in local dispositive.
2 - …in the most elegant way: a microbial consortium
Analyzing the current solutions helped us to take an original positioning for our solution and focus more on the prevention approach by purifying water than on a diagnosis system. Our system is energy free, has a soft impact on the user by being easy to implement in the all-day life, and has a minimal impact on organoleptic characteristic of the water.
Fig. 6: iGEM teams which have already worked on cholera: St Andrew 2010 , Dundee Schools 2016 , Colombia 2014 and Sheffield 2010 .
We were not the first iGEM team to engage in the cholera fight. The main challenge of previous iGEMers was about V. cholerae quorum sensing detection. They worked with E. coli as a chassis but all faced major issues to detect V. cholerae quorum sensing since transposition of signaling pathway between microorganisms is a complex task, even harder if we want to integrate a bacterial pathway in a yeast. That was our main reason to choose the cholera problem to demonstrate the potent of synthetic consortium.
Conditional expression of non-conventional antimicrobial peptides.
First, D-NY15 was shown to be efficient to eliminate V. cholerea ( see Results ). Our solution is intended to treat large volume of water. Considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains, we feel that using such an innovative molecule is a great asset to the project. This is reinforced by the expression conditional to V. cholerae presence. D-NY15 use will also be facilitated by the fact that it does not show any cytotoxicity effect on human cells. 10
Advantages of the consortium solution
Fig. 7: our multi-organisms system to fight against cholera.
Building a synthetic microbial consortium with V. harveyi and Pichia pastoris was a major disrupting decision regarding the current solutions and the previous iGEM works. Eventually, this consortium could be superior to the sum of both single organism. With minimal modifications, Vibrio harveyi can detect V. cholerae but cannot produce AMP because of self-lysis issues. Pichia pastoris"

Collaboration
We have collaborated with other iGEM teams in meaningful ways and made contributions to projects of other teams.
* We worked as a leader and collaborated with other 10 iGEM teams to take videos about biosafety.
* We provided USTC a kind of reagent – CdS nanoparticles for testing whether CdS nanoparticles can increase the cathode-current as expected. Eventually, we received their feedback of their data.
* We helped UCAS characterize their nitrogen promoter to make their data more solid.
* We visited Fudan and finally gave them a realistic model for their project.
* We have collected parts from other teams to help us for constructing our devices library.
* We have attended many conferences and have meetings with many iGEM teams. We have participated in CCiC in FAFU, and one of our team member, Mingzhe Chen, has be invited to give a short introduction about quorum sensing system.

Human Practice
The great amount of work we have done for Human Practices has given rise to the increasing interests of Synthetic Biology of at least hundreds of adults from different fields. Firstly，we have done public education: In this part, we brought synthetic biology and MagicBlock to the public. We visited high schools to introduce synthetic biology to the students and to guide them to design bio-product using MagicBlock. We also used Social media to publicize synthetic biology and our project. Secondly, we leaded biosafety videos for 10 iGEM teams: Biosafety is one of the most important issues everyone should be aware of before starting any biology related experiments. However, the biosafety education in China is far behind the fast development of modern biological research. In some places, students are not trained properly because of the outdated education material or the language barrier that prevent them from reading biosafety guidelines written in English.

Integrated Human Practice
Our integrated human practice constitutively guides our project in various ways:
From one hand, inspired by the creativity and enthusiasm of non-biologists through interviews and questionnaires, we have found that many people are very enthusiastic and imaginative about bio-designs, yet have little knowledge in synthetic biology and little lab experience.
During the invention of MagicBlock, we maintain contact with the public, to test MagicBlock as well as receiving suggestions. we held two workshops, guiding participants to use MagicBlock to design their own bio-products. We received various thought"

Some notes from the Whisky by-products study case
The whisky sector remains high with a growth rate estimated at 2.1% over the period to 2018. This would result in an approximate increase in by-products in the region of: Draff – 52,800 tonnes and Pot ale – 88,800 tonnes. By-products from Scotch Whisky distillery (draff and pot ale for example), have long been reused by the agriculture sector as a valuable animal feed and fertiliser for agricultural land (Figure 1). However, suitable routes would be need to be found for these by-products, as existing are near their natural capacity. New developments have recently opened up new markets for the use of by-products as feedstock for renewable heat or its use to make protein feed for salmon farming and biofuel.

Summary
Summary
A team member visited a government ""biotechnology park"" intended to be used by small scale startups. We wanted to understand the facilities available in these parks to see if there existed a need for improvement and gauge the feasibility of implementing our project in these parks. We found that the bioreactors in these parks had no sensors, centrifuges or any level of automation. These bioreactors were currently used only to grow cultures that were sold without further processing.
We input information learned from our visit into our project by developing biobricks and a protocol to perform functions usually done by machines, which were not available in these parks like centrifugation, automatic induction and cell density monitoring. This would enable more complicated protocols required for the biosynthesis of most useful products to be undertaken at these facilities.
Thus, we integrated information gleaned from the visit in the processes targeted by cellfifuge.
Biotech Park Visit
Visit to Biotechnology Park
As stated in the introduction, our project is an attempt to modify E. coli to lower capital and running costs for rDNA bioreactor systems, by automating protein over-expression induction and separation of cell from growth media.
To learn more about the existing biotech infrastructure in India, we decided to visit some biotech parks in India and explore the feasibility and applicability of our idea.
As stated in the summary, we found that the bioreactors in these parks had no sensors, centrifuges or any level of automation. These bioreactors were currently used only to grow cultures that were sold without further processing. We input information learned from our visit into our project by developing biobricks and a protocol to perform functions usually done by machines, which were not available in these parks like centrifugation, automatic induction and cell density monitoring.

This symposium also offered a great opportunity for reaching out to the public. 150 people, students, academics, but also non-scientists, attended the symposium!
The first lecture was given by professor Johan Robben, who is one of our instructors this year and has been for every participation of the KU Leuven in the competition. He currently supervises the new lab for molecular and synthetic biology. His lecture revolved around the basic understanding of living nature and how this eventually evolves into changing nature. This was followed by a lecture of professor Kevin Verstrepen. After a period of scientific research and teaching at the MIT and Harvard professor Verstrepen returned to the KU Leuven where he continues his research about fundamental genetics. The subject of the lecture is related to that: how does DNA coding for new functions come into existence?
After the lectures, the public had gotten a taste for synthetic biology and it was time for us and the delegation of the Groningen iGEM team to present our projects. We invited all the Benelux (Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg) iGEM-teams, but that close to the deadline of the European Jamboree, only the team from Groningen could make it for the presentation. In short presentations of twenty minutes we explained the content of our project and its uses to the public. We received useful information to improve our presentation for the European Jamboree!

And after a little climbing tour to Montmartre and maybe some super-last-minute poster printing ;), we settled for the night in our shady ""lodging"" to be ready to showcase our project publicly for the first time. Early morning, we headed to the event location. First objective: COFFEE,
which ended up being a greater challenge than could have been anticipated... Don't bring a knife (instant coffee) to a gun fight (horde of thirsty, tired students) :D

Fire performance
After breakfast was acquired, things started to get interesting. Dozens of awesome projects from all over Europe and even the UK! It was great to see all those ideas and of course to be able to showcase our own bioprinting project ourselves. We also obtained helpful tips and hints. After the poster sessions was over and nutrition had been taken care of, interesting panels on ethics and entrepreneurship in synthetic biology followed before it was time for Randy to drop some final Brexit jokes and conclude the scientific section of the event.

Party
The evening promised to be a great dance party in ""downtown Paris,"" including a live stream of the quarter-final match of the European Championship between Italy and of course Germany. After this sweat-breaking, super-tight, overly nerve-wracking game was finally over, with the better end for us :), we hit the dance floor down in the underground car park. The midnight surprise: a breathtaking fire-breather, who for some reason was interrupted by the security guard, we wonder why ;). With this awesome party night marking the end of the European Experience , we used the following Sunday to enjoy a wonderful French breakfast and explore the tourist sites of the ""City of Love"" before it was time to board the plane back to the lab. What a great event!

New reagents were prepared to repeat the PCR, using this time the optimal concentrations recommended by Bio-Rad for the iProof polymerase, i.e. primer concentrations of 0.5 uM and DNA template quantities between 1 pg and 10 ng for 50 ul. Specifically, we prepared a set with 1:1000 diluted template (resulting in a mass between 25 and 100 pg) and a set with 1:100 diluted template (resulting in a mass between 0.25 and 1 ng). They have been frozen with no polymerase, to attempt a touchdown PCR tomorrow.

*EPIC FAIL* - Touchdown PCR to amplify the fragments for Gibson assembly of the two reporter plasmids
Touchdown PCR was run on yesterday's samples, to amplify the fragments for Gibson assembly of the reporter plasmids, using the Bio-Rad thermal cycler. The thermal cycles were designed according to the iProof datasheet, using touchdown PCR recommendations from Korbie & Mattick (2008) [1]. Since the primer melting temperatures range from 47° C to 60° C, the cycle step the annealing temperature down from 65° C to 45° C over 20 cycles in constant decrements. It then repeats another 20 cycles at the 45° C floor temperature. Elongation lasts 40 s, following Bio-Rad's recommendation of 15 s/kb, for a 2400 kb product. The other parameters are as usual for iProof polymerase.
The PCR yielded absolutely no products. To further investigate the cause of failure, the PCR has been repeated using the Roche High Fidelity PLUS PCR kit, adapting the thermal cycles to the new polymerase. In a desparate move, the old PCR products were re-used for an almost-identical run on the Eppendorf cycler, with slightly longer elongation and denaturation steps (50 s and 7 s, respectively).

Austin_UTexas,2018,Team:Austin UTexas#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," actually designed for non-model organisms. To ensure that the plasmids and method of transforming many plasmids at once was applicable outside of E. coli, we began testing the same preliminary version of the one tube mixture in other host organisms. The assemblies found in Table 1 were transformed into V. natriegens, specifically we used Vmax cells. The recoveries were plated on media containing KAN, CRB, or CAM. Separately, we also performed a transformation that involved a positive control provided by the Vmax kit. We received this positive control from the Barrick lab who told us that the quality of controls was not optimal. Vmax cells are more sensitive to ampicillin/carbenicillin than our E. coli, and Vmax™ Express has natural resistance to kanamycin. Therefore, we used the recommended concentration for the selection of kanamycin-resistant colonies: 100 µg/mL of kanamycin. Colony growth was seen only in KAN and CAM plates, however, there was no clear presence of the reporter colors on either plate. Additionally, the KAN plate has two size colonies growing (Figure 5).
Transformation into V. natriegens was only evident in the KAN plate, on which three assembly plasmids containing the appropriate antibiotic resistance gene can grow. The protocol for transforming into Vmax cells (electrocompetent V. natriegens) cites the presence of two types of colonies as potential evidence for successful transformation, the smaller size colonies perhaps being the ones with the extra burden of maintaining one of our plasmids. To see the protocol, click here. There were hints of color in the smaller colonies, but what was observed could not be considered conclusive evidence of reporter gene expression. This could be due to the choice of promoter for these completed assemblies. Up until this point, we had been making our assemblies with the GlpT promoter. However, this promoter does not have a particularly broad host range, which may explain why the transformations did not appear to be as successful. The lack of reporter expression in V. natriegens has led us to begin transitioning to using the CP25 promoter in our assemblies and bridge parts, because it is considerably more broad host range and has a higher expression rate1.
We have several options for next steps. These involve picking colonies and plating them on new plates to see if they grow normally, and/or sequencing colonies for their barcodes which are specific to origins. This will allow us to check which origins are working. From there we may retransform for further verification.

Cornell,2014,Team:Cornell#project#hprac#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," the environment.
Our filtration device includes a hollow fiber reactor, which is specifically designed to hold cells inside, yet let water and other materials pass through it. The hollow fiber reactor is made of high flux polysulfone and has a molecular weight cut off at 5 kilodaltons, retaining about half of any molecule that is of that weight. It is highly unlikely that our cells would be capable of escaping the device.
Proliferation/Competition – The subsequent multiplication, genetic reconstruction, growth, transport, modification and die-off of these micro-organisms in the environment, including possible transfer of genetic material to other micro-organisms.
The inclusion of the metallothionein gene in our organism severely impedes growth, thus other cells in the environment will outcompete our genetically engineered strain.
Establishment – The establishment of these micro-organisms within an ecosystem niche, including possible colonization of humans or other biota.
Since our cells are both slow-growing and highly unlikely to escape from the filtration device, it is improbable that the organism will be able to create a niche and outcompete healthy cells within the ecosystem.
Effect – The subsequent occurrence of human or ecological effects due to interaction of the organism with some host or environmental factor.
Ideally, our project would not have an effect on the environment or any other host. However, if there were to be a leak somewhere in our system, the largest concern would be if another organism were to somehow take up DNA lost from our cells. This would require a naturally competent bacterial strain to come across a leak in our system that yields an intact plasmid, and the plasmid would have to be able to replicate. In all likelihood, in the absence of selective pressure, the plasmid would actually be deleterious to the cell due to the increased metabolic load and would therefore probably be expelled.[1]
Comprehensive Environmental Assessment
The EPA’s Comprehensive Environmental Assessment (CEA) is a tool to allow scientists to broaden their perspectives by incorporating the experiences, expertise, and concerns of diverse stakeholders. CEA differs from traditional methods of risk assessment by recognizing that risk assessment is fundamentally a decision-making process in which scientists, experts, and the public should be engaged in transparent dialogue. The goal is to evaluate limitations and trade-offs to arrive at holistic conclusions about the primary issues that researchers should be addressing in their research planning.
The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., recently launched efforts to lay out a framework to apply CEA to synthetic biology. This groundbreaking project set out to assess the CEA approach’s relevance to synthetic biology, in anticipation of the growing demand"

We also think we could improve the clarity of our handouts to guide people through our prepared exercises more effectively. We enjoyed delivering this workshop and feel the feedback shows our workshop was a success.  We believe the workshop presentation and handouts we developed are a great resource for those new to biological modelling.

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Foundations_-_-_TEXT.html," of the project was to quantify and subsequently model the amounts of protein expression when the system is exposed to different rates of variation of temperature. Utilizing a fluorescent protein was obviously very convenient for this goal as it allowed accurate, quick quantification of protein expression. However, in the future, this part of the system could be swapped out for any functional protein so that the system could respond in the desired manner to the input signal fluctuation.
mf-Lon:
mfLon is a Lon protease originally found in Mesoplasma florum that degrades proteins tagged with a corresponding protein degradation tag [10], described by Cameron and Collins in 2014 and characterized by the 2017 William and Mary iGEM Team [11,12]. It was selected to be incorporated into our system because its protein target sequence is orthogonal to native E. coli degradation tags. It only degrades the specially marked TetR and σF protein products so as to prevent false fluorescence readings resulting from protein accumulation.
Furthermore, because mf-Lon is foreign to E. coli, in future studies we could tune the rate of its expression by modifying the promoter or ribosome binding sequences that precede the mfLon gene. This would give us greater control over our system. The rate of degradation of the hrpR/S proteins would become an additional tunable parameter to determine the range of frequency of input signal for which the reporter would be expressed.

Introducing a 10% ‘spacer gel’ between 4% stacking and 16% separating gels considerably sharpens the bands for proteins and peptides of 1–5 kDa.
3. Adjust protein concentrations so that a suitable amount of protein can be loaded onto the gel. Concentrate samples, preferentially by techniques that do not increase the salt concentration (such as ultrafiltration). Roughly 0.2–1 μg of protein for each protein band (in 0.7 × 5 mm gel strips) is sufficient for Coomassie staining. Accordingly, the desired protein concentration in the sample is 0.1 mg/ml–1 for each protein band. For silver staining, 100-fold less protein may be sufficient. Depending on the requirements of protein detection and analysis, concentration of the sample may be necessary.The maximal protein load can be limited by large amounts of neutral detergent in the sample and by high concentrations of lipid when solubilizing biological membranes. SDS must always be in large excess over neutral detergents and/or lipids. For isolated mitochondrial membranes (70% protein, 30% lipid), for example, the optimized maximal protein load of sample wells 0.7 × 5 mm is 20 μg. Increasing the applied amount of protein to 40 μg, for example, may cause the individual protein bands to disappear in a diffuse background. Around 0.4% neutral detergent in the sample can be tolerated for direct mixing with SDS-containing sample incubation buffers and application to SDS gels. The incubation buffers and volumes described in Step 4 set a tenfold excess of SDS over the neutral detergent. Setting the SDS/neutral detergent ratio to <10 may result in a surprising result after staining: normally separated, large proteins may be detected in the upper gel areas, but the lower gel areas may be completely clear with no small proteins detectable.
4. Mix samples with SDS-containing sample buffers. The volume and buffer to be used depend on the origins of the samples. For low-density samples such as elution fractions from chromatographic columns, add 5 μl of reducing or nonreducing sample incubation buffer A or B (see REAGENTS) to 15 μl of sample. For high-density samples such as fractions from sucrose density gradients, add 5 μl of sample buffer C or D to 15 μl of sample. For pellet samples"

The mouse strain C57BL/6J was obtained from the breeding centre of the Medical faculty, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. This is a well characterized strain (genome and physiology) and was shown to be responsive to H. pylori infection by exhibiting higher colonization rates and increased patho-histological changes in the stomach upon infection. In addition, this strain reacts to the infection mostly by Th1 cell response, which resembles the response of humans to infection with H. pylori. We can therefore better extrapolate the results gained in this mouse model to the human.

FREDsense Technologies
We are building better biosensors.
FREDsense has developed a novel system for quantitative, real-time detection of various toxins in any sample. We use a biosensor with an electrochemical output to create a system that is portable, fast, and unlike anything else in the market
See how we're different. >
Toxic Chemicals Are Bad.
Detecting toxic compounds in our environment is an ongoing struggle that we face, whether the underlying issue is a public health or an environmental protection concern.  The biosensing market worldwide is already an $8.9 billion market and is expected to grow to $18.9 billion by 2018. Alberta, Canada is faced with a specific challenge; development of petroleum related industries, specifically the oil sands, has led to large volumes of contaminated water that must be remediated before release into the natural ecosystem.  However, current methods of testing are either too slow, labour intensive or do not accurately report the relative toxicity. Thus, the 2013 iGEM Calgary Entrepreneurial team is building a better biosensor based system to report on the general toxicity present.
The Pitch
Who Are We?
We are FREDsense, an early venture start-up company focused on designing and implementing novel biosensor systems for oil sands applications. Our goal is to commercialize a product that was initially started as an iGEM project in 2012.
What Do We Have?
Our toxin biosensor system is designed to be rapid, on-site, and require little to no sample prep, providing a distinct advantage against competing technologies presently available to oil sands service companies.
Are We Needed?
With growing regulatory bodies increasing the financial contribution to analytical based monitoring instrumentation, there is an emerging market surrounding specific toxin sensing for oil sands applications.

Macquarie_Australia,2017,Team:Macquarie Australia#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," user with ease. A petrol bowser is connected to the base and coils around a holder at the side of the unit to allow for easy, compact storage. As stated in our overriding objective, sustainability is our team’s top priority. As such, the H2GEM’s exterior will be made from recycled metal materials sourced from scrap yards which would have otherwise been destined for landfill. All the functionalities of this prototype were designed considering our survey results, industry advice , and interviewee feedback.
The internal compartments were designed so that the E. coli vat would sit at the bottom. Nutrients such as the media and glucose would be delivered through cassettes that would plug into the machine. The produced gases would pass through a hydrogen selective membrane, and be stored in a round compartment, which will help equalise pressure, sitting atop the vat. The gas would then pass through a column and convert the hydrogen gas into a more safely storable aluminium hydride. When the gas is needed, it can be reverted back and used for consumption in a hydrogen cell.
We are different!
As far as our team or any of our collaborators at the CSIRO or USyd are aware, this is the first such construction in which organisms are manipulated into producing gas for consumption. No other conception such as ours exists and the prototype is entirely novel, building upon the work of last year’s team. This product integrates our laboratory component to give it a more practical capability and has potential to disrupt the market should there be any investment, as outlined in our prototype business plan .
It is through this simple and elegant design that our team successfully addressed the problems associated with renewable hydrogen gas by 1) using genetically engineered E. coli to produce hydrogen gas in a cheap, environmentally friendly manner, and 2) storing it in a safe container sourced from recycled material. When designing this prototype, our team was in communications with Ainsley Newson (A/Prof of Bioethics at Sydney Health Ethics, Sydney School of Public Health) in regard to having genetically engineered organisms in the home, and we also followed all Australian guidelines in our experimentation. This design was also showcased at two international conferences to great interest from all parties, and with the help of Mr Michael Rampe and Mr Peter Reeves from Pedestal our team designed a 3D rendering of our prototype,  H2GEM, which is available on their website.
This product also has potential to become internationally viable due to the fact that our collaboration with Manchester allowed us to ensure that our prototype would follow legislations and safety guidelines from not just in Australia, but also from countries in Europe, America"

This experiment made it clear, that gene expression controlled by the pBAD promoter is both inducible and repressible as required when cloned into the low copy vector pSB3K3. Consequently, the pBAD promoter was found to be suitable for controlling gene expression of the antitoxin RelB in the implemented dormancy system."

Labcourse for middle school students
Lecture: For Freshmen
Context, rationale & prior work
Most of our members knew nothing about synthetic biology until we started the second academic year. We really hope that somebody could introduce us to the new subject as soon as we entered university.
Luckily, a teacher giving lecture to freshmen contacted us and invited us to give a lecture in this class! We were so excited. iGEMers can be professors! Also, the teacher asked us to prepare some homework and several questions in the exam related to synthetic biology and he would correct them.
This is a great way to introduce the subject to freshmen. They are really excited and unclear about how to spend their University life and iGEMers could be a great example. Not only did they know a new subject, but they knew many energetic and innovative students as well. Also, as a team you could try to find new members for the iGEM competition next year. It's beneficial and easy to do this. We plan to get favor from our instructor and give a series of systematic lectures in the future and teach them as much things as possible.
Our Work
Most of them had never heard about Synthetic Biology and it was our lecture that introduced them to the subject! They asked a lot about the competition and hoped to join us! This lecture made it early enough to prepare for it!
Lecture for freshman students in Nankai University.
For safety, know more & do more.
In our Human Practice project, we decided to do a survey focusing on the health and safety of researchers. We collected information and the results inspired us a lot. We consequently decided to integrate the 'safety' part into our program.
We will demonstrate the survey before presenting more details of the integration.
Context, rationale & prior work of the investigation
Event 1 On Sep 21st, a serious accident hurt three students badly, which shocked the whole country. According to the report, a student who is in his second year of postgraduate study was teaching two newcomers to do experiments. He wrongly used an Erlenmeyer flask instead of a beaker and added much potassium permanganate (KMnO4) to concentrated sulfuric acid. When he was doing this, he told his students to be careful because ""the product is easily to explode"". Pitifully, hardly when he had finished the sentence did it come true."
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," microfluidics such as mixing and extensibility for zones capable of manipulating temperature. The software provides a separate but fundamentally similar interface alongside that which the chip will be running, creating a simulator able to mimic the effects of running a process on the chip. This serves as an inexpensive and rapid means of testing a real EWOD system. In order to serve a real purpose, the simulation software must not simply function correctly but also provide a simple, fast means of displaying, logging and outputting the information it processes. As such the software must not only be correct, verified, and validated, but also intuitive both to extend and use the full range of the base functionality. This introduces a key component of human-computer interaction to the task whereby the software must be able to cater to the precise needs of the user. It must also be possible to tailor it accordingly.
Agent-Based Modelling
The use of an agent-based system for this task is advantageous in a number of key areas. Agent-based systems excel in giving a very clear idea of how the properties of an individual are affecting the greater system, especially when individuals are heterogeneous (Bonabeau, 2002). In this project for example, if scheduling is not optimal for a chip layout then there may be significant bottlenecking in a particular area. Bottlenecking is an example of emergent phenomena in that it can only occur as a result of the properties of many individuals. With only access to the behaviour of the entire system, it can be very difficult to determine the cause of a bottleneck. With an agent based approach however, and analysis of several individuals in the affected area, the cause of the problem will in most cases quickly become apparent. Another advantage of using an agent-based system for this project is that we are also implementing the scheduling for the software. Our scheduling system requires knowledge of each of the individual droplets in the system, and it must also be able to predict their movements for a certain period of time into the future. Computationally we are therefore already expending time and resources upon acquiring and manipulating these data sets and as such it makes sense to extend this knowledge into the agent-based model.

In order that the characteristic factors of the folding rate can be extracted from protein sequences, we introduced the Chou's pseudo amino acid composition concept.38 According to the pseudo amino acid composition principle, the position information of protein sequences can be, to some extent, reflected by a group of serial correlation factors θ1，θ2 ，θ3……，θn ,which is defined as follows:
in the function, θ1 is called the first-tier correlation factor that reflects the sequences order correlation between all the most contiguous residues along a protein chain (Fig. 2a), θ2 the second-tier correlation factor that reflects the sequences order correlation between all the second most contiguous residues (Fig.2b), θ3 the third-tier correlation factor that reflects the sequences order correlation between all the 3rd most contiguous residues (Fig.2c), and so forth.38
Figure 2
the correlation function is given by4:
Θ(Ri,Rj)=|H(Rj)-H(Ri)|
where H1(Ri)), H2(Ri), and M(Ri) are, respectively, the hydrophobicity value. Studies have shown that λ=10 will be the best predictor.39 But there will be a large amount of calculation considering all possible situations—the 30 factors. We"

The Sociology of iGEM
Modern science communication is about more than telling non-scientists what to think. Establishing a two-way conversation with those outside the profession allows a wider variety of socially relevant issues to emerge naturally. Our ‘human practices’ effort therefore, has not used our wetlab project as a starting point. Instead, we have conducted a sociological investigation into iGEM.
We found out why students participate in iGEM , how they devised their projects and how they react to the philosophical questions raised by synthetic biology. We asked journalists what makes synthetic biology interesting , and how news media might shape perceptions. We spoke to social scientists sceptical of the value of iGEM , both for society and scientific research. We questioned private institutions that fund iGEM teams about what makes the competition a worthwhile investment . We quizzed a previous iGEM judge on the value of ‘human practices’ within the competition. And spoke to artists about the language of MIT’s synthetic biology .
Our research culminates in an event jointly held with the Science Museum, London, where we’ll bring together ideas around the ability of iGEM to influence the culture of scientific research, and the implications this has for the external image of synthetic biology.
Conclusions
We have unearthed a wide variety of views on iGEM, synthetic biology, and the politics of transparency. Many are sceptical of the productivity of the field to date, and others see a contradiction in the competitive element of iGEM. Financial cost appears as an important barrier to entry, and the motives of participants tend towards career advancement rather than on the research.
The transparency and open-source ethos of the BioBrick Foundation could be seen as political; it serves to distance the project from competing private research such as that undertaken by Craig Venter. The ‘hacking’ ethos often encouraged by MIT and evident within iGEM has shaped the beginnings of the ‘garage biology’ movement, which has the potential to outpace traditional research. We have explored the democratising effect this will have for science in the future.
iGEM has also been described as a platform for training in innovation management, where the science itself is of less importance than the skills gained in marketing and teamwork. In the end, questions remain about the relevance of synthetic biology in terms of its products, and in terms of its interest to non-scientists.
iGEM has provided us with a"

Software tools for iGEMers : BioBrick/Project Search & Tutorials
When you first decided to take part in iGEM, you might have spent a lot of time on things such as learning about BioBricks and how to use them, searching a vast library of past projects, and looking for relevant parts.
These difficulties are common, so you are not alone among beginners to stumble upon them, halting the progression of determinig your team project.
However, there are presently only a few tools which help beginners from spending too much time.
Most software made by past teams target Synthetic biologists, those already farmiliar with iGEM to some extent, and are only available after long steps -- downloading, decompressing, and installing.
So, we decided to create a set of tools helpful to beginners.
If common obstacles can be removed, you can spend more time thinking about your project.
We have created two types of software : the Tutorial and the Searching System.
The Tutorial helps you understand concepts that beginners frequently stumble on, and what BioBricks and Genetic Networks are.
We have gamified the totorial, making it enjoyable to read.
The Searching System saves your time searching past projects and BioBrick parts.
You can easily access the information you really want.
Detailed descriptions are on individual project pages.

Our team is made up of engineers first. Biologists and students of medicine complete us. We were brought together by the Georgiev Lab whose engineering and innovation philosophy set the bar for all ideas and activities. We strive to make synthetic biology more comprehensible and bearable to engineers. This is the first iGEM team from the Czech Republic, hence the name. In a country where synthetic biology still lacks footing, we are outsiders in all of our respective departments. This brings us close together to a single lab from multiple corners of our country. In the months of hard work on the IOD band, our own band of friends and lab geeks emerged.

In January, 2004, Regulation on the Bio-safety Management of Pathogenic Microbe Labs was published soon. This is a milestone and since then, many other detailed regulations were published, either. The regulations includes highly pathogenic microbes transportation regulation (《可感染人类的高致病性病原微生物菌（毒）种或样本运输管理规定》) in 2005 by Ministry of Health, interpersonal infectious catalogue (《人间传染的病原微生物名录》) in 2006 by Ministry of Health，Regulations on Administration of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety(《农业转基因生物安全管理条例》) in 2001 by State Council, highly pathogenic microbes laboratory creature management rules(《人间传染的高致病性病原微生物实验室和实验活动生物安全审批管理办法》) in 2006 by Ministry of Health. These regulations are all restricted to the microorganism that is capable of causing human or animal diseases.
However, until now, there is not a specific regulation for synthetic biology. This phenomenon may be the result that the previous regulations for genetic engineering have covered the synthetic biology. Some people, such as Furger and Schweiz (2007) held similar view that synthetic biology will not have significant difference between genetic engineering in the future 25 years. However, synthetic biology has its own special features. The traditional regulations care less about homologous DNA transition. However, no one can guarantee that transfer several homologous DNA at a time is also safe.
Some institutions in China are trying their best to contribute to biosafety. In January, 2010, Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Botany held the first discussion about biosafety and held a second one in November, 2011. Synthetic biology regulation, management, related legislative suggestion (Guan, 2012).

The final simulation results of model are shown below (Fig.7). In acidic condition, the acid regulation device will produce GABA and decrease the extracellular pH. When environmental pH turns to be higher than 7.0, alkali regulation device will let lactic acid to neutralize the outside pH. Eventually, the environmental pH will be constrained between two promoters’ responsive range (but with a fluctuation).

Mathieu HUBERT
After obtaining his scientific high-school diploma, he did a Biotech degree in Bioanalysis and Controls where he acquired several laboratory competencies. He wanted to dive into scientific research and he flew to study in Paris to receive training in biomedical research. Second of the class, his passion for virology grew and he integrated the UPMC Master Molecular and Cellular Biology. He did the Master 2 Fundamental Virology at Institut Pasteur, where his knowledge about virology increased exponentially. Second of the class, he obtained a grant to fund his doctorate in virology during the next 3 years. Mathieu is a person who seems very calm at first sight, but when you know him well, he is a very funny guy and we spend a very pleasant time in his company! Between each laboratory experiment he never hesitates to make jokes to lighten the mood. He just validated his master in virology brilliantly and he is very good at what he does. We can say without a doubt that he is of great help in the lab and in the scientific design of our project!

Overview
Circular RNAs (circRNAs), formed by non-sequential back-splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts, are a wide- spread form of non-coding RNA in animal cells. Various function of natural existed circRNA revealed recently shows that circRNA can be used as powerful     tools in future research and health care. However, there is no toolbox to generate circRNA up to date, which restrict the research and application of circRNA. Our project focus on the devices to cyclize specific part of RNA, aiming to start a circRNA     revolution.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs expressed in different tissue and cell types that suppress the expression of target genes. Certain miRNAs, called oncomiRs, play a causal role in the onset and maintenance of cancer when overexpressed. Due     to the resistance to exonucleases, circRNAs sponge are promising tools for regulating oncomiRs.
We designed three types of devices to cyclize the RNA based on the back-splicing mechanism：the “Ouroboros”（cyclizing device based on the inverted repeat sequence in the exon-flanking region）, the “Cyclizer”（proteins that accelerate RNA cyclization)and     the acRNA(ssRNA that accelerate RNA cyclization).
We experimentally validate that our device can accelerate the formation of cirRNA. We also measured the half-life time of the circRNA, which proved its stability. To solidity our experiment procedure, we designed a device to report the level of mir-21     concentration and modeled the steady state of proteins to confirm our design.
Our devices provide huge possibility for cirRNA research and regulating oncomiRs. With our editable RNA binding domain of “Cyclizer”, we will eventually accomplish the cyclization of any selected exon based on the back-splicing mechanism. Our “Ouroboros”     has already been proved to be an efficient tool for ceRNA research and miRNA-function research. It is also promising to investigate the usage of our circRNA sponge in fighting cancer, for our sponge has display powerful ability to regulate oncomiRs.
Apart from our lab work, we also took active part in the educational outreach activities which has had huge influences on and off campus. As sociable participants in iGEM, we have collaboration with NYU_Shanghai, ZJU-China and NCTU Formosa, and mentored     a high school team WLSA_Fudan-Shanghai.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Survey
A useful tool to get different opinions on topics related to the iGEM team’s projects is conducting surveys. Therefore, you need as many participants as possible to get a broad spectrum of opinions. So our team decided to take part in the surveys of the different teams which can be seen below.
Political Perspective
We got in contact with many different politicians and asked for their opinion about genetic engineering and the political situation in Germany.
The answers from the different political parties can be seen in the PDF files below.
Svenja Schulze - SPD - minister for innovation, science and research
She is head of the ministry for innovation, science and research of North-Rhine-Westphalia and sent us greetings: ""Wenn sich junge Nachwuchswissenschaftlerinnen und Nachwuchswissenschaftler zu einem interdisziplinären Team zusammenschließen, um sich mit großem Engagement einem wichtigen Alltagsproblem zu widmen, dann verdient das Respekt und Anerkennung. Ich freue mich sehr, dass sich im iGEM 2016 Team Aachen Studierende der Fachrichtungen Biologie, Biotechnologie, Biomedizintechnik und Informatik zusammengefunden haben, um den Wissenschaftsstandort Nordrhein-Westfalen bei diesem internationalen Wettbewerb zu vertreten. Die Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer leisten damit einen Beitrag zur internationalen Sichtbarkeit unsers Standortes. Und sie leisten einen Beitrag für die Zukunft unserer Gesellschaft. Denn genau das ist schließlich Ziel von Forschung: die Zukunft unserer Gesellschaft gestalten. Das gilt auch für den Bereich der Synthetischen Biologie. Sie stellt aber insofern eine Besonderheit dar, als hier in besonderer Weise ethische Fragen eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Ich wünsche dem iGEM 2016 Team Aachen viel Freude bei der spannenden Forschungsarbeit und viel Erfolg beim internationalen Wettbewerb!"" Dr. Kay Zerlin answered our questions on behalf of her."

Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

With a huge      1-liter german beermug (for each of us) and music all around us, we talked about our planned      projects, the different ideas and how each of us ended up in our team.
June
First prototype / concept
Soon our first game concept and the first prototype was finished. We decided on a grid of 5 screens. One for every key aspect of the app. The augmented reality feature obviously ended up in the middle. Inventory and the Pathodex (our “virus dictionary”) ended up on opposite screens. The laboratory on the right side allowed for easy antidote crafting and the profile with achievements and a ladder got placed on the left side.
May
Reinventing the wheel
We soon settled on a gaming application, but ideas came plentiful: A quiz app about biology, a card game with viruses and several other ideas. In the end we settled for “Pathomon”.   An augmented reality app in which you encounter and fight viruses at randomly chosen GPS coordinates. To do this, you need to find active ingredients and craft them into antidotes.
April
Can I interest you in an adventure?
Our journey started when the Erlanger iGEM Team decided to bring in some computer scientists to expand their capabilities in new areas. The chair for games engineering in Wuerzburg seemed like the perfect fit and they presented their project, as well as the iGEM conference in general. After that it was without question, that we wanted to participate and joined their team. We immediately started thinking about the exact part we wanted to take in the iGEM Team. Designing and managing the website was an obvious task, which we inherited from the Erlanger department, but additional goals had to be set, which resulted in a lot of brainstorming sessions.

When we discussed our plans with the Winston Churchill Science Department, the best direction to have the PD days instilled was discussed. They suggested forming a collaborative community. In Alberta, a collaborative community is defined as a group of teachers being able to focus on any one school related topic and is open for any teacher to join. Moving forward in this direction, this would also allow these PD days to be open to the whole school district in Lethbridge.
The teachers are planning on visiting SynBridge facilities on April 9th, 2018 and plan on using this visit to move forward with the development of more synthetic biology initiatives in their curriculum. We plan on this being a long-term initiative to be continued on after our season has ended.

To understand if synthetic biology products and cell-free systems were regulated around the world, we researched relevant legislation. Table 1 is an overview of the regulations that we could find that are implemented in the four legal systems used as was suggested to us by Ian Andrews . Figure 1 is a map of the world to show which countries fall under one of the four legal systems mentioned. We concluded that some legal systems have more established regulations for the use of products derived using biotechnology. Most countries have in place some form of assessments to ensure that any products produced will not have detrimental effects on the environment and human health. As the use of biotechnology grows, we envision that more protocols and legislation will be enacted on the international level to have a more standardized way of regulating products and how they can be used within the different legal systems.

In place, appropriate labelling required in most cases to identify GMO status
Generally strict regulations in place (EU, JPN)
In place, usage differs depending on country though most countries allow (notable exception: NZ)
Dependent on country: some follow EU regulations and restrict access while others are in the process of developing legislation with minimal regulations
In place, only allow certain crops, need proper labelling to identify GMO status
