OD/F Device
Measuring Optical Density (OD) or absorbance is one of the indispensable elements in the field of microbiology. One question that has to be answered often is how many cells are in a suspension? Here, the OD can give a hint. However, the commercially available OD meters are expensive and limit its application and usage in low budget institutions.
Therefore, here we present our OD/F Device. The device is specifically designed for biohackspaces, Do It Yourself (DIY), community laboratories and schools. With our OD/F Device, we aim to enable precise and inexpensive scientific research.
Further, in Synthetic Biology, the task of measuring OD and fluorescence are often performed at the same time. Hence, here we present a device that can be configured to simultaneously measure both fluorescence and OD. With such a configuration of the OD/F Device, the production of fluorescence signal can be correlated to cell growth using a single and a portable device.

Measuring Principle
The measuring principle for both optical density (OD) and fluorescence measurement is shown below. For OD measurement,  the sample is illuminated with an LED and a fixed slit width. A filter blocks any light less than 600 nm. In this way, the sensor mainly senses the 600 nm light which is needed for OD600 measurement.
For the fluorescence measurement, a similar approach is followed. The filter, again, is used to block the exciting light from being sensed. In this way, only the emitted light from the fluorescence protein is detected and measured.
Further details about selecting filters, code, a construction manual and evaluation can be found here .

Despite, or perhaps because of this failure, we are moving on, trying to make new constructs that will be used for tunability. The YFP has yet to give us a solid band, so we are trying to move it into the psb1c3 plasmid in case there are some plasmid specific sequences that were giving us poor results. The ligation and transformation has been done, and we are waiting for colonies. The PCR products necessary for the gibson assembly of the GFP-IPTG-TrpA gene were also all available, and that gibson assembly has been done. However, due to the failure of several gels, there was very little product left, and PCR purification would likely result in unusuable quantities, so we tried a Gibson assembly with the straight PCR product, and we will see if it works.
Another PCR was done to generate some of the other parts required for assembly of other parts. The new forward primer for the arabinose promoter does not seem to be working, although the old one worked well. We recently ran out of phusion polymerase, and have resorted to using an eclectic mix of collected polymerases in our PCR box.
There are two distinct bands on the RFP PCR, one at the correct length, the other much lower. Seems like a perfect chance for gel extraction. Several other products were also generated today, but there are still two essential parts, that of YFP and that of the new arabinose promoter, which have not yet been successfully PCR'd.

The plans for the metA construct induction were further discussed. Overnight colonies will be made of the construct and a negative control, then they will be diluted in 1 in 100 LB, allowed to grow to 0.4 OD, induced with 0.1 mM new IPTG, and harvested at a certain OD following this, then run on an SDS PAGE. This will test to see if the IPTG really would stimulate the production of the metA gene. The negative controls were not in place yet. Four potential constructs have been grown up overnight, and are labeled 1-4 on tape in the right section of the left shaker. Is there some label on the metA protein that we could use to do a Western?
The data from the supernatant growth experiment was partially analyzed. It appears that 14 hours was not sufficient to reach a final OD in some cases, but there was growth in many of the wells. It was also suggested that we"

Interlab Study
As our team is competing in the Measurement track for this year's competition, we were also required to participate in the iGEM 2014 Measurement Interlab Study . This study aims to collect data from iGEM teams all over the world on the fluorescence of three genetic devices expressing GFP. The devices differ in their plasmid copy properties and the strength of the promoter.
We introduced the three constructs into E. coli cells and measured fluorescence as well as optical density of the liquid cultures over a period of 18 hours, using a spectrophotometer and a plate reader, respectively. The obtained results confirmed our hypothesis that the fluorescence of the BioBrick in the high copy plasmid pSB1C3, J23101.E0240, would exhibit a stronger signal than the constructs I20260, which is the low to mid copy plasmid pSB3K3, and J23115.E0240, which has a weaker promoter than J23101.E0240. During the experiment, we could observe a typical growth curve for E.coli including lag, exponential, stationary and death phase. We could show that the fluorescence we measured is rather a function of each cell than the whole culture, since all cultures had comparable optical densities.

Experimental Design
For the Interlab Study, we tested GFP-containing BioBricks for fluorescence and optical density. Subject of the study were the BioBricks I20260, J23101.E0240 and J23115.E0240. The latter consists of a pSB3K3 backbone with an insert, a combination of the promoter J23101 , the RBS B0032 , the GFP coding sequence E004"

So we can get following differential equations to describe the process
Finally, we simulated those fuctions and get the steady concentration distribution:
Figure 3.2 | The concentration distribution describes the steady relative concentration of the integrase varies with the relative position to the plasmid which we consider as the point source of repressor production in E.coli. The arrow marks out the average distance between the promoter and the point source as well as the corresponding concentration. We assume both the average radius of the cell and the concentration of the point source as the unit 1.
The average distance mentioned above can be estimated from the copy number of the plasmids.Though further discussions about the the interactions between those plamids can not be made yet, our hypothesis about the diffusion of the repressor causes the leakage has already been proved by this model. Futher improvements to eliminate the impact caused by diffusion may help to solve our leakage problem. .

No colonies observed on plates from Sunday. Attempted to use ligation product from Sunday to transform another batch of cells, because of sudden fear that our electrocompetent cells may not be good. Not enough ligated product remains to attempt this.
Tuesday, July 1, 2014
Ashlee and Emily prepared tubes of primers and four purified digestion products to send for sequencing.  They continued their work on the website and tried to find more html help for certain aspects.
Goal of the day is to transform some more cells, and use different ratio of insert to backbone during ligation in hopes of getting colonies to grow. Attempted to re-ligate digested GFPs and pFTV but not enough remains from Sunday to attempt this. Calculations ran for re-doing digestions and ligation. Digestions completed. RBS calculations from 6/26 analyzed, found that even using no initial condition (only N's followed by Pst1), sufficiently high TIR can be discovered. Need to use calculator algorithm on either Dr. Salis or Iman's computer so that a dRBS can be constructed using an initial condition that is followed by a non-mutable Pst1 site. Digested gblocks and pFTV ligated and cells transformed, then plated on antibiotic selective plates.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Design and Background_-_-_TEXT.html," in literature, to release saccharide chains from glycans expressed in gastric mucus (Ashida, 2002). Therefore, we assumed it would behave similarly with the lungs’ mucus.
EBG releases the saccharides by hydrolysing the bonds next to galactose in the polysaccharide chains of mucins (figure 3). This enzyme interacts only with saccharides that do not contain sialic acids. Mucins contain such glycans, but a combination of both enzymes is believed to result in mucin degradation.
Figure 2. Endo-β-galactosidase reaction mechanism.
To summarize, applying one of the enzymes or a combination of both, is believed to degrade different sugar groups on the mucins, consequently decreasing the mucins’ ability to bind water, and thus making the mucus less viscous.
How will we measure the degradation?
Firstly, to measure the rate of degradation, a method called high-performance anion-exchange chromatography was used. Using this method, we were able to quantify the amount of saccharides degraded from mucin samples.
Secondly, to confirm that the degradation of sugar groups really adjusts the visco-elastic properties of the mucus, we used the method rheology: the study of the flow of matter. By applying sialidase or EBG, or both, onto a mucus sample, we hope to prove that our enzymes are capable of making the mucus less viscous. Several studies have shown that small differences in the mucin concentration can affect the mucus viscoelasticity tremendously (e.g. 2-4 fold increase in mucin concentration can result in 100-fold higher viscosity) (Lai et al., 2009). In cystic fibrosis for instance, a disease with an abnormally high mucin concentration, the viscosity at low shear rates (close to standstill) can be compared to that of rubber  (Lai et al., 2009) (Mestecky et al., 2015).
How will we secrete our enzymes?
To achieve the goal of degrading mucus in the lung, the engineered bacteria, in this case E. coli, should be able to secrete the enzymes out of the cell. E. coli is not natively equipped with the proper machinery to secrete large enzymes. Therefore, the possibility of making E. 0coli secrete the desired enzymes was studied.
We chose to work with a type I secretion system, which is also known as the ABC transporter (figure 4). The system works"

Wednesday:
Today, I worked on fixing some bugs with the popup, and restructured how we scraped the web pages for the registry info. Earlier, we were getting the source code and looking for certain HTML tags to get the information that we needed, but now, we're using the Registry API, which is really great because the information is organized in a way that makes the scraping process much more efficient and less error-prone.
Thursday:
More work on the popup! Fixing inconsistencies, styling, and making it respond to touch. We also presented Eugenie so far to Natalie Kuldell, who we collaborated with earlier this summer to learn more about synthetic biology as well as a high school iGEM teacher. It seemed like they really liked the product so far, so we're excited to see how it will be received at iGEM!
Demonstrating the visual language of Eugenie
Friday:
Today, we presented our work so far to the CS/Math/Physics community at Wellesley. We practiced our presentation in the morning and then presented later that afternoon. We're pushing for a fully functional program that can make an inverter by Monday, so it's going to be a busy weekend!
Week 9: July 29 - August 2
Monday:
We made more progress this weekend than we did for the past couple weeks combined! Eugenie has gone leaps and bounds from where it was on Friday. Over the weekend, I added an undo functionality so that the user doesn't have to restart the program if a mistake is made in the device building process. I also added a root so that users can name their design. Additionally, users can now name their custom parts which can also be added to a collection of parts that the user can access without having to search/edit each part individually each time.
Tuesday:
Today, I worked on adding a small molecule functionality, so that when users want to specify that a part is induced by a small molecule, they can do so. Additionally, they can specify what the small molecule is produced by. Now that we have a functioning framework, it's becoming easier and easier to add functionality!
Wednesday:
Today, I improved the search function, or rather, actually made it a search function. Prior to today, users could only search by part type (e.g. ""promoter"", ""terminator"", etc). Users can now search by part name or properties such as inducible, repressible, etc, so it's definitely an improvement"

Protein pre-expression FsCUse pET-28a as expression vector and pre-express FsC, FsC-sJanus, FsC- sJanus-m in BL21. Analyze the result of SDS-PAGE to infer whether protein FsC, FsC-sJanus, FsC-sJanus-m express after induced by IPTG.
Figure 3. The results of SDS-PAGE. M is Protein marker. a is sample of FsC which is non-induced. b is sample of FsC which is induced.
We can tell the difference (in red circle) between non-induced and induced. The amount of protein after induced is larger than non-induced and molecular weight is about 25kDa which is target protein’s molecular weight. So we infer that FsC can express in E.coli BL21.

Human beings have as their main tool in the evolution the need to understand the world  through science. However, our behavior suggests that we are always dealing with the rising of new myths and points of view, often opposing to the new, particularly around innovative technologies. Thus, the highlighting on synthetic biology is present this simple and efficient alternative to the problems of society, raising questions and doubts about the safety of this technique.
One of the problems that synthetic biology has been trying to solve is the use of Mercury. The risks of mercury and high toxicity, both to the environment and to humans, are well known in society. We use many products that have this element as an essential component, so its containment into the environment is a challenge for humanity. Our project aims to minimize the effects of this metal in the ecosystem. However, new questions arise, such as: Which bacteria will be used?  How the genes used would impact the environment? How to handle mercury in laboratory guaranteeing no health risk to the academic community and the  society surrrounding us?
With all these variables in mind, we began to study possible bacteria to be manipulated. Escherichia coli was chosen for being a bacterium widely studied and described in the literature and also provide minimum health human risk, since they are not pathogenic. The regulated promoter mercury is the primary dispersion control genes comprising the Mer operon, since the bacteria have high chances of losing the plasmid when its mercury-free medium and antibiotics, this demands for maintaining plasmids excessive expenditure of energy, which there is no advantage to the cell that is in a medium without the odds quoted.
Our constructions were made aiming at the good functioning of the biosystem, the integrity of the environment and the safety of all directly or indirectly connected with the project. A laboratory for the safe handling of mercury was mounted, and a whole study on how to dispose of it safely was developed and implemented ( Safety ).
There will always be doubts about the safety of any new technology, and genetic engineering and biotechnology are certainly no exception. One reason for this concern is the fact that it"

Dr Smith encouraged us to look more broadly at diversity in science as well, emphasising that the problem doesn’t just stem from gender inequality, but also from a lack of diversity in terms of ethnicity, religion, disability and background.
Using the University of Exeter as a case study for other universities across the UK, we focused on three distinct areas:
Firstly, the initial reaction of students and academics to the concept of gender inequality and diversity within science. With this we hoped to gauge whether sexism in science is a widely recognised issue across the UK in higher education and if enough is being done to publicise the problem. We also wanted to understand how the definition of diversity changes across the world.
Secondly, the work that is being done by academics at the University of Exeter to both publicise and change the problem of inequality within science. We wanted to use the statistics provided by the Universities' Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity group and the Athena Swan group to quantify the accounts we have heard. Furthermore we wanted to begin the discussion of what more can be done.
Thirdly, the role that students can have in promoting equality and diversity within various fields. We wanted to speak to student leaders about how they view the situation and what they think can be done to promote not just gender diversity, but also diversity in terms of religion, ethnicity, disability and socio-economic background.
Through this work, we can open up the issue to a wider audiences, beyond just academics responsible for issues of equality and diversity within the department, to promote the fact that this is an issue that should be addressed by all.  Ultimately we want to leave a legacy that shows that we have made a significant impact not only locally but also nationally.
Does sexism in science exist?
Highlighting the issues:
We asked members of different iGEM teams their opinions and experiences of gender inequality in science to try to gauge, on a small scale, whether it is a widely recognised problem.
Although this is a difficult issue, it is one that needs to be resolved. We thought that by asking students without prior warning, and therefore not allowing them time to use information from the internet to formulate a more politically correct answer, we could get a real understanding of their view towards the issue. We also wanted to capture their genuine reactions to the question of whether inequality in terms of gender in science exists to help us identify whether students are shocked by the idea of sexist biases in their field, or if they have experienced it directly themselves. Obviously this is only on a small scale, but by asking students from across the UK for their experiences we may be"

Experiment
KULeuven have had already published the memory system in 2008 and built its model (see here) , but the construction of the whole device was left undone. So the core work in our group is to construct the memory system and experiment with the relating data. First we add the DNA sequence of GFP with LVA-tag into device D. If the green fluorescence was detected, we know that the device works. On the other hand, if the conjugated function works, the transcription of GFP-LVA sequence will soon shut down and the signal of the green fluorescence will reduce, by which can we ensure the effectiveness of the system.

Primer Design
PCR: amplifies double stranded DNA.  Usually given positive strand (5’-3’) by databases. PCR consists of heating, cooling. Heating causes the strands to separate, allowing primers to bind. Primers are specific to a specific sequence (oligo’s of DNA).  Primers bind during annealing step, then extend around 72 C. during extension, polymerase extends 5’-3’.
Basic Design: 1. Primer aka oligo. Single stranded piece of DNA, order it from a company. Want the primer to be about 20 bp long (length of complementarity). The shorter, the cheaper.
2. 3’ GC clamp. GC has 3 H bonds holding it together, AT has 2 H bonds (so AT is a weaker binding than GC). Want the tightest interaction of the primer binding the DNA to be at the 3’ end because this is where elongation is going to proceed from.
5’-ACTG-3’
3’-TGAC-5’
3. Melting temp (Tm) greater than or equal to 60 degrees C. The higher the better.
CG 4 degrees C
AT 2 degrees C
so if a 20-mer, 20*4 means melting temp around 80 degrees for an entirely GC 20-mer.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#unnatural base pair#uptake and biosynthesis_-_-_TEXT.html," complex and is based on the de novo synthesis of the unnatural (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates. Therefore, existing pathways from natural sources or newly designed pathways have to be introduced to the cell. The nucleoside triphosphates are then incorporated into the DNA.
The Nucleotide Transporter from Phaeodactylum tricornutum PtNTT2
Given the structural similarity to the natural bases, iso-dCm and iso-dG might be taken up through the existing nucleoside transporters in sufficient amounts. But phosphorylation of the nucleosides remains a challenge. Therefore, the introduction of a heterologous nucleoside triphosphate transporter into the desired strain represents a promising alternative for the direct uptake of iso-dCmTP and iso-dGTP from the media.
The algae Phaeodactylum tricornutum, a diatom of the genus Phaedactylum, features six putative nucleotide transporters (NTTs). Two isoforms of these NTTs have been characterized by Ast and coworkers and it was shown that both isoforms facilitate transport across the plastid membrane. While isoform 1 (NTT1) acts as a proton-dependent adenine nucleotide importer, NTT2 facilitates the counter exchange of (deoxy-)nucleoside triphosphates (Ast et al., 2009).
Figure 2: Uptake of α32-labeled nucleotides by the two isoforms PtNTT1 and PtNTT2 when expressed in E. coli (Ast et al., 2009)
The uptake of α32-labeled nucleotides was measured in E. coli. Isoform 1 (A) was shown to transport adenosine mono-, di- and triphosphates, while isoform 2 (B) shows a specificity for nucleoside triphosphates.
Ast and colleagues demonstrated the subcellular localization by tagging the transporters with GFP. Figure 3 shows the subcellular localization of the two isoforms PtNTT1 and PtNTT2. The fluorescence signal can only be detected within the cell around the plastid and not within the cell membranes. The isoform 2 of the nucleotide transporter was shown to be an unspecific (deoxy-)nucleoside transporter, facilitating the uptake of CTP, GTP, dCTP, ATP, UTP, dGTP, dATP and TTP when expressed in E. coli, as shown in Figure 2 (Ast et al., 2009).

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," of each node represents its path to the root node, we can restore the tree structure from the Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes of leaf nodes could uniquely determine a tree structure. With help of Huffman codes, it is simple to compare the forest structure after and before exchange of both chains.
To go further, we must define the preference of each forest structure due to exchange of chains: compare each node of the first tree by their Huffman codes and weights in the same way as comparison of strings and if equal, compare the next until difference appears or to the end of either forest. If one is less than another, it has higher priority. With this definition, the order of those equal chains in the first-stage sorting is determined by the one which generates the forest strucuture with highest priority among all possibilities. By performing this algorithm for all groups of equal chains obtained from the first-stage sorting, we could find both the unique order of the chains and the groups of equivalent chains (exchange of the order fo several chains in the same equivalent group will not change the forest structure). The figure illustrates this idea graphically.
It is easy to compare two structures with help of chain sorting. We only need to compare first the chain list in order, chain by chain, and if equal, compare both associated forest structures. If two structures are same, the comparison must be equal since chains and trees are all in their unique order. If the comparison is equal, they must be the same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the chains as well as its associated forest structure.
Structural pattern match of template species
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.
Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template"

Additionally unique part names will be helpful to identify     the devices with more than one Biobrick in their constructs. Assignment     of unique and distinct names for parts describing their nature and content     will be helpful to researchers for the recognition of and search for     the parts.
Headings Selected From Previous Entry Forms for Indication of Standardized     Information

=========================================
Table 1: The table above basically describes and designates     qualities of parts which identifies their compositions and demonstrates     the status of previously assigned standards. PartID refers to the unique     ID number for parts including atomic parts and assemblies. PartName     refers to the given unique names to parts. Bricks, refers to the shortcut     names which specifies atomic parts. ImageIDs, refers to individual or     combination of numbers that are assigned by us. RFCs refers to the states     of parts based on RFC standards.
iGEM both provides individual, atomic parts and pre-combined constructs     such as devices and systems. Availability of combined constructs is     important to the researchers as combining individual bio-bricks one     at a time will be very time consuming. These previously merged constructs,     serve as the repository for puzzle and they can be used for different     purposes. Up to date the largest and most trustworthy source, for synthetic     biology and its components, is iGEM’s parts registry. In 2010, iGEM     provided over 1000 parts that have initiated many projects. Having more     atomic parts available in the iGEM’s repository, will lead to the design     of more complex and robust constructs, and we would have a better chance     to design different constructs for unique purposes. Also, for the parts     that are already available, extra steps needs to be taken for the quality     control and surveillance of these products. The quality control of the     information for the parts is essential for the future of iGEM and synthetic     biology. Even though we have found pre-determined RFC standards useful     and included those to our standardized template, some individual parts     still requires re-organization of the information as RFC standards alone     for the functionality of parts, does not satisfy the needs for wet lab     biologists.
Without a question there is an urgent need to build a distinct and     specific database well organized with its own standards for synthetic     biology; however, development of such a database is not an easy task.

PcelA ( BBa_ K1379002 ) and PcomFA ( BBa_ K1379003 ) construct
Backbone pSB1C3 was used for PcelA and PcomFA construct. PcelA / PcomFA gene was fused with BBa_E0240 , which contains a medium RBS ( BBa_B0034 ), GFP ( BBa_E0040 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ). The purpose of this GFP generator is to indicate the functionality of PcelA and PcomFA in the presence and absence of σx. BBa_E0240 was obtained from 2014 iGEM distribution kit. The bacterial strain of E. coli used is DH10B.
PCelA / PcomFA gene
Identifying the Possible Promoter Regions
To date (12 Oct 2014), the core/minimal promoter region of PcelA has not yet been experimentally defined. In locating the promoter region required to initiate transcription, iGEM 2014 Hong_Kong_HKUST team attempted in making educated guesses based on relevant information available from the literature. The Com-Box promoter consensus sequence “TACGAATA” was BLASTed for targets in the Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes of strains R6, D39, ATCC7699 and NCTC7465 in the NCBI database. Genome of strain NCTC7465 was particularly given attention because its gDNA was available for manipulation. A list of loci with annotated genes returned. σx was known to turn on late competence gene and therefore loci containing any of those genes documented were favored and filtered for. Those loci were then manually checked for consensus among the 4 genomes mentioned above. A sequence of 67 base pairs stood out as a promising target because it was 1) upstream of a late competence genes celA (encodes competence protein CelA), and 2) was identical across the 4 genomes. This 67 bp region has varying upstream sequences and the potential promoter region can reach as far as 200bp. Different truncations (67, 100, 150, 180, 249, "

What are your perspectives on the ethical implications of establishing a Mars colony?
The hardest part of human space colonization is humans. Honestly, it goes back to the idea that we, as a society, are risk-averse right now. The reality is that if you are sending people to Mars, you are setting them up in a situation that is risky, and for many reasons, it’s not just due to resource or psychological constraints; they have to get there; they’re got to cross interplanetary space, which hasn’t been done before; they’ve got to live with a significant light delay between planets, so that with any emergency that comes up, it means a minimum 20-40 minute contact with Earth. I did the HI-SEAS Mars stimulation, and we were well-versed in the fact that any time we had a problem, it would take a good 20-40 minutes in order to get information back to us. How do you deal with that? Or, if you’ve got a medical emergency, how do you deal with that immediately? And, the truth of the matter is that we’re talking about it today as if we’re leaving today, but we don't leave until 10-20 years, and by that time, we’ve got improvements in computer technology, hardware medicine, robotic medicine… So from an ethical perspective, you then have to talk about things like genetic engineering… anytime you talk about life, there’s going to be some ethical concern.
What you guys are doing is really interesting. You recognize that genetics and organisms behave like machines and they can be programmed with a genetic modification. I think that’s the perception that needs to grow. The fear is always going to be that we’re taking resources away from existing life, and the thing is that it’s not the goal. The goal is to create a machine that is a component in a recovery system.

The Das Conference
March 30th 2018
We went to the DAS conference, this conference is a meeting for everyone working inside an institution that     provides education for laboratory studies. Our goal on this event was to provide information about iGEM through the     Netherlands and make contacts with specialist. These specialist gave mini presentations in which we learned about     sensors, chips and chemical processes.     We also presented our top 3 ideas by handing out brochures, on which we received feedback and input for improvement of     our additions. We were very happy to make contacts and carry out the iGEM competition through the Netherlands.
Nationale carière beurs (National Career fair)
April 6th 2018
Today we went to the National Career Event in Amsterdam. This is a big Dutch event where more than 120 employers     gather to expose their company to a bigger audience and share contact information with potential recruits and     interns. We had hoped to familiarize some relevant companies to iGEM along with trying to attain some sponsors.     Sadly the event was primarily focused on IT companies with a very small representation of chemical companies and nothing     biology related. Despite this it was a valuable team bonding experience.
The dutch NBC conference
May 22th 2018
Also were we present at the dutch NBC conference, where we got the chance to show and tell about our project.     During this day several professionals and students working in the biotechnology workfield were connected. They were     informed during interactive sessions and got to know all about the latest developments in their workfield.
BCF career event
May 24th 2018
After we went to the National Career Event in Amsterdam, we thought that it might be helpful if we'd go to more     events. Today we went to the BCF (biology, chemistry and pharmacy) in Utrecht to promote our project. The BCF     career event is an event just like the one in Amsterdam but only for biology, chemistry and pharmacy. It was a nice     day where we shared a lot of our business cards with the present companies.

UCC_Ireland,2014,Team:UCC Ireland#Projects SeeDNA.html_-_-_TEXT.html," reporter gene expression if it has encountered a specific short linear target DNA sequence.
We designed several detector plasmid prototypes.  All the detectors comprise a standard Biobrick cloned into the standard pSB1-C3 plasmid that following an activation step should have the properties outlined above.  Several prototypes were developed and tested.   From these prototypes a successful system for the design and preparation of plasmid-based DNA detectors was eventually devised.
We feel that potentially this method may have commercial applications.  To keep open the option of a patent application we are therefore not disclosing the details of the detector design and preparation.  Once a patent has been secured, or if it is decided that a patent application is not merited, we would plan to make the SeeDNA parts (Biobricks) available through the iGEM Registry for non-commercial entities.
The SeeDNA detector plasmid prototype is a standard Biobrick cloned into the standard pSB1-C3 plasmid.  Following transformation into E. coli,  the detector plasmid will only support the formation of colonies if it has encountered a specific short linear target DNA sequence (see Figure below, part A and B).  Since bacterial growth is an exponential process, the signal amplification that can be achieved is similar to PCR.  The sensitivity of the system is thus primarily limited by the efficiency of target detection and the transformation efficiency.
Although bacterial growth as a readout provides exponential signal amplification it has a number of disadvantages in that it is rather slow and requires plating of cells on antibiotic agar plates.  Expression of a reporter gene at high levels from a high copy number plasmid should also provide significant signal amplification.  We therefore modified our DNA detector by adding a Registry Part that encodes a green fluorescent protein reporter under the control of a constitutive promoter (BBa_K584001).  This should in theory permit quicker DNA detection by visualizing GFP fluorescence under a microscope or by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).

1. Salicylate pathway
(Group: iGEM2006_MIT)
 
Assessment:
 
The characterization method of gas chromatography is difficult to perform. First, what can be analyzed is methyl salicylate production, that is to say, another enzyme should be co-transformed to E.coli too, which will increase cell’s burden and reduce the ratio of successful co-transformation. Second, it is not convenient for us to borrow the relative machine.

Das Event begann, indem Bianca das Publikum herzlich begrüßte und Anna eine kurze Einleitung zum iGEM Wettbewerb, das Prinzip der BioBricks und eine Einführung in unser Projekt gab. Diese Themen wurden in einer Art und Weise erklärt, dass jeder folgen konnte.  Der erste Vortrag wurde von Prof. Dr. Michael Bölker gehalten. Er sprach über Synthetische Biologie und stellte Gründer wie Craig Venter und einige Anwendungen der Synthetischen Biologie vor ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbEbEu-e3Vc ). Als zweiter Sprecher des Abends hielt Sascha Karberg einen kriischen Vortrag über Synthetische Biologie. Er hob die möglichen Risiken hervor und zeigte auch einige Ausschnitte von Artikeln, mit denen er zum Thema Synthetische Biologie konfrontiert wurde ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqjqZPP9_GU ). Die letzte Präsentation wurde von Dr. Anna Deplazes-Zemp gehalten. Sie gab die ethischen und moralischen Fragen, die sich Wissenschaftler stellen müssen, die mit kontrovers diskutierten Organismen und Methoden arbeiten, wieder ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDBpW0fy13w ).

1. In the TOP 10 plate ,there no bacteria grow up, but in the DH5αplate ,there were some single colonies. Transfer it into liquid culture medium and induce the promoter with 10%Ara.
We use DH5αcell to make competent cell.
After a day we find some single colonies in the TOP 10 plate. So we use TOP 10    cell to make competent cell. To make sure the PKD46 plasmid transfer into the TOP 10 cell, we extract plasmid and use electrophoresis technology to verify, the result was correct. It means PKD46 plasmid was in the TOP 10 cell.
2. Until now, we have one contrast.DH5αcell and TOP 10 cell. In order to analysis how many homologous arms were more appropriate, we design two homologous arms, one was 555bp and another was 49bp. We have two kinds of aim snippets. Now, we have two contrasts.
DH5αcell
A.555bp homologous arms in the both sides of aim snippet.
B.49bp homologous arms in the both sides of aim snippet
TOP 10 cell
C.555bp homologous arms in the both sides of aim snippet
D.49bp homologous arms in the both sides of aim snippet                                             Here’s schematic diagram

Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#app scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," plaque formation. From areas of plaque clearing or preventative bacterial growth, the desired phage are isolated.  The endolysin and holin genes of the phage can be identified via sequencing. The preferred method of knocking out one or both of these genes is homologous recombination. Any standard plasmid (with the appropriate origin of replication) can be used as a vector. The 5’ and 3’ ends of the endolysin gene, interrupted by a reporter gene, will be inserted into this vector. This vector is transformed into infected bacteria. Those which are unable to form plaques underwent homologous recombination to remove the endolysin gene.
More extensive genetic modifications complicate the process, especially if the genes introduced to the phage are lethal to the bacteria which are intended to produce the phage particles. This can be avoided by changing codon assignments in the host bacterial strain such that CRISPR-Cas9 or RNA silencing approaches which are lethal to a wild-type bacterium but have no effect on the genetically modified host. For phages which are modified to synthesize lethal proteins, inserting an RNA silencing system into the host will ensure that the phage can replicate within the cell without killing it. Inserting these lethal genes can be done through homologous recombination the same way that endolysin genes are knocked out. Conversely, for phages which have circular genomes, it may be possible to insert a gene via conventional DNA assembly and electroporate it into a host. Additionally, yeast can be a suitable organism for cloning during the construction of phage genomes since they will not express phage genes would might otherwise harm bacterial hosts.
Recovering the lysis-deficient phage can be accomplished by lysing bacteria with small glass beads, pelleting the debris, and filtering the supernatant to obtain purified phage. Similarly, the host bacteria can be transformed with a plasmid harboring an endolysin gene under an inducible promoter to achieve the same effect.

Capturing Phage in Silk Film
Once the phage particles have been recovered from the host, a solution of them can be mixed with a silk fibroin aqueous solution. This mixture is then freeze-dried. This lyophilization process results in a thin silk film which stably incorporates phage and will prevent their degradation even at high temperatures. A sufficiently large film of this nature can be utilized as a bandage. To achieve better delivery of these phage particles, the incorporation of phage into a silk hydrogel could also be"

From the perspective of the policy-advisory Technology Assessment, it is currently a very interesting question if iGEM research activities and public relations may cause, by the commitment of the participating students, an increased interest for biological work and DIY biology, particularly in the non-scientific community. The iGEM-teams inspirit science and they are predestined to motivate people for an active participation in life science.”(citation of Dr. Arnold Sauter)
Impacts on our project
Dr. Arnold Sauter helped us to estimate our project referring the Biosafety aspect. He confirmed our batch system as a system which has sufficient safeguard against environmental and health risks. For eventual future application, for example in waste water treatment plants, we had to engineer a continuous MFC with advanced plant manufacturing. In addition he feels confident that our human practice motivates people for an active participation in life science. This could be possibly increases interest for biological work and DIY biology, particularly in the non-scientific community.
Dipl. Environmental Scientist Aeneas Wanner
Introduction
The feedback we received following our successful appearance at the European Jamboree made it clear to us that we had to gain more expert opinions regarding the future applicability of our MFC. Searching for companies with a deep knowledge in the field of usage and distribution of renewable energies, we found out about Energie Zukunft Schweiz (Energy future Switzerland). The Swiss company is partner of several organizations and energy providers that want to facilitate the production of renewable energies and try to raise their energy efficiency. The EZS also acts as an agent between these institutions and communities that are interested in the usage of renewable energies. All of this is performed under consideration of economic aspects.
Aeneas Wanner is the general manager of Energie Zukunft Schweiz since 2006. Beforehand he was the driving force behind the climate protection organization myclimate . Besides his appointment at EZS, he also works as an academic at the ETH Zurich and the technical college St. Gallen and is a member of the parliament of Basel for the green-liberal party .
Expert classification of our questions
Can you imagine a “BioBattery” in which bacteria produce energy? How do you assess its acceptance within the general public?
Of course I can imagine such a “BioBattery” and as long as there are no direct impacts like malodor, I foresee little resistance.
Was the idea of producing energy with bacteria ever discussed within your company?
No, we tend to research and evaluate techniques, which are standing just before a broad market acceptance.

2.WriteSBMLFile
Convert from db0.dat to SBML file
The class WriteSBMLFile is used to output a SBML file base on the species and parameters selected from the database. the amount of the exporting file is based on the users requirement.In this part, the class WriteSBMLFile extract data from the two following file: “subs.dat”; ”dbt.dat”.
Although we have listed all the types of bio-chemical reactions, it is also needed to make the mathematical expression fit each certain reaction. Since the SBML uses ASTNode(binary tree) to store the formulas, we choose to traverse binary tree and replace the name of each node the certain species and parameters. Thus, the kineticlaw is been made uniquely for each bio-chemical system.
Here are the steps of converting “subs.dat” and ”dbt.dat” to SBML file:
1. Create new SBMLDocument and model
2. Scrape the species names from ""subs.dat"", and create new species in model
3. Get reactions related information from""dbt.dat"". As the graph, put them into the model by categories
4. Rename the node to species name corresponding
5. Validate the model
6. Output SBML file
3.Verifying and other functions
One of the most important features of libSBML is its ability to perform SBML validation to ensure that a model adheres to the SBML specification for whatever Level+Version combination the model uses. Since it is difficult to ensure that everything in a model is constructed properly. The ability to perform automatic checks then becomes very useful.
LibSBML implements verification of SBML in two steps, represented by the two methods SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() and SBMLDocument::checkConsistency(). The former verifies the basic internal consistency and syntax of an SBML document, and the latter implements more elaborate validation rules (both those defined by the SBML specifications, as well as additional rules offered by libSBML). When an application builds up a model programmatically and is finally ready to say ""yes, this model is finished"", it should call both of these methods to help ensure the correctness and consistency of the finished result. Conversely, if it is reading a model from a file or data stream, the function will automatically verify the syntax and schema consistency of the document. The application only needs to check the results by interrogating the error log on the SBMLDocument object, then call SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() for checking the model against the SBML validation rules.
As mentioned above, SBML uses ASTNode"

In order to ascertain the flexibility of the hybrid promoter and help prove our original aim of producing a promoter that could be used in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes correct, the DNA for M-B + eCFP was transfected into the MCF7 human breast cancer cell line. An experiment was set up using S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP), a nitric oxide donor, in order to induce expression of the fluorescent protein.

Cellock Holmes - A Case of Identity
Welcome to the iGEM Aachen 2014 Wiki!
Until now, an ideal method to detect pathogenic bacteria is still elusive. The existing techniques require expensive equipment, trained personnel or labourious routines.
We, the iGEM team Aachen, have developed a '''novel biosensor system''' called ''Cellock Holmes'' that '''detects bacteria on solid surfaces''' using a low-cost, rapid and portable technique.
In this project, we demonstrate a unique way of combining '''Open Source biology, software and hardware'''.

2. Yeast strains are more rarely used in iGEM projects but contain certain parameters that are ideal for certain projects. Many teams are beginning to use yeast this year and are submitting useful biobricks, so we decided to make a collection of biobricks parts aimed at protein localization within the cell (known as 'yeast functional tags'):
Aga2: The Aga2 protein is screted from the yeast cell and attaches itself through disulfide bonds to the Aga1 protein on the cellular surface. If the Aga2 protein fused to a part of interest, the fusion is secreted, Aga2 complexes with Aga1 on the cellular surface, and the part of interest is displayed on the surface of the cell. While we did not end up using this part in our official construct, biobricking it from a plasmid we already had in our lab will surely benefit future teams.
Aga2+Linker: Most everyone will want a linker attached to the Aga2 protein, so we went ahead and submitted this construct as well. COLLABORATION: We also sent this part along with the secretion tag to iGEM Osaka to aid them in the wetwork for their own project.
Secretion Tag: Another 'yeast functional tag', the secretion tag does just what you think when fused to the C terminus of a protein of interest - directs secretion of the fused protein. Cleverly, this tag is cleaved from the fusion along the secretion pathway, resulting secretion of the protein of interest without the tag attached.
Ura3: This is one of the proteins in the pathway for Uracil biosynthesis. It is incredibly useful as a selectable marker in yeast genetics because it can be selected for and against. We use it in our system as the nutritional marker in our yeast two-hybrid screen.
3. To construct and submit certain ubiquitously useful biobricks that we would be using.
Flexible (Gly4Ser)3 peptide linker: for use with most any peptide fusions
4. To provide reporter constructs as positive controls of commonly used devices
pGal-Aga2-eCFP: This reporter secretes Aga2:eCFP when the yeast is grown in galactose media. It is used as a positive control for the function of the surface display system. This construct was used by our team to test whether the Aga2 protein could direct secretion of a fusion and if the the Aga1 protein was present on the extracellular surface of our strain.

Flat Stanley is a book written by Jeff Brown, where you connect with other people (teams) by sending out a paper ""Flat Stanley"" (microbe) across the world by mail (email). The team created our own version of ""Flat Stanley"", whom we named ""Mike the Microbe."" We sent Mike the Microbe to teams all across the globe in hopes that they would take a picture with Mike in their workspace or team meeting. We were overjoyed to receive many pictures with other teams on social media from across the world. Our goal to share information about our project was achieved, with the other teams really enjoying the opportunity to interact with us over social media about ETEC! We hope to meet these teams at the Jamboree to extend our thanks. Teams who participated: Grongingen, Hamburg,  KU Leuven, XMU-China, and KU Leuven!

BioSynthAge : Do not go gentle into that good night
We envision a time in which the human population lives a healthier life, for longer. We will use                         synthetic biology to ensure the ageing world population can both maintain their quality of life                         and extend their lifespan - increasing their ‘healthspan’. The health challenges currently posed                         by ageing are many and complex so we propose a suite of synthetic biology solutions to tackle these                         challenges. We have modelled , designed novel BioBrick devices , characterised our BioBricks , collaborated and thought about the real world application through our human practices! Have a look at our achievements or watch our project video below to find out how we are approaching this!

As an additional safety measure, BeeT relies on the presence of a synthetic amino acid that is to be applied to the beehive. In the presence of the synthetic amino acid, catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) is produced that has the synthetic amino acid incorporated, at the expense of catalytically active Cas9. If BeeT escapes from the hive, it can no longer access the synthetic amino acid, and dCas9 can no longer be formed. Instead, catalytically active Cas9 is produced which cuts the BeeT genome as well as any heterologous DNA that is present, thereby killing the bacterium and preventing horizontal gene transfer.
Optogenetic Kill Switch
Hijacking Cellular Control Mechanisms
The optogenetic kill switch is the unification of two different genetic systems: an artificially-created promoter system activated by light (pDawn) and a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system native to Escherichia coli (MazEF).
The optogenetic system pDawn 1 is an altered version of a heme-sensing system native to Bradyrhizobium japonicum 2 . pDawn’s sensor component, the histidine kinase YF1, replaces the original oxygen-sensing domain with one that reacts to blue light (470 nm). In the absence of light, YF1 phosphorylates (and therefore activates) the response regulator protein FixJ, which in turn drives the promoter FixK2. This forms the system pDusk (Figure 1, top). When exposed to blue light, YF1 is inactivated, resulting in reduced expression of the ""target"" gene under FixK2. Addition of repressor protein λ cI to the system as an invertor creates pDawn (Figure 1, bottom), which is inactive in the dark and strongly increases expression when exposed to light.
As the name implies, the TA system MazEF 3 consists of two components: a toxin (MazF) and its complimentary antitoxin (MazE). The MazF protein functions as an endoribonuclease, cleaving mRNA and thereby inhibiting transcription, which is ultimately lethal for the cell. MazE forms a complex with MazF, preventing it from functioning. However, MazE is a more labile protein than MazF, degrading faster. For this reason, TA systems like MazEF are also known as addiction modules"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

A digestion over night is possible. If you digest over night use only 0.1 µL restriction enzyme.
It is also possible to use PCR product as insert. Digest after PCR with corresponding restriction enzymes and clean up with PCR clean-up kit . This could lead to higher yields of insert DNA because a lot of DNA gets lost during the gel electrophoresis clean up.
Sometimes some BioBricks are hard to assemble. Then you have to clean up the vector by gel electrophoresis as well.

Measure RNAT under heat stress
Fluorescence of mCherry is a common indicator to indicate the switch efficiency of RNAT. However, most RNATs(ROSE for example) are derived from heat shock systems. Heat stress will cause protein unfolding, entanglement, and unspecific aggregation[24], which can interfere with protein expression. Thus, the fluorescence difference is the combined effect of RNAT and heat stress. Let’s use a formula to show these 2 factors and the indicator:
F stands for Fluorescence of mCherry
f1 stands for switch efficiency of RNAT
f2 stands for heat stress
We explored a new method to measure the switch efficiency: using 2 kinds of fluorescent proteins, a GFP to indicate the heat stress, while a RFP to indicate the combined effect.

Thermosensitive T7 RNA Polymerase
What is it?
Inspired by Liang’s work[6],we constructed the Thermosensitive T7 RNA Polymerase (TS T7 RNAP) by inserting a Thermosensitive intein(TS intein) into selected locus of T7 RNAP.
TS Intein is a polypeptide that can catalyze its own excision from the flanking polypeptides, or exteins, as well as ligation of the exteins at specific temperature[2](This process is also named “protein splicing”). In consequence, the interrupted T7 RNAP could only regain activity and transcribe gene under the control of T7 promoter at the permissive temperature(Fig.12.).

The restreaked plates containing our constructs of pAT02, pAT06 and pAT07 were used for innoculation of overnight cultures; these will be mini-preped tomorrow.
PCR clean ups were made on the pSB2K3 PCR products as well as the digestions of the above mentioned products after digestion was performed.

Today the PCR of G1, G2, GR1, GR2, BADZ1 and BADZ2 was redone and it looks good:)
Restrictions with E+S was made on G1, G2, GR1, GR2, BADZ1 and BADZ2 (old PCR products).
6 mL of the transformation overnight culture (still from last week) was spun down. This will hopefully result in a mini-prep with a higher concentration than the ones Maya did... Miniprep was made and they are stored in the working box: no label. Only number (corresponding to the original colony) and date.
Lisa did cleanups of the PCR products and the restrictions.
Maya made restrictions of pSB4A5, pSB2K3, RFP, GFP as well as cleanups of these.
Tomorrow we should be ready to some ligations.

The PCRs I made the 24-09-2010 were ran on a gel i the weekend and no bands appeared:-( Maybe something is really wrong, or maybe I'm just really bad at making PCRs. Sebastien had a look at the gel picture with the purified plasmids that I used as templates and thinks that they look weird. He thinks the concentration is way lower than normally, and he also thinks they look like cut plasmids. So I'm not sure whether we should attempt a new miniprep or whether we should make a new PCR on the miniprep I did, or start all over... We did after all have a lot of background in this ligation, so maybe its a good idea to start over. Sebstien also mentioned that it could be a problem to try to clone the gifsy repressors into p"

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Choice of Protein_-_-_TEXT.html," suggestions for our system regarding how to handle protein folding.
Integration
Virginia Wotring: The input we got from Virginia made us rethink which space related health issues we wanted to address with our system. Virginia made us consider proteins that affected the immune system and thereby were targeting another type of health problems that we originally hadn't considered. We integrated her suggestion by investigating whether immune regulators would be possible to produce with our protein printer. Virginia also suggested producing G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) as a way to address the high radiation levels in outer space. Afterwards we have considered this thoroughly and we have ended up with this as one of the final target proteins for our system!
Jon Scott: Jon Scott encouraged us to try to produce some protein drugs that could be combined with exercise and that would prevent bone loss. This made us readjust our project and try to figure which proteins would be good for preventing bone loss.
Karen McDonald: Karen McDonald suggested producing bone anabolic hormones such as Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) to address bone loss experienced by astronauts. She also suggested producing anti-cancer drugs. This input led us to consider PTH as a possible target protein given that it was interesting from a medical point of view. We further did some analysis of the proteins and we have ended up with PTH being one of our target proteins, which we believe could be produced with our system!
Eva Horn Møller: Eva Horn Møller emphasized the importance of patience safety when producing drugs. Therefore, she said that it was very important that we made a thouroug characterization of if anything was co-secreted through the injectisome. In order to be completely sure, she suggested us to use E. coli disabled of LPS (lipopolysaccharide, which is a molecule that is very toxic to humans) for  protein production – and this is definitely something we intend to make sure to disable and which we have incorporated into our project!
Jørgen Sauer: Jørgen Sauer pointed out that we should try to keep the pH in the protein buffer as close to blood pH as possible because this would result less pain when injecting the proteins into the veins. We hadn't thought about this before, but we definitely intend to do it now. Furthermore Jørgen Sauer also pointed out the importance of being aware of the LPS content. This further confirmed our decision made about using E. coli disabled of LPS for protein production. Jørgen Sauer further believed that Human Growth Hormone would be a very good candidate for production with our system.

"
UC_Chile,2013,Team:UC Chile#The Game_-_-_TEXT.html," is the mission that the main character of our game is going to face. She will have to find a way of fighting this bugs using Synthetic Biology and she will have to do it fast, before every plastic tube and plastic petri dishes disappear and stops her investigation from taking place.
By building different kind of genetic constructs in bacteria to be able to defeat the intrinsic prokaryotic organisms that live inside the termites, the player will learn about microbiology, molecular genetics and Synthetic Biology.
How does Research help to spread Synthetic Biology?
Trapped inside a labyrinth! How to get out from it?
We wanted to motivate teenagers to get into Biology and in particular into Synthetic Biology. In order to do so, we have first to teach them about this new exciting area. Our problem here was: how to reach teenagers? We could visit schools or organize activities for them, like other iGEM teams have done. But we thought that the quantity of teenagers that is possible to reach by these means is small. This motivates us to search new methods of reaching them. One was the organization of the School diffusion through teachers: the other one was the generation of this game.
Nowadays a computer in a house is a must, and children, in general, spend a lot of time using and playing with them. So, the idea of a game was ideal: teenagers like to play games way more than learning. What if we could tell them about SynBio while they are playing?
A game has the advantage of being available for a wide spectrum of people through the Internet. It can spread easily with a link, it can be posted on the forums of RPG maker games, and people that like our game can help us promote it among their friends. This way, instead of reaching a small amount of teenagers, we could reach more people, even from out of our native country, Chile. With this objective in mind, we created the game both in Spanish as in English: Spanish was necessary for our own and other Latin American countries, and English was in order to be able to be played by anyone in the world who speaks it, independently of their own native language.
Fly around the MIT!
Spreading Research
In order to make our game famous, we put the Spanish version in the Internet on our own website www.igemuc.cl. We also create an English version that was uploaded on our iGEM webpage and on disemination english webpage . Since RPG maker is a game that only works on Windows OS, we investigated and were able to create a version compatible with Mac OS in both languages.

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Content#PolicyAndPractices#PolicyandPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," future ethical debates since it can open up possibilities for interpretation.
This has, under the assumption of a future ""minimal cell"" the result of changing perspective on life itself. The clear distinction between animate and inanimate is repealed, life as a laboratory adjustable process is demystified.
Artificial or artificially generated
The “artificial cell“
An often used term in synthetic biology besides ""living machines"" is ""artificial cell"" or ""synthetic cell"". Both terms mean artificial, constructed, pseudo and pose as the opposite of ""natural"" (Oxford dictionary).
It should be noted what is exactly characterize as an ""artificial"" cell, as the term has no clear semantic boundaries. The laboratory-designed organisms are made as well as natural cells of organic material and have cellular structures. “Natural"" cell carry the DNA or RNA necessary for reproduction, evolution, and metabolism information as well as the “artificial cell”.
The artificiality of the cells lies precisely in the laboratory completed synthetic production method, which is why they can be labeled as ""genetic artificiality"" (Birnbacher 2006).
The ambiguous and imprecise formulation can lead, as much as the phrase ""living machine"" to ethical problems. It is indicated that the synthetic modified organisms differentiate from ""natural"" organisms and are in contrast ""unnatural"". Splitting organisms in these two groups leads to an apparent dissection of the concept of life, even though both are ""natural.""
Again, as with the distinction between ""living"" and ""non-living"" this leads the division between ""natural"" and ""artificial"" to an altered prospect on life and a problematic classification and grading of the unit life (Boldt / Müller 2009 ).
Conclusion
Thinking ahead, the possibilities of creating new organisms through manipulation, reduction and modularization leads to man as a kind of ""Creator"". This opens up new ethical, social and philosophical areas of conflict. In this article the problem arising from the use of terms like ""living machines"" and ""synthetic / artifical cell"" were highlighted.
Particularly problematic is in our eyes, that there are several types of interpretation.
A science which has the possibility to improve the lives of people with new, low-cost and effective methods of environmental protection, the treatment of diseases and many other areas, should provide an unambiguous basis for an informed discussion. The fact that terms imply false and failing to reach full potential scenarios, prevents a qualified debate on opportunities and risks in this field. An example of this can be seen in the genetechnology debate, in which, through ignorance of the topic"

In the beginning of the summer the Dundee collegiate team greatly helped me develop the skills needed, and from their experience I have learned not to repeat their mistakes - such as not labelling test tubes.

Mia Wood
So that we could get everything done, my time was split 50/50 between the dry and wet teams (wiki coder note: we include her as an honorary dry team member anyway for a satisfyingly even split. Also since it's the better team). In the lab I did a lot of work in making the initial construct and performing the tests on it with the help of John, Fatima and Alex. Working together with the rest of my team in the lab made it very enjoyable, and allowed us to help each other and share our knowledge. When I wasn’t in the lab I would be working with Beth and Darryl on human practices/outreach, contacting various specialists to get their insight into our project. I also worked on the maths modelling with Beth, Bartosz, and Darryl, with the help of Lucas and Prof. Fordyce Davidson. Special shout-out to Fatima for driving me home in time for the Great British Bake Off after being in the lab until late.
Beth Rear
Throughout our project I was mostly part of the dry team, involving myself in maths modelling with help from Lucas and Prof. Fordyce Davidson. I was also focused on the human practices aspect of our project, working together with Mia and Darryl to develop this. Once that was done, I started working on our presentation and poster together with the rest of the team. (She may be a technophobe, but most of the lovely diagrams you see throughout our wiki and on presentation slides were by her and her unexpected Powerpoint prowess). However, I would occasionally be found in the lab helping out with any work to be done, particularly towards the final stages of the project.
Darryl Sime
During our project, I took on the job of coding/bringing together the team’s wiki. With limited prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, I decided to teach myself them using Codecademy, W3Schools, and the wonders of Google. When I hit a snag, I'd also seek guidance when needed from John, or Chris Nelis from the Dundee collegiate team. I also worked on human practices with Mia and Beth, plus a bit of maths modelling with them and Bartosz, guided by Lucas and Dyce. Big big thank you also to Ummi"

Register assembly RL PR-1a: middle part for assembly of site-specific recombination based Registers. Composed of the PR-1a inverted sequence and the Mtb terminator flanked by two opposing PhiC31 site-specific recombination sites (attR and attL).
θC31 recombinase (BBa_K1742004): PhiC31 is a site-specific serine recombinase derived from a Streptomyces phage (Keravala et al., 2006). The enzyme recognizes two different attachments sites called also attB and attP, and also excise a sequence flanked with attB and attP sites close to the promoter.
Gp3: Streptomyces phage phiC31-encoded recombination directionality factor (RDF). Upon interaction with PhiC31 Integrase, it promotes site-specific recombination of attR and attL attachment sites to produce PhiC31 attP and attB sites.
Ros1: The Antirrhinum majus transcription factor Rosea1. It's usually used as a visual reporter gene (Majer, Llorente, Rodríguez-Concepción & Daròs, 2017).

Ensuring that we achieve critical milestones in a timely manner is vital to the success of FREDsense Technologies. To this end, we have strategically planned to both utilize our resources in the most effective way and to meet the needs of our market. Here we outline how FREDsense Technologies will grow over the next 5 years.
Our Plan
Ensuring that we achieve critical goals is vital to our success at FREDsense. To this end, we have developed a strategic plan for where our energies will need to be focused to best utilize our resources and to achieve our goals in a timely manner. This involves us devoting focus to key developments of our technology, legal frameworks, and financial implications. Here we outline how FREDsense will grow over the next 5 years in three intervals.
Year One
Within the first year of our operations we foresee the following major achievements. The continued development of our technology through characterization of the different genetic, chemical and cellular systems will be paramount.  Further, these discoveries will be protected by strategically filing patents and maintaining trade secrets of our technology.
We will also begin the process of obtaining regulatory approvals required for the sale and use our final system in Canada and the United States primarily through CEPA. Additionally, to enable steady growth for our technologies market, we will be engaging with key industry"

Conferences
A big part of dissemination of science is to include young adults in high school, teach them enough about science so as to peak their interest. In accordance to our goals, we decided to give a general, dynamic talk about nanotechnology, bionanotechnology and iGEM in career fairs for people close to graduation.
Movie Projection
It is customary in our campus to project a film every Tuesday, run by a club called “Cineclub”. We decided to take advantage of this ongoing tradition to present a film related to synthetic biology and to give a very quick presentation on the basics of synthetic biology. This way we could get a token amount of information for people within our community and allowed them to reach out to us in case anyone wanted more information.

Publicity on Campus Open Day
In May 2018, on the campus open day of Dalian University of Technology, the DLUT_CHINA_B team                         carried out a series of activities to expand the influence of synthetic biology and iGEM                         competition at Dalian University of Technology. We designed the “Prize-giving Quiz” game to give                         the guests a general knowledge of biology. “Understanding Micro-World Activities” provides                         visitors with microscopes and some samples made by the team members which let them to observe                         and understand the microbes we can't see. This part attracted many primary and middle school                         students. We also distributed more than 300 survey questionnaires. These questionnaires were                         mainly designed for people of different ages to understand their physical condition and for                         understanding the market demand of our product. The results showed that a lot of people are                         interested in our program which made the team members more motivated.
Lead Synthetic Biology Into the Campus
In order to propaganda synthetic biology knowledge to primary and secondary schools more vividly                         in Dalian, our decided to work with OUC-CHINA. Their team members will design synthetic biology                         science brochures and we would made into a poster. The poster will be displayed together with                         the posters of DLUT_CHINA_B in several primary and secondary schools in Dalian as well as the                         libraries of Dalian University of Technology. The OUC-CHINA team's popular science brochure is                         called SPACESHIP E.coli, which compares E. coli to a spaceship, anthropomorphizing the ribosome,                         and describing the logic switches and biological components in synthetic biology vividly. We                         hope that more primary and middle school students will grow a great interest in synthetic                         biology through the activities.
In these promotions, we also found that some of the high school attached great importance to this                         competition. High School affiliated to Dalian University of Technology is one of them.
Three members of our team came to the High School affiliated to Dalian University of Technology.                         After the team members explained the principle of synthetic biology, many students have shown a                         great interest in synthetic biology. We learned that the Dalian High School affiliated to the                         Dalian University of Technology had also established the iGEM Student Association during the                         communication. This communication also provided some new ideas for the students of the iGEM                         association, which broadened their horizons and inspire them to learn more about synthetic                         biology.

Vanderbilt,2015,Team:Vanderbilt#Practices#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html,". Our team is looking for collaborators who are willing to answer a simple question: if your BioBricks were implemented in the real world, what would the consequences be if they ever mutated?
Could it turn your therapeutic into a poison? Could it frustrate production at a commercial scale? Could you lose a priceless genotype? Would it do anything at all? We want to challenge the community to think about these hard questions and critically examine the very real dangers posed by DNA mutation.
For those teams that complete a quick survey about what the consequences of mutation might be for their project, we have a special reward in mind: we will give you access to a computational algorithm that our team has developed to lower the mutagenic potential of gene sequences. Using this algorithm, we can give you statistics on how mutation-prone your favorite BioBricks really are.
We received responses from the University of Virginia, University of Paris-Bettencourt, Team Vilnius-Lithuania, and the University of California San Francisco. Our survey thus helped raise awareness about the dangers that mutations pose to synthetic biology. To take one illustrative example, one team who completed our survey started by writing that they were unable to come up with any way that mutation may affect their project, because all of the genes they work with are endogenous to their model system. Needless to say our team quickly got on the case, and began devising all sorts of devious ways mutations could occur, and started a dialogue about mutational stability.
Industry Outreach
To get a better idea of the consequence of mutations in industrial scale operations, we contacted representatives from companies that work with microbes. We first contacted Dr. Burns from Tennessee Brew Works. She informed us about the significant role that mutations play in quality control for brewing operations. Companies like Tennessee Brew Works will periodically replace the yeast starter cultures they used with frozen stocks. The reason for this is that the yeast can be altered in significant and unpredictable ways over time by processes like mutations. If these companies could make improve the longevity of their yeast cultures by making them more mutation resistant, this could reduce costs, improve the consistency and quality of production bases, and could product priceless brewing strains from mutating.

Design
When we were formulating the design of our BactoMotor, we were well aware of the existance of previous models of similar bacterial driven motors. However, the previous designs, though receiving a lot of attention, lack some key components an ideal motor should have:
Low efficiency while transforming vectorial differences in Brownian Motion into rotation [1]
Lack unidirectional movement of bacteria [2]
A small percentage of motors rotated in undesired direction [2]
Involve chemical rather than genetic modification of surface proteins [2]
No speed control mechanism (discussed in Speed Controller module) [1] [2]
To overcome such problems, we designed a 'Direction Controller' module which we have implemented into our bacteria. The use of this module is to overcome the problems listed above as well as introducing several more benifits:
Achieve strong selective binding of Bacteria onto the BactoMotor
The genetic modification (biobricks) is flexible and stable compared to chemical treatment
Future application for medical purposes by expression of desired ligands or receptors
The mechanism by which the Direction Controller operate will be discussed below.
The biggest advantage of our Bactomotor is that the expression of streptavidin is specifically at the pole of the bacteria, which allows cells to adhere in the same orientation to the motor. Once bacterial cells adhere to the biotin-coated micromotor, the propulsion force would thereafter be generated by bacterial swimming. Therefore, this synthetic device is capable to convert biological energy into mechanical work.
Figure 1. Expression of streptavidin at the forehead of the bacteria
The polar expression of the streptavidin at one pole of the bacteria is crucial in our project. It's well known that there're some systems could express proteins evenly on the outer membrane of the bacteria, or concentratedly at single poles under some certain conditions. This surface expression characteristics could ensure the precise structures and functions of the expressed protein streptavid"

Determination of immobilized β2-MG concentration
1. Standard for immobilized β2-MG concentration
We have known that the orientation of liquid crystal molecules is very sensitive to the                             topographic changes on the substrate surface. When the β2-MG and GA are                             crosslinked and fixed on the substrate surface, the topographic structure of the surface                             will be changed to a certain extent affecting the orientation of the liquid crystal                             molecules. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of the concentration of                             immobilized β2-MG on the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell. With the                             decrease of the concentration of immobilized β2-MG, the perturbation to the                             orientation of liquid crystal molecule decreases, and the optical imaging of liquid crystal                             cell gradually darkens. Only a few speckles appear in the optical imaging of liquid crystal                             cell, which tend to be all-black background. The highest immobilized β2-MG                             concentration, which can keep the optical imaging background dark, is fixed on the substrate                             surface when sufficient antigen and antibody reactions are required.
2. Result
Keeping other conditions unchanged,the concerntration of β2-MG is in the range of 250ng/mL to 1000ng/mL,                             and the results are shown in Fig. 4.

From the experimental results, the results show when the concentration of β2-MG                             fixed to the substrate surface is under 500 ng/mL, only a few bright spots appear in the                             optical imaging of the liquid crystal cells gradually darkening, approaching the full black                             background. When the concentration of β2-MG is above 500 ng/mL, the optical                             imaging appears obvious bright spot which is becoming brighter gradually.

しかしその位置情報を大腸菌に認識させるという、積算の次のステップのシステムが現在出されていません。

Besides, the whole PKS chain includes a Loading Domain on the N-terminus and a TE Domain (thioesterase) on the C-terminus.
From the previous description, we know that each polypeptide chain (DEBS) has two Modules, and each Module includes several domains, which have similar structure and function.
A module contains but not limits to three domains: KS, AT, ACP (please click here to get more information about domain). Each a module can catalyze an extension and the cyclization of a carbon chain [4].
Design:
According to the design of our project PPS, we cannot make sure that we will make each domain as a standard part accurately. Maybe we will make the mistake that the function of some domains lose as we cut some necessary base pairs which we do not know. Therefore, we need to express the whole DEBS in E.coli functionally [5].
We choose PCR amplification to obtain the target gene segments. Base on the data of eryA we get from NCBI (the whole length of eryA is nearly 33kb), we have to use three different plasmids pSB1C3, pSB1A3 and pSB3K3 to carry eryAⅠ(11kb), eryAⅡ(11kb), eryAⅢ(9kb) as the carrying capacity of plasmid is limited.
Later, we will introduce all the three rebuilt plasmids into the host E.coli BAP1 and induce the functional expression of DEBS. If our design is OK, we will get the same product comparing with the experiment group, which uses combined standard domains to synthesize 6dEB.
Operation:
First of all, we find the sequence of eryA gene from NCBI and complete the genome extraction of S.erythraea which will be used as the PCR template.
It seems that we will meet the challenge of PCR amplification for the GC-enriched (≥70%) and large DNA fragment (nearly 11kb).
The first time, we design the primer pairs commonly with RFC 10. Primer STAR [2] & GenSTAR are chosen as the DNA polymerase while 3% DMSO is added to decrease the annealing temperature.
However, we failed on the first try as we only got the 2kb fragment.
We tried again immediately by changing the PCR enzyme and conditions.
We made the length of primer pairs longer to lower the high GC content of eryA. In addition to this, we done explore experiments about different"

2. Focus on reusing or fixing the CO2 that will be released from the respiration of our cell culture to minimize environmental pollution.
3. The size of the MFC should be scaled up to accommodate the slow PE plastic degradation rate.
7. Finalising our ideas – Final wrap-up with Prof. Davis Bookhart
After making the mentioned modifications to our system, we again approached Prof. Bookhart to update him with our progress and to show him the data we collected. We asked for further advice on how to integrate the public opinion we obtained to help define our future direction with the project. Prof. Bookhart ’s main concern still lied in the fact that CO2 was our end product. He commented that our added nitrogenase system would only delay the problem of CO2 release by recycling it, instead of trapping it permanently.
Integrating all the concerns and suggestions given by Prof. Bookhart and our market research during our exhibition, we came up with the biosphere-MFC conjugation and the nitrogenase system to fully sequester CO2.
For the former, we will let CO2 pass from the anode chamber that houses Shewanella into an adjoining compartment via a semipermeable membrane. This adjoining compartment will house a self-contained biosphere, where plants, shrimp and potentially fish can be kept. The plants inside can take up the CO2 that crosses over via photosynthesis,  hence fixing the CO2 and therefore sequestering it as plant biomass. This will help decompose PE without releasing additional CO2 to solve the issue raised by Professor Bookhart. Since the nitrogenase system does not trap the CO2 permanently, it was not suggested to be the primary way to solve the sustainability issue. Nonetheless, our team decided to keep this system, to enhance our electricity generation when the plastic degradation process is limited.
Alongside carbon sequestration, there is an added benefit of putting plants near the MFC: to absorb any excess copper ions (Cu+) from our PE degradation module (which role is to enhance laccase enzymatic activity). This will nourish the biosphere and also prevent copper ions contamination to the environment.
All in all, our final product design is modified into an MFC/biosphere conjugation. We hope that the mini-ecosystem can serve as a visual attractant to educate people on the idea of sustainability and also to motivate them to be more environmentally friendly. In addition to educating the public and raising awareness towards the environment, this MFC/biosphere conjugation could generate enough electricity to charge a power pack, through the help of a"
