AI-2Sensitive Promoter and LsrR
We got the results of Lsr promoter part from 2013 ATOMS iGEM team. Their results are shown below.
Inducible promoter experiment
To observe inducible promoters response, we co incubated two different bacteria. The first bacteria culture is expressing enzyme system and the second culture is including inducible promoter. At the experiment, we incubated them seperately for 16 hours and mixed them into one flask and 4 hour later, we add 0,1 mM SAH (with 10x PBS containing %1 BSA). Incubate with SAH for one day and, took 2 ml of liquid culture to santrifuge tube.Centrifuged it. We saw the red color at the pellet as you see below.
So, it means the enzyme system is working and inducible promoter is succesfully induced from AI-2.
Toehold-Trigger RNA-GFP
PSB1C3-Toehold-GFP/Trigger RNA CLONING
We cloned these two IDT G-Block genes into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and TnrA-pAlst-RFP G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, Toehold-GFP’s band should be at 1294 bp line and Trigger RNA’s should be at 443.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check as a second control of cloning. We used EcorI and PstI restriction enzymes for cut-check.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," we have electroporated an E. coli strain that only harbors the Tn5 transposase for comparison with untargeted integration.
Results and interpretation: Prior to doing any actual genomic integration, we performed a broad scala of control experiments. Table 1 gives an overview of the results obtained for these controls. The obtained data confirmed that, based on their blue colony phenotype, the parental BL21DE3 strain indeed contained intact and functional lacZ. Furthermore, the parental strain was not found to be resistant to chloramphenicol nor to kanamycin. Harboring the fusion construct and the gRNA that targets lacZ, while not provided with donor DNA, did not influence the functionality of the lacZ, resulting in remaining blue colony phenotype. This discards the potential expressional inhibition effects to to binding of the fusion complex. Furthermore, we took along some controls including Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), which is present by default on iGEM backbone vectors (pSB1K3). Together with blue phenotype, this resulted into a purple colony phenotype.

When transforming the donor DNA plasmid (BBa_K2643011) into E. coli DH5α and selecting on medium complemented with chloramphenicol and kanamycin, we observed formation of red colonies. This indicates that the kanamycin cassette, as well as the RFP cassette were intact and functional. The sequence verification confirmed both sequences were intact and oriented as desired. DH5α was not able to grow on LB+Kan+Cam, and demonstrates the negative control.

Introduction
Higher order self-assembling protein assemblies are commonplace in nature, such as ferritin, which carries iron in many single-celled organisms. Due to their encapsulating function and box-like structure, such assemblies are often called protein “cages.” Inspired by these natural sources, an abundance of research has been done into creating synthetic cages with new customized properties such as stability, size, and subunit types. Furthermore, while applications for cages have been suggested, many have not been tested experimentally.
An application that we have centered our project around is targeted drug delivery. By specifying the site of delivery, the effects of the drug can be limited to desired areas with maximized efficiency and we can avoid damaging undesired targets in the body.
Thrombosis, the process by which a clot forms in the blood stream, is associated with widespread diseases including stroke and many heart conditions. Anticoagulants prevent clot formation by interfering with clotting factors and allowing for smoother blood flow and restoring normal circulation. However, these drugs can have detrimental side effects, such as an inability to inhibit fatal blood loss through cuts or other wounds. By localizing the site of delivery and reducing the necessary drug dosage, we can mitigate these kinds of problems. A protein cage encapsulating an anticoagulant drug that would selectively release its payload at the site of a clot would fulfill this purpose. To specify the target, we should select an associated enzyme or byproduct of the clotting cascade. Thrombin, a protease present at blood clots, cleaves a specific amino acid sequence. This sequence, if properly inserted into a protein cage containing an anticoagulant, would result in disassembly of the cage, release of the drug molecule to the targeted area, and destruction of the clot.
The goal of our project is to modify protein cages that disassemble in the presence of thrombin protease. We are using two previously created synthetic cages, one composed of 12 subunits forming a tetrahedral cage while the other is composed of 24 subunits forming an octahedral cage. For each of these protein cages, we have designed mutants with inserted thrombin cleavage sites with the intention to induce disassembly of the cages by treatment with thrombin prote"

  (Promega)
Basic principle of the enzymatically detection assay:
NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay
We used the NAD/NADH-Glo™ Assay for the determination of the NAD+ and NADH levels in the cells during the cultivation in different growth phases.
Protocol:
The 1st step, before the assay can be performed is the lysis of the cells.
1 ml of bacteria culture (OD600= 0,375 ≈ 3 • 103 cells)get                       pelleted by centrifugation
Remove supernatant and add 300 µl bicarbonatebuffer + 1% DTAB                      (dodecyl(trimethyl)azanium bromide)
Mix thoroughly for cell lysis
Assay the neutralized samples using the NAD/NADH-Glo Assay by transferring 30 µl of each                     sample to the wells of a 96-well white luminometer plate and add 30µl of NAD/NADH-Glo                     Detection Reagent.
Incubate at room temperature and read luminescence after 30 to 60 minutes.
Determine NAD/NADH ratios by comparing RLU, or calculate the concentrations by comparison to a                       standard curve.
This method is used, if you want to measure the total amount of NAD+ and NADH. For the determination of the individual NAD+ and NADH concentrations follow the description below.
Individual determination of NAD+ and NADH
After the cells got mixed briefly transfer two 100µl  aliquots to each of two new tubes.(R1 and R2)
Add 100µl HCl (0.4M) to R1 for acid treatment
Heat both aliquots at 60 °C for 15 minutes
Cool at room temperature for 10 minutes
Neutralize R1 with 100 µl trizma base (0.5M). This sample now contains the oxidized form NAD.
Neutralize R2 with 200µl of a 1:1 mixture of HCl (0.5M) and trizma base (0.5M).  This sample now contains the oreduced form NADH
Both samples can be assayed as already described.
This protocol is taken from ""Bioluminescent Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Detection in Bacteria"" of the Promega corporation. All measurements were carried out with the GloMax® Discover Multimode-Reader .

Note: all centrifugations should be carried out in a table-top microcentrifuge at > 12000 x g/10.000-14.000 rpm
Preparation
Excise gel slice containing the DNA fragment using a clean scalpel or razor blade. Cut as close to the DNA band as possible to minimize the gel volume. Place the gel slice into a pre-weighed 1.5 mL tube. Record the weight of the gel slice. Note: If the purified fragment will be used for cloning reactions, avoid damaging the DNA through UV light exposure. Minimize UV exposure to a few seconds or keep the gel slice on a glass or plastic plate during UV illumination.
Add 1:1 volume of Binding Buffer to the gel slice (volume:weigt)
Incubate the gel mixture at 50-60 °C for 10 min or until the gel slice is completely dissolved. Mix the tube by inversion every few minutes to facilitate the melting process. Ensure that the gel slice is completely dissolved. Vortex the gel buffer mixture briefly before loading on the column.
Check the color of the solution. A yellow color indicates an optimal pH for DNA binding. If the color of the solution is orange"

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Content#PolicyAndPractices#PolicyandPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," with the autopoiesis-theory in synthetic biology leads to restricted and modified applicability of the theory .
Thus, the following discussion will concentrate on the definition of life first illustrated and includes the autopoiesis theory in restricted form, as this will gain importance in synthetic biology for future developments.
After consideration of the machine concept and definitions of life it is evident that the organisms named ""living machine"" are by no means machines but living organisms. Today synthetically engineered organisms satisfy the minimum requirements of reproduction, metabolism and evolution. The term ""machine"" emphasizes the intended machine-like function. The organisms are alive but perform a machine-related purpose.
The claim of the synthetic biology is to create living organisms, which act simultaneously as a machine. The synthetic biology changes the definitions of living organisms and aims to abolish the separation between life and machine. It follows that the discussion with this term is not regarding the definition, but rather an ontological problem.
The term suggests a utilization of life with the pure focus on the control and goals of the humans.
On the one hand the term ""living machine"" generates an ethical problem, for the reason that it reduces living organisms to their purpose and implies a total control of created existence. Man breeds and keeps animals for the purpose of procuring food, which includes utilization and control of these creatures. There is an analogy to the organisms of the synthetic biology, however in synthetic biology humans appear as self-creators. Synthetic biology aims the creation of new organisms, in which the structures and properties are artificially defined by man whereas breeding and keeping animals is still subordinated through evolution.
On the other hand, ""living machine"" belies the fact that, due to a lack of understanding any intervention in the genome can indeed provide the desired functionality, but might also have not foreseeable effects. A feature of living cells is the interaction with the environment. It is difficult to assess the impact such interaction for the environment is as expected.
Furthermore, it has to be noted that currently it is possible to manipulate and utilize unicellular organisms, however in the future it is also conceivable to engineer higher organisms. The designation of ""living machines"" then abates these creatures to their pure function.
The concept of ""living"" and ""non-living"" organisms create a hybrid of both and does not answer which properties apply to these exactly. This might implicate associations about properties and facts which do not match the actual conditions in these organism. Furthermore the linguistic imprecision could have an effect on future ethical debates since it can open up possibilities for interpretation.
This has, under the assumption of a future ""minimal cell"" the result of changing perspective"
UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", this time inserting CysE after araCpBad in pSB1C3, cutting      the vector (which contains araCpBad) with S and P and then insert (CysE)      with X and P. Last time we used the registry protocol; This time we used higher quantities of DNA. For the insert we used PCR products rather than a plasmid.
The screening gives a variety of results. I realize we’re very unlucky, again: screening with E and P, which gives vector and insert bands, results in fragments of the same length. Cristina finds there’s a BamHI site near the end of araCpBad, so I can screen with BamHI and PstI to confirm the cloning . I also confirm by PCR using Prefix and Suffix primers, just to be sure . Both are good, meaning I have my third Part.
This week I also begin to work with the mutated version of the composite      part: araCpBad-M256I CysE. I try with a modified version of the 3A method, the one I didn’t manage to do well with Ross last time. This time, instead of simply digesting and ligating the biobrick , I PCR out CysE* and araCpBad and then digested them separately.Afterward I have ligated them into pSB1C3 in one shot.
The screening of the transformation (with many many red colonies) is not      good, again. The 3A assembly seems my nemesis.
In the weekend I digested a whole miniprep for every part I needed use. Quantifications also were good, so Everything was ready for monday!      Me Giaco and Guzz had and exam this week so we took a day off for studying, but at the end of the week I got the two main constructs done!
This week our gene synthesized by Genscript has arrived! I will be working all day long from now. From now on I will have to sleep in the lab.
I immediately started to try to amplify the gene by PCR, and after 12 attempts I finally succeeded in it . In the weekend I purified and digested all the parts that I would have used to create my new parts, K731400 and K731450.
On the 27th June I will start working on the constructs assigned to me. Up until now, I've helped out others.
I will build and characterize our new lac operator-containing plasmids. I will then pass the information I gathered to Andrea and help her testing her"

All values are integers as the Gillespie algorithm works with discrete numbers of molecules. The values were chosen based on a stable equilibrium found by letting the model run a simulation of the inherent system over 450 minutes with different starting values.
Ranging from 1-350 molecules per minute, the implemented expression rates of RelE and RelB in the model might seem too high, as the rates in the inherit system is effectively around 80-100 for RelB and 2-5 for RelE. However, the possibility of placing the relE and relB genes under regulation of controllable promoters makes the high total production values reasonable.
When the inherent toxin-antitoxin system is activated under starvation, 40-70 molecules of free RelE are found in each cell, making it reasonable to believe that the cells enter dormancy when a few tens of free RelE copies are present. This result obtained from the model is in agreement with literature Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297
For the full list of constants, see the attached Table 1 at the bottom of this page.
Running the Model
To give a stochastic view of the system, the Gillespie algorithm was run in the computer programming language MATLAB, utilising an implementation made by MATLAB user Nezar.
For the runs simulating dormancy, deterministic initial values were used and the system was run for 30 minutes without activation of the inserted toxin promoter. This resulted in a stochastic distribution of initial values mimicking variations between cells. Analysis showed, that 30 minutes was enough for the model to find a stable distribution, which is"

One of the most obvious requests that came out of this meeting was that the protocols be available in multiple languages.  Since one of the students working on this protocol idea is going to school at Peking University, we called them up and had another little meeting on internationalization of our protocols.  PKU kindly provided us with Chinese versions of many of their own experimental protocols, which have been useful to us in testing our multi-language support!  Without our helpful partners in America and China, it would have been impossible to develop this tool.  We have learned a lot about user-facing design, and we are extremely grateful to these two teams for their help!

About USTC_Software
A bunch of energetic young guys bumping into each other in pursuit of the truth of life, and this is basically the essential reason why we are here now.
This year, we are much more populated than before. This not only gets solid proof from the increasing coverage of participants' number, but also can be demonstrsted by the big variance among participants' backgrounds. The 2009 iGEM team of USTC, well, if we just count the dry team, consists of two graduate students and four undergraduates. Our major varies from  electrnic engineering to condensed matter physics, from geophysics to computational biology. By such a colorful combination, anything exciting could be possible relying on our brotherhood. We feel so lucky to get acquaintance with each other and really enjoy all the funny days we are together. We will enjoy the days in MIT, just join us!

This means, as long as the prior does not significantly change anything, we will not be able to make very accurate predictions on the parameters.
Including priors in further investigating will increase the accuracy of our measurements. Unfortunately, as computing profile likelihoods can become quite time consuming, we were not able to compute a profile likelihood with priors included.
Markov Analysis
Analysis was performed with a Metropolis Hastings algorithm with a multivariate normal distribution as jumping distribution. 1000000 samples were generated and then thinned by a factor 1:100 to reduce correlation of the samples. The covariance matrix of previously generated samples were used to tune the jumping distribution, this resulted in an acceptance rate of 21%, so a little below the target of 23%.
Figure 3. Course of parameters during generation of samples (unthinned)
Joint Distribution
Figure 4. Smoothed 2D histogram of the joint distribution of in each case 2 parameters.
Figure 5. Scatter plot of the samples of joint distribution of in each case 2 parameters.
For the smoothed histogram plot smoothhist2d.m[ Perkins, 2009 ] was used. The color indicates the density of samples. Black to dark red reflects a low density, yellow to white indicates a high density. Grey dots indicate samples identified as outliers by the script.
On the diagonal of the scatter plot the kernel density estimation script kde.m[ Botev, 2011 ] was used to obtain a plot of the respective marginal densities.  Off the diagonal is a again a plot of the joint distribution. Here the color indicates the a-posterior probability of the respective sample. Low probabilities are mapped by blue to green color, High probabilities are mapped by yellow to red color.
Mind that due to the nature of the the utilized scripts, the orientation of the Y-Axis is flipped when comparing the two plots.
Credibility Intervals
As the Metropolis Hastings algorithm samples exactly from the target distribution, one can use the generated samples to find credibility intervals. The shown intervals are maximum density credibility intervals. They were obtained by computing the 1-α/2; and α/2 quantiles, with alpha being the missing percentage to 100%, that minimized the 1-norm of the distance between the two values.

Following a similar protocol to the one performed on 5/18.
Growing up cells in 100ml of LB.
We are doing a smaller volume because we are running low on bugbuster lysis reagents, and we want to be able to do at least one more reaction after this one.
Instead of making a starter culture, we are simply inoculating a colony into a 2L beveled culture flask.
I would have used a 1L one, but there were none available.
I started incubating the culture at 12:35 pm 7/27, but I forgot to add the Kanamycin antibiotic until 1 pm.  (100 ul of 1000x).
Here are the steps for today's growth protocol.
Inoculate one colony in 100 ml of LB in an autoclaved beveled flask.
Add appropriate antibiotics.
Grow and shake at 37 until OD reaches between 0.4 and 0.6.
At that point, add IPTG to final concentration of 0.5 mM
Continue to incubate at 37 C and shake overnight.
In the morning, spin down the cells, decant the supernatant, and freeze the pellet at -80 for storage.

$M_{2\:max}$: Frequency of most common checkmethod 2 value
$F$: Frequency of possible unique bits of information
This has been plotted for a 2 and 3 BabbleBlock system in Fig.5 and Fig.6 respectively.     When comparing checksum to checkcethod 2 the frequency peak is approximately 20 to 30     times smaller in both cases whilst utilizing more values. In Fig.5 and Fig.6 the largest     improvement using the second iteration of the checkmethod is the utilization of every     integer value, checkmethod 1 appears shaded as the frequency varies frequently. The last     step is to test checkmethod 2 when used in a babbleBlock containing 20 BabbleBricks; the     largest value possible assuming a BabbleBlock containing the value ‘3’ in each digit will     grant a value of 60600 which falls out of the current limit of 10$^4$ values. Therefore,     it is recommended that one more BabbleBrick is added to the end of the BabbleBlock in order     to store 10$^5$ values.
To improve this method  further more complex multiplications could be added, it would be    a decision based on optimising efficiency of calculations and minimising false positives.    In a 2 and 3 BabbleBrick system the"

Max and Jonah continued their work on the serial dilutions of chitinase testing against Yarrowia and Nissile in order to collect data on an effective concentration of cinnamaldehyde .  After the lab work was completed, the RX students met at UES with all of the mentors for an all team meeting where they discussed project progress as well as possible human outreach “field trips” to the Cleveland Becket Oil and an oil subsidiary of Marathon in Cincinnati.

Lab 1
Today’s plan included a digestion protocol, purification, and ligation on the IDT order with the with experience after doing so many for so long. They were able to complete everything and then head off to the team photo shoot at the United States Air Force Museum, where they took team pictures in front of many iconic planes.
Lab 2
The RX lab team started the day once again in lab where they discussed the direction their project was heading.  Max and Jonah began discussion since their cinnamaldehyde parts were cancelled by IDT along with the Chitinase B4A part.  The team reexamined the DNA sequences and found an error in one of their parts.  They fixed the error and split the two cinnamaldehyde parts into 3 parts instead of two.    With this dilema out of the way and the new parts ordered, the team headed to the lab where they once again split into two working groups. Peter, Travis, and Chris spent the rest of the day performing a digest of the KPN1 removed plasmid DNA and ran a gel with it.  After the gel was ran and a picture was taken, a gel extraction was performed.  The final concentration of the extracted plasmid was 7.9 ng/uL which seemed to be low but acceptable for the DNA assembly and transformation that was planned to occur in the following days. Max and Jonah set up an experiment where they isolated colonies on plates and performed a serial dilution on the plate of cinnamaldehyde.

Only samples 78 to 82 had colonies after overnight incubation--these were the same colonies that were electroporated, instead of chemically transformed. Because we only added 1 ul of our cells to the plates, it is possible that this was not enough sample for us to see colonies, especially since chemical transformation is not as efficient as electroporation. The samples on the LB+spec plates had what appeared to be unspecific growth around the edges. This may be because the spec did not diffuse evenly. We will be re-plating all of our samples later today, on new LB+spec plates.
PCR of product from isothermal assembly of expression plasmid
We also ran a PCR on the product of the three-part isothermal assembly (omega+linker, ultramers, spec backbone). We used the cross-junction primers and the same recipe as our PCR on Tuesday . Once again we expected a product of 1.4 kb.

High school member
DTU Biobuilders has a tradition of getting high school students to participate in the team’s project. This is done to give them a unique hands-on experience with iGEM. As the previous years, the team had an open application round to select high school members that are interested in learning more about synthetic biology.
Minh Greulich (Nærum Gymnasium, 3rd year)
During the summer period, Minh has contributed to both the InterLab study, and the Biosensor project. She was especially helpful in the testing of the Biosensor protocol, for which no noteworthy experience in the lab was actually an advantage.
Support from DTU Bioengineering
We have had some great help from our supervisors, who have guided us throughout the whole process of making this project a reality.

Microfluidics 101
Introduction to Microfluidics | Dinithi
In order to effectively use the MARS system, users need to have a fundamental understanding of microfluidics. With this in mind, we created an introduction to microfluidics that teaches users the basics of microfluidics. This educational component of project MARS consists of an introduction to microfluidic chips as well as a guide to the various primitives used in our microfluidic designs.
Video Tutorials | Sarah and Dinithi
In order to make the microfluidic chips we designed accessible to synthetic biologists we developed four fully-narrated tutorial videos. These videos go step by step through the process of manufacturing, assembling, and testing a microfluidic device. The four videos created teach uses how to mill a microfluidic chip, how to make PDMS, how to assemble a microfluidic chip, and how to clean a microfluidic chip. Each of these videos is accompanied by a detailed written protocol as well.
Mars Repository
In order to make microfluidics a practical field for synthetic biologists, we created the MARS microfluidic chip repository. This repository hosts nine microfluidic chips that each perform a fundamental synthetic biological protocol. These nine protocols were determined after reaching out to synthetic biologists in the Boston University and iGEM communities. Each chip comes with all the required design files and documentation so that a synthetic biologist could download, manufacture, and test any chip in the repository. The nine chips in the MARS repository are as follows:
Cellular Lysis | Dylan
DNA Digestion | Dinithi
Cell Sorting | Dinithi
Ligation | Sarah
Transformation | Sarah
PCR | Sarah
Antibiotic Resistance | Dylan
Fluorescence Testing | Dinithi
Cell Culturing | Dylan
For more information regarding each chip, please see our

page.
Fluid Functionality
In order to verify whether or not a microfluidic device is functional, a grading system was developed: the Fluid Functionality Checklist. This fluid functionality system was broken up into two portions: a qualitative checklist and a quantitative analysis.

Each case of bovine mastitis can cost up to $300, and permanently damages infected cows so that they produce 10% less milk for the remainder of their milking years, causing additional losses on top of the initial $300 cost. Since farmers can identify the strains of bacteria that cause each case of mastitis on the farm using a special culture plate, choosing a specific bacteriocin for treatment is more precise than the traditional broad-range antibiotic cocktail. Bill also said that the microscope and app we were designing would be more convenient than current management techniques for bovine mastitis.
7 months and 13 interviews later, we turned inspiration into Legendairy results.
FINDINGS: Our dream of curing, preventing, and detecting mastitis can become a reality.

Douglas Densmore - Out of the lab (Peru salt pools)
Yesterday was the first official day for Berkeley's 2009 iGEM computational team. In the morning we had an introductory meeting and the students filled out forms so that they had key access to Cory Hall, the DOP Center, and their office space. It was great that we were able to get this taken care of so quickly!
After the short time together in the morning, they went to safety training from 10-noon. This was followed by a meeting of both teams over pizza lunch in Stanley Hall. This was a good chance to meet everyone and get some logistics out of the way (stipends, photo release forms, etc).
In the afternoon we did the following:

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0v, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability"

When Trim finds Nanobody, the game screen will shift to another one demonstrating the result of this game, Trim combining with Nanobody and ubiquitin, degrading targeted protein.
Cancer now becomes the majority of people's primary concern. And Trim has a potential studying value for cancer treatment. We added this relationship into our context and players were impressed by it. Some of them expressed their support in their comments. So, to further improve the utility of Trim became our primary goal--use plasmids containing DNA sequence of Trim and Nanobody to inject, which can last longer in cell than previous methods.

It is an index to measure the oxygen need within 5 days (in mg/l), for the oxidation processes of the organic substances present in waste performed by microorganisms.
C.O.D. (Chemical Oxygen Demand)
It is a measure of the amount of oxygen used to oxidize organic and inorganic compounds contained in a water sample. It provides a global measurement of all chemicals in the water that can be oxidized and so it is an indirect index of pollutants in a water sample.
Disposal of whey is a serious problem even if for a long time this product has been discharged into water streams, used for land spreading or to feed farm animals, since B.O.D. reduction treatments require a great economic effort.
Nowadays, it is well known that the management of the whey disposal is expensive and that whey is considered as a troublesome reject substance.
Whey processing: added-value substances like whey proteins, dry whey and, in some cases, lactose are extracted and residual lactose can be fermented in ethanol.
However, thanks to the new technologies, it is possible to obtain added-value substances to employ in pharmaceutical and alimentary industry, through membranes and filtration.  The main substances extracted are whey-proteins, used in fortifying more and more foods, beverages, infant formulas, nutraceuticals and lactose, which has somewhat limited applications in food products, for its low digestibility and poor solubility.  Moreover, lactose extraction from whey is an unprofitable process because the cost of the extraction is higher than the economic value of lactose itself. As a consequence, the residual liquid of cheese whey remains a special waste because of the high lactose concentration (~4.5%). For this reason, we aim at finding a new way to valorize residual lactose present in whey after extraction of other nutrients and precious substances, using fermentation. In this way, B.O.D.5 and C.O.D. parameters would be decreased, cheese whey would not be treated as a “special waste” and industries would take profit from fermentation products.
Fermentation
Fermentation is an anaerobic biochemical process, in which an organic compound is reduced to ethanol or lactic acid (typically) as final products in order to produce NAD+, a coenzyme involved in the standard energy-producing pathway, that is glicolysis. Fermentation is wide-spread in living beings: it is the only energy production mechanism coupled to glicolysis in prokaryotes and is also present in eukaryotes were it is an alternative to the"

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
All the PCR amplicons were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 4 μL DNA was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
As can be seen, the PCR amplification with primers 005, 006, 007 and 008 resulting in Linker-Tn5, Tn5, Tn5-Linker (respective sizes: 1508, 1452 and 1505 bp) were successful. In contradiction with the previous results, the new PCR machine did result in thicker and brighter bands DNA and is therefore considered more efficient for this PCR reaction. From this experiment it can be concluded that the standard PCR conditions work sufficient for this purpose.

Overview
In order to lower down the repeatability rate of codons, we use intelligent optimization algorithm.  We exploit amino acid degeneracy and alternate nucleotides to reduce the repetition rate of bases of TALE DNA sequence. (See Figure 1) Then the optimized TALE sequence will be tested in wet lab to verify our conjecture whether TALE DNA sequence of lower repeatability rate works at higher efficiency.
Figure 1. RNA codon Table
For instance, we may change UUC into UUU to make one of the repeats different from others while the amino acid(PhenylalaninePhe) is identical.
By this way, we use two types of intelligent optimization algorithm to optimize TALE DNA sequence.
Genetic Algorithm(GA)
-Introduction of Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection. The heuristic is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems.[1]
GA has lots of applications in many fields, such as in bioinformatics, using GA to optimize DNA successfully made the sequences have better physic-chemical properties for PCR.
-Our strategy
Initialization
Create a population of hundreds of TALE sequences.
Mutation
Each sequence changes a base randomly under the premise that 1. Amino acids sequence remain unchanged 2. To prevent TALE sequence from being cut, no restriction enzyme site we exploit in experiment is allowed to be created 3. Mutation should not take place on the overhang of each repeat.
Crossover
In GA, crossover is a simulation of the process of synapsis. We randomly choose a point of amino acid, and two sequences exchange their parts from the point we choose to one of the ends.
Figure 2.The process of crossover is a simulation of natural synapsis of chromosome.
Fitness Scoring
We take two main factors into consideration:

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," embryos non-viable, such that they cannot result in a live birth. Huang's research team collected 86 of these non-viable human embryos from a fertility clinic, and these were the cells which were used in the experiment.
Treating the disease: beta-thalassaemia
Huang and his colleagues were looking for ways to cure a hereditary disease called beta-thalassaemia, which is a blood disorder that can prove fatal for some individuals. This disease is caused by the mutation in the HBB gene, which contains coding information for building the oxygen carrier haemoglobin, found in the blood. A mutation in this gene, a mistake in the genetic instruction manual for building haemoglobin, means than an individual with beta-thalassaemia had a reduced capacity to carry oxygen in their blood. As a result, sufferers of the disease described above experience tiredness, shortness of breath and other symptoms associated with a lack of oxygen supply to the organs.
Repairing the instruction manual: CRISPR/Cas9
Huang's research group used an effective, low-cost gene-editing technique called CRISPR/Cas9, which was first put to use in 2013. In this experiment, the CRISPR/Cas9 complex, and other molecules designed to replace the faulty DNA of the HBB gene, were injected into the cell of interest, and subsequently travelled to the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, CRISPR/Cas9 was intended to cut and replace the faulty region of the HBB gene.
Procedure and Results
The team injected 86 embryos with CRISPR/Cas9, along with the other molecules required to replace the faulty DNA. The researchers then waited for 48 hours, by which time the embryos would have grown to roughly 8 cells each. Of the 71 embryos that survived, 53 were genetically tested. This revealed that only 4 of those embryos had seen their HBB gene corrected.
""If you want to do it with normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%"" says Huang, commenting on his results. ""That's why we stopped. We still think it's too immature"". In addition to their low success rate, his team found that CRISPR/Cas9 had caused a surprising number of off-target mutatinos in these cells, something that would have had potentially fatal consequences for a viable embryo. Huang suggests that the abnormal environment of the doubly-fertilised egg cells could have been responsible for the large number of off-target effects caused by CRISPR/Cas9, a case not observed in the experiments using human adult cells"

PBAD Leakage
Leakage was observed for PBAD promoter in DH10B. Although the RPU was relatively higher compared to that of other two strains, DH10B showed leakage at no arabinose  induction. The RPU was around 0.16 for DH10B which is quite significant if we want to have a non-leaky system. For BW25113 and DH5α the leakages were below RPU of 0.1.  The lowest leakage was observed for DH5α. The low leakage in DH5α, once again, could be explained by the additional copy of araC in the genome. The low leakage BW25113,  however, is harder to explain. Nonetheless, if we want a low-leakage system that can reach relatively high RPU upon arabinose induction, out of the three strain we have used,  BW25113 would be the best option.
3-D graphs for DH10B and DH5α
We also tried to produce a 3-D graph. We, however, had some changes from the genetic context that Groningen 2011 used. At 3’ of the PBAD promoter, instead of using BBa_E0840 (GFP generator), we used BBa_E0240 (GFP generator). We also used a  low copy pSB3K3 plasmid as the backbone instead of the high copy pSB1C3. We also could not take measurements every 15 minutes interval because we had to measure the fluorescence at  each time point manually. Fluorescence was instead measured every two hours. Lastly, OD600 was also monitored and graphed (Figure 4. A and B)
Figure 5. Fluorescence and OD600 measurements of DH10B and DH5α induced in different arabinose concentrations.
Triplicate of DH10B and DH5α samples were inoculated in deep well 96 well plate overnight in M9 minimal salt medium.       Arabinose was added to match the final working concentration from 0 to 1.0 % (w/v) with 0.2% increments. Fluorescence and OD600 was measured every       two hours for ten hours.

As Randy says, the problems of the world and the opportunities for our youths are often found in local settings, the potential market of our project as well as the possible application situations may provide new inspirations and valuable input in our project design. By integrating our human practice outcomes with our project, multiple user- or market- oriented modifications were made in the design and the execution of our project. Besides, we also took our effort keeping pace with the policy-making progress and spread our idea to the public. In this page, we are about to describe how our lab-works were integrated with our Human practice activities.

Meeting the users’ demands is always the key of a successful product. Bearing this in mind, with our initial idea in developing miRNA inhibitors, we talked with the potential users of our product to gather their specific needs. Some interesting points that never came into our mind was raised in these interviews. For example, during the talk with Dr. Song Zhuo, the technical director of Genetalks, he talked about a few recently-published papers about cross-talks among different miRNAs. Building on these papers, he highlighted the potential needs of multi-targeting miRNA inhibitors and encouraged us to try crating one. For another example, during our interview with Professor Ping Li, she spoke highly of our dsDNA library based assembly system, and suggested us that a software assisting users to select correct nucleotides from the library might be necessary.
With these constructive suggestions, we adjusted our project design in the following aspects. Firstly, we tried assembling multiple-targeting miRNA inhibitors in"

Science and Technology Week
Science and Technology Week is a large-scale, centralized science popularization campaign organized by University of Science and Technology of China. This year, Science and Technology Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils, high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC and offered visitors a feast of biological knowledge and a chance to cultivate interest in biology. We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens by poster presentation and our explanation, then showed them some basic experiment operations, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We educated and inspired visitors' interest by allowing them to observe biochemical-related sections under a laboratory microscope. In addition,                 we distributed questionnaires to visitors to get their feedback on                 synthetic biology to improve the design of our software.

Student Open Source Conference
Motivation
The Student Open Source Annual Meeting is the first open source technology summit in China that is organized by student organizations. The main theme of the conference is understanding, participating in, and contributing to open source. The conference was held on Jun 9th and Jun 10th, when our thought had been come up with. So we wanted to introduce our thought, as well as our initial achievements to the participants of open source communities and get suggestions from them. To this end, some members of our team registered and attended this conference.
Practices
At the conference, our leader Wang Hao introduced the iGEM competition,  as well as our project - the EDITOR to the audience. Then a member of our team，Chen Lutong, showed the user interface design, functions of the editor and how to achieve them in detail. Finally, the team leader made a summary, listed the advantages of our project, and thought of the future: if there are PHY HUB, CHE HUB, etc., combining them, we will get LAB HUB, which will Facilitate scientific research better.
Integrated into the project
After the conference, we received some feedback from the audience. Based on their suggestions, we made some changes to our project"

Figure 12: Target DNA made from pSB1T3. The target DNA was made by RPA.
We successfully amplified a part of the tetracycline resistance gene from pSB1T3. RPA is thus applicable for amplifying DNA at a constant temperature, even though pipetting and mixing all compounds together might require some practice.
During the RPA reaction, a T7-polymerase binding site can be added to the target DNA by special designed primers. By adding T7-polymerase the DNA can be transcribed into RNA simultaneously.The combined reaction of RPA and T7 polymerase was tested to amplify and transcribe a part of the tetracycline resistance gene present on pSB1T3. First, the DNA was amplified and transcribed into RNA following the RPA+in vitro transcription protocol. We used the primers IG0016 and IG0017 , designed with a T7 promoter tail. The expected RNA product was 145 bp. After purification of the sample ( RNA  isolation ), the sample was checked on an RNA gel. ( RNA electrophoresis ), as can be seen in Figure 13.
Figure 13: Target RNA made from pSB1T3. The target RNA was made by RPA and in vitro transcription at 37 °C.
DNA amplification and in vitro transcription can be combined to obtain the required target RNA. Again, pipetting and mixing all compounds together requires some training, meaning that we need to come up with a solution to reduce the number of pipetting steps.
Combining DNA isolation, amplification and transcription
The next step was to combine the DNA isolation step with the consecutive amplification and transcription step. Therefore, pSB1T3 was transformed into DH5-α and the cells were diluted in milk.
To assess the sensitivity of the boiling method on gram-negative bacteria in milk, we prepared a dilution range of 10-3 up to and including 10-9 in milk. The DNA was isolated following the boiling method protocol.
After amplification and in vitro transcription of the isolated DNA, the RNA was purified and loaded on a gel to check the result (making use of the RPA+in vitro transcription protocol, the RNA  isolation protocol and the RNA electrophoresis protocol). The results can be found in Figure 14.

Relative fluorescent intensity is fluorescence per OD600 standardized with fluorescence per OD600 value of each test group at Time=0, IPTG=0. The promotors we used are from the Anderson collection: BBa_J23100 for strong lacI-LVA expression (pink), BBa_J23110 for medium expression (green), BBa_J23114 for weak expression (orange).
With high level of lacI expression ( BBa_K2558203 ), sfGFP fluorescence had almost no response to IPTG induction. Weak lacI expression ( BBa_K2558205 ) had the most significant IPTG induced sfGFP expression. With medium lacI expression level ( BBa_K2558204 ), the induction efficiency lay in between. Therefore, the result proves that high level of lacI expression severely decreases IPTG induction efficiency [1]. Furthermore, IPTG concentration can affect the regulation part performance. The figure shows that without IPTG the sfGFP florescence intensity remained low. After IPTG addition, fluorescence signal immediately began to climb, forming a peak at five hours after induction, then sfGFP florescence intensity decreased and maintained at a lower level afterwards. IPTG concentration did not significantly affect the height of the peak or the expression level after the peak, but rather the peak width and expression stability of the system. Figures indicate that 5-10 mM IPTG had the most stable induction results.

1. Transform the plasmids into E. coli DH5α.
2. Pick a single colony by a sterile tip from each of the LB plates for all the experimental and control groups. Add the colony into 5ml M9 medium with ampicillin at 100 ng/µl. Incubate for 6-8 h at 37℃ in a shaker.
3. Measure OD600 of the culture medium with photometer. Dilute the culture medium until OD600 reaches 0.6.
4. Add 100 µl bacteria culture medium into a sterile 96-well plate. Add IPTG to final concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 10, 20 mM. Fresh M9 medium serves as blank control. Positive control is colony constantly expressing sfGFP and negative control is colony without sfGFP expression. Place the 96-well plate into an automatic microplate reader. Incubate at 16℃ overnight and record the fluorometric value at 510 nm and OD600 for each well every 30 minutes.

Generation of RFC10 compatible pRS vectors
Mutagenesis of the RFC10 restriction sites and the ApaI restriction site in the backbone of the pRS plasmids were  performed by mutagenesis PCR. Positive clones were screened by restriction analysis with the respective restriction  enzymes ( compare plasmid maps ).
Then, the old multiple cloning site (MCS) was replaced by restriction digest (ApaI, SacI) and subsequent ligation of annealed oligonucleotides containing matching overhangs. Verification of successful replacement of the old MCS  was performed by using a restriction site that was only present in the initial pRS MCS (SalI).
Figure 1: Schematic agarose gel showing the migration pattern of various pRS plasmids incubated with different restriction enzymes.
Figure 2: Restriction analysis of various pRS plasmid constructs.
In figure 1, a schematic agarose gel showing the migration pattern of the three pRS vectors when digested with   different restriction enzymes is depicted. Figure 2 shows the restriction analysis of various pRS plasmid constructs. The used pRS vectors show the expected migration behaviour. Lane 3 in figure 2c shows an additional fragment at around 5 kb which indicates an incomplete digestion of the pRS316 plasmid. In summary, every RFC10 restriction site in the pRS plasmid backbones was removed and the MCS was replaced. Unfortunately, due to time constraints we were not able to insert a terminator.
Analysis of the Dronpa protein
First, Dronpa and NLS-Dronpa were cloned under the control of the pGAL1 promoter and yeast cells were transformed with these constructs. Cells were grown in galactose-containing media and fluorescence levels were determined in the plate reader. Different media were used to resuspend the cells to determine whether this has an effect on the fluorescence levels.
Figure 1: Relative fluorescence units normalised to OD600. Data were obtained from 3 independent biological replicates.
In figure 1 it can be seen that the Dronpa construct-containing cells show a significantly higher fluorescence signal than the wild type cells. In addition to that, cells expressing NLS-Dronpa show a higher fluorescence intensity than the NLS-Dronpa"

Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthesis. Get to Know the Theory.
Abstract
For many years biological scientists knew of only one direction of genomic-information transfer. Accordingly DNA is transcribed into RNA and RNA is translated into proteins. However, for many organisms this simple assumption turned out to be insufficient to explain their ability to post-translationally modify these complex peptide chains. One of the most striking additional possibilities for bacteria, fungi and even plants to synthesize small peptides is the non-ribosomal peptide synthesis pathway (NRPS).
NRPS are modular mega-enzymes assembled from subunits that are affine for a specific peptide monomer. These enzymes catalyze not only the binding reaction between two monomers but can also add secondary modifications to the associated substrate.  Until to now more than 500 different proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic monomers have been found and documented. The consequential assembled small peptide chains often harbor remarkable properties ranging from simple visibility to metal chelating or antibiotic abilities. Even more impressive than the already known wide range of NRPs efficacy is the vast potential of the undiscovered properties that may arise when permuting all these monomers.
Inspired by this idea our team wants to lay the foundation to make this potential accessible to the iGEM community. But first let us have a closer look on the nature of NRPS and learn the basic principles of NRP synthesis.
Even though the ribosome is the molecular machinery mostly used by cells to produce complex polypeptides, bacteria  [1, 2] and fungi  [3, 4] have an additional pathway that synthesizes peptides via non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). The short peptides assembled by NRPS, termed non-ribosomal"

First of all, their tryptophan productivity was measured. For we wanted to know their productivity in our evolution conditions, we didn’t applied the previous fermentation condition (30℃ after IPTG induction for 48h). Oppositely, we applied the conditions that would be applied in our evolution protocol as 37℃ after IPTG induction for 24h. The IPTG application concentration was set as 24mg/L. Results was shown as below.
Figure.14 bitter pressure part function: growth rate against concentration of tryptophan (intracellular tryptophan production)
It was clear that transformation of our engineered bitter pressure parts didn’t significantly influence original strains’ tryptophan relative productivity. Hence, we further tested these three parts’ performance by measuring the growth rate of these nine strains in different tetracycline concentration. For protocol, please refer to our note part. The final results were shown as growth dynamics below.
As shown here, strains carrying our bitter pressure part with RBS B0030 and B0032 showed good tryptophan dependent growth property within the first 15h after culture. Further, as the increase of tetracycline, the selection pressure increased and the growth rate of strains decreased. However, with increased selection pressure, especially for B0032, it could be observed that with time window of about 15h, strains with higher tryptophan overproduction showed much higher growth rate with the growth of tryptophan non producer trp000 nearly inhibited by high concentration of tetracycline. However, it was confused to find that strains trp000 carrying bitter pressure part vector tended to grow beyond this time window. That was hypothesized to be due to the inactivity of tetracycline. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment that. Another obvious phenomenon was such tryptophan dependent growth difference was more significant when IPTG induction was conducted. Thus, according to the result of tryptophan dependent growth, we designed the evolution protocol for tryptophan overproduction strains.

To furthermore simplify the procedures of functional test, we constructed another vector pHT01-mCherry-LacI-PgltAB-Pgrac-TetA-GFP(int) to test the fluorescence intensity instead of mRNA. The results are roughly in accordance with our expectation.
Parts Creation
We constructed 12 standard parts, 1. PgltAB-LacI-Pgrac-TetA (BBa_K2705006); 2. LacI(BBa_K2705001); 3. PgltAB(BBa_K2705000); 4. Pgrac(BBa_K2705002); 5. TetA(BBa_K2705003); 6. GFP(BBa_K2705004) 7. PgltAB-GFP(BBa_K2705005); 8. PliaG&43(BBa_K2705008); 9. PliaG&43-1(BBa_K2705009); 10. PliaG&43-2(BBa_K2705010); 11. PliaG&43-3(BBa_K2705011); 12. TetA(optimized)(BBa_K2705003). The promoter PgltAB, Pgrac, lacI, tetA, and gfp genes are cloned by PCR. Then both these segments and pSB1C3 vector were treated with restriction enzymes. After that, these parts were separately ligated to linear pSB1C3 by ligase or recombinase, and the products were separately transformed into E.coli JM110. Verification PCR was performed to select the positive clones. The positive strains were chosen to be cultured overnight and plasmids were extracted. After restriction enzyme digestion verification, the positive clones were sequenced.
Parts Improvements
We improved 2 parts, BBa_K823000 and BBa_J31006. For BBa_K823000 the weak, constitutive promoter from Bacillus subtilis, we chose to mimic the structure of P43, the relatively strong constitutive promoter which can be recognized by both sigma factor 55 (the major sigma factor A) and sigma factor 37 (the lag phase sigma factor B).

The only living biological material that could escaped from the lab would be our E. coli host for DNA cloning and      parts characterization, and there is little risk associated with their leakage because we are using DH10B as the       major cloning host in which the strain is auxotrophic for leucine, and therefore rendering it unlikely to propagation       outside laboratory environment. The strains of E. coli we use in lab, DH10B and DH5alpha, are also routinely used lab       strains that are innocuous and non-virulent.
Researcher Safety
Tacking risk of organism, only non-virulent part was extracted from genomic DNA of non-virulent S. pneumoniae strain       obtained from Professor Patrick Chiu Yat Woo at Hong Kong University.      For chassis, only Biosafety Level 1 organisms (DH10B and DH5alpha) are dealt in the lab.       All members are trained to deliver safe lab practices. In dealing with toxic chemicals such as DMSO, we wear lab coats      and gloves and execute under fume hood.      All experiments are conducted in a lab premise under authorized supervision.      Risks with handling toxic chemicals, including DMSO, phenol and chloroform,       which include chemical burns and damage to the health of team members in the long run, have been addressed.      We wear lab coats and gloves whenever we handle these chemicals to minimize exposure to these chemicals,       and we carry out bulk management of these chemicals inside a well ventilated fume hood.      Risks associated with UV exposure during gel documentation and excision are also minimized by wearing face shields       and gloves until the UV light is off.
University Safety
Health, Safety & Environment Office (HSEO) is responsible for safety regulations at our institution,       The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKUST.      We, team members, have not directly discussed our project with the director of HSEO but, our supervisors have.      After discussing the risks, we decided to operate only on the genomic DNA of a non-virulent strain of S. pneumoniae and       we are not handling the live bacteria itself.

Today I was able to meet with Dr. Ray Turner from the Department of Biological Sciences. He was very helpful in assessing our project as well as able to tip us off on some of the details and terminology issues that we were having in the project. This would help us present at MIT and answer some of the questions that might arise.

After selecting the appropriate initial value for the three parameters, the results can be obtained quickly. By the fitting of eight groups of data, we found all the right parameters A,B,C to make data points distributing on both sides of the fitted curve and variance is small. If so, it is considered that the eight groups of data conform to the S-shaped curve, and that the image processing above is reliable The fitting results of a particular group are as follows:

Fig 4.4 Fitting results analysis in Matlab
4.3 Estimation and analysis of the rate of experimental bacteria growth
Fig 4.5 Growth rate of E. coli
Fig 4.6 Growth rate of the Bdellovibrio
Specific statistics can be seen in Appendix. The method of calculating the growth rate here is to calculate the difference quotient. It is shown in the figure that there are all downward trends in the growth rate of E. coli and Bdellovibrio. The growth rate rebound in the 30th to 40th hour, which is likely to be affected by the large base of bacteria and the rich surrounding nutrients. In addition, the rebound of E. coli within 20th to 30th hour may be influenced by changes in light intensity in the fourth, five photos( respectively shooting at 19.8 and 23.5 hours). If the plaque is regarded as a single connected area with smooth edge, the radius of curvature of a point can be obtained by the image processing, so the outwardly extending rate in the radius direction at a certain time can also be obtained by solving a quadratic equation.    1.5 Shortcomings and improvements 1. Since the first step of the image processing requires threshold value pictures, therefore the lighting situation, especially in light colors and light intensity, have a significant effect on the results. Accidental illumination changes caused by tiny accidental error can be ignored, but it must be required that the natural light is weak, and the indoor light, camera distance, angle and camera parameters must remain constant at least in the same set of photos, in order to avoid systematic errors. However, we did not notice in the experiments when taking photos, so that the light intensity of the first to the fourth sheets of the third group is significantly different from the ones after the fourth photo. Even though the appropriate processing is performed by changing the binarization threshold, there inevitably exist some small systematic error."

CelloCAD Plasmid Optimization
CelloCAD is a newly created software, allowing plasmid optimization through powerful bioinformatics tools. It was described in 2016 in “Genetic Circuit Design Automation” (Nielsen et al.), and is freely available here
CelloCad takes a genetic construction as an input, and gives as an output the best possible plasmid for this genetic construction.
Our team wanted to work with the Cello software in order to try to optimize our plasmid. Though we may not have the most complex genetic circuit, we were interested in the possible outcomes of such an experiment.
We heard about Cello through one of our advisors, and were immediately appealed by the characterization possibilities of such a software. We wanted to design an enhanced version of our biosensor plasmid, and then compare its properties (detection range, response rapidity…) to the one we designed ourselves.
However, we encountered an issue during the realization of this side-projects: in order for the software to work, we needed to know the RPU (Relative Promoter Unit) of our promoters. This RPU method is fairly recent, and no RPU database currently exists. We therefore wanted to determine by ourselves the RPU for the two promoters used in our biosensor, (Pr and Pu), and maybe add our results as the beginning of a crowdsourced RPU database. In order to perform this experiment,"

The owner of the farm showed us the milking process and told us that the most intensive part of bovine mastitis was disease prevention. Ensuring the cows and their environment were clean is time consuming, but crucial to prevent mastitis. Due to Snofarm's size, antibiotics were a last resort for the owners, and they preferred helping the cow heal on its own.

Vet Dairy Teaching Barn
Ithaca, NY
Shortly after, we visited Cornell's Vet Dairy Teaching Barn. Located close to campus, the Vet Dairy Teaching barn supplies milk and is often used for educational purposes and outreach events. We met with Charles, who showed us the milking process. He informed us about the methods that he uses to prevent and treat bovine mastitis, and showed us the instruments used to inject antibiotics into a cow. After our talk with Charles, we decided that mastitis prevention efforts were more important during the milking period than during the dry period. We saw that during milking, the first bit of milk from the teat is squirted onto the floor as a visual test for bovine mastitis, and decided to create a more sophisticated method for bovine mastitis detection.

Quality Milk Production Services
Ithaca, NY
Dr. Daryl Nydam is the reigning milk quality expert in New York State. He works at the Quality Milk Production Services (QMPS) located on Cornell’s campus, which serves all of New York. The QMPS is world-renowned for its diagnostic services, mastitis prevention programs, and educational assistance. Dr. Nydam gave us information about different types of bovine mastitis-causing pathogens and the bacteriocins that target them. Rare species are worth targeting because a single outbreak can quickly become detrimental. Infection by Gram-negative pathogens is common because they are found in abundance in the milking environment. Gram-positive pathogens are the most virulent and traditionally must be treated with antibiotics. Our wet lab team decided to target a few species in"

Implementation
Cell free extract preparation procedures were based on methods reported in literature previously (Kwon & Jewett, 2015). Cell free extracts were prepared from Escherichia coli BL21 and Bacillus subtilis 168. Cells were streak plated out from glycerol stocks on LB agar (15 mg/mL agar, 10 mg/mL tryptone, 5 mg/mL yeast extract, 0.17 M sodium chloride) and incubated overnight at 37oC. A single colony was used to inoculate 10 mL LB broth (10 mg mL-1 tryptone, 5 mg mL-1 yeast extract, 0.17 M sodium chloride) before shake-incubation at 37oC for approximately 16 hours overnight. 2 mL of overnight liquid culture was used to inoculate 200 mL LB broth in a 2 L flask and shake-incubated at 37oC until late exponential phase was reached (OD600 nm of approximately 2.5 for E. coli BL21 cells). The culture was split in half and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 RPM and 4oC for 20 minutes in pre-weighed falcon tubes. The wet cell pellet weight was determined before storage at -20oC. Cells were defrosted on ice for approximately 1.5 hours and resuspended in approximately 10 mL of ice-cold CFPS wash buffer (60 mM potassium glutamate, 14 mM magnesium glutamate, 10 mM TRIS (pH 8.2 with acetic acid); autoclave sterilised; supplemented with 2 mM DTT immediately before use) per gram of wet cell pellet. Resuspended cells were centrifuged at 4,500 RPM and 4oC for 20 mins. The supernatant was discarded and cell pellets were resuspended and centrifuged in CFPS wash buffer twice more. The washed pellets were then resuspended in 1 mL CFPS wash buffer per gram of wet cell pellet and aliquoted to 1 mL in 2 mL tubes. Cells were lysed by sonication (20% amplitude, cycles of 40 seconds on – 59.9 seconds off, 432.5 Joules) and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 RPM for 10 mins, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80oC.

2.   Take BFP-Hydrophobin fusion protein standardization for instance
We use overlap PCR to get all the fusion protein. The overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (or OE-PCR) is a variant of  PCR . It is also referred to as Splicing by overlap extension / Splicing by overhang extension (SOE) PCR. To splice two DNA molecules, special primers are used at the ends that are to be joined, because of which a linker is added into BFP and hydrophobic protein. When PCR, to splice two DNA molecules, special primers are used at the ends that are to be joined. Once both DNA molecules are extended in such a manner, the overlapping complementary sequences introduced will serve as primers and the two sequences will be fused.
We can use this technique to combine A fragment and B fragment. In first cycle we use a couple of primers of A and the same to B to PCR. By this, we design a same length of base sequence. In second cycle, due to the homologous sequence, when adding the beginning primers and the final primers, A and B can be primers to each other. They extend to a combined fragment.
This image shows how OE-PCR might be utilized to splice two DNA sequences (red and blue). The arrows represent the 3' ends

The laser safety of our project was supervised by Jeremie Capoulade (Head of the microscopy facility of the Department of Bionanoscience).
Safety of our project
For our project we make use of the host organism Escherichia coli, a harmless organism of Risk Group 1. The organism is transformed with a gene to express Silicatein-α, originating from two species of sponges, T. aurantia and S. domuncula. This enzyme will enable an organism to cover itself in a coat of polysilicate. E. coli is only able to produce the enzyme upon transformation of our designed plasmid and after induction with IPTG. Furthermore, our cells are also able to fluoresce after transformation with three different types of fluorescent proteins, GFP, mVenus and mKate. These proteins are expressed constitutively. We also have investigated native E. coli genes that might influence cell shape. The design of our parts is based on several scientific papers and previous iGEM projects.
Since we use genetically modified bacteria that have gained new functions compared to its wildtype, we have to be very careful in following biosafety guidelines. The properties of our bacteria, synthesizing glass and fluorescence, are not directly harmful to humans, but these properties in bacteria haven't been observed in nature before, so we don't know what the effect of these bacteria on the environment could be. Therefore, we are very careful in following strict ML-1 rules to make sure the bacteria stay in our lab, which includes sterilizing waste, washing hands and keeping lab material, such as lab coats, within the lab. The work space is sterilized with ethanol before and after working with our bacteria. We also use some harmful chemicals, such as ethidium bromide, Silicic acid hydrate, Tetraethyl orthosilicate, Rhodamine 123 and Sulphuric acid. These chemicals are handled with care wearing the right protective materials and clothing, following de MSDSs in our research proposal, see the paragraph ‘General lab safety’. Team members with little to none experience with handling GMO’s were under supervision of instructors and team members with at least one year of experience.
For our project we have used the E. coli K-12 strain TOP10 for cloning,  transformation and proliferation of our designed BioBricks. Upon confirmation of the correct cloning of our BioBricks in TOP10 we purified the BioBricks and transformed them into our chassis organism, E"

“It always seems impossible until it is done” - Nelson Mandela.
As a project revolving around Mars and creating habitable areas, we knew that testing our material at Earth conditions would not suffice. The gravity is not the same and humans cannot breathe in the low pressure of Mars' atmosphere, so the pressure inside the buildings needs to be higher than the atmospheric. This leads to a pressure gradient resulting in stress on the material. Using COMSOL® we have simulated these conditions on our final structure using COMSOL® , with material properties measured by ourselves . Secondly, the radiation hitting earth is deflected by the magnetic field and absorbed by the atmosphere, neither of these are very strong on Mars. This could potentially limit the growth, this we have also tested .
1.
Firstly, not many have made building materials from Aspergillus, so we made tests of the material properties of our own bricks. These tests were based on the statistical design of experiments. We then used this data and COMSOL® to simulate the stresses on our structure on Mars. These simulations showed that based on our materials we would need a wall thickness a little over 0.3 m.
hi
Secondly, the radiation levels on Mars are higher, since there is no protective magnetosphere (1). This means that when the bricks are grown, they will have to withstand a constant level of increased radiation, compared to Earth. Growth experiments were conducted, testing the effects of the increased amounts of $\gamma$-radiation, since $\beta$-radiation and $\alpha$"

The optimal concentration of Janus is 200μg/ml.
The optimal concentration of antigens (CEA, AFP and CA15-3) is 2.5μg/ml.
The optimal concentration of antibodies is 5μg/ml.
Figure 1. Hydrophobins sJanus show good effects of antibodies fixing. Here we use antibodies with green fluorescence tag as example. The spots with strong fluorescence represent successful binding between capture antibody (probe) and antigen (tumor marker).
Figure 2. Hydrophobins inJanus tend to show weak fluorescence signal. After compared experiments, we discovered that increasing the incubation time helps to improving detecting sensitivity.
Project Achievements
1. We introduced a new method of protein chip substrate modification by using Janus, and verified its feasibility.
2. We confirmed the optimal concentration of antigens and antibodies in the detection of tumor markers, which helps to save materials to the most extent and keep the reliability of the results at the same time.
3. The experiments were conducted with different kinds of antigens and antibodies, ensuring the universality of the tumor detection chip under a certain range.
Process of Optimization
1. In the beginning, due to our inexperience, the concentration of antigens and antibodies was too high, which leads to excessive strong fluorescence signal intensity.
At first we thought it was caused by the improperly operation of microscope, but after literature reviewing and analyzing, we tried lowering the concentration about four times and achieved good results.
Figure 3. Here is the excessive strong fluorescence signal intensity caused by high concentration.
Figure 4. Good results were achieved after lowering the concentration.
2. In mid-stage, many crystallized structures appeared in the protein spot, and hence influenced the image quality and observation results. To solve this problem, we consulted large quantities of data and information, and discovered a similar case arising when solutions of antibodies and antigens were stored for too long, leading to degeneration. So we reformulated all the solutions we need, and crystallization disappeared. From this we learned that reagents should be used right after they were ready. In this case, another possible cause was that we used TBST in the last washing step, which may also lead to crystallization. In the upper course of experiments we used water instead of TBST.

Japan additionally requires the employers to hold medical check-ups every 6 months for the exposed workers. The legislations of EU, Korea, Canada, Chile and India group biological agents according to the risk they might create. These groups, in turn, determine what safety measures are to be taken in each case.
In Korea, Canada and Chile, the facilities must also be located in an isolated or secluded location. Chile only requires it for biosafety levels 3 and 4. Finally, Korea and India require the existence of a decontamination room between the work area and the outside.
As a consumer, how do I know if a product I want to buy contains GMO?
The legal requirements for disclosing GMOs within food and other products differ across the world. Some countries within the Americas have little to no laws in place regarding GMO labelling. In the USA, there are no official obligations for companies to label any products containing GMOs. The same applies to Canada, unless the food is likely to pose a health or safety risk to consumers, in which case full disclosure of GMOs is mandatory. The Brazilian government, which has until now required companies to label transgenic products with a T symbol, is (as of 2017) currently considering removing this law. Chilean government might be a notable exception as it prohibits the introduction into the market of any products containing GMOs.
In contrast, most of Europe, Asia and Oceania have strict guidelines surrounding labelling of GMO products. The European Union, Australia, India and Indonesia all require the packaging of such products to be bear the label “this product contains genetically modified organisms”, although exceptions do exist in the form of medical products (in the European Union) and foods produced by animals fed with GMO foods (in Australia). Japan and Korea follow a percentage scale, with GMO labelling required if a product contains more than 5% and 1% genetically-modified ingredients respectively.
What are the most important documents related to GMMs?
The documents related to GMM concern a wide range of issues like Manufacturing, Transportation, Safety, Environment, Health, etc.
When it comes to Biosafety, places like European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea, India, and Indonesia clearly have got laws and regulations concerning biosafety and documents are supposed to be submitted in this regard.

SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the treatment cycle of acid lowering is very long, most patients stop taking medicine when they are not painful, so the treatment effect is difficult to achieve. At the same time, doctors tend to advise patients to control their diet and try to eat less-purine food, but patients are often unwilling to adhere to the doctor’s advice, causing the poor acid lowering effects. In addition, there is controversy over whether to use drugs on patients with hyperuricemia but without gout symptoms. On the one hand, the clinical endocrine guidelines are very strict and long-term hyperuricemia is bound to damage the body, so medication should be used; But on the other hand, if there is no symptom, it is very difficult for the patient to insist on taking medicine, and the drug is bound to cause certain damage to the body, so it is very difficult to solve this controversy. All of it give us with a very full clinical background, and we found out our project can provide a better solution to the above problems, which gives us great confidence. Because the colonization time of the bacteria is up to two weeks theoretically, it will reduce the number of taking medicine and improve the compliance of patients; Intestinal colonization can also reduce the degree of patient's dietary control, thereby reducing patient’s pain and improving their compliance; In addition, the intestinal colonization of engineering bacteria is different from the medication, it can solve the clinical controversy over whether to use drugs on patients with hyperuricemia but without gout symptoms.
We also inquired into the clinical treatment of refractory gout. Doctors said that there were indeed some clinically refractory gout patients with bad symptoms and even requiring dialysis, which allowed us to find the application objects for dialysis part project.
After that, we briefly introduced two parts of our project - the intestinal part and the dialysis part, and asked the doctors for their advices and suggestions. As for the intestinal part, the doctors agreed that our ideas were novel and feasible. Because the intestinal tract has always been a clinically neglected way to excrete uric acid, and if it is fully utilized, it must be a good method to reduce blood uric acid concentration. As for the dialysis part, there were differences among the teachers' opinions. Some doctors thought that this idea was radical, the effect was unknown, and there may be immune safety problems. The scope of clinical use was too small, it was better to concentrate on the intestinal part of the subject and make it better. There were also some doctors who believed that this was a new therapeutic strategy that was worth trying. It may be a"

Student Engagement
Science fairs and work experience students
Big Bang South West
The Big Bang South West Science Fair was one of the first places we tested BioMech. Our stall at the fair focussed on introducing students and teachers to synthetic biology and gathering information on how people perceive the field. Students were aged between 8 and 18, and there were teachers from a large variety of schools from across the South West.
For the fair, we wanted to show visitors the interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology. We discussed how physics, chemistry, biology and engineering make up synthetic biology and demonstrated multiple applications within each of the core sciences. We created two leaflets: one which explained the basics of synthetic biology, and one which explained the iGEM competition. We made two companion powerpoint presentations to the leaflets which went in more depth, and played them on loop on two iPads on the stand. As well as this, we premiered a very basic form of our educational synthetic biology board game, for students and teachers try out. One student told us:
BioMech is more fun than the card games I played at a  card game convention in Birmingham
BioMech was well received by children of all ages, with the younger ones particularly enjoying the simplicity of the game and the clean aesthetics, whilst the older ones took a great interest in the descriptions of all the components as well as the mechanics the game offers. The fair provided us with some honest feedback from the children on our board game that we then kept in mind when designing our final version of the now highly user friendly and interactive version of BioMech.
We also drew inspiration from the ‘Activities Booklet’ created by the William and Mary iGEM 2015 team. The sweetie DNA construction activity proved incredibly popular amongst the younger students and gave us an opportunity to talk to them about basic genetics as well as some synthetic biology ideas.

DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gels see    the following protocol .
Figure 4. DNA electrophoresis of colony PCR for the key sequence in     pDR111. Sample 5,6,7 and 9 show the correct size of     504 bp.
Conclusion:
Transformation of pDR111+key into E. coli Top10 appeared to be    successful. The samples 5, 6, 7 and 9 showed the right size of band in    the colony PCR. These samples were used to obtain the plasmid from an overnight culture.
Validation
Experiment:
02/09/16: Grown cultures of E. coli Top10 with pDR111+key were used to    obtain a glycerol stocks and plasmid isolation was performed (QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit) . Firstly, concentration of the plasmids obtained was    measured on Nanodrop. Secondly, plasmids were sent for sequencing and    then stored at -20°C.
Sequencing:
Plasmids pDR111+key from colonies 5, 6, 7 and 9 were sent for sequencing with the sequencing primer F message    sequencing (see primer list) .
Conclusion:
Sequencing results showed that cloning of message sequence into the    integration plasmid pDR111 was successful. Sample 5, 6 and 9 show a    100% homology, so the key was successfully cloned into the pDR111    plasmid. See sequencing results in Figure 5.

The iGEM team Groningen 2016 worked on bioencryption in order to safely store data in DNA. In our project we were mainly working with two sequences of DNA which were the encrypted message sequence and the encryption key sequence. The key sequence was created by our software. It is therefore artificial DNA. We ordered the encryption key sequence as gBlock from IDT (Integrated DNA technologies). To submit our key sequence as BioBrick ("

Phillip's notes
Introduction:  Today, the primers for PCquad should be checked by a more experienced primer designer, and amplifying and sequencing primers should also be made.  The clones from Yeate’s lab will also be picked up.  Lastly, preparation for the journal presentation on PCR will be done with Nithin and Tyler.
Notes from Fasih: Design amplifying primers for the gBlock itself.  It says the yield you ought to get is 1 ug, so you should get 100uL at a 10ng/ul concentration, which is great for PCR, but it wouldn’t hurt to have amplfying primers ready for emergencies Check the secondary structure on Benchling to avoid primer dimer or loops.
The cage was picked up from Dr. Yeates. The BL21 (DE3) strain is ampicillin resistant.
Designing of primers: Some notes on primer design: http://www.premierbiosoft.com/tech_notes/PCR_Primer_Design.html Potentially do two rounds of PCR to add the ends we need. Vinson suggested to use q5 polymerase Removed atg at start of PCquad
Conclusions:  Due to the seemingly extensive amount of secondary structure, the primers will be worked on next week, with some feedback.  Ideally, the order will go out some time mid next week."

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#HumanPractice#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html,"KIT). During our visit we were shown the institutes's bioreactors and Prof. Posten gave us an idea of how a symbiosis between plant and technology can look like. In the past his group worked on a collaboration project with Prof. Dr. Reski (see our Advisery Board ) on biological process engineering for Physcomitrella patens. As part of this discussion we figured out several important parameters to control and possible problems to solve in order to successfully implement our PhyscoFilter.

10) Visiting the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2013
On our road trip we also spent an evening with the iGEM team Heidelberg 2013 . At first they told us that they were too busy with experiments but in the end they found 3 team members who showed us their lab and the gorgeous city of Heidelberg. Thank you a lot and see you in Boston!
11) Expert box: Bestmann Green Systems (near Hamburg)
Figure 14:
Bestmann Green Systems is an engineering company which offers commercial solutions for embedding vegetation in aquatic ecosystems. As this is a major point of our implementation project we also talked to this company (because of the actual distance a visit was not possible). This company also sells swimming raft devices which allow the cultivation of plants on free water. This technology was highly interesting also for our business model in which Bestmann Green Systems could be a potential collaboration partner.
12) Discussion of our Project with Dr. Christoph Then from Testbiotech
Dr. Christoph Then is a recognized expert on risk assesment in the biotechnological field and the CEO of  the Testbiotech registered association . Amongst many other engagements, he has worked as an expert advisor on agriculture and genetic engineering for the Green Party in the Bavarian Landtag (legislative assembly in a German state) and as expert for Greenpeace on agriculture, genetic engineering and consumer affairs. Since our iGEM project deals with Green Biotechnology and since our various implementation ideas include biosafety and GMO release aspects, he was the ideal expert to talk to. We had a very productive and interesting discussion that helped us get a much clearer picture on these aspects as well as on the regulations of GMO authorisation.

Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Restriction Enzyme_-_-_TEXT.html," simple observation under a fluorescence viewer, we have seen that the addition of 1% L-Rhamnose leads to a significant expression of RFP after 10hours. The negative controls, where no Rhamnose was added, or when the promoter was repressed by Glucose, did not show any visible fluorescence.  Both photos are taken after we centrifuged a culture of NEB Turbo strain with transformed plasmid. For the fluorescent result, the same tubes were photographed under excitation light (540nm), through an emission filter (590nm).
E.Coli The left tube: cells were grown without L-rhamnose. The right tube: cells are grown in the present of 1% of L-rhamnose.
E.Coli The right tube which was induced by L-rhamnose expresses RFP, while the left tube where we didn't add it, has no visible expression.
We quantified this result in a plate reader.
Quantification of the fluorescence after 10h of growth
Next, we characterized the pRha promoter using a plate reader. We used different concentrations of L-Rhamnose (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5% and 1%) and observed the resulting fluorescence over time. As negative controls, we used the non-induced cells, as well as cells repressed by 1% Glucose.
Characterization of the pRha promoter using a plate reader
As we can see from the graph above, pRha promoter works as expected and it could be well tuned by concentration of L-rhamnose.

The iGEM Team from Virginia created a survey about synthetic biology which was also to be conducted by teams from other parts of the world. Therefore, we translated the survey into German and conducted it at our university’s open house. The survey dealt with the public awareness towards and acceptance of synthetic biology and the aim was to get an impression of how people from all ages, origins and professions think about this. We do not know the results yet, but we still hope we could make a contribution for this survey to become more representative with regard to the control sample.

We have fulfilled all medal criteria for Bronze, Silver and Gold. Please find details below.
Bronze Requirements (6/6)
Our team was successfully registered.
The judging form was completed.
We created our own Wiki.
We are excited to present our poster and project talk at the Giant Jamboree.
The different work of our project was attributed on the respective wiki page.
We submitted K1585320 among several other new BioBricks to the iGEM registry.
Silver Requirements (3/3)
We characterized K1585210 as part of the implementation of the MCC in E. coli and beyond that multiple successful gene knockouts.
This part was submitted to the registry.
Looking beyond our own lab work, we pursued an open dialogue about the chances and risks of community labs in Germany with Team Darmstadt, the Technik Garage and the Waag Society. We also discussed this subject at a symposium at our university. In order to help community labs with their organization, we had tubefront tested and valued it as a suitable software for that matter.
Gold Requirements (4/2)
On top of the aspects of mentioned in the Silver Medal Requirement, our team engaged in innovative human practices activities by starting of an educational advance following the principle of ""teach the teacher"" . Thereby, we provided teachers and community labs with materials for school experiments and worked out a possible interdisciplinary lesson based on our DIY bioreactor.
We demonstrated a functional prototype of glycogen accumulation systems, combining a functional operon with successful gene knockouts. We were the first to use CRISPR/Cas9 at our institute.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html,"Team:TUDelft/Main-Measurement
One of the main aims within our project was to develop a detection method to detect the presence of specific RNA sequences without the use of any complicated laboratory equipment. Furthermore, this method should be cheap and widely available to everyone. We indeed succeeded in developing such a method and this page is dedicated to describe how this novel measurement method was implemented in our project. It is based on structures called 'coacervates'.
Coacervates are polymer-rich regions in solutions of mutually attractive polymers. The process of mutually attractive polymers phase-separating into a polymer-rich and polymer-poor phase is known as coacervation. This process can under some circumstances be observed by the naked eye, as coacervates generally cause solutions to be more turbid. A key physical property of coacervates is that they require polymers of a certain length to form. In general, only polymers that are ‘long enough’ form coacervates.
Figure 1: Schematic description of coacervation. Long, mutually attractive polymers can phase separate into dense, polymer-rich regions known as coacervates, and a polymer-poor region consisting of the solvent.
The underlying reason for this can be explained theoretically and experimentally . These latter facts directly imply that (changes in) polymer length can be visualized to the naked eye, which we utilized to design a novel detection method coined CINDY Seq . However, as we will argue in greater detail below, the method has potential to serve as a far broader method to characterize existing and future BioBricks, and the activity of many enzymes that show synthesis or degradation of any (coacervating) polymer.
The coacervation method in our project
In our project we developed the Coacervate Inducing Nucleotide Detection of Your Sequence (CINDY Seq) method for visualizing the activity of Cas13a into a readout visible to the naked eye. When Cas13a binds to its RNA target, it undergoes a conformational change and engages in a state of collateral cleavage. In this state, it non-specifically cleaves the RNA it encounters ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ; Gootenberg et al. 2017 ; Liu et al. 2017 ). Long sequences of RNA have been demonstrated to form coacervates visible to the naked eye with spermine ( Aumiller et al. 2016 ). The RNA sequences will likewise be cleaved by the activated Cas13a. After cleavage, the previously long ‘"
