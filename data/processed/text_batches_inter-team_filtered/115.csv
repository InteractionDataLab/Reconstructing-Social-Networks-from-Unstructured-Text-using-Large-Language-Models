On a wider aspect train ourselves to look at general situations from different points of view. To begin our future plans we booked an appointment with Assoc. Prof. Dr. Sinan Canan who is greatly popular with his captivating conferences such as [N]Brain. We discussed our ideas and noted his advises and was honoured upon his offer of collaborating with him on our next conference.
SynArt
100 years ago our ancestors invented laboratories to ease the observation of creation; to enhance our knowledge and develop for the better so a new renascence began. Today, SynArt may introduce a second renascence where science will work together as one wit art. ATOMS Turkiye believe that laboratories may be unsatisfactory to fathom creation itself. For this reason, SynArt will allow us to perceive synthetic biology from an artist’s standpoint. In order to take the first step, we contacted the other European iGEM teams and invited them to send their valuable artworks for the 2-day SynArt exhibition that was held in our university. We asked what the viewers’ interpretations were and their choice of favourite.

SynSafe
We aim to transfer the outcomes attained in laboratories to our daily lives by implementing it on a larger scale and alterations of organisms whether genetical or epigenetical is one way to do this. However this is not always possible as we cannot predict how an altered organism will adapt to the natural environment and what it’s effects on the ecosystem will be. Hence, safety and security occupy a great space of importance when it comes to devising projects for iGEM; risks must be lowered at a maximal level.
‘Two heads are better than one’ is the best saying to depict our approach on safety.  This year, we read the abstracts and e-mailed most European iGEM teams to question and discuss the safety of their projects. Scroll down to view the answers of Grenoble-EMSE-LSU and METU-Turkey. Besides collaborating, we tried to increase each teams safety by preparing them for the obvious that can be questioned. With the support of iGEM, our aim is to form a biosafety congress in the future years because synthetic biology is like a potential limitless world source to anything that can be imagined by us. If Synthetic Biology is used for the right purposes then it  serves possibilities from"

Anthony Vuong, that is my full name. I am brother to the one with the same surname (Ben). Majoring in Biology; the University of Lethbridge I am attending. This will be my fourth year—oh my, so near the ending. Also, this is my second year iGEMing. A single beer is all it takes for a crimson glow to grace my face. A common problem, they do say, for the people of my race. For me, it is a bother, though not one for my younger brother. Is it ironic that “Red” is my favourite colour? Some may say I have a unique sense of fashion. Though shy I once was, not one for social interaction. But now, others shout “Eccentric” whilst smirking at my actions. A lion’s head, I may embellish in a dance of which I do so relish—a musical exhibition originating from the Chinese tradition (Chinese Lion Dance).

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," does not currently exist in the organism, it is possible to convert ergosterol to progesterone. We searched through research articles and found the work of Duport et al. from 1998 in which they outlined the possible pathway to convert ergosterol to progesterone using five genes [12] . The first gene is for the enzyme ∆7-sterol reductase (∆7Red), isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana, which reduces ergosterol to ergosta-5-enol and ergosta-5,22-dienol [13] . The next gene encodes for bovine side-chain cleavage cytochrome (P450scc), which converts ergosta-5-enol and ergosta-5,22-dienol to pregnenolone. P450scc requires the assistance of bovine ferredoxin-1 (FDX1) as an electron carrier, and adrenodoxin reductase (ADR) to reduce FDX1. The final gene is type II human 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) that converts pregnenolone to progesterone [14,15] . See the complete pathway to progesterone biosynthesis in Y. lipolytica below in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Progesterone biosynthesis pathway optimized for use in yeast. Design idea came directly from Duport et al., and genes for enzymes and electron carriers were codon optimized for use in Y. lipolytica [12] .
We found the sequences for each gene from either KEGG or UniProt and codon optimized them for Y. lipolytica using the DNA works system from the High-Performance Computing at the NIH website [10, 16] .
PROMOTER & TERMINATOR
Once we had constructed the pathway we wanted to use, we needed to choose a promoter and terminator. A favorable promoter or terminator is short in length with high levels of expression. We designed the genes in the biosynthesis pathway to function monocistronically, where each gene possesses its own promoter and terminator.
Promoter
Initially, we considered a galactose-inducible promoter, GAL10, to control the expression of the progesterone gene cassette. However, the presence of glucose represses GAL10 via the MIG1 binding site, and we wanted our yeast strain to be able to produce progesterone when grown on a variety of substrates, including glucose. To use this promoter, we would have to modify the MIG1 binding site for the"

I am exploring the emergence of synthetic biology in India, and it was a great honour that iGEM IIT Delhi team invited and welcomed me. As a sociologist of science, it had been a great learning experience for me to observe the way a group of young people took up this new mode of knowledge construction. Their passion, perseverance and never give up attitude - given the lack of resources they face - enriched my own work in multiple ways and proved out as an excellent site for a STS scholar.

2. Cell measurement protocol
We        were provided with six different devices (Test device 1 - BBa_J364000 ,        Test device 2 - BBa_J364001 ,        Test device 3 - BBa_J364002 ,        Test device 4 - BBa_J364007 ,        Test device 5 - BBa_J364008 ,        Test device 6 - BBa_J364009 ) along with negative ( BBa_R0040 ) and positive        ( BBa_I20270 ) controls which then we transformed into E.        coli DH5α strain. Devices express GFP under Anderson promoters of different        strength and are in the pSB1C3 backbone which carries resistance to        chloramphenicol.
We        made overnight cultures of two colonies of each transformation plate.        The next day, the cultures were diluted to OD600=0.02        and grown for 6 hours. The absorbance (600 nm) (Fig. 3A) and        fluorescence (485/520, gain = 50) (Fig. 3B) of cultures were measured        at 0 and 6 hours.
Figure 3. Average absorbance (A) and fluorescence (B) measurements of the 2 colonies and 4 replicates for each         sample, taken after 6 hours of growth.
The        negative control demonstrates the highest absorbance which could be        the result of the lowest metabolic load of all the devices, since it        has no GFP expressed. On the other hand, devices 1, 4 and 5 show much        slower bacteria growth even though the fluorescence of these devices        is not the highest. Furthermore, device 1 demonstrates a really        moderate absorbance and fluorescence increase after 6 hours        suggesting that environmental factors could have impeded sample        growth.
Next,        the previous data (absorbance and fluorescence) was normalized to the        comparable OD units (Fig. 4A) and then to particles (Fig. 4B) so that we could        determine the mean expression level of GFP per cell.
Figure 4. Normalization of fluorescence to the OD units (A) and MFEL per particle (B).
After        6 hours all the devices (except the negative control) demonstrates a        relatively decreased level of fluorescence. That could be explained        by cells reaching a certain level of GFP expression after which the        fluorescence stops increasing whereas absorption steadily goes up.

Lethbridge_HS,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", and scalpels. Currents methods used to destroy biofilms include antibiotics and biocides. These methods are often expensive, harsh, and ineffective; biofilms are notorious for developing resistance to chemical treatments. Instead of trying to kill the bacteria in the biofilm, we decided to degrade the matrix that protects it. We have created a cocktail of Nuclease and Dextranase to achieve this purpose. Once the matrix is degraded, the bacteria inside can be eliminated without the use of expensive chemicals.  What is nuclease? What is dextranase? As mentioned earlier, one of the two targets for dispersing the biofilm is its extracellular DNA. To do so, we are using E.coli to secrete nuclease. A nuclease is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds of nucleic acids. More specifically, the nuclease utilized by our team is a Micrococcal nuclease (Mnase) capable of cleaving single-stranded and double-stranded nucleic acids. The irony of the situation being that the nuclease bio brick (Part: BBa_K729004) being used is derived from Staphylococcus aureus.  S. aureus biofilms are a major problem on medical equipment, and account for many infections. The S. aureus biofilm uses the Mnase for partial dispersal of its outer layer, so its inner colonies can spread outside and grow more biofilms. S aureus. Being a gram positive, ubiquitous bacteria, has one of the toughest biofilms. And hence, the strength of the Mnase is equally supplementary. Although the Mnase is derived from S. aureus, the function and the effect of the enzyme is not limited to that bacteria. Since extracellular DNA is component of almost every biofilm, the effect of the enzyme will not be affected by a change in the species/strain of bacteria. To further enhance the effects of Mnase, it will be applied in a mixture that also includes Dextranase. Dextranase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of bonds within dextran. Dextran is a component of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix, common to many biofilms. The dextranase used for the construct, is an alpha-dextranase derived from Chaetomium gracile (a dematiaceous mold from the fungi family). Dextranase, by degrading parts of the EPS matrix would allow for Mnase to further seep into"

Adhesion
Adhesion to Streptococcus pneumoniae
Three peptides were shown to bind to S. pneumoniae when fused to a maltose binding protein. Anchors to the B. subtilis cell wall are still in work.
Binding of the peptides C4P, CSP and A5P to S. pneumoniae cells was evaluated with the results strongly indicating the adhesion. Our BioBricks BBa_K1351001 , BBa_K1351002 and BBa_K1351003 thus can serve as a helpful tool for biomedical applications targeting S. pneumoniae.

Ecf41 provides a delayed expression
A delayed expression can be achieved by wiring the ecf σ factor σecf41 BBa_K823043 and its target promoter PydfG BBa_K823041 between the input promoter and the output.
The SdpI BioBrick can rescue ∆sdpI B. subtilis mutant strains
Induceable SdpI BBa_K1351017 production leads to higher resistance against the antimicrobial peptide SdpC.
The sdpI-antisense RNA shows no impact regarding accelerated degradation
In B. subtilis W168 cells the expression of the sdpI-antisense RNA did not show any impact on cell vitality.

This year, the theme of our Human Practices endeavors was altering public perception of genetic engineering. In addition to acquiring input from established academics and leaders in industry regarding the laboratory component of the project, we decided to write an investigative journalism piece on the attitudes people have towards science, and host workshops for high school students by partnering with Geering Up, a local non-profit organization.  To best convey what we gained from our interviews, we adapted and used the AREA framework as described by the University of Exeter :

KENT CHEN
Masters student working with Bally Lab on the relationships between flavonoids and cancer growth.
A: When meeting with Kent we anticipated to receive advice about troubleshooting our project and building on what Dr. Yadav mentioned to us. We provided the graduate student with our previous work and researched his background which was working with flavonoids and using it for cancer research. Thus, we were anticipating to receive a great sum of knowledge on perfecting our project.
R: The meeting was informative and positive though not necessarily helpful directly to troubleshoot. However, in the Human Practices team, it was deemed very helpful because we learned a lot about other aspects the project could pertain to.
E: Kent Chen explained to us that flavonoids are a natural product industry, is anti-inflammatory and has varying amount of hydroxyl group thus affecting its efficacy of producing its function fully. He gave us advice on understanding the process of turning a compound into a marketable drug as we could test in tissue culture against cell line and see if it is potent then proceed do it in-vivo and put it in clinical trial. Additionally, we were informed more about flavonoids and how usually when produced industrially it is from plant extracts. We were also given basic information about the anti-inflammatory molecule of flavonoids itself and how adding liposomes help make the drug more ingestible. As well, Kent Chen told us about how E. coli can export and uptake flavon"

Some Feedbacks
“In CORE Design the safety level of a circuit can be seen, it’s considerate. However, when searching for a genetic circuit, the results should be able to be filtered by safety level.”
(It is a good suggestion!)
“CORE Bank should provide the chance for users to edit the information on the genetic design. However, I like CORE Bank, and it just like GitHub!”
(It is also a good suggestion! However, just like the wiki of one team should not be edited by other team, the record of one genetic design should be original. In CORE Bank, the record of one genetic circuit can be retrieved by other users, and after modifications and improvements, the users can upload another new record.)
“Q & A (in Co-development) can have different topics for users to discuss. Anyway, it’s good to provide a platform for communication in the community.”
Inspirations
For a dry-lab practitioner (a bioinformatician), Ma is more interested in the “Hub”. The idea of adopting the features of “GitHub” and applying them to Synbio is a try. To stand the test of time, the “Hub” should make collaboration and open design a routine to synthetic biologists and iGEMers. Ma is a student in bioinformatics and seldom constructs genetic circuits in vitro (wet-lab practices) or in silico, but CORE can to some extent help him with his research: maybe he could find some research topics in the Co-development that he can use his knowledge of bioinformatics to solve, and a collaboration result!

(But it is not only for Q & A.)
“CORE Bank. I can more easily find a genetic circuit.”
Inspirations
For a wet-lab practitioner, he or she would find CORE Design most useful. CORE Design provide a more powerful protocol management and experiment scheduling functions. In addition, he or she might think that a Q & A platform is helpful when they encounter troubles in the experiment. In general, wet-lab practitioners deal"

Prior to any use of a GMM, a business must first obtain a licence from the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator. This process involves providing detailed information about the host, donor, transferred DNA, properties of the GMM and where it will be grown. A formal risk assessment is then carried out by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator who then make a decision as to whether a licence will be granted.
In order to use a GMM in your business, one needs to fulfill numerous requirements. The development of any GMM must be monitored by the CTNBio and the regulatory agencies. If your company is going to start working with GMM, the first step is getting the Certified of Biosafety by CTNBio and create an internal committee of biosafety. Then, you need the approval by the regulatory agency (e.g. Anvisa for human purposes and the MAPA for agriculture purposes). You are going to need to fulfill a lot of requirements in order to get the registry and the permission to develop your research in your lab.
For agriculture purposes, once you have finished your research inside the lab, the CTNBio will evaluate it and emit a position paper that will allow you to do a planned and controlled release. To do that, you are going to need to fulfill the requirements of the Normative Resolution n. 6 of November 6th, 2008.
For medical purposes, once you finished your research inside the lab, you are going to need to ask Anvisa for a registry of biological medication and you are going to need to fulfill all of the requirements stared in the Resolution n. 55 of December 16th, 2010.
Once your product is registered and approved by CTNBio and MAPA or Anvisa, you will be able to release and/or commercialise it.
It is forbidden to commercialise GMOs, the only way to establish a business with them is to export seeds. This is only allowed once an environmental impact study regulated by the National Service of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) has been undertaken.
Approval process for commercial release of GMOs:
1. Initially, the company developing the GMOs undertakes several biosafety assessments including, environmental, food, and feed safety assessments in containment.
2. This is followed by Bio-safety Research Trials which require prior approval of the regulators, the GEAC and the RCGM.

What we did
Short description of our work, our results and our supporters
The creation of certain constructs was necessary for our two systems for cell selection by means of apoptosis: “Cut’N’Survive” and “Jump-Or-Die”. We searched for sources of the DNA sequences we needed and found several supporters which are listed below.
Most genes and promoters were amplificated via PCR with overhang-primers with the BioBrick prefix or suffix. If the sequence contained a EcoR1-, Pst1-, Xba1-, Spe1- or Not1- restriction site, we used mutagenesis primers and fusioned both DNA parts by fusion PCR. All PCRs worked out, even the fusion PCRs.
The length of the PCR products were tested by agarose gel electrophoresis. We tried to sequence our PCR products, but obtained poor results and resorted to sequencing the plasmids.
In parallel, we made competent cells and multiplied ccdB (death gene)-vectors with different antibiotic resistances. All components were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The samples were cleaned with a PCR clean up kit or dephosphorylated to reduce false ligations.
We ligated our constructs and several interim stages with the 3A-assembly according to our schedule. The ligations were transformed to E.coli DH5α strains and selected by antibiotics. Afterwards, some colonies were picked and we tested the insertion of the construct by colony PCR.
If the colony PCR resulted in bands of the right size, we extracted the plasmids from overnight cultures and sequenced the samples with forward and reverse BioBrick primers.
Unfortunately, not all BioBricks were cloned succesfully. However, we were able to produce 4 BioBricks, one of which represents a full construct while the other three are intermediates. The system wasn't completed on time, so we weren´t able to test them in eukarytic cell lines.
The protocols we used are listed here: Protocols

Introduction
Since the earliest stages, we have decided to explore an entrepreneurial side of our project and not only present it in the Giant Jamboree but also try to prepare it for the the market. We put an effort into clearing a market demand for our system by consulting with our sponsors and other professionals while in the same time establishing a potential customer network. Also, to protect our idea for the future implementation, we have submitted a patent application covering our solution and prepared a short guide on what the future iGEM teams should take into account in order to protect their intellectual property. Lastly, we have covered important factors and indicators that will help to turn our project into business.
Market demand
Using enzymes for compound synthesis has great advantages over chemical synthesis, such as shorter synthesis routes, reduced waste and high product yields. Moreover, enzymes are biodegradable and thus are a better alternative considering ecological aspect.
Yet, each unique enzyme takes years to develop, while the industry demand for biocatalysts is growing at a rapid pace. Numerous amino acid combinations form enzymes, but only a handful of them can transform a given substrate into the required product.
For example, after pharmaceutical company fully develops a particular drug, it takes an average of two additional years to develop the enzyme(s) that can facilitate synthesis of such molecule. And even advanced screening technologies and protein evolution cannot fully satisfy these market needs.
The enzyme industry has experienced significant growth due to the global growing demand for cleaner and greener technology, according to 2017 BCC Research. Moreover, the global market for industrial enzymes is expected to grow from nearly $5.0 billion in 2016 to $6.3 billion in 2021. Provided there is an increasing demand for enzymes in global market, it is safe to say there is also an increasing demand for protein engineering solutions"

Funding for diagnostics is not centralized as is for vaccines. Due to the low-profit margins for the developers, funding can become a problem
When talking about diagnostics specifically, an additional financial hurdle is present: they have to be developed by third-party manufacturers who often want to make profit while keeping the price per diagnostic low and affordable. As was mentioned by MSF laboratory advisor Erwan Piriou:
95% of all malaria diagnostics, a tool that has proven to be extremely useful, are developed by only two companies worldwide. Since these diagnostics have to be affordable, prices have been going down for years, and so has the profit of the manufacturers.
These manufacturers have been threatening to stop production if prices are forced down even more by the NGO’s, as they can not survive on the low profit margins.
Case: HAT in Congo
In the last decade the world's healthcare policy was focussed on the major infectious diseases HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, resulting in allocation of the funding for the goal of controlling these diseases [1]. Relatively unknown neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), like HAT, have been overlooked in financial support, partly due to their non-changing situation and seemingly low direct impact on population. Even though these NTDs are also in great need for funding, improving their situations is often more cost-effective and has added health benefits for the local society [2].
To support the efforts of tackling smaller, lesser known diseases, multiple NGOs have been established, often focussing on only a few diseases at a time. They play an important role in securing funding, setting up healthcare infrastructures, communicating with governments and evoking global interest in the diseases.
When prevention of a second outbreak is the goal of the diagnostic, the difficulty lies in funding. Preventing recurrence comes down to screening in the field with said diagnostic, where mobile teams are then sent into the field to perform active case testing. Every year after the epidemic the mobile teams are sent to test villages poulations. If no case is found in 5 years after the last case, the mobile teams become active only once every three years.
To overcome the funding problem, the WHO is setting up a list of Essential Diagnostics that should help maintain funding [3].
Case: Zika in Brazil
Since the beginning of the 21st century, media coverage has proven to be an increasingly important factor in the attraction of funding for controlling infectious diseases. Recent outbreaks such as SARS, ebola and Zika have received more attention than similar diseases have a few decades ago.

After 1h of regeneration time the electroporation mixes were diluted by a factor 1:10 and 1:100 and streaked out on previously prepared LB-agar-plates with chloramphenicol since the transport vector brings a chloramphenicol resistance marker with it. Multiple colonies of those plates were then grown in ONCs and the plasmid was isolated with a miniprep from promega. Then a PCR to amplify the insert with the following specs was prepared:
To check the results of this PCR, an agarose gel electrophoresis was ran (Fig. 2.2). The findings showed that one of our biobricks (tesA mutated) was completed successfully. The second Biobrick however (atfA optimized) did not assemble correctly since it was not possible to amplify the insert with the PCR. To get this second biobrick, all steps since the ligation were repeated with leftover ligation mix yielding the wanted results.
It is to note that simultaneously all biobrick assembly steps were ran again, to save time in case something went wrong with the assembly although ultimately not needed.
The correct plasmids (about 250ng) were then filled into their respective wells on the submission plate and dried with a SpeedVac concentrator without its rotor.
Characterization
For characterization of the biobricks some of the positive tesA and atfA clones were used to inoculate ONCs and later on for main cultures. After determination of the OD600 the culture was split into equal parts and used for lipid extraction. For the extraction the method invented by Folch was used.
For identification the formation of Triacylglycerides, the measurement of the fatty acid composition and for purification a thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed.
The fatty acid spots were scratched of the TLC plate and converted into fatty acid methyl ester. This methyl ester were analyzed by gas chromatography to identify the fatty acid composition.
Fig.2.3: GC-FID of the E.Coli strain with the mutated tesA in comparison to the wild type - the curves have been added into the same diagram with a slight shift on the x-axis for the tesA containing sample for comparison purposes
The addition of the mutated tesA gene via plasmid resulted in an upregulation of the tesA functions and therefore more fatty acids were produced in general. It is also a peak visible in the area were C14:0 is to be expected, giving us strong indication that the mutated tesA gene is fulfilling its purpose. For further evidence, the wild type"

FluoSafe: acrylamide sensor
This year Warsaw iGEM team is presenting to you FluoSafe - a bacterial sensor for acrylamide detection. As many of you know acrylamide is usually present in biochemical laboratories. But what is the significance of this organic compound really? Well, it is a neurotoxin and its carcinogenic activity has been widely proven.
French fries
Not only is it present in our work environment but also in our food. You might think that if something is not mentioned on the food label it means that that substance cannot be found in what you eat. Well - unfortunately this is not true. Acrylamide is found in chips, french fries, and anything that contains amino acids, reducing sugar and is subjected to heat. This environment is perfect for the Maillard reaction to occur. Once this reaction has taken place, we can find acrylamide in our food.
This is the reason why our project is focusing on detecting acrylamide not only in laboratories all over the world, but also in the food we eat. Our aim is also to create a sensor that can be widely used and is cheap enought to be more available for anyone who would like to use it.
Hemoglobin Structure.
As it has been demonstrated before acrylamide reacts with the C-terminal valine of both hemoglobin subunits, creating adducts. When this reaction has occurred, it is possible to measure acrylamide level by using ion selective electrode coated with human hemoglobin and then observing the change in current intensity to voltage ratio.
The aim of the current project is to create a bacterial sensor using an E. coli strain which can produce functional human hemoglobin (this idea is based on the system designed in 2007 by the Berkeley iGEM Team).

Project Results
Below are the results for each of the experiments we conducted.
General Growth Curve
Optical densities over time were collected for control BL21 E. coli and  BL21 E. coli transformed with Proteorhodopsin (BBa_K1282002)  and NOX (BBa_K1282003) expressing plasmids. Data points were collected in three replicates, the standard deviation of which is shown with error bars. The data shows no major departure in either of the transformed groups from the untransformed control bacteria. For NOX this indicates that there isn’t any significant cytotoxic effect of the expression of the his-tagged protein. The Proteorhodopsin transformed culture doesn’t conclusively demonstrate whether the expressed proteins activity is cytotoxic as this experiment was conducted in cultures that were not exposed to beta-carotene or additional light and so, while the protein is expected to be expressed in the system it will not be conformationally active. A Proteorhodopsin specific growth assay was done to characterize whether or not the activity of Proteorhodopsin is cytotoxic in our system.
Proteorhodopsin Cytotoxicity Growth Assay
This assay compared optical density over time between the different experimental groups for BL21 E. coli transformed with BBa_K1282002 in order to characterize any effect that active proteorhodopsin might have on cell growth and vitality compared to inactive forms. There was no major discrepancy between the optical densities of the active induced light group and the inactivated groups. This supports the idea that the action of proteorhodopsin in our system is not significantly cytotoxic.
Proteorhodopsin ATP/ADP Assay
ATP/ADP ratios of BBa_K1282002 transformed BL21 E. coli were measured across different experimental groups using an EnzyLight kit. It is expected that functioning Proteorhodopsin would increase the ATP content of a bacterial cell by increasing the concentration of extracellular H+. Functional Proteorhodopsin is expected only from the group induced with beta-carotene and exposed to light. However the ATP/"

We hope to continue this meet-up over the following years, as we expect more and more teams to represent Singapore in iGEM.
Translations Collaboration
We also helped multiple teams with translating their Human Practice documents and videos to other languages to further help their outreach. Below are the teams we collaborated with.
Team Washington
Team Washington produced a booklet which taught the basics of synthetic biology to those not familiar in the area. Among the topics they presented was on the CRISPR-Cas system, which we found relevant to our project. We provided the Vietnamese translation for the above-mentioned section.
Team IIT-Madras
Team IIT-Madras produced a series of videos explaining the basics of cellular systems. We helped translate and record the Korean version of one of their videos.
Human Practices Collaboration
We also collaborated with Team EPFL on a comparative study between the legislative frameworks for genetic engineering in our countries, Switzerland and Singapore. Thus, we did an analysis on the similarities and differences and how these can be accounted to context differences. Head over to #CasWrites to read up our analysis!"

Panel discussion - Glyphosat zum Salat?! - Chancen und Risiken des Herbizids
During our human practice events we realized that most people do not have enough information about the herbicide glyphosate but are very interested in getting to know more about the topic. Therefore our iGEM Team invited to a panel discussion with the topic “Glyphosate on my plate?-Chances and risks of the herbicide” on the 12th of July in the Adam-von-Trott-Saal of the old Mensa in Göttingen which had the perfect ambience to discuss this controversial topic.
Our Team after the panel discussion together with our guests.
The event started with an introduction of our project by our team member Jonas in order to inform the very diverse audience about the iGEM competition, why we are participating, about what glyphosate is, the current state of the research and of course about our project and aim to find a solution to this controversially discussed herbicide.
Afterwards Robert and Marie of our team introduced our four guests (from left to right) Horst-Henning Steinmann of the centre for Biodiversity in Göttingen, Werner Wille of the “CDU” of Göttingen, Achim Hübner of the “Landvolk Niedersachsen” and Harald Wiedemann of “die Grünen” of Göttingen.
Horst-Henning Steinmann (Center for Biodiversity, Göttingen)
Werner Wille (CDU, Göttingen)
Achim Hübner (Landvolk Niedersachsen)
Harald Wiedemann (Die Grünen, Göttingen)
The panel started the discussion about the wide application of glyphosate in the agricultural areas of and around Göttingen. Lower Saxony , which Göttingen is part of, is known as the number one state of Germanys agriculture and produces for example almost half of the total german potato yield.
Harald Wiedemann expressed his severe concerns about the biodiversity and the extinction of specific species due to the use of glyphosate and other herbicides. He and his party are also part of the initiative „Stopp Glyphosat“ to reduce the use of a herbicide which long-term effects are not known yet.
Achim Hübner however pointed out that the use of glyphosate is essential in"

Possible reasons for an inability to obtain this approval could be due to lack of capital to do so, time pressures, or technical details of our technology that cannot be modified to meet requirements for both. In order to mitigate this risk, we have developed two strategies:
Should the accreditation process take longer than expected, we will utilize our other marketing strategy which involves targeting individual companies and environmental groups for monitoring outside of government-mandated regulation. Although this may present a smaller market opportunity, this would allow us to generate some initial revenue while we navigate the accreditation process.
If the process proves to be overly time- or resource-dependent, we may decide to completely change our target market. We have developed our product to make use of a versatile detector platform.  This not only facilitates development of additional cartridge systems for targeting additional compounds of interest, but will let us easily move into other markets. As such, should we encounter significant difficulties in meeting regulatory standards in the oil and gas sector, we may find that minor changes to our engineered strains will allow us to focus in on additional, less-regulated markets.  An example of this is in the waste water management industry.
Outside of the regulatory domain, other legal risks could involve the potential for lawsuits filed against us should our product cause harm. Strategies to mitigate these risks will involve obtaining proper insurance (i.e. business liability and product liability insurance). In addition, should our product not work as expected, we plan to offer a full refund to customers. As adoption by key players in the industry seems to influence large-scale adoption in the oil and gas sector, this would be necessary in order to maintain our image and bolster our sales among potential customers
Market Risks
As with any early venture, market risks are always important to consider. Particularly as our product will have a significant time to market with first sales projected for late 2016, changes to market demand could impact the success of our company significantly. In order to mitigate this serious risks, we have employed several strategies. We have developed a partnership with a large prospective customer, HydroQual Laboratories. Through sustaining detailed discussions and eventual testing of our prototypes with them, we are helping to ensure that our design continues to meet industry needs. In addition, as mentioned above, we may also make use of our versatile platform sensing system to move into other, more stable markets such as industrial food processing.
An additional possible risk is that our product does make use of a genetically modified organism. Although we have taken every step possible to ensure that our final product will be safe to use and will not pose any environmental concerns"

BCA for Concentrated Fraction
Following the manufacturer's protocol, a BCA was conducted on the concentrated sample made yesterday via a 20kD Pierce concentrator. 9 standards were used to plot the Beer's Law Calibration Curve, and ultra pure water was used as a blank. Immediately after addition of 1mL of working reagent to 100ul of concentrated Tamura sample, the solution turned a deep purple, and this qualitative observation indicated early on that the sample was concentrated to a good extent. (Judging from the 9 standards' reactions after adding working reagent, the less concentrated samples were green and the more concentrated samples were purple.)  After spectroscopy, it was discovered that the concentrated Tamura sample was even more concentrated than the highest standard concentration, resulting in an absorbance reading of 2.66. This value is out of the 0.1-1.0 working absorbance range for Beer's Law.  The spectrophotometer was unable to generate an estimated protein concentration in ug/mL. So, the data from the standards were plotted and an equation from the line of best fit was generated. The corresponding absorbance was then calculated from an mathematical expression, the quadratic function ( ), and found to be 2970ug/mL, which is approximately 3mg/mL, a 0.3 w/v %.
Note: The concentrated Tamura should have been diluted down until it generated an absorbance reading between 0.1 and 1.0, this would have allowed for a more accurate calculation of its concentration. This will be done next time if we run into the same problem with our purified and concentrated proteins.

Imperial_College_London,2009,Team:Imperial College London#Drylab#Enzyme#Analysis#Detailed_-_-_TEXT.html,"-Menten assumption:
The Michaelis-Menten (MM) assumption is a simplifying assumption that is commonly made with enzymatic reactions. It says that since substrate binding is very fast compared to catalysis, the enzyme complex ES is always at quasi-steady state, ie:
, during the time of the experiment.
It is straightforward to prove that combining the MM assumption
with the conservation equation [E0]=[E]+[ES] yields a new form for the fourth equation
, where  KM is the Michaelis-Menten constant.
Equation (4-MM) seems more complex but is in practice more useful exploitable than Equation (4). Indeed, [S] can often be measured during an experiment, whereas [ES] cannot. Furthermore when the initial concentration of substrate [S0] is large compared to KM, then [S] remains large compared to KM over a certain range of time (that includes the start of the assay) and (4-MM) simplifies to
over this range of time. Simply put, for these times P is produced at a constant rate at the start of the assay. Because of its close association to one of the possible behaviours of the system, the KM is one of the important pieces of information that can be given about an enzymatic reaction.

At last we surveyed about the hot point about iGEM. In these choices, most people choose “food and nutrition”. “Gene diagnosis” and “environment” are flat. Only a little people choose “energy” and “information”. This is a little different from what we guess.
Result
According to the online questionnaire and sampling survey offline,we found that some people don’t know about synthetic biology while they showed interests in it. They are willing to have a deep acknowledge of synthetic biology, who are mainly 5~28 years old.
We asked them about their attitude towards synthetic biology, finding there’re   different views from different ages.
At the same time, we collected the opinions to saline-alkali land and our project from public. The data is used to predict the accessibility of our project. We found some doubts of our project was the result of the strangeness of bacteria and synthetic biology.
Towards this phenomenon, we started public presentations about synthetic biology. For different ages of people, we adjusted presentation details. We want to increase the favorability of biology of public by our presentations in which we tried to popularize biology knowledge so that we can appeal more people knowing and joining us.
Public Engagement
In 29th September 2018, our team visited the Middle School attached to Northwest University. Since the professor Edvard Moser who won Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine gave a speech to Northwest University in 26th, our team got connection with the Middle school attached to Northwest University.
The headmaster of the middle school invited our team to give students a presentation because their students have shown great interest in biology. So in 29th, we visited the middle school to give a lecture to Grade 8.
Our team members separated into 7 classes. All members use different ways to teach students basic biology and synthetic biology in a brief. We also introduced the information about iGEM and the project of our team. Some students were so active that they even said they want to attend the competition. After presentation, we had a finding differences game. During playing time, we taught students safety norms in laboratory.
At last, we handed out our self-made questionnaire to students. All students finished the survey.
In 6th October 2018, our team visited the Middle School attached to Northwest University again. The teachers in Senior Three invited our team to give a presentation to students to encourage them since they will attend the Collage Entrance Exam soon. During the presentation, some students were impressed by iGEM competition. They said they wanted to join the competition in collage. Some of them even wanted to be admitted"

In addition, we hosted a host Q&A session afterwards where many students and faculty members asked us questions about our research. We enthusiastically agreed to give this presentation because this event  not only provided this with an opportunity to practice our presentation skills for the Jamboree but also allowed us to engage with students and faculty on our campus about our  project and the field of synthetic biology. Many of questions asked during the Q&A session concerned interpretation of our data as well as the impact of our work on combating climate change.  We learned that, just like us, many of the students and faculty members that attended were aware of the grave impacts of climate and seemed to understand the importance of our research.

PUF Experimental Design
In designing our project we based our quantitative tests on fluorescence measured by a plate fluorescence reader. Our constructs were created in ways that best suit providing evidence for our hypothesis of the PUF-PIN fusion protein showing endonuclease activity. Generally, our results were collected from quantifying two main PUF-PIN fusion protein types, a wild type and a mutant type, in different conditions. These two fusion proteins had recognition sites that differed by two base pairs.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," running the LED panel for your own requirements. To further simplify software adaptations of our LED panel, we created our own Arduino Library that contains all necessary functions for controlling the LED panel in an intuitive way. For example, instead of accessing every LED individually, the following lines of code are sufficient for configuring the LED panel and turning on all LEDs at the desired intensity:
#include ""Bielefeld-CeBiTec_LED_panel.h""                             LED_panel led_panel = LED_panel();
led_panel.begin();
led_panel.setPWM( INTENSITY );
All code, including the Arduino Library, are available for download in the Downloads section.
Apart from the software for the microcontroller, we developed an Android application that allows users to operate the LED panel via Bluetooth. This is especially helpful for advanced illumination protocols which would not be possible by controlling the LED panel with the rotary encoder alone. The software is written in Android Studio, which is free to use for everyone. On startup, the application searches for accessible Bluetooth devices in its range and automatically identifies the LED panel. It then establishes a serial connection and waits for the user to create a program sequence of illumination settings.
The Program Sequence activity of our Bluetooth application. The program sequence contains entries for each change in the illumination profile. At a glance, the whole illumination sequence is comprehensible to the user. In the given example, the LED panel is first illuminated evenly for 10 seconds at 20 % intensity. Afterwards, the intensity is linearly increased from 20 % to 80 % over 1:15  minutes, followed by an additional, constant illumination at 100 % intensity for 1 minute.
Creating and editing program sequence entries. Controlled via a single, clearly arranged interface, the user can create and edit entries of the program sequence. At the top, the user can choose between contant illumination and time dependent linear, exponential or logarithmic change in illumination intensity. Beneath, the user can set the illumination intensity before and after the specified period of time. If the optional gradient option is selected, the intensities before and after the time period can be adjusted for the leftmost and rightmost wells of the microtiter plate individually.
The edit menu allows the user to create and edit very complex illumination settings. First, it can be chosen between constant illumination intensity or time dependent linear, exponential or logarithmic change in illumination intensity. Afterwards, the illumination intensity before and after a specified period of time can be chosen. Even gradient illumination profiles are possible, setting the illumination intensities individually for the leftmost and rightmost wells of microtiter plate.

Workflow Design
The major design goals of our workflow are accessability and a fast generation of reproducible, extensive results. Moreover, a modular software architecture should allow for easy extensibility, as well as a high potential of reusage of workflow components for other tasks or workflows.
The deimmunization of biopharmaceuticals poses a big challenge, since every attempt of decreasing the immunogenicity of a protein by a point mutation might lead to a loss of function or the protein might outright not fold anymore. Thus, we formulated two goals:
Decrease the immunogenicity
Keep structural solidity
As the key metric of immunogenicity we used the epitope count for a user-defined set of alleles and implemented our own epitope predictor for MHC-I in MHCBoost. MHC-II epitope prediction is enabled through interoperability with NetMHCIIPan 3.2 [] .
To narrow down the set of potential amino acid substitutions and identify highly conserved amino acids, we developed EvoCS.
Together with CoReM, an innovative machine learning estimator of mutation-affected structural solidity, experimentally feasible deimmunization targets are identified accurately.
In the following we will introduce all tools and finally explain how they are connected and how their interplay works.
Figure 1:  A high level overview of BERT. The protein sequence is deimmunized while taking the loss of immunogenicity and the impact on the structural solidity of a set of considered mutations into account.
EvoCS - Evolutionary Consensus Sequencer
Motivation
The deimmunization of a protein is the act of utilizing position specific point mutations to decrease the chances"

The variation of the number of resistant bacteria R over time is:
A gain equal to the growth of those bacteria: +a*R
A gain equal to the number of bacteria that mutates into phage-resistant bacteria: +f*S
The variation of the number of infected bacteria I over time is:
A gain equal to the number of bacteria infected by phages: +b*S*V
A loss equal to the number of bacteria infected by phages at time t-K (where K is the time needed for a phage to kill a bacterium): -b*S(t-K)*V(t-K)
The variation of the number of phages V over time is:
A gain equal to the number of phages released after the lysis of previously infected bacteria, where h is the average number of phages created inside an infected host: +h*b*S(t-K)*V(t-K)
A loss equal to the number of phages that infected bacteria: -b*S*V
A loss equal to the degradation of phages in the solution: -m*V
As we can see the equations here are relatively simple, and the only real difficulty to solve them is the presence of a Delay Differential Equation (DDE) in the form of S(t-K)*V(t-K).
To solve those equations we chose to use MATLAB because we were used to this computing language (and because we obtained a license through the iGEM competition framework). Thanks to this computing environment we can solve those DDE with a built-in function called “dde23”.
This function comes with some options, one of which allows us to indicate the function what happens for t < K. In our case, we want that for t
We started by implementing the system as described in the article, then to obtain equations that fitted our need we added :
A variable D representing the quantity of DNA freed during the lysis of the bacteria by the phage
A carrying capacity C (modeling the fact that a solution can be saturated in term of bacteria)
A degradation factor r (for bacteria) and l (for DNA)
A factor d modeling the average quantity of DNA freed after lysis
Here are the final equation in our code:
It is important to note that we were able to implement the DNA variable D quite easily because we did implement a toxin variable in order to work with Ruth from the Nottingham iGEM team. After working with Ruth we also decided to use a carrying capacity factor.  And we ended up agreeing on the fact that the carrying capacity is a common factor for both S and I ("
TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," easy to isolation from cells because of their difference in size and density in comparison to cellular organelles. Inclusion body proteins also degrade slower and resist proteolytic attacks by proteases. Lastly, proteins expressed in inclusion bodies tend to be less contaminated with cellular substances and can be purified with less steps  [12] .
Purification and Refolding
To purify the enzyme, a C-terminal-directed mutagenesis was performed to add a His-taq. The nodB gene was again expressed in E. coli BL21. The cells were disrupted via sonication and in a second sonication step the inclusion bodies were solubilized in a highly concentrated guanidine hydrochloride buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. High concentrations of chaotropic denaturants such as guanidine hydrochloride and reducing agents (β-mercaptoethanol) provide the solubilization of inclusion bodies  [12] . To prevent non-native disulfide bond formations β-mercaptoethanol was used. To refold the bound protein, the 6 M guanidine-hydrochloride buffer was exchanged to a 6 M urea buffer. During slow removal of the denaturant urea, the protein was refolded into the native state  [12] .
Affinity purification of His-tagged recombinant proteins and subsequent on-column refolding, gives us the feasibility to purify and refold NodB in a single chromatographic step  [13] .  The protein was purified via an ÄKTA in combination with a 1 mL HisTrap column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden).
Enzyme Reaction and Assay
Reaction
A reaction volume was set to 1 ml with 1 mM chitin pentamers (AG Prof. Dr. Bruno Moerschbacher, WWU Münster, Institut für Biologie und Biotechnologie der Pflanzen) and 2,5 µM purified NodB eluted in NH4HCO3 adjusted to pH 9. Four reactions were initiated and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After approximately 20 hours the reactions were heat-inactivated at 80 °C for 20 minutes to denature remaining enzymes.
Assay
NodB is a carbohydrate esterase which deacetylates the first N-acetyl-D-glucosamine unit (GlcNAc) of the non-reducing substrate"

Lab Work:
Due to the hard work required to take care of several mutants libraries and to go through our diverse selection methods, most of the team took part in the lab work. But beyond the daily work we can highlight the work of Adrien Gauchet who designed a protocol to extract maltodextrins from glycose syrup; Antoine Godeaux, Joaquin Guzman and Meredith Wouters who, relying on their lab’s experience, trained the rest of the team; François Tyckaert and Maxime Velings who realized most of the sequencings.
Maltodextrin production:
Purified maltodextrins, is a substrate needed in large quantities during our selection process. It is a key component for our project, difficult to obtain and which prices can rise to 1500 €/gr. Thanks to Cargill who delivered free corn glucose syrup, we were able to extract from it the wanted malt"

==Parts Summary==
Silica Binding Peptide (Si4): A short amino acid sequence that binds silica with high affinity.
Bio-system 1: CpxR promoter controlling GFP expression. Will produce the green fluorescent protein following exposure to hydrophobic membrane stress. Extensive experimental data has been acquired about the response of the cpxR promoter to various forms of physical and chemical stresses, this can be found in the Device 1 section of the Lab Results page.
Bio-system 2: INP.Si4 is produced constitutively with GFP production under control of CpxR promoter. The system is designed to bind with high affinity to silica macro-structures and produce a fluorescent response when it does. Flow cytometry, fluorescence confocal, and scanning electron microscopy data has been gathered to characterize this part. Problems with expression meant that the data is not as conclusive as predicted but indicates that Si4 is expressed in some cells.

Performance evaluation
Target of evaluation
In the part of system analysis, we have talked about the influence of promoter strengths and plasmid copy numbers to initial steady states and expression level of gene elements after sensing nicotine. The goal of our project is to detect nicotine and transform nicotine to more valuable chemicals, so it is necessary to evaluate the performance of sensing system like threshold and timeliness. Besides, because part of nicotine is degraded to 6-Hydroxynicotine which is out of the pathway of 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine metabolism, we need to calculate the rate of nicotine transformed to the target product. Parameter sweep provides us appropriate parameter intervals for system design, so effectiveness analysis is based on these parameter settings (s2 = 0.5, s1 = 0.5, plamid1 copy number =10, plasmid2 copy number = 10). We mainly focus on the threshold of sensor, time point suitable for fluorescence measurement, the recycle rate and the relationship between nicotine input, promoter1 strength and these three properties.
Threshold of sensing system
The usage of sensing system is to detect the existence and concentration of nicotine in the medium, so it has its own detection limit. Besides, in consideration of the complexity of the system, its sensitivity to nicotine input may vary a lot with different concentration of nicotine input. The combination of parameters is another important factor in the discussion of threshold and sensitivity because both low nicotine input and low expression of Vppa leads to inadequate 6-Hydroxynicotine to release the hdnoR repression of GFP signal.
Figure 1 GFP with s1, nicotine input
Figure 2 GFP heat-map
The nicotine input we set is within the interval of [1e-5,1] M and the strength of promoter in is within [0,1]. To get the full vision of GFP change along the time span, the simulation runs for 200000 s. From figure 1 and figure 2, we find that the maximal GFP concentration ranges from 0 to about 2000 nM with the increase of nicotine input"

The “window period” of miRNA is determined by the initial concentration of miRNA and the velocity of bacteria growth, and we cannot adjust that. Thus, the key problem is how to elevate the expression level of GFP earlier. Based on the previous analysis, we attempt to solve the problem by increasing the concentration of the gene on the plasmid in the initial state. There are two methods can reach the goal. First, integrating the entire expression box into the bacterial genome. Second, transfer the plasmid into the bacteria to make it into competence, and then transfer miRNA into bacteria. In either case, the concentration of the gene on the plasmid in the initial state has been increased. We have taken the second approach, and the experimental results show that we have obtained ideal observation, which prove that the analysis and the solution are effective (Fig. 2).
3. The research of “Promoter-antimicro-RBS” device
When we examine the effect of anti-miRNA insertions on GFP expression in the initial state, we obtained the following data (Fig. 3).
From the figure, both “promoter-antimicro-RBS” and “RBS-antimicro-GFP” could express GFP regularly, but the fluorescence intensity of “promoter-antimicro-RBS” increased significantly. We hypothesize that perhaps the sequence of anti-miRNA itself can act as a “strong promoter” or “strong RBS”, so as to increase the expression of GFP. Hence, we constructed additional gene circuits to prove our ideas. Also, we conducted fluorescence detection and obtained the following results (Fig. 4, 5).
It can be seen that the express ability of the system lose when promoter or RBS is removed from the expression. This suggests that the anti-miRNA sequence itself cannot act as an independent element to initiate transcription or translation of gene. Therefore, the increase in GFP expression of promoter-antimicro-RBS could be explained by the interaction between anti-miRNA sequence and promoter or RBS, which indicates that there are certain problems about the insulation between components, which is caused by the design itself. We hope that some team could develop a better solution to this problem in the future.
Next, we used a flow cytometry to collect data for more detailed view of the expression of the promoter-antimicro-RBS device. Flow cytometry is a method of measuring the size, density, fluorescence type, and fluorescence intensity of a event (single bacteria"

Durante siglos los alquimistas creían en la piedra filosófica que es una sustancia misteriosa que es capaz de convertir cualquier metal en puro oro y plata. Aparte de esa propiedad también es capaz de cumplir la ansia de la humanidad: la inmortalidad.
A pesar de que la piedra filosófica nunca fue descubierto, los alquimistas buscando la piedra probaron innumerable sustancias y sus implicaciones en el laboratorio. Así acumularon mucho conocimiento básico en la química y farmacología que sigue siendo parte del fundamento de la ciencia actual.
En el mundo del veintiunesco siglo la fe en la piedra filosófica desapareció con el tiempo. Sin embargo estamos buscando todavía no solo caminos de prorogar la vida sino también soluciones para los problemas ecológicas creados de nuestra misma modernización. Al contrario del pasado no buscamos sustancias mágicas en la naturaleza. Nos dejamos inspirar y creamos nuestras propias herramientas para solucionar los retos de la reciente sociedad.

  We choose ""reagent leak treatment"" as the theme and narrated a story through the form of melodrama. Two students missed the teacher's teaching because they were late in experiment class. They accidentally overturned the test tube containing ether while dropping the ether. Being panic, they opened the doors and windows immediately and asked the teacher for help. After the teacher handled the accident, he educated the students and mentioned what had happened before: solid reagent leakage treatment (take the case of sodium bromide leakage as an example) and the leakage treatment of ultra clean workbench medium.

Figure 1: Cell growth of Mercury Bacter in different Hg concentrations in function of time;
Figure 2: Cell growth of control bacteria in different Hg concentrations in function of time;
Comparing the graphs shown on figure 1 and 2, it can be observed that the biobrick BBa_K135504 provided resistance to high Hg concentrations. Control bacteria did not present resistance to Hg concentration equal or higher to 1 ppm. On the contrary, Mercury Bacter grew up even in 10 ppm Hg concentrations. Interestingly, at the concentration of 10 ppm Mercury Bacter needed 24 hours to exhibit increase in cell growth, and after 48 hours it maintained the same OD, unlike the others. At 1 ppm, 2.5 ppm and 5 ppm Mercury Bacter performed an overwhelming cellular growth after 24 hours of exposure to Hg, reaching approximately the same cellular growth as the non-exposed bacteria!!

Human Practices Overview
iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .

Module:ABACUS
ABACUS is firstly developed by professor Liu Haiyan, to enlarge the functions of Biopano. The de novo design of amino acid sequence to fold into desired structures is a way to reach a more thorough understanding of how amino acid sequences encode protein structures and to supply methods for protein engineering. To overcome limitations in current computational models, they developed a comprehensive statistical energy function for protein design with a new general strategy and verify that it can complement and rival current well-established models. They established an experimental approach which can be used to efficiently assess or improve the foldability of designed proteins. To prove it, they report four de novo proteins for different targets, all experimentally verified to the well-folded, solved solution structures for two being excellent agreement with respective design targets.[2]
Unit Test
Our development is based on Git version control with multiple branches. All pushed commits will be automatically tested on our test server at once so that we can see the result soon. Besides unit tests, our test server will also process code analyzing to prevent fault codes and ensure that all classes and functions are well documented. When all is done, the new docker image will be generated automatically on DockerHub so that anyone can install and run our program with only one command.
Continuous integration and deployment ensure that we can fix bugs at the first time it appears. Unit tests ensure that our software performs all its intended function.

Bordeaux,2014,Team:Bordeaux#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," 2nd year at the engineering school ENSTBB. I have discovered the iGEL thanks to another student in my school who has already participated in the iGEM the year before. I am excited to participate in this 10th anniversary of iGEM 2014! I hope to learn more about synthetic biology and how it can influence our lives and the society in general.
Lauriane NATHOU (Master 1 Biologie et Biotechnologie des plantes et des champignons)
In several fields, synthetic biology is an innovative alternative which can bring solutions for fundamental research, pharmaceutics or in ecology. Working on microorganism is essential and the original ideas brought by students are more likely to be the beginning of tomorrow big discoveries. Following this mentality, the iGEM competition allows a blossoming at short and middle terms by provoking a strong healthy rivalry. My experience from last year brought me a lot and I would like to have the opportunity to go even further this year to highly bring the work of the team of Bordeaux.
Diane BUGEAUD (1Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB)
Biology is everywhere, all around us. This makes it a wide field to explore and the discoveries left to be done seem countless. The everlasting biological evolution makes it attractive and also fascinating. Synthetic biology is fast-growing and the fields in which it is used are numerous like conception of new drugs, new recyclable materials, biofuels. The current and future needs destined it to a bright prospect. The iGEM will allow me to acquire deeper knowledge, to learn fast and to get the useful experience needed for my future career of engineer. This scientific competition gathers all the biology-passionate which makes it a unique human adventure.
Besson Xavier (1Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB):
Biotechnologies are booming and will be without a doubt at the center of many fields in the next few years. Throughout the complexity of the resources provided by nature and the techniques that always progress, the prospects for biotechnologies are varied and numerous (personalized medicine, energy sources). The iGEM allows students to be at the heart of innovation by imagining every year experiments vying of originality and ingenuity. On a more personal level, this experience represents for me the occasion of exchanging with people from different horizons, gathered around a common passion: biology. This is also the occasion to follow the evolution of a scientific project, from the idea to its conception and to familiarize with my future job as an engineer.

0. Important questions beyond the bench
 
Beyond the bench, our project contains a Major question, which is described in detail in the following paragraphs ( Understanding economy ), is how to understand economy by iGEM and other biology students. Our approach to this question obtained from interaction with general public people is Development of education tool for economy using E. coli.  We thank this interaction which strongly influenced our scientific-project planning. Evaluation of our education tool from biology students clearly shows the usefulness of the tool (Fig 6-1-0).
Fig6-1-0. effects of our presentation
 
We think that our presentation supported with biobrick parts and modeling can be easily adapted to not only iGEMers but other biology students, who are great human resource of innovation. 
Through activities beyond the bench, we also encountered other questions for safety, future, and image of synthetic biology ( Others ).  An example of such question is how we can solve the safety problem for distribution of our education tool.  We consulted the biosafety expert, Mr. Tomoya Saito, who is working for National Institute of Public Health. He gave us a lecture on dual-use technology. After that, we asked him some questions about biosafety ( Our question about biosafety ).
 
1. Abstract
 
Economics is basically called the ""QUEEN SUBJECT "" of all subjects of social sciences. Economics is one of the most useful of all sciences, because it makes us aware of how things are exchanged, flourished, and survived within multiple markets. Not even that, it makes us aware of lots of fact"
Northwestern,2012,Team:Northwestern#Protocols#GelElec_-_-_TEXT.html," that once the gel is placed into the rig, none will spill out.
Pour the gel into the forming tray when it cools. If bubbles appear, use the comb to push them towards the sides.
Place the comb at the end of the tray. Cover the tray with aluminum foil. Let the gel cool for 20 minutes until solid.
Using both hands, grasp the top of the comb between your thumb and index finger, and slowly pull the comb up. A partner should also gently hold down the gel.
Rotate the gel 90 degrees so that the opening of the wells are the furthest from the red wire on the cover. Remove the red tape from the forming tray.
Add more 0.5X TBE buffer to the rig until the entire gel is covered by about 1mm.
Mix loading dye with DNA solution – 5uL for every 10uL of solution. Generally, each well can hold about 30uL total. If you are only using the gel for evaluation purposes, 10uL solution with 5uL dye is plenty. If you need to gel-extract, you should do about 20uL solution and 10uL dye, and can even increase this and fill multiple wells to increase yield.
Load DNA and standards into the wells. Check the concentration of your ladder to determine how much you should dilute it down with nuclease free water. You should load standards on both sides of the gel in case your gel runs unevenly. If you know you will be gel extracting later, skip a well between different DNA samples to make sure that the DNA doesn’t mix.
Place the cover on the rig and attach the electrodes. Set the voltage to approximately 100V. Let it run for approximately one hour or until the DNA has run ⅔ along the gel. Don’t let it run too long because the ethidium bromide is positively charged, and will shift locations.

This protein can be used to complex Nickel or Cobalt.  The principal mechanism is comparable to Ni-NTA columns, as chelates the ions. Free binding sites of the ions are then exposed, so that a His-tagged protein can attach to them. The design of the protein is of a particular interest, too. LRR are highly conserved motifs throughout evolution. They appear in all kingdoms of life in almost every thinkable role (Ligases, Receptors, Toxins etc.). Their core is highly conserved and provides a very stable backbone, while the intermediate, non-conserved aminoacids are almost freely interchangeable.
This protein can be used to complex up to 4 Nickel or Cobalt. However the principal design oft he protein is of a particular interest, too. LRR are highly conserved motifs throughout evolution.

Their core is highly conserved and provides a very stable backbone, while the intermediate, non-conserved aminoacids are almost freely interchangeable.
We only submitted one of the three versions, to reduce redundancy in the registry. Please contact us for any questions.
Usage and Biology
The Precipitator is a new artificially designed LRR protein. It is meant as protein that binds Nickel ions with Histidines grouped on its surface. The bound Nickel can then precipitate His-tagged proteins. In our Lab in a Cell it should function as an adaptor between the plastic surface of pipettes and the His-tagged protein. Please look at our detailed description of the design layout in our modeling section. The sequence was synthesised and cloned into the iGEm vector. The submitted sequence was fully confirmed by sequencing.

Design Notes
Here we investigated an optimal set of non-conserved aminoacids by analysing large sets of similar proteins and databases. You can use this piece of work as a template to design your own protein and give it any function you like, by simply interchanging aminoacids and fusing other domains on the N or C termini.

Project Overview
Haloalkanes are widely used commercially. The majority of these compounds have been shown to be serious pollutants as they are toxic and quite persistent in the environment, such as a man-made industrial chemical 1,2,3-Trichloropropane (TCP) and an organic pesticide γ-Hexachlorocyclohex-ane (Lindane，γ-HCH). These halogenated compounds have been introduced into our environment as a consequence of industrial waste disposal and widespread open use in agriculture, which need to be removed to low levels from waste streams and during sanitation of polluted sites. For this reason, Microbial degradation of these compounds represents an important and efficient way to fulfill the target. In order to improve biodegradation efficiency, several powerful genetically engineered E. coli strains have been constructed by the co-expression of key enzymes involving in the biodegradation pathways of the two compounds.  As putting the different selected enzymes together, it will have an ability to degrade more halogenated compounds besides the both. To construct the efficient co-expression system and achieve biodegradation of γ-HCH and TCP, these key enzymes, LinA, LinB, DhaA and HheC, are chosen, and foot and mouth disease virus 2A peptide and polycistronic co-expression strategies were adopted. Foot and mouth disease virus 2A peptide has been widely used for co-expression of multiple genes in eukaryote systems. However, the use of the 2A peptide in prokaryotes is limited, and so far only one paper described that F2A can work in E. coli as well.[1] To explore whether the 2A peptides can work in our co-expression system, several vectors were constructed by using all three 2A peptides, respectively. The results showed that all enzymes could co-express as a soluble protein with P2A peptide acting as a linker and F"

After we returned to Evanston, we emailed Emma a new survey that would provide useful information for future iGEM teams planning presentations for high school students. The survey instructions made clear its voluntary and anonymous nature. Emma administered the survey and sent us the results promptly. Here’s what we learned:

•pXyl: It´s a promoter in B. subtilis which is regulated by Xylose and XylR[11,12]. In the endogenous systems, pXyl is the promoter for a set of genes involved in xylose metabolism[12].
•P4: It´s a transcription factor from phi29 phage, which is a phage of B. subtilis, it is the activator of the A3 promoter[4,5].
•LasR: It is another activator transcription factor, its origin is Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, its correspondent promoter is LasB[20].
•CI: This protein is a repressor from Lambda phage.
•RFP: highly engineered mutant of red fluorescent protein from Discosoma striata (coral), this is our reporter gene[6].
•Pveg: This is a constitutive promoter from B. subtilis regulates by the sigma factor sigma A[13].
•XylR: This is a repressor transcription factor which in the presence of xylose is inactivated by a conformational change triggered by the binding with xylose that induces the dissociation of the XylR from its binding site[14].
•AraC: It´s one E.coli repressor transcription factor. In the absence of arabinose, araC binds to two binding sites located in the pBAD promoter and through the binding of both monomers od AraC a DNA looping is made which blocks the transcription of the genes under that promoter[15]. When arabinose is present in the medium.
•Omega cassette: The Omega Cassette provides resistance to Spectinomycin and Streptomycin; it was obtained from plasmid pHP45omega[7,8]. Specifically, the resistance is provided by the aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance gene (aadA +) originally carried on a 1.7-kb PvuII-HindIII fragment from the R100.1 plasmid[8].

Steps 6 and 7 (involving solutions II and III need to be carried out in quick succession (adhering to the short incubation time) to ensure good results. It is advisable to do these two steps in pairs as in step 6 the tubes need to be tightly capped once solution II is added.
The precipitate formed in following step 7 does not pellet well after centrifugation in step 8, and hence the suspension needs to be removed immediately to prevent resuspension.
The inversion in step 6 needs to be done gently so that genomic DNA of the bacteria are not extracted along with the desired plasmid DNA.

Study Enzyme Deinking From Dr. Su, Yu-Chang
To study enzyme deinking method, we have visited Dr. Su, Yu-Chang, an expert of dendrochemistry in National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan. Dr. Su had advised us several kinds of enzymes which are able to degrade cellulose and hemicellulose, and shared the experimental conditions that had been applied on enzymes in his research with us, which became a great help for the construction of our process. During the interview, we also had a tour to Dr. Su’s laboratory which equipped with small scale paper making machines. Later we established our own paper making process according to the learning from Dr. Su.
Participate in 2017 Science Carnival !
Participating in 2017 Science Carnival provided us a great opportunity to educate the public. We wanted to make people understand the importance of fiber preservation, and how we achieve high preservation ratio through using enzymes to deink. Popularizing our design and let people value timber resource, we need people to put environmental protection into practice.
Collaboration and Meet-up with iGEM teams
2012 TU Munich In the last design of our project, we contacted 2012 TU Munich to learn about their red light induced system biobricks. Through meetings, we gradually understand their original design. We appreciate 2012 TU Munich for giving us many advices of how we improve the biobricks. Lastly, we optimize the protein codon and reverse the direction of protein expression.

Soiled
Soil Nutritional Analysis
Taking a clue from the tests field technicians perform on soil samples, ""Soiled"" applies color as a metric for nutritional analysis. Such sampling assesses the concentration and presence of chemicals vital to optimal growth. In contrast to most of the toxic reagents used in the industry standard, we propose the construction of a device that will utilize biological means to detect nutrient value.
What harmful reagents cannot be substituted will be minimized within a microfluidic chip housed in a mobile device with a compatible app, limiting exposure and increasing the accuracy of the results. The physical manifestation of our project will take the form of a Bio Art Installation, utilizing data taken from NYC backyards. Various graphic charts and laboratory consumables, light sources and color-aid papers will be employed to form a cohesive aesthetic experience, in keeping with the parameters of New Media art, reflecting recent trends in urban gardening.

Parts from Caroline actually came in today, so we decided to attempt transformations.  Note that the parts were estimated to be at 200ng/uL in 10mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5.  At first we were going to do transformations of all of them, but we quickly realized that, although the sheet indicated that there was 10uL of plamid in each tube, there actually only appeared to be about 2uL.  Our guess is that some of each plasmid dried up during shipment.  Therefore, we decided instead to attempt a trial transformation with a part that we already had in glycerol stock, P0501 or J63006, to use Caroline's naming system and the registry's, respectively.  Placed only about 2 uL in with 50uL competent cells, but put the whole 4 uL in for the positive control.  Only realized after the two hours of incubation that the volume for the positive control should have matched that for the part P0501.  Will have to redo this experiment should transformation fail.  Incubated for 2 hr and 2 min, then plated all of the liquid onto two separate plates.  For each tube, used 20% of the liquid on one plate and 80% on the other.  Placed in incubator at 10:14 pm.  Will come in tomorrow around 12 pm to check on them.
Note: For the transformation, used the plates that had been slightly burnt.
6/14/08
Came in around 1:30 pm, after the plates had been in the incubator for 15 hr and 23 min.  Discovered good colonies on P0501 as well as the positive control, with no colonies on the negative control.  For some reason, it appears that the incubator had been set to 25 degrees Celsisus, so the colonies were still quite small.  Set the incubator to 37 degrees and put them back in for several hours.  Took them out again after the timer had said 19hr and 34 min.  Will use two colonies from P0501 to make glycerol stocks and store the plates in the fridge.

Modelling DSF
Clp Over-Expression Hypothesis
Objectives
DSF-Induced Phosphorylation of RpfG Mediates GFP Expression
DSF-Independent Activation of the manA Promoter
Conclusion
Objectives
To investigate why GFP expression was high in the absence of signal in our engineered DSF system.
DSF-Induced Phosphorylation of RpfG Mediates GFP Expression
We constructed models1 similar to those used in the PQS system to help design and calibrate  the signal-response behaviour of the DSF system. Thus we  determined a theoretical, quantitative link between  DSF signal level and GFP expression in the engineered chassis 2,3.  The model took account of the following processes: phosphorylation of RpfG is induced by DSF binding to a cell receptor;  RpfG[P] then degrades c-di-GMP which relieves the inhibition of Clp;  Clp then activated the expression of GFP through the engineered manA promoter. In the absence of a DSF signal, RpfG was predicted to remain in its unphosphorylated form and GFP expression  repressed.
DSF-Independent Activation of the manA Promoter
Interestingly, our experimental results subsequently revealed that in the absence of DSF, the manA promoter was active in our engineered system and hence GFP expression upregulated.
Like the BDSF pathway, the DSF system contains a phosphore"

As  this will be my first research opportunity at the university level, the  only experience I have is that obtained from first year Biology labs and  Medical Science courses. I believe that one of the major characteristics  of iGEM, interdisciplinary cooperation, allows the team to bring together top student  talents from faculties ranging from engineering to medicine. I am also a  huge soccer fan, especially Manchester United and Leicester City!
Emily Hicks
I’ve just finished my second year as a Biomedical Science student in the  Bachelor of Health Sciences program. I have taken Medical Science and  biology courses as well as ethics and Health in Society. I joined the iGEM  team because I’m really excited to have the opportunity to work on  something that’s novel and part of a very diverse team. I think synthetic  biology is an interesting and powerful field that will only grow in the  near future and it’s exciting to be a part of something that may be able  to come up with solutions to global problems. This summer, I’m going to be  working on the outreach team as well as in the lab and the iGEM wiki. I  will be helping to present our project to high school students to try to  build more interest in synthetic biology in Alberta. In my spare time I  compete in highland dancing, play the oboe in the University of Calgary  Symphonic band and participate in plays with Storybook theatre.

My name is Himika Dastidar and I am a Biomedical Sciences student in the University of Calgary. I am going into my 3rd year in the fall of 2010.  As a student of Biomedical Sciences, I have a background in cell biology, basic biochemistry and basic genetics. I am involved in iGEM because I think that iGEM will give me interdisciplinary exposure to molecular biology. The additional challenge of engineering circuits in molecular biology is rather new and interesting. iGEM also allows me to gain hands on experience about concepts learnt in class such as PCR, restriction digest etc. Other than academic involvement, I am involved in extracurricular activities such as volunteering with Big Brothers Big Sisters Calgary and LinkAges. I am also involved in activities like singing, playing the guitar, and martial arts. I think this summer is going to be a fantastic learning experience.

Formal Lab Session - 17th August 2009
Overview
Metal Sensor Team - tested the amyE knockouts in the B. subtilis pGFP-rrnB transformants (plated on LB + Chloram + starch) using iodine
Stochastic Switch Team - hydrated 7 BioBricks from Spring Distribution and transformed E. coli with them. Also analysed B. subtilis transformants using iodine
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team - carried out an improved second attempt at recovering cw1D spores and also analysed B. subtilis transformants with iodine.
Metal Sensor Team
Metal Sensor Team: LB + starch plate containing Bacillus subtilis with disabled amyE after being treated with iodine - Note there are no halos around the bacteria
LB + starch plates containing transformed Bacillus subtilis (with amyE disabled) being treated with iodine crystals - plates prepared by both Metal Sensing team and Stochastic Switch team
Introduction and Summary
In our last lab session (14/08/09) starch agar plates were made and once this task had been completed, Bacillus subtilis was entered onto the plate. This was done by firstly drawing a grid of 46 squares on the base of the agar plate and then marking each square with the bacteria. Into square 1, untransformed wild type Bacillus subtilis was added and into squares 2-46, Bacillus subtilis transformed with gfp-rrnb was added. These plates were then grown overnight.
The reason for this exercise is to see whether the bacteria that have survived the chloramphenicol treatment really have been given this property by taking up gfp-rr"

Hey yo! I’m Frederik and I have worked day and night on iGEM, mostly drinking beers at night time, but that should count as well. When I’m not working in lab or on the PC, I have fun with my teammates and tell bad dad jokes. I also make crazy ideas come true - like celebrating Christmas in July.

Heyah! I’m the other Frederik. I’m a green, lean, coffee-machine. I’ve been the steady supplier and consumer of coffee on the team. My main focus has been on how to build a sustainable iGEM project. I’ve been planting trees, eating green and lowering our team's carbon footprint. Oh, and did I also mention that I starred in our commercial? You can get autographs later.

Hey sup? I’m Jonas and used to like sports, partying, eating cake, hanging out with friends and other such things most people like to do. During iGEM these interests have changed… As I have been enslaved in the lab, I’ve come to realise that the only purpose of my life is to be in the lab.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Ciblage Tissulaire_-_-_TEXT.html,"uses semaines. D’où, sans doute notre difficulté à quantifier par cytométrie, la présence du vecteur tissulaire après une semaine.
La figure ci-dessus est tiré de la publication «  Thymus as a target for mycobacterial infections  ». Le même type de protocole a été réalisé, avec injection de 10^6 CFU/ml de M. avium administré par voie intraveineuse. Il est décrit dans cette figure que les poumons sont infectés dès le premier jour de l’infection, mais en très petite quantité (légèrement supérieur à 10^1, puis de manière prolongée avec une propagation rapide (de 10^1 à 10^6 CFU/organe en moins de 5 semaines). Ceci prouve donc bien que les poumons sont colonisé par M. avium.
Haut de page
Conclusion
Bien que notre étude ne prouve pas significativement la présence de M. avium dans le poumon, il a été prouvé mainte fois que ce type de bactérie colonise le poumon. Cet organe est l'un des tropismes naturels de M. avium chez la souris, comme chez l’homme.
Le DVS peut donc être utilisé sur le cancer du poumon, car nous avons la certitude que le vecteur tissulaire peut cibler l'organe et y libérer le vecteur cellulaire .

THE STAPHISCOPE!
ABSTRACT
Superbugs, or antibiotic resistant microorganisms, are microbes that have become resistant to traditional treatments. These types of infections are difficult to diagnose, treat, and eradicate, making the healing process time consuming and resource intensive. The native quorum-sensing unit from S.aureus (the Agr system), will be introduced into a non-pathogenic strain of E.coli. The E.coli will then effectively have the ability to eavesdrop on the activity of the pathogenic organism and emit an indication of the magnitude of the infection in the form of RFP. Using sensitivity tuners the system can be designed such that the response will occur at an exact level, when the size of the population poses a threat to the host. Upon a positive result from a diagnosis, further tests could be done to specify whether MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) or MSSA (Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) are present.
MODELING
Since the project aims to detect S. aureus at low concentrations, the modelling aims to determine how sensitive the system will be so that it can be adjusted to detect S. aureus at clinically-relevant concentrations. To that end, models for the sensitivity tuners from the 2009 Cambridge team needed to be built that can be combined with models for the AIP detection system. Most importantly, the noisiness of the system needs to be determined to know if false positives will be generated.
WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR GENEROUS SPONSORS.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Methicilin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are bacteria whose presence has been quite problematic in terms of human pathogenic infections. Since its discovery in the 1880s, Staphylococcus aureus has been the known cause for several kinds of minor skin, and major post-surgical infections. Prior to 1940, mortality rates in relation to this pathogenic organism reached 80% (Deurenberg and Stobberingh, 2008.) The first wave of resistant S. aureus came two years after the introduction of penicillin for medicinal practice in 1940. In less than twenty years, most of the S. aureus strains known to man were unaffected by the antibiotic. In the late 195"

Intellectual Property
In collaboration with the LMU Munich and all other German iGEM teams, iGEM Berlin supports the introduction of an new toolbar which indicates the intellectual property status of the parts in the registry.
A proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more"
