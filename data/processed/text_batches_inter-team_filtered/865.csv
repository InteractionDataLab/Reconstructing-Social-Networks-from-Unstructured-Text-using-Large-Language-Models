According to “Global Air Purifiers Market By Filter Type, By End Use Sector, By Region, Competition Forecast and Opportunities, 2011 – 2021”, the global air purifiers market is projected to cross $ 29 billion by 2021. 50% of the air purifiers market is now in China. This market is growing constantly (average growth: 10-15% per year), and faster than we think. In 2017, we expect 9 million air purifiers will be sold in China. According to market projections, more than 50% of the Chinese population will be equipped before 2020. And the next market will probably be India.
We can divide the current supply in two main categories:.
Large companies where depollution is not the main activity: Philips, Dyson or LG. Traditional air purifiers. Their price fluctuates between 200 and 1,500 euros. These device suck up and filter the internal air, retaining particles and gases. Their biggest drawback is, when used at high performance levels, they are very noisy. They also use up a lot of energy, which in terms of ""pollution balance"" can be a paradox. Indeed in the many countries where the primary source of electricity production is coal, the trapping of a gram of pollutants by the filter of an air purifier, can induce simultaneously the release of 100 grams, while powering the device! Their maintenance is quite expensive: the filters, which can cost between 50 and 120 euros, must be changed at least once a year, or even more often in the most polluted countries. Nevertheless, they cannot filter ultra-fine particles, which are the most toxic, because they enter the blood and tissues, and are considered by WHO to be a major public health problem.
Startups like Aube, Air Serenity, Reqova…
We can divide the purifying methods in three groups:
-Ionization: Ions have the virtue of cleaning the particles from the air by charging them electrically, once charged, the particles fall back down on the ground. The problem with conventional ionisers is that they emit a lot of ozone, a dangerous gas for health.
-Photocatalysis: A process by which a photocatalyst causes a chemical reaction, in which the ultraviolet rays will degrade and decompose the polluting particles.
-Cold Plasma: Air Serenity uses a unique cartridge that mixes a filter, absorbent sponges and cold plasma to capture fine particles, chemical pollutions and microbes.

20 minutes is a daily free generalist newspaper that aims to give quick and concise information about a whole range of topics. They wrote an online article about our project in the regional section of the newspaper. Thanks to them, we were able to reach the inhabitants of the region and keep them updated about what was happening in the scientific field.
Actu.fr is a site published by the Publihebdos Group, a French press group working in the Regional Weekly Press and Local Daily Press. The group's objectives are to provide information and services to local communities in a humanist and democratic way. The group operates in 9 regions in France through the publication of 93 local news weekly newspapers.
Crowfunding is a fantastic opportunity to both raise money and communicate with the general public. We are proud to have reached a lot of people this way and to have collected more than 2500 euros (2900 US dollars).
SCIENCE EDUCATION: EVENTS
Since we were committed to explaining biotechnologies (and iGEM!) to the general public, we looked for scientific events where our participation  could be of interest. These were great times for us, from a human aspect with many meetings and discoveries, as well as from a scientific point of view (how to explain science, how to explain biology, synthetic biology, biotechnologies, iGEM, etc). Here is a summary of these events.
""GRIMOIRE""
Date: March 10th & 11th
Speakers: Members of Grimoire and 4 members of our team
Audience: INSA students  and university of Toulouse
What is Grimoire?
Grimoire is a club of students interested in card games, board games & role playing games, as part of INSA Toulouse. It was with a relaxed and welcoming attitude that they organised the Playful Fantasy Convention for the twelfth consecutive year. This festival is lasts for a weekend in Spring each year, and is entirely dedicated to games in a campus decorated in the theme of lost cities.
Why were we at this event ?
We participated in this event in order to present Microbioworld, a card game first created by the iGEM Team Toulouse 2017, but also to discuss our project, iGEM and  biotechnologies with a non-specialist public.
Conclusion
This weekend in Grimoire was intense but rewarding. We got along very well with all the members of Grimoire. It was one of our earliest human practice"

Integrated Practices
- An Implementation of the Future
“The best way to predict your future, is to create it”
Abraham Lincoln - (former) president of the United States of America
Not that we can claim to be anything like Abraham Lincoln, or even to be vampire hunters. Nonetheless, we do agree that to create the future we all hope for, we must contribute to find a sustainable solution for a greener future. Before we can tackle the task of providing a sustainable future for the entire world, we must first look to our own local environment. We believe that the best way to gain a better understanding of a global dilemma, is to examine how a local environment is affected by it. Hopefully, this approach will help future iGEM teams find a connection between global issues and local ones. This approach has helped us elucidate specific issues and find sustainable solutions, which can be implemented into our society with the help and endorsement of local agents.
A Statement from the Mayor of Odense
We first decided to reach out to the mayor of Odense, to investigate the possibilities for iGEM to help in the government's endeavours to make Odense a CO2 neutral city.
“We face a series of challenges that we have to recognise, in the chase of the good and sustainable life in the city of Odense. Some of these concern local circumstances, while others contain national and even global issues. We as the municipality can only go so far on our own. So, we are entirely dependent on the help of local agents. It makes me so happy, when the students of the city, have taken on the mantle of developing new green technologies that solves global issues, while contributing to local city growth”
Peter Rahbæk Juel - Mayor of Odense
The core philosophy of our Integrated Human Practices has been to incorporate local experts in the development of our project. We wanted to examine how results produced in the laboratory, could be used to shape a product that corresponds with the green values of Odense.
We sought the advice of experts in other fields, e.g. expert in plastics to design the best possible exterior of our device. Furthermore, we met with business developer Ann Zahle Andersen to investigate the core value of our product from a business perspective.
We believe that Human Practices have played an essential role in our iGEM project. Everything from the design of our prototype to ethical considerations have been influenced by the people we engaged with.
Interviewing Smart City Odense
For the possible implementation of the PowerLeaf in the local environment of Odense, we"
SCU-China,2016,Team:SCU-China#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," some questions about our project and it was surprising that most of them didn’t resist to using the insole with the bacteria in it. ""I don't mind that it contains bacteria as long as it's useful,” said one of the interviewees.
Interview of PLA Cadets
For the final part of our interview, we choose the PLA Cadets in Sichuan University as our interviewees.  Due to their daily training and seldom changed shoes and insoles, they may suffer from foot diseases more likely.
From our interview with the cadets, we know more about their foot health situation. Unsurprisingly, they are troubled by the foot diseases like the athlete’s foot which couldn’t be cured easily by common medicine available such as Daktarin or Mometasone Furoate gel, etc.
We introduced the knowledge about foot and our project which aims to cure the foot disease related to germs. The cadets showed a great interest and expect sincerely that our project can make them get rid of their foot problems..

Meet Up
IngenuityLab_Canada
The leader of IngenuityLab_Canada, Dawson, was born in Chengdu, China. So we have the opportunity to have a meetup in our lab. We discussed a lot about the each team and the difference between China and Canada iGEM competition attendance. This meetup lead us to cooperation later discussed.
CCiC Attendance
CCiC (Central China iGEM Consortium) is organized every year in China mainland. This year, SYSU-China and SYSU-Software organized such a huge meetup in College of Life Science of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. More than 20 teams attended the meetup and presented their project. SCU-China was invited this year and presented the project “Look What They’ve Done To My Shoes.” Haoqian Zhang, the finalist leader 2010 from Peking University gave us some good advice. We’re so happy that a lot of people are interested in our project.
It’s such a cool experience to meet with a lot of teams in China, including NCTU-Formosa from Taiwan. We talked a lot about the team project, the team construction and difficulties a lot with different teams. At the same time, it’s glad to travel in Guangzhou and Sun Yat-sen University."

Bordeaux,2018,Team:Bordeaux#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," our project, provide us with insight into the effect of HMF on                         bacterial cell processes. We are very thankful for this meaningful collaboration and look forward                         to meeting their team again in Boston.
Figure 2 : pDnaK-GFP and pSoxS-GFP show a slight stress response to HMF Four stress detecting strains                             were exposed to multiple concentrations of HMF. Figure 2A shows little to no response of the                             pCspA-strain to all 5 concentrations of HMF. Figure 2B shows a reaction of the pDnaK-strain when                             exposed to 0.5 µg/mL HMF. Figure 2C shows no reaction of the pRpoE-strain for all 5 HMF concentrations.                             Figure 2D shows a reaction of the pSoxS-strain when exposed to 0.5µg/mL HMF
From their stress detection strains, pCspA-GFP and pRpoE which are involved in stress metabolism did                         not show indication that HMF delivers stress. But, pDnaK-GFP and pSoxS-GFP (which are involved in                         DNA damage) show some responses.
It would be great to investigate more the toxicity of HMF with an other assay (like Minimal Inhibitory                         Concentration Assay) (14), we could do more tests and add some statistics tests for more relevance.

To analyze the LO-AOX protein [ BBa_K1991009 ] expression, we run on a SDS-PGE gel and performed Coomassie Blue staining. The data showed the expressed proteins were observed at the estimated size (i.e., 91 kDa for LO-AOX)
 
 
 
Enzyme activity of LO-AOX [ BBa_K1991009 ] was measured as the function of hydrogen peroxide using ethanol as substrate. The data showed that E. coli displaying AOX enzymes is able to react with increasing concentrations of ethanol in a dose-dependent manner. The intensities (readouts) are linearly correlated to the concentrations of ethanol, indicating that our system could be used to measure the concentration of an unknown sample of alcohol.
 
 
 
To test whether our prototype of blood alcohol meter does work, we did modeling using an electrochemical simulator. The reduction potential of AOX with the aid of potassium ferricyanide as electron mediators was determine (around -1200 mV in our case) in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment. Then, the current intensity of AOX redox reaction to various concentrations of ethanol was measured in the amperometry experiment. Finally, according to the results, we plotted a concentration calibration curve which can be utilized to calculate the unknown concentration of an alcohol sample.
This year, we made the impossible possible. We proved the feasibility of the blood alcohol meter prototype in the lab and in a simulator. We believe it could be applied to measure the blood alcohol in the near future, and provides an alternative method for the field sobriety test  in addition to the breathalyzer."

OUR PROJECT
Abstract
Modern ""lithography"" has made images vividly printed on pages and animations vigorously projected on screens. From that point, we move a step forward. Our project aims to conceive and construct a colorful bio-imaging system, on which once you project an image, ideally, the bio-system would exactly print it out on the substrate. To accomplish this, novel bio-bricks (light sensors & color printers), Caulobacter crescentus (a type of sticky bacterium) and riboswitches were utilized to conceptually make the system colorful, clear and compact. The results did prove this idea sound in principle, although further evaluation is required. We have managed to build light sensing circuits of three colors and a motion control device in C.crescentus. Furthermore, RNA logical gates were built in vivo as potential substitutes for certain parts of the system with hopefully unprecedented effectiveness.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

These factors would prove difficult for even the most intelligent sociopath trained in synthetic biology; it would be even more difficult for the second source of bioterrorism identified – the ‘biohacker’.  Analogous to the computer hacker, the media and to a lesser extent academia stoke fears of what these “biopunks” or the Open Wetware or DIY Biology movement may do.  Tucker and Zilinskas describe the ‘biohacker’ as ‘an individual who does not necessarily have malicious intent but seeks to create bioengineered organisms out of curiosity or to demonstrate his technical prowess—a common motivation of many designers of computer viruses.  The reagents and tools used in synthetic biology will eventually be converted into commercial kits, making it easier for biohackers to acquire them. Moreover, as synthetic-biology training becomes increasingly available to students at the college and possibly even high-school levels, a “hacker culture” may emerge, increasing the risk of reckless or malevolent experimentation.’
So to conclude, despite their earlier assertion about state biological warfare programs, the main threats of bioterrorism are sociopathic loners and irresponsible students who don’t know any better.  A demonstration of how there is already ample legislation allowing authorities to act against suspected individuals, as well as some indication of the level of competence and situational awareness available to the enforcers of these laws came from the Steven Kurtz case (CAE Defense Fund, 2009).  Of course the threat of bioterrorism is real, however given that the 2002 announcement of a successful synthesis of polio virus from oligonucleotides received from a commercial supplier based on the viral genome acquired from the internet by Dr Wimmer (Josefson, 2002), (Tucker, 2006) and (Balmer, 2008), given that that research was funded by $3m (Josefson, 2002),  from the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), who along with the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Energy (DoE) have injected ‘significant’ amounts of money into the field, including $3 million from the DoD to Dr Venter’s Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives.  DARPA are also said to be particularly interested in DNA computing. (Bhutkar, 2005).

Collaboration - Help Other Teams
We have helped UC Davis iGEM team this year. Part of UC Davis’s team project aims to develop and implement an experimental data depot for biobrick characterization data. We have joined the collaboration to produce a multi-lab, extensive characterization of a commonly used part library based on their protocol and requirements.
We measured the fluorescent kinetics in an 18-hour period to characterize several members of a promoter family. The parts we choose to characterize are J23101, J23112, J23113, J23114, J23115, J23116, J23117, J23118, J23119 in iGEM 2013 Kit Distribution as well as J23108, J23109, J23111 in 2012 iGEM Kit Distribution. Then we preliminary processed all the raw data and send them to UC Davis’s iGEMers together with the information of the plate reader we used and the measurement conditions.
The results (as a downloadable table in UC Davis' project) are partly shown as

Why these parts?
Fig.1 Reaction catalyste by tesA (picture from iGEM11_Utah_State )
Since some of the genes used in the project had unique and useful features, they were chosen for submission to the iGEM biobrick parts database. They have the potential to improve and speed up projects of future iGEM teams that pick E. coli as their organism of choice.
BBa_K2850000:Acyl-ACP Thioesterase (TesA)
For this matter it was decided to submit a mutated variant of the tesA gene of 3 codons (S122K, Y145K, and L146K) that should influence the fatty acid composition produced by the E. coli by shifting it from a C16/C18 heavy composition to a C12/14 favoured scenario. The mutations where proposed and tested in the paper: “Computational Redesign of Acyl-ACP Thioesterase with Improved Selectivity toward Medium-Chain-Length Fatty Acids” by Matthew J. Grisewood et. al.. The effects of this mutations fit perfectly for the project since the fatty acids produced were exactly the ones needed for the palm kernel oil alternative the work was aimed at. Since those fatty acids are harder to attain in high quantities than longer chain fatty acids this gene is a good addition to the iGEM biobrick database.
BBa_K2850001: Acyltransferase (atfA)
The second Biobrick that was picked for submission was the atfA gene from Acinetobacter bayliy ADP1 since it gives E. coli the capabilities to assemble the produced fatty acids into triacylglycerides. We found a Biobrick part on the Database that already included this gene but only with added MoClo sites which were not needed for our purposes. It was decided to submit an improved version of this gene better fit for direct implementation into E. coli. To achieve this goal, the gene was codon optimized for E. coli and a strong RBS from the database (BBa_B0030) was added for a good expression rate. This biobrick is more specialized than the previous one since triacylglycerides are usually produced in other organisms with lipid droplets for storage, but short chain fatty acids like the C12 fatty acid lauric acid are unf"

Carbon Fixation
Project Overview
Introduction
Carbon fixation in autotrophic organisms is responsible for the net fixation of 7×1016 g carbon annually Berg IA. Ecological aspects of the distribution of different autotrophic CO2 fixation pathways. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 2011;77(6):1925-36. . Six different pathways related to carbon fixation have been discovered, but the most widespread of these, is the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle found in photosynthetic eukaryotes, e.g. plants and algae, as well as in photo- and chemosynthetic bacteria B. Bowien MG, R. Klintworth, U. Windhövel. Metabolic and Molecular Regulation of the CO2-assimilating Enzyme System in Aerobic Chemoautotrophs.  Microbial Growth on C1 Compounds: Proceedings of the 5th International Symposion. 1st ed. Institute for Microbiology, Georg-August-University Göttingen, Federal Republic of Germany: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers; 1987. . Out of the eleven enzymes needed for the Calvin cycle, only three are heterologous to E. coli, namely: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo), sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK). By the concurrent heterologous expression of the three genes encoding these enzymes, E. coli can be engineered to perform the full Calvin cycle.

The carboxysome is a microcompartment utilised by many chemoautotrophic bacteria, including cyanobacteria, as a CO2 accumulating mechanism to increase carbon fixation efficiency.

The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 40 seconds and an annealing temperature of 65 °C, 30 cycles. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 4°C.
The PCR gave positive bands for all the spiked samples. But also for the negative control, the unspiked serum. After redoing of this PCR for the non spiked and spiked samples using the two EPO primer combinations 072+073 and 074+075 it became clear that there was a contamination in the non spiked serum samples.
To avoid further contaminations the PCR reagents were tested with PCR on contaminations by using different reagents and also the reagents of the extraction kit were tested. There was no contamination in these reagents.

The second transcription unit   that codes for GFP only was first constructed in another plasmid and later inserted into the first plasmid by   Biobrick Standard Assembly. We also constructed one plasmid for the control group that only had the second   transcription unit encoding GFP. After construction, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)   cells. We also designed an advanced part with one Linker2 and one flexible linker Linker3 between the INPNC and Linker1, but it was not tested (see BBa_K1378009 ).
Figure 8. The final construct of the “Binding” plasmid. One transcription unit that expresses INPNC-MVN and one that expresses GFP are inserted into the same plasmid pSB1C3. GFP is expressed under the constitutive promoter J23117 while INPNC-MVN is expressed under the constitutive promoter J23105. INPNC and MVN are separated by Linker1 which is a 10aa flexible protein domain linker.
We carried out this binding test with M. aeruginosa FACHB-1343. The cells of the experiment group and control group were both incubated till their   OD600 reached 0.6. Then both E. coli and M. aeruginosa were applied to short period of mild sonication   to break up the colony formed and harvested by centrifugation and PBS washing. E. coli and M.   aeruginosa were co-incubated and observed under fluorescence microscope afterwards. We used microscopic counting   to quantify the binding effect.
The binding assay was carried out with both the experimental group and the control group. Each test was done for several times to make the results persuasive. We randomly chose 18 views for both the experimental group and the control goup. Every view was observed in the blue and green channel respectively and later merged together to see the binding effect. The binding effect of the experimental group is shown below in Fig. 9.

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," hold more “fast” codons, which will lead to higher translation elongation rate and thus higher protein expression, whereas the slow regions will hold more “slow” codons leading to lower expression. This data is summarized in the following figure.
Codon Frequency in Fast and Slow regions of the Genome
Fast codons show a positive correlation between frequency and TIR, slow codons show a negative correlation
Ng, C. Y., Farasat, I., Zomorrodi, A. R., Maranas, C. D. & Salis, H. M. Model-guided construction and optimization of synthetic metabolism for chemical product synthesis. Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center Spring Retreat (2013), Berkeley, CA.
Codons whose frequency increases with TIR are defined as fast codons. Those with declining frequency in relation to TIR are slow codons, and those with no correlation are defined as independent of TIR. This can be viewed in the figure above as the slope of the graphs for each codon showing ratio and TIR. If ratio increases with TIR, the codon is fast, and the graph displays positive slope. Slow codons slow negative slope, and TIR independent codons show essentially no slope.
Example of a fast codon. Notice that the codon is more frequent in higher TIR regions of the genome.
In another related research project, researchers developed a program which models the process of translation elongation. This program takes into account the chemical binding of individual codons to ribosomes as well as numerous other relevant biological criteria and is able to predict the time taken by a ribosome to add an amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain. This is known as the “insertion time” for that codon. Using this software, a list of the insertion times for each codon was compiled. It is theorized that codons with longer insertion times will have lower translation elongation rates and thus lower the expression of the protein of the particular CDS that contains the slow codons. This data is summarized in the table below.
Codons with faster insertion times are theorized to lead to higher protein expression.
2) Apply These Criteria to a Reporter Gene (GFP)
It is important to understand the difference between the slow, fast, rare, common, and insertion times criteria. Common and rare codons are based on the frequency of particular degenerate codons in the entire E. coli genome. The hypothesis that common codons will lead to higher expression of proteins is based on the idea that cells have become optimized through evolution to efficiently translate proteins necessary to their survival."

Introduction
We believe SMORE should be accessible to every researcher who needs it and everyone who likes to learn about                 it. An accessibility regardless of academic background is important to innovation through interdisciplinary                 research, a notion we explored in the Interdisciplinarity page.
Nonetheless, an exchange of skillset and knowledge can be difficult. Technical language forms communication barriers.                 A steep learning curve hinders the gain of new skills. How can we make SMORE an accessible platform that                 promotes interdisciplinarity?
We improved the accessibility of SMORE in five aspects: readability, teaching the principle of recombination, hardware, user experience and data. These help                 our project to become easier to understand to use, as a step to diversify the field of synthetic biology.
Readability
To provide everyone with the opportunity to understand SMORE, our first step was to increase the readability                 of our wiki.
Introduction is where most readers start from. And technical details in later paragraphs are often reserved for                 the experienced and the interested. Therefore, we decided to write introductory paragraphs on main pages in a highly                 readable language, as they are targeted to a wide audience.
The readability of the introductions was carefully set to a 12th Grade student level. This is because the iGEM                 community includes high-school students. And thus, synthetic biology topics should be available and understood                 by a high-school level audience.
To obtain an estimate on readability, we chose the Dale-Chall formula over other readability indices [1]. Unlike                 other indices, result of the Dale-Chall formula does not depend on the number of syllables. Many scientific                 terms with a high syllable count have no short and accurate substitutes. For example, “significance” has many                 syllables, but it is irreplaceable in scientific statistics. Moreover, our skill exchange survey showed that                 technical language, when used moderately and precisely, also helps understanding. Dale-Chall formula does                 not weigh heavily on syllables, and directly measures the difficulty of words. This encourages us to explain                 the difficult words, rather than to use inaccurate substitutes.

Fig. 17. SMILES comparison page of Alpha Ant. Software Assessment: Results validation： We visit Shanghai R&D center of Meihua Group in September. Meihua Group is one of the largest MSG manufacturers in the world. It is the largest amino acid producer in China and an important member of the global bio-fermentation field. Their R&D center is dedicated to do research in amino acid production by bio-fermentation. There are several mature production lines for amino acid, which utilizes pathway engineering. We used these efficient pathways to evaluate the results of our software.

Aspects to be improved We visit R&D center of Cathay Industrial Biotech in September. Cathay Industrial Biotech focus on the industrialization of bio-manufacturing technology and practices, which have already achieved large-scale industrialization including long-chain dibasic acids, biobutanol, biopentylamine, and bio-based polyamides.
Fig. 19. We visit R&D center of Cathay Industrial Biotech in September. We had an in-depth discussion with R&D staffs. They pointed out many aspects in our software to be improved based on their years of research and development experience. Due to lack of time, we decided to made future plans as follows. Future plan1: The optimum conditions for each reactions’ enzymes may be different, we will take into accont the positions and optimum conditions of each reaction’s enzyme when ranking pathway to guarantee that the recommended optimal pathway will achieve the highest efficiency under the same condition. Future plan2:There are other factors should be taken into account when evaluating the pathway, such as primary metabolite or secondary metabolite,growth phase or fermentation period of microorganism. We learned that in the production of industrial compounds, producers tend to use microbial fermentation in an anaerobic environment to reduce the biomass energy consumption and achieve high productity. So we will take the types of metabolite and growth state of microorganism into account when optimising pathway. Future plan3: We will consider about modyfing existing enzymes to improve efficiency of pathway. Enzymes are often engineered to carry out new functions in the context of synthetic metabolic pathways. Enzyme modification is a challenging and promising solution for improving pathway efficiency. We are planning to read related literature and develop this excitiing funcion"

Our results
        What we found is exemplified below- reoccurring trends within individual news sources correlating very well for some news sources, and poorly in other cases. For example, title length positively correlates to ""likability"" for Millions against Monsanto and Buzzfeed, but is anti-correlative with the New York Times. In short, no systemic, cross-source patterns of metric correlation were found.
       But these trends are superb within a news source! So we began to think these pattern arise from the followers of each news sources. People who follow Buzzfeed are slightly drawn towards articles with longer titles, whereas New York Timers like succinct information. This principle extends to the problem at hand- people who have a certain opinion follow news sources that strongly propagate that opinion and are likely subject to the same preferences in ""click-bait"".        At this point, we performed a correlative analysis between each metric to identify the principle components of each news source. Each source had a unique signature as to what metrics strongly correlated to their ""likability"". For example, the New York Times had a strongly negative correlation to adjective content in titles and average title length as their first two principle components, followed by a positive correlation to proper noun usage. Indeed, we can also confirm this intuitively, as the New York Times is typically recognized as an objective news source that is frequently trafficked for breaking news stories, full of names and places with little adjective padding.
Healthy communication = Healthy relationships
       Finally, we return to biotechnology and how the scientists should talk to the public. Let's consider Millions Against Monsanto as our test group, which draws much of its following from those vividly fearful articles against GMOs. We can characterize the principle components of the news source, and design a title that others following this group would be more likely to click and possibly like. With the red bars in the figure below corresponding to negative correlation and blue corresponding to positive correlation, we can extrapolate this to decisions we would make when crafting articles representing our views. Lower adjective count and lower verb count in titles of articles are correlated to a higher number of likes. The power of this tool is limited only by our ability to target the correct demographics. With it, we hope to utilize what has proven effective in reaching the public in order to return science and reason to the evolving conversation about synthetic biology.

LZU-China,2015,Team:LZU-China#project_-_-_TEXT.html," and how he works?
First of all Mr. Holmes must has a piercing eye to find the trail of pollutant; And after detecting pollutant, Mr. Holmes must has the ability to convey the message to us in time. Therefore, in order to constitute a series of inductivity parts which can be efficiently expressed in E.Coli BL 21 bacterial strains we link the efficient receptor of heavy metal ions with ribB--- the key synthesis gene of riboflavin. They can translate the information from the concentration of heavy metal ions to the riboflavin content, which is the product of reporter gene ribB. Riboflavin is a kind of redox mediator who works as a highly-efficient electronic transfer mediator. When the concentration of Riboflavin increased, it can improve the efficiency of electronic translocation between E.Coli and the anode and eventually augment the voltage. Combined with MFC (microbial fuel cell) system, we can measure the concentration of heavy metal ions in water through the voltage presented by MFC system and realize the conversion of heavy metal ions concentration to electrical signal. This method has lots of advantages, such as compatibility, high efficiency, instantaneity, reliability and so on.
The main idea of designing this experiment can be seen in the following flow chart.
Fig 1 Whole Experiment Flow Chart
In this project, parts were divided into two kinds. One is constitutive part, combined by various type of promoter, RBS, ribB and terminator. We constructed the constitutive parts to select a highly-expressed part of ribB. The other is inducible part with RBS, ribB terminator and promoter which can sense heavy metal ions. This kind of parts can highly express ribB so that it is practical to associate the concentration of heavy metal ions with the output of riboflavin. Therefore, putting the E.Coli BL 21 into the MFC, we collected the statistics of MFC on the condition that concentration of metal ion solution was already known. So we built the correlation model, then induced the E.Coli BL21 with the solution to be measured. It is easy to figure out the concentration by measuring the voltage of MFC. We can monitor the specific metal ions real-timely, quantitatively and swiftly through this way and more importantly, it has compatibility in the measurement of metal ion by changing the parts to detect different metal ions.

2. The model has helped us to gain insights into how we can further improve the phosphate-temperature sensor. See below for more details.
Design and Specifications
Input Sensors
The Engineered Probiotic Kill Switch uses a Phosphate Promoter (BBa_K116401) and a Temperature Promoter (plTpA36). With more sensors, the user can increase specificity and develop more complex logic.
We choose to use these two sensors because when used together, they offer sensitivity between all the environments involved, and therefore allow controlled activation for killing the engineered probiotic in the correct wastewater conditions. (See Figure 1)
Output Killing Mechanism
To kill the engineered probiotic, we employ use of the E2 Toxin that is standardised in our proposed approach. We use the E2 Toxin because it can degrade Host DNA, whilst posing little threat to the gut microbiota.
We control killing by controlling the expression of the anti-toxin, IM2. With little or no expression of the IM2 anti-toxin, the constitutively expressed E2 toxin will kill the engineered probiotic.
State Diagram
It is important to consider the application lifecycle during the design stage. For our engineered probiotics application, we expect the engineered probiotic to travel through four different states.
In the Transportation stage, the engineered probiotic is stored in its packaging conditions, such that it is ready to be transported or consumed. It is stored in a high phosphate solution. The temperature in this condition is irrelevant.
In the Ingestion Stage, the engineered probiotic resides in the intestines. In the intestines, the probiotic is in a high phosphate concentration and high temperature (body temperature) condition.
In the Colon Stage, the engineered probiotic resides in the Colon. In the Colon stage, much of the phosphate has been absorbed by the small intestine. Hence, the engineered probiotic is in a low phosphate and high temperature condition (body temperature).
In the Wastewater Stage, or the Excretion stage, the probiotic exists in wastewater and has been exposed to outside low temperatures. The low phosphate and low temperature environment triggers activation of the killing mechanism.

Phosphate = 1 refers to a high concentration of phosphate, Phosphate = 0 refers to a low concentration of phosphate. Temperature = 1 refers to greater than 36°C conditions, Temperature = 0 refers to lower than 36°C conditions, Temperature = X refers"

Sensing Module
Overview / Rationale
In order to control the expression in a population of cells, it is essential that the signal can propagate from one         cell to another. It is therefore, important to consider the diffusion of signals. Signals should be able to pass         through cell membrane and cell wall, from cytoplasm to the outside environment, and vice versa. Adding a positive         feedback loop can enhance the transmission of the signal through the population
To ensure the knockout process occurs in every single cell, we select the diffusible signals that a bacterium can produce         quickly. This inducer is the 3O6CHSL, or AHL molecule.
Sensing Module Construct
Diagram 1. Sensing Module Construct
Positive feedback loop mechanism
Diagram 2. Positive feedback loop mechanism
Experimental Construct
Diagram 3. Experimental Construct
Our Design
The function of the sensing module is to detect the deliberately released stimulus and initiate the process of “knockout”.         Considering that the released stimulus can become diluted in an environment, a positive feedback loop is included         to amplify the signal. Thus, 3OC6HSL, which is a member of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) family, was chosen as the         inducer. 3OC6HSL, originally from V. fischeri, is a lipid molecule that can diffuse through bacterial cell         membrane, facilitating cell-to-cell communication.
The sensing module begins with the TetR repressible promoter or pTetR (BBa_R0040), which can be treated as constitutive         promoter of LuxR protein (BBa_C0062) under no repressor TetR. This segment of the biosensor works to produce an abundance         of LuxR. Once the 3OC6HSL is added to the cell environment, LuxR forms a complex with 3OC6HSL and then activates         downstream promoter, pLuxR (BBa_R0062).

In the absence of Autoinducer-2, LsrR repress the LsrR promoter to bind LsrR-Binding Site. In the presence of AI-2 extracellular AI-2 is imported into the cell (cytoplasmic AI-2) via LsrACDB transporter, where it is phosphorylated by LsrK. LsrK is a kinase responsible for converting AI-2 to phospho-AI-2, which is required for relieving LsrR repression. Phospho-AI-2 has been reported to bind to LsrR and relieve its repression effect on the lsrR promoter.
3. Toehold System
Toehold switches provide a high level of orthogonality and can be forward engineered to provide average dynamic range above 400. Toehold switches, with their wide dynamic range, orthogonality, and programmability, represent a versatile and powerful platform for regulation of translation, offering diverse applications in molecular biology, synthetic biology, and biotechnology.New classes of regulatory components that offer wide dynamic range, low system crosstalk, and design flexibility represent a much-needed, enabling step toward fully realizing the potential of synthetic biology in areas such as biotechnology and medicine. (Khalil and Collins, 2010).
Engineered riboregulators consist of cognate pairs of RNAs: a transducer strand that regulates translation or transcription and a trans-acting RNA that binds to the transducer to modulate its biological activity. Riboregulator designs can be classified according to the initial RNA-RNA interaction that drives hybridization between the transducer and trans-acting RNAs. Reactions initiated between loop sequences in both RNAs are termed loop-loop interactions, whereas those that occur between a loop sequence and an unstructured RNA are termed loop-linear(Takahashi and Lucks, 2013).
A common limitation for riboregulators has been their dynamic range (Liu et al., 2012). Previous prokaryotic translational riboregulators have typically modulated biological signals by up to a maximum of 55-fold for activators (Callura et al., 2012) and up to 10-fold for repressors (Mutalik et al., 2012). In contrast, protein-based transcriptional regulators have demonstrated dynamic ranges over an order of magnitude higher, with widely-used inducible promoters regulating protein expression over 350-fold (Lutz and Bujard, 1997) and sigma factor-promoter pairs providing up to"

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Notebook#July2011_-_-_TEXT.html," but we don't know what we have.
Alessandro made the transformation of the Repressilator plasmid because we haven't a sufficient amount to start PCRs. Once we have that plasmid we can re-do PCRs to get the part for the Gibson assembly (RFP/Lysis plasmids). Alessandro also designed the primers to do the colony-PCR wich we'll help us in a faster fashion to screen colony with the correct plasmid from the gibson assembly (instead of making minipreps and the following DNA digestion).
Douglas prepared agar-ampicillin plates for the mutagenesis, and transformed a pF3A plasmid with GFP (and ampicillin resistance). It can be used for a trial run of mutagenesis if the gibson assembled tetR plasmid is not yet available. He also transformed some repressilator, so we should have plenty to keep us going for a while. Also, Nadine debriefed him on her work for the past few weeks, so he can take over while she is on holiday.
Thursday, 21 July 2011
Douglas and Alessandro inoculated the colonies transformed with the repressilator plasmid to make minipreps the following day. Alessandro also made the LB broth (because one bottle got contaminated) and distilled water.
Gel from our first attempt to replicate Nadine's PCR, to create fragments for the J61002-based reporter plasmid. None of the expected products show up: they should all be between 700 b and 2.4 kb
Douglas and Alessandro repeated Nadine's unsuccessful PCR, to make the fragments for Gibson assembly of the 'reporter plasmid' (pTet-lacI-pLac-RFP/Lysis). The PCR was just as unsuccessful, showing no trace of the expected products, as shown on the figure to the right. The fragments being assembled are:
A J61002 backbone amplified from the J61002-pTet-RFP plasmid
LacI amplified from the Repressilator plasmid
pLac-RFP from the T4 Lysis plasmid
OR pLac-T4Lysis also from the J61002-pTet-RFP plasmid
We found two similarly labelled tubes containing J61002-pTet-RFP, so we used both for our PCRs. The 'bis' reactions used the plasmid miniprepped by Allesandro, labelled in green writing. The 'non"

We have sent those data to the team BUCT-China to analyse.
After testing the effect of different fatty acids on the fluorescence amount of chassis, we Shared our completed Tetracycline HPLC Protocol with them, and it is also hoped that BUCT can help us take water samples nearby their campus and measure tetracycline concentration in water.
After several days of measurement, we got the results of tetracycline content measured by BUCT-China in waters near BUCT campus.
It can be seen that the tetracycline content in Beijing area river is keeping in a low degree, but there still containing some other pollution substance.
We are very grateful for the cooperation of BUCT-China iGEMer, and we hope we our teams can keep in touch closely in the future.
Collaboration with  iGEM Tec CEM 2018

CarAd/B0034 was successfully plasmid switched into PSB1C3, making it ready for submission. Construction of J13002 and CarAa may have been successful as the digest of the miniprep looked promising. It will be sent for sequencing next week. Unfortunately there was no progress made on the constructions of AmdA with J13002 or CarAc with B0034. These will be redigested and religated for next week. We could not amplify the Ant operon despite trying many variations of PCR using high fidelity KAPA polymerase. This is probably due to the multiple, large regions of homology on the operon that the reverse primer binds to making amplification difficult. Because the function of this gene can theoretically be replaced by AmdA, we may scale back efforts dedicated to it, as the chances of successful amplification appear slim.
Week 20 (September 10 - September 14)
Denitrogenation
Constructs that continued this week included AmdA with J13002, CarAa with J13002, and CarAc with B0034. Some sequencing was sent, but no positive results were obtained. A new approach to biobrick the Ant operon was implemented this week. A new forward primer was designed that would anneal about 1500 base pairs upstream of the Ant operon, avoiding the region of homology that is repeated at various points on the plasmid. Once this region is successfully amplified we could use this amplified DNA as a template for another PCR reaction which would use the normal Ant primers. Since the template would no longer include regions of homology these primers should be free to work properly and amplify the Ant operon. The PCR using the new primers was started this week, and although amplification at 4500 base pairs was observed as expected, there was also a lot of non-specific amplification. This means that to purify the amplified DNA that we want and avoid the other products we will have to perform a dreaded gel extraction next week.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Labwork#MoreProtocols#DNAGel_-_-_TEXT.html," when putting gel in microwave, keep checking on it regularly (once every 30-40 secs) – it must not be left unattended!***
Using gloves, remove the gel from the microwave and check it for any solids. If it has completely melted, leave it somewhere to cool.
Image 1 shows what the agarose solution should look like - as a clear liquid with no solid agarose present
Preparing the buffer
Image 2: Top bottle (circled)= 50x TAE buffer; lower bottle (circled)= 1x TAE buffer
The buffer we use for DNA gel electrophoresis is called TAE (Tris-acetate-EDTA) – WE NEVER USE WATER! To make up a stock solution of this buffer at 50x concentration TAE, use:
242 grams of Tris
57.1 ml of Glacial Acetic Acid
100 ml of 0.5M EDTA (pH 8.0)
Make up volume to 1 litre using DEIONISED WATER
From this stock solution make up a 1x concentrated TAE solution.
Image 2 shows where the solutions of TAE buffer can be found (the shelf is located near the DNA gel electrophoresis machine, centrifuge and shaker incubator). The top red circle indicates the 50x concentrated TAE buffer; the bottom yellow circle indicates the 1x concentrated TAE buffer. For the electrophoresis, use the 1x TAE buffer. If it runs out, MAKE UP NEW 1x BUFFER FROM 50x TAE BUFFER and place it on the appropriate shelf
Preparing the gel electrophoresis trays
Image 3: Jane showing what we mean by the comb and the DNA gel electrophoresis tray
Image 4: Jane showing the manner in which the comb should be inserted into the tray - the groove near the edge of the tray
Make sure that a clean tray is prepared before carrying out procedure. This must be cleaned using de-ionised water and then with the buffer in which the electrophoresis will be conducted in.
Make sure that the tray has been dried completely using a paper towel.
Make sure that there is a clean, dry comb (cleaned in the same format as the tray).
Insert the comb into the groove of the plate (nearest the end).
Place the tray along with comb in proximity of the electrodes.
Image 3 shows the electrophoresis tray and the comb as separate items - make sure they are both cleaned and dried!

Toronto,2013,Team:Toronto#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," dilutions of CF, CV, CR and EtBr planned out. Need to find a cell lysis solution for EtBr since it binds with DNA. Data will be analyzed with Excel.
08/09
Microscope slides were made containing cultures from all 23 strains. The crystal  violet and calcofluor dye plates were read on the fluorescence spec. A serial dilution of 1:2 was done across 3 rows of the washed black plate for  calcofluor, starting from 1:100 dilution of 1 g/L. A serial dilution of 1:5 of original  CR solution was done. Both sets of data were read on the spec in the Houry Lab. Graphs were prepared for the initial CV serial dilution, the recent CR and CF  data.Worked on motility assay validation.
08/10
Overnight cultures of MG, BW, (delta)csgD, (delta)fimH and (delta)ompR were  made.
Worked on using different strains for validating motility assay.
08/11
A 1:2 serial dilution of a 1:100 dilution of 0.1% CV solution was done.  Absorbance readings were taken. EtBr protocol was modified.
To get the standard dilution curve of EtBr, we placed cells inside and add increasing  volumes of ethanol:acetic acid.
Measured OD600 for MG1655 and B25113 and dropped 1 microlitre onto the motility  plates.
08/12
The EtBr protocol was performed over 4 h. 3 rows had a constant volume and  concentration of EtBr, whereas 3 others had a constant of EtOH: acetic acid  solution. 3 control wells had Milli-Q, 3 had EtBr and LB, 3 had EtOH: acetic acid  and LB. Regular and kan CR plates were made. 2 replicates were made for each type of plate with MG and BW to test whether the glycerol stocks of the WT  strains are contaminated.
08/13
Decided that motility assay needs to be repeated by just dipping the pipette tip into the  overnight culture. Made a new batch of motility plates and made 70% EtOH.
The EtBr protocol was repeated with a 1:10 dilution of 0.5 mg/mL EtBr. CR + BB  plates were used to replate glycerol stocks of wild type strains.

Started kill switch assays on colicin E2 and BamHI. Colicin E2 is on the SOS promoter, which is best switched on by mitomycin. However, we currently do not have access to mitomycin or any of its closely related derivatives, so, judging by the previous;y mentioned paper, it might be able to be induced by b-lactam antibiotics in low concentrations.
Procedure outline: Dilute 1:100 22A, 3C and wt strains in 25 mL LB. Measure OD every hour. At start of exponential phase, add arabinose to 0.01% or amp to 4 ug/mL to strain+control. Plate 25 uL 2 hours later, mid exponential phase. Details to follow.

A highly specific test will have lots of false negatives but few false positives. Switch to high sensitivity .
The sensitivity and specificity of a screening tool depend on the cutoffs used on a Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and as one increases the other is likely to decrease. Depending on the type of screening we want to do, we can alter the cutoffs on the ROC curve.
For a high-risk screening (e.g. heavy smokers for NSCLC), we would set the cut-offs at 100% sensitivity so it would always pick up NSCLC, and compromise on the specificity which would be at 84%. For mass population screening, we would use a 100% specificity cut-off which would cause the sensitivity to be 56%. The cutoffs here are based on Hennessy et al.'s ROC curve for miRs-15b-5p and 27b-3p in diagnosing NSCLC. [3]
The ROC curve for the two miRNAs we are using is shown here. The area under curve (AUC) of 98% represents the accuracy of the test.

Graph reproduced from data provided in Hennessey et al.'s paper [3]
The choice to use high specificity for mass population ensures would minimize false positive rates for cost efficiency necessary for population wide screening. However, the low sensitivity means that some people with cancer may not be referred for further testing, and are thus left untreated. Through using many miRNA signatures in tandem, we would try to reduce the rate of false negatives.  The goal of mass population screening is also to pick up as many people with a cancer, as early as possible, not everyone, meaning the lower sensitivity would be acceptable.
In the case of high risk screening, the low specificity (and thus higher false positive rate) is less problematic than it may seem, as the ratio of positives to negatives in the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset"

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer."

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Our circuit, the Tristable Switch, has many possible functions, ranging from bio-computing, cell differentiation to biosensors.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", and in turn, eliminates at least 4 burdensome steps from the overall design.
Week 30
After multiple design iterations based on literature and consultations with field experts we have decided it is time to start building different parts from our system.
.
Building CAT-Seq
Week 31
We have started to build our first activity recording system prototype and immediately found the first issue with our initial prototype: the usage of circular ssDNA template.
More
Firstly, it was extremely difficult to make circularized ssDNA templates, as ssDNA is highly unstable and the strand removal from dsDNA and circularization reactions were resulting in low yields even after weeks of various optimizations.
Secondly, the final elongated DNA concentration we got in each droplet after the prototype workflow was extremely low. Each time, it was sub-nanogram amounts of DNA. That was because initially in each droplet there was on average one template of circularized ssDNA. As phi29 elongates that ssDNA template during the amplification step, it still does not make enough of a difference to increase the DNA yield significantly, even when generating millions of droplets in a single experiment. Moreover, after phi29 elongates the ssDNA molecule it creates another long ssDNA molecule, therefore second strand synthesis needs to be performed, which is also far from 100 percent efficient. Considering that nanopore sequencing requires at least of 100 ng to 1000 ng of starting template, we immediately knew we had a serious prototype design flaw in our hands.
Close
Week 32
In hopes of finding a quick and elegant solution to our problem stemming from the usage of single stranded DNA template we have met with Audrius Laurynėnas from the Institute of Biochemistry at Vilnius University.
More
We knew that Audrius has in-depth knowledge about Phi29 and similar isothermal polymerases. We have discussed about different ways that phi29 or any other isothermal polymerase could be applied to our case to solve our current issues.
The meeting was concluded with the idea to try and use the Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) reaction together with random hexamers instead of elongating one long single stranded DNA molecule from the circular ssDNA template. Firstly, this would both allow us to use double stranded circular DNA which would make the preparation for experiments much quicker and easier. Secondly, in each droplet the MDA reaction would yield a lot more DNA.
Audrius also suggested that we should model our MDA reaction first in order to know what length distribution of product we should expect and what effect the substrate nucleotide might have"

Modelling & Prototype Journal
Week 1: May 5th - May 9th
Modelling team formed. The big idea discussed during the week was to digitalize the proposed diagnostic test using an Arduino Uno microcontroller or Raspberry Pi. The idea was based on glucose meters for diabetics with the potential for disposable strips with the device to reduce cost per test.  As we brainstorm ideas it is important for us to remember that we are designing this for developing nations often with less resources.  We looked into the advantages and disadvantages of Arduino Uno vs Raspberry Pi and how they operate. Currently, the Arduino Uno seems to be a more suitable choice for our purposes as it works well with simple programs and has many applicable functions. We looked into how to program an Arduino Uno microcontroller and started writing simple programs to familiarize ourselves with microcontroller. As part of the digital reporter circuit that will be designed and wired, we are looking into using a sensor to detect a change from the biological reaction. We researched different sensors that are compatible with the microcontroller and we found that there are Arduino Uno sensors that for light, colour, current, methane, ethanol, carbon dioxide, propane, butane, and H2.   We also researched the basics of microfluidics and the potential application this could have with our designs for the project. Additionally, everyone on the team participated in workshops on DNA and cell biology, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and PCR optimization, DNA extraction, cloning and transformation, bioinformatics,"

Duesseldorf,2016,Team:Duesseldorf#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html,"th Information Day about Cancer at the “Haus der Universität”, where we learned a lot about the progress that was made in cancer treatment therapy.
We Skyped with a former iGEM member of Freiburg, who worked on AAVs in 2010.
Talking to cancer patients gave us an impressive insight into a life with and the fight against cancer.
A survey on the general acceptance for gene therapy.
Human Practice: Education in Public
Postcard exchange
Raising public awareness not only about our project, but also about synthetic biology in general was always of high importance for us. We thought that other German iGEM teams may share that thought, so we decided to develop a concept in order to raise public awareness and make it possible for the other teams to do so as well. But how do you do that?
The concept our team developed was rather simple yet convincing: Every participating team has to design a postcard with an interesting image which is related to their project on the front and a little information text about synthetic biology on the back; unifying the lore of synthetic biology with fascinating, eye-catching images. A batch of each team’s postcards is then exchanged between the participating teams and then distributed by them.
After we finished creating our concept, we contacted the other German iGEM teams and presented them our concept. It was received really well and seven teams ( Aachen , Bielefeld , Bonn , Goettingen , Darmstadt , Hannover , Tübingen ) decided to join us and design their own postcard. The postcards were exchanged and then distributed by each team at several events like the NRW day or our public lecture at the “Haus der Universität”. We hope that by combining stunning images with short texts about synthetic biology, we are able to get people interested in synthetic biology and maybe even the iGEM competition itself.
Public presentation about our project, iGEM and synthetic biology at the House of the University
Informing people about our project and raising awareness about synthetic biology, new methods of cancer treatment and iGEM in general has always been of high importance to us.         Besides lectures at local high schools, several press publications, an info booth and a presentation at the NRW day, we also decided to hold a lecture at the “Haus der Universität”, where admission-free public lectures are held on a regular basis.
The lecture on the evening of the 11th of October was visited by a lot of people, more people than we expected to come. The audience were very diverse: There were Biology-Professors, Bachelor"

The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 276, No. 39. This enzyme proved to recycle the luciferase product oxyluciferin.  Our goal here was to couple both, luciferase and LRE, to be able to make the construction autonomous after the first and single input of luciferin. We sent to synthesize the LRE enzyme.

From 2011.igem.org
Initially, to model the OR operating region a statistical thermodynamic model developed by Gary Ackers, Alexander Johnosn, and Madeline Shea was used. This model appeared in a 1981 paper entitled Quantitative Model For Gene Regulation by Lambda Phage Repressor. The model consisted of the following equation, which related the probability of the OR operator region in configuration 's' to the Gibbs free energy of binding of repressor to that site and the concentration of unbound repressor dimer.
The following graph was produced showing the probability distributions of all eight possible configurations of the model as a function of the unbound repressor dimer concentration in molar.
By summing the probability distributions of specific configurations an overall fraction of repressed operator as a function of unbound dimer can be determined as is shown in the graph below.
This model however was too simplistic in that it only took in to account repressor concentration and not CRO concentration. Therefore this model was ultimately abandoned in favor of a more complex model taking in to account CRO and RNAP concentration inside the cell as well as repressor concentration. This new model, also developed by Madeline Shea and Gary Ackers appeared in the paper The OR Control System of Bacteriophage Lambda A Physical-Chemical Model for Gene Regulation published in 1983. This model had 40 configurations of operator region in it while the previous paper only had 8, which makes for a more accurate representation of real life. Once again it relied on a statistical thermodynamic model of the form:
where Cs is the probability of the operating region being in the specified form, and the values i, j, and k refer to the number of repressor, CRO, and RNAP molecules bound to the OR region respectively and have values from 0 to 3. In this model when specific configurations were summed the probability of RNAP expressing protein could be determined as a function of the repressor and CRO protein concentrations. The following contour plot shows the probability of RNAP being bound to OR3 and repressor at OR2 as a function of the concentrations of CRO protein and repressor protein in nM. This model shows the deactivating nature of CI repressor at PRM and the activating qualities of CRO. At very low concentrations of CI repressor the promoter site is relatively transcriptionally active, while at higher concentrations the RNAP is unable to transcribe protein.
This particular graph was equal"

-A recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody.
-Direct against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)[2][3].
Mechanism of drug:
The binding of Herceptin with extracellular domains of HER2 on cancer cells can prevent the dimerization of HER2 with other HER family member, for example HER1, HER3 and HER4 which cause further intracellular signaling transmission and cell proliferation.
Besides, by binding with HER2, the cancer cells will be flagged for destruction by the immune system which known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
Moreover, the binding between Trastuzumab with HER2 can help prevent the shading of HER2 from cancer cell surfaces[1].

Skype meetup
We had 4 engaging internet discussions with teams that were KAIT_ Japan, Amoy_ China, TU Delft, and Oxford. We always learned so much from each team’s amazing idea. After exchanging ideas, we were amazed by them and what’s more, as we talked to different people from different culture, culture shock and multicultural interaction experience were something we were excited about. With all these cross-cultural meet ups, our lives had been spiced up.

University_of_Ottawa,2008,Team:University of Ottawa#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"SK1 phosphorylation is key to suppressing the yeast’s HOG1 pathway – a stress reponse pathway to high osmolarity, whose activity is lethal under normal conditions. YPD1 also shuttles into the nucleus and activates the SKN7 transcription factor by phosphorylation. In the design, SKN7 was preferred over SSK1 because the SLN1-YPD1-SSK1 pathway is known to affect many high-osmolarity response genes. In order to make SKN7 inducible to IP stimulation (i.e. not constitutively phosphorylated), SLN1 had to be deleted; however, SLN1 deletion is lethal due to activation of the HOG1 pathway. In order to keep the HOG1 pathway silenced in the absence of SLN1, the cells were transformed with a plasmid to overexpress PTP2, an endogenous HOG1 phosphatase, thus rescuing the lethal mutant phenotype.
Using this chassis strain (TM182α) [ 2,3 ], the yeast could now be engineered to express the Arabidopsis CRE1 cytokinin receptor and respond to IP. The Weiss group used the CRE1 strain to express IP-inducible GFP in response to sender cells synthesizing IP, as well as a quorum sensing system where the sender and receiver circuits were incorporated into the same cell to achieve cell density dependent expression.
The Design
Using a CRE1-expressing yeast strain, our goal was to develop a gene regulatory network that would trigger a transient pulse of gene expression upon induction. Many transcription networks in nature have recently been found to contain certain recurring “network motifs” that occur more often than in randomized networks [ 4,5 ]. One type of motif that has been described having pulsing ability is the feedforward loop. Specifically, it is the Incoherent Type 1 Feedforward Loop (FFL), and has the following topology:
Figure I - Incoherent Type 1 Feedforward regulatory motif
Here A, B represent transcriptional regulators of a gene C. If A is inducible, it can turn on genes B and C upon induction. If B-mediated repression of C is strong when induced by A, the result is a pulse generator. The incoherent type I FFL is the most common of all natural feedforward loops in both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as determined by screening transcription network databases [ 5 ], suggesting that the structure may possess an evolutionary robustness.
In our system, the induced transcriptional activator (A) is SKN7 and"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic"

(1) Short but strong, which decreases the possibility of undesired homologous reorganization and provide significant output strength compared with commonly used promoter-terminator pair.
(2) Can work in different yeast strains, which can provide robust function for extensive application.
(3) Has good modularity because of the low transcriptional read through efficiency from minimal terminator, which is an important characteristic in synthetic biology.
Future work
Although we have only constructed one MINI promoter-terminator pair,  we are able to do more in the future, which includes:
(1)Establish a library of similar pairs on its basis
(2)Study the relationship between transcribtion strength and pair strength
(3)Enlarge its function into a toolbox.

JUDGING FORM
Realizing a Light-Inducible Kill Switch
Organisms engineered by synthetic biologists have the potential to deliver new solutions to a wide range of problems. However, they must be implemented in responsible and controlled ways.
For example, last year the Kingsborough team focused on engineering E. coli, to deteriorate nitrogenous waste in sewage more effectively. However, we found that E. coli can survive in local waterways, which is the ultimate destination for wastewater after treatment. To prevent the escape of our organism, and develop this idea further, we are focused this year on improving and characterizing a control element, commonly referred to as a ""Kill Switch."" With this kill switch, we will be able to combat the escape of modified E. coli from the treatment plant.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
We focused on the development of a light-inducible kill switch; since the bacteria will not be exposed to significant amounts of light within the sewage treatment plant. Other teams have proposed and modeled such switches, but few have successfully built, implemented, and characterized such devices. We will be building upon our past design, as well as improving and completing a previously proposed light-inducible kill switch (in particular, the design of team Wageningen from 2016 ).
Thus, the bacteria would create would hopefully be creatures of the night - not unlike the famous Phantom of the Opera!"

The positive feedback loop we found involves in the use of luxR cassette in E.coli. We characterized and found that there's basal expression level under no induction. We, therefore, addressed the issues of promoter leakiness and basal level expression through the use of antisense RNA based on our modelling analysis. Click to see our Modelling Page.

Feedbacks from conference (2017 iGEM Pan-Pearl conference organized by the CUHK 2018 team)
Q1: Is there a chance where random homologous recombination occurs between your recombinant plasmid and bacterial genome                             inside the cell?
Q2: Is there any enzymes that can digest your engineered plasmids instead of using these recombinases?
Q3: How can you eliminate the plasmid after it’s recombined?
Q4: How would you use your construct in particular scenarios. For example, how will your construct help if you accidentally                             spill the GM bacteria into environment?

ADDRESSING ISSUES
In addition to these feedback questions, we looked more into details of our constructs where improvement can further be made                             to reduce the safety issues. We conducted an interview with Prof. Matthew Bennett from Rice University                             in Houston, who is an expert in organism’s genetic system and circuits.
Q1: It was found that even though luxR sequences do not appear in E. coli in nature,                             there is a homologous gene found in E. coli genome called sdiA. The luxR gene, a family of sdiA gene, shares homologous sequence such that random recombination                             between the plasmid and genome may occur many times, although not frequent. We address this problem                             by finding a chassis that has the sdiA gene being knocked out. See strain JW1901-5 2
Q2: Prof. Matthew Bennett commented that endonucleases may be more efficient in targeting multiple restriction sites and                             we have explored some more nucleases that could do the job of DNA degradation. One efficient                             method to target DNA degradation is the use of CRISPR-Cas3 device, where CRISPR nuclease specifically                             degrades the targeted DNA, leaving the non-targeted DNA unaffected 3 There is also a nuclease that can be transiently transcribed in vivo such as Yeast homothallic                             switching endonuclease (HO endo) which recognizes HO recognition sites and cleaves DNA to become                             linearized 4.

Photosystem II Overview
Over 3 billion years of evolution has produced one of the most efficient system of machinery ever produced. The protein in Cyanobacteria, Photosystem II has efficiency of converting light into electrical energy with as high as 95% efficiency. We choose to test our nano-circuit if it can conduct electrical signal via attaching it to the Photosystem II protein.
The photosystem is a highly complex system with multiple subunit and being a membrane protein it needed high amount of attention during experiments to preserve its activity. Using a mutant strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 which has a His-tag on the CP47 subunit"

However, if both systems utilize the same receptor protein, no competitive binding of repressor and activator occurs. Therefore a different receptor is required. In that way the light receptor (desired value) can express A (activator) and the odour receptor can express B (inhibitor).
The blue lagoon
Today was about finding answers to the questions posed yesterday.
We searched for information about the optimal growth temperature for E. coli and temperature profiles for ponds in summer. We found that E. coli can grow in temperatures as low as 7,5 °C, while ponds should be well above 18°C. So, temperature should not be a problem.
We also continued working on the refinement of the ideas for our Blue Lagoon. After a short talk with Inge, we started looking for suitable cyanobacteria to replace E. coli, since it would solve a lot of the problems we were still facing with E. coli.
Our preferred cyanobacterium will be a strain from P. marinus, it will either by the SS120 strain or the MIT9313 (?) strain. Both strains have desirable properties, but we will have to make adjustments to the biobricks if we want to use these.
Tomorrow will be about further searching for information about P. marinus and it's possible use.

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," overcoming current challenges.
To use optogenetics in controlling cellular behaviour, several challenges need to be addressed. We analysed natural mechanisms of tissue development and found different entry points at certain stages in the development. Then, we designed our optogenetic guidance system to hijack the natural systems with minimal changes to the underlying biochemical pathways. In the cells of growing tissue, these are the mechanisms to be controlled through light:
Instantaneous cell adhesion
In order to form structures cells need to form dynamic non-covalent formations in adherens junctions that allow constant remodelling of the structure while still maintaining a high degree of rigidity. The cell adhesion proteins in these junctions are stabilized via connections with the cytoskeleton, most notably actin filaments. Cells forming synthetic tissues therefore need to have the ability to form these connections rapidly in a cell culture that is dividing. In mammalian cells transcription takes around 30 min, translation (incl. mRNA export) another 30 min and further protein sorting and processing is dependent on the type of protein. For the purpose of forming structural patterns, a photosensitive cell adhesion system therefore needs to be post-translational and instantaneous.
Gene activation
Many studies in developmental biology focus on the cell signalling in a growing organisms to elucidate the formation of complex structures. From these studies we know that simple adhesion between cells is only the first step of forming a stable, 3-dimensional structure. Equally important is the activation of genes that lead to the production of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and other cell adhesion proteins like integrins and selections.Furthermore, the ability to activate specific genes in a cell, theoretically, allows biological engineers to harness the already existing code to activate a full range of mechanisms.
The ones that are most important for tissue engineering are:
Dedifferentiation
Differentiation - Tissue consists of a range of specialised cells and their products and there is never a type of tissue made up of only one cell. To form a type of tissue cells, therefore, have to differentiate into a range of different cell types. This process requires already existing pluripotent stem cells. But in order to make this process feasible in healthcare current methods of inducing cells into a pluripotent state a too inefficient. We therefore propose that a gene activation system is needed that can induce dedifferentiation and differentiation triggered by different light sources.
Phototaxis - Next to forming connections between cells and rigidifying these by consecutive establishment of an ECM, cells need to migrate inside and on top of the tissue. One of the major disadvantages of current tissue engineering approaches is that a cell"

Whereas, as for which indicators are most suitable for our project, the director of General Surgery said that he could not give authoritative advice, for the director of Clinical Laboratory is the expert who he suggested we should go to.
Clinical Laboratory of SIR RUN RUN SHAW HOSPITAL has played an irreplaceable role in providing advice to clarify potential indicators. Although there were some indicators to choose, from our perspectives, we would like to do some general but practical work, the framework of which could provide reference for disease diagnosis and later research. After understanding our vision, he explained the basic items of CX7+ in detail and thought we could deal with basic indicators first within the scope of our current capabilities. Eventually, after several discussions late at night, we decided to use glucose, lactic acid and lactate dehydrogenase as signal inputs of detection.
During this process of project design, the directors highly appreciated our rigorous scientific attitude and had great expectations for A Detector.
• Modeling
The dry lab selected the classical clustering algorithm KNN in machine learning to help us classify samples as pathology or normal. The core assumption of KNN algorithm is that if the majority of the k most neighboring samples in a feature space belong to a certain category, the sample also belongs to this category.
We imminently need hundreds of patient data and controls to implement this model and then we turned to the director of Clinical Laboratory in SIR RUN RUN SHAW HOSPITAL again. He generously offered clinical data for modeling and blood samples for further product testing!
Here is the cooperation agreement signed by Clinical Laboratory of SIR RUN RUN SHAW HOSPITAL and ZJU-China. It said during iGEM Competition Clinical Laboratory would provide a certain amount of blood samples and related data to ZJU-China and were also responsible for safety training before clinical experiments. Accordingly, ZJU-China should protect the information of the data and the privacy of samples from infringement. All the materials obtained from Clinical Laboratory is for scientific research purposes only(see scanned certificate document here ).
It was a bright sunny morning, but we had to come to hospital for data. We worked on the hospital’s internal data system from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and collected the data of more than 600 patients and controls after 2 days’ work.
The results of modeling indicate that the clustering model performed well within the scope of our acceptance when applied to unknown samples, which drives the progress of A Detector and makes the diagnosis more credible. Here are results of modeling.
Moreover, in our communication with other teams online, we found"

Extraction of Bacillus subtilis genomic DNA
Adam Denyer, Tanel Ozdemir    June 13, 2014   Protocols   DNA extraction
Our literature search identified a number of bacterial species that have been proven to degrade azo dye compounds including B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa.  We were able to obtain a B. subtilis strain for use in our project from ?.  We extracted the genomic DNA from this strain using a Promega Wizard Genomic DNA extraction kit so that we could subsequently amplify the azo-reducatase gene (AzoR1) and create our first azo-reductase BioBrick.  After completing the genomic DNA extracton we ran a gel to show that we had successfully extracted the B. subtilis genomic DNA.
Transforming E. coli with Azo-reductase plasmids
Adam Denyer    October 15, 2013   Protocols   PCR competent cells transformation miniprep
We were gratefully provided with a set of five plasmids from a group of researchers working at the University of Lisbon, Portugal who are researching how azo-dye degrading enzymes function and who were keen to collaborate with us.  These plasmids contained a number of genes encoding azo-dye degrading enzymes from both B. subtilis and P. putida including mutated forms found to exhibit enhanced degradation activity.  As the DNA concentration of the plasmids we were sent was insufficient to perform PCR amplification on we transformed each of these plasmids into our E. coli NEB5alpha competent cells.  After growing the cells overnight we then mini-prepped each of them to obtain plasmids at sufficient concentrations for future experimental work.

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#HolographicModel_-_-_TEXT.html,", we decided to model       our setup with the help of HoloPy - a python based tool for working with digital holograms and light scattering. HoloPy started as a project in the Manoharan Lab at Harvard University and the code can be found here .
Theory
With the help of Holopy we simulated whether our idea of the lensless setup would be feasible, i.e. would provide enough resolution to clearly resolve E.coli on a single-cell level and allows us to analyse their tumbling frequency. As       described in the Hardware section our idea would be to use a setup as illustrated in figure below.
Illustration of the principle of lensless imaging [REF 2].
Since the incoherent illumination source is placed far away from the sample (especially when compared to the wavelength of the incident light), the approximation of having a plane wave illumination holds in such a setup [REF 2]. Therefore, this       setting perfectly coincides with the functionality of HoloPy which performs a scattering calculation of an incoming plane wave with the specified sample and then displays the resulting hologram. This hologram is basically the interference       pattern which was created through the fact that a part of the incoming wave (R) was scattered by our objects (O). Therefore at the image plane we effectively get:
$|R+O|^2 = |R^2|+|O^2|+R^*O+ RO^*$
The major limitation in this setting is the physical pixel size of our sensor as the magnification factor is 1 due to the sample being placed very close to the imaging chip. (For more details visit our Hardware section).
Results
In the figure below, the results of different scattering calculations, performed in HoloPy are shown. For all of the scattering calculations we assumed to have a monochromatic blue light source (wavelength 405 nm) as well as a sensor       pixel       size of 1.2 um. The objects of interest were polystyrene beads and E.coli. We compared those two as they have comparable sizes. Nevertheless it should be easier to see the beads due to the higher contrast. In terms of refractive indices, we       used a refractive index of 1.395 for E.coli, 1.59 for the beads, 1.3 for water and 1.338 for LB.
Scattering calculations of different objects. Top: Assuming a magnification of 10x, Bottom: no additional magnification (pure lensless setup)

2. sRNA REGULATORY SYSTEM
2.1 INTRODUCTION
In order to enter passwords sequentially, we designed a password-control system by engineering artificial small RNAs for conditional gene silencing in E.co-Lock. A majority of the trans-acting sRNAs in bacteria interact with the untranslated region (UTR) and the translation initiation region of the targeted mRNAs via imperfect base pairing, resulting in reduced translation efficiency and mRNA stability. Additionally, bacterial sRNAs often contain distinct scaffolds that recruit RNA chaperones such as Hfq to facilitate gene regulation (Fig.2-1).
In this study, we describe a strategy to engineer artificial sRNAs that can regulate desired genes in E.coli. Using LacZ as reporter gene that was fused to a native 30 mRNA leader sequence, active artificial sRNAs were screened from libraries in which natural sRNA scaffolds were fused to a designed antisense domain. Artificial sRNAs that posttranscriptionally repress two genes ipgC and sicA were isolated and characterized.
We anticipate that the artificial sRNAs will be useful for dynamic control and fine-tuning of endogenous gene expression in bacteria for applications in synthetic biology.

1)Construction of small RNAs regulatory system. The system is composed of box1 and box2. The model figure is as below.
2)．Screening of function silencing sequences.
(a)Add target-gene and anti-target-gene sequence to small RNAs regulatory system by One-step Site-directed Mutagenesis.
(b)Verify the effect of silence.
2.3 RESULTS
In our protocol, we design two kinds of sRNAs, including sRNA-sicA and sRNA-ipgC. Based on the reference “Design and use of synthetic regulatory small RNAs to control gene expression in Escherichia coli[1]”, we try to design sRNA-sicA for 24nt and sRNA-ipgC for 15nt. Their secondary structure figures are as follows. Now, we will introduce how to explore the inhibition efficiency of the sRNA.
We constructed two boxes in the PSB1C3 plasmid, the gene in the box1 could express normally the sRNA which inhibit the target gene in the box2.So we could measure the enzyme activity of the β-galactosidase"
