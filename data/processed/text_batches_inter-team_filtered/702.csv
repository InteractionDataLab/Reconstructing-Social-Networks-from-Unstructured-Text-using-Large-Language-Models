UESTC,2013,Team:UESTC Life#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," According to many papers, the effects of linker length on equilibrium stability arise from significant and sometimes opposing changes in folding and unfolding kinetics.[1,4,7,8] As for the structure, the rank of linker is α-helix >β-sheet > loop.[2,3,4,5,8] And the effect of structure is dominant. We collected amass of data1,[4,6,7,8] and degraded the effect of linker. Finally, we got a formula. The formula can predict the efficiency of the length of linker. The full mark is 10 points.
Length points
y=y0 + (A/(w*sqrt(PI/2)))*exp(-2*((x-xc)/w)^2)
Y0=4.19829; Xc=21.97825; W=13.10889; A=68.84675
Structure point
1.α-helix    A         2.β-sheet    B           3.  loop      C
Results
The point of P2A is A, the length point is 7.9777
P2A is in high score in this system. It is similar to our experiment result.
Predict
The optimal linker is an α-helix and the number of amino acid is 22.  So in future work we can construct new chimeric protein using this linker.

Part II: Collaboration with UBC : IP issues encountered by iGEM teams
Introduction
The University of British Colombia team was also interested in intellectual property issues. They sent to each team a survey to understand what kind of IP issues are encountered by iGEM teams? Do IP issues hinder iGEM project? What level of IP knowledge have iGEMers?  We were glad to see we were not alone on IP planet, so we contacted them to share our works. UBC has accepted to give us their survey results and in exchange we commented their poll and their FAQ, we also answered their survey.281 iGEMers had answered the survey when we treated it .
This collaboration allowed us to broaden our reflexion to iGEM teams' issues.
Teams and IP experience
Firstly we studied past iGEMers experience with IP . In a graphic we summarize the answer  to two questions:
Do you have a past experience regarding the IP ?
Was your past experience in the context of a past iGEM project or outside of it ?
Only a few iGEM participants experienced dealing with IP issues. However, it would have been interesting to know their age in order to know if both data were bounded.
Besides, a patent experience seems to be often linked to a different project than the iGEM one, the reason probably being the special functioning of the iGEM contest in which most of the tools needed (such as the plasmid vectors) are provided without any intellectual property rights. Outside of iGEM, of course, such tools are obviously not freely supplied, which may results in a patent experience if the materials used are under a proprietary license.
Nonetheless, these answers do not reveal what these past experiences are. To test our hypothesis (iGEMers acquire IP experience outside of iGEM because patented materials are not used) we got interested in the nature of iGEMers IP experiences.
Nature of the IP experience
In this study, those who had an IP experience had to explain what was its nature. The results are that most of them (46 %) had already used patented materials before. However, 15% renounced to actually use them, which shows how patent can impede research and innovation: getting a license may be dissuasive, especially in France where"

Week 8
Monday, July 9, 2012
Victoria, Kait, and Alexander ran digestions to check the length of some of their fragments. Chris check his cultures for growth, but they were not ready for mini-prepping yet. Kevin completed the first 93 seconds of an animation for the team.
Tuesday, July 10, 2012< br/>    Chris received his sequencing data. It looked promising, however parts of it seemed inconclusive. He cultured this strain in preparation for testing it by inserting a promoter. Victoria ran a PCR reaction for some of the components for the Codon Optimization Project. Victoria and Alexander worked to make master cultures of components for the Codon Optimization Project.
Wednesday, July 11, 2012
Victoria, Kait, and Alexander mini-prepped cultures in preparation for sequencing. Chris transformed a plasmid, BBa_J23102, to use to test a construct that looks positive for having all the parts from the CBAR. Victoria also ran a digestion on the plasmids she prepared earlier to see if they possessed the correct restriction sites. The plasmids that looked promising were sent to sequencing. Kevin made more progress with the animation. He also worked with Nikki to help plan out the flow of the website.
Thursday, July 12, 2012
Chris checked his results from sequencing. With help from Hannah, he was able to conclude that there was a good chance that the plasmid was the desired construct. Hannah also checked her results from sequencing plasmids from her colonies from her second CBAR reaction. Her results showed to be negative, in response she ran another CBAR. Chris mini-prepped the J23102 that he grew up yesterday in preparation of inserting it into his suspected construct. Victoria ran a PCR for a fragment of the Codon Optimization Project, and cleaned the product of a previous PCR. Kevin made progress and created all new home and team pages. He also managed to get the navigation bar working, albeit in a crude format.
Friday, July 13, 2012
Chris checked the concentration of some of his mini-preps in preparation for sequencing and ligations. Victoria transformed some plasmids to be able to check them later for the desired parts. Victoria worked with Jyotsna to find some of the needed parts for the Codon Optimization Project. Kevin updated some of the webpages and poured some plates.

UT-Tokyo,2016,Team:UT-Tokyo#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," in addition to the new sigma factors that we constructed, we decided to improve the characterisation of the existing the ECF sigma parts so that we can better understand their activity for the use in our system.
According to our modelling results, the concentration of sigma factors must be tuned so that while it must be high enough to activate the sigma promoter activity, it should not be too high that it cannot be repressed by anti sigma factors.
The approach that was taken in 2014 to tune the expression of ECF sigma factors was to tune the promoter that transcribes the genes coding for the ECF sigma factors. However, they reported that due to the possible leak from the PBAD promoter, the sigma expression could not be tuned appropriately.
Figure 5. Previous iGEM results of sigma 11 activity. (Taken from UT-Tokyo 2014 wiki.)
Results indicate that though the ECF sigma11 factors were functional in activating the corresponding promoters, they were not able to influence the level of activation by tuning the expression level of promoter generating sigma factors.
We thus decided to test constitutive promoters of different strengths for generating the sigma factors and as well take another approach to tuning the induction of the sigma promoters, that is, by expressing the sigma factors on a plasmids of different copy number.
Figure 6. Measurement of sigma 11 promoter activity under different sigma11 generating conditions.
Strong promoter refers to BBa_J23101, while weak promoter refers to BBa_J23109. High copy plasmid refers to pSB1C3 (copy number of 100-300 per cell) and low copy plasmid refers to pSB3K3 (copy number of 10-12 per cell). Graph illustrates that there is a very significant difference( ** indicates P value 0.001 to 0.01) between different conditions. Data represents an average of 3 samples. Error bars show standard deviation.
The results above indicate that it is possible to tune the expression of the sigma 11 promoter by tuning levels of sigma11. The first approach is to change the expression level of promoter generating the sigma factors, and the second approach is to change the copy number of plasmid in which the sigma factors are expressed.
Anti Sigma Factors
To be used together with the ECF sigma11 and its promoter pair is anti sigma11 ( BBa_K1461007 ) reported to be able to repress the activity of ECF sigma 11 in activating the sigma11 promoter. However, when its functionality was tested previously, by iGEM-UT Tokyo 2014, the results suggested"

Hey Folks! If you've started Clement's and Geoffrey's descriptions, you'll probably believe that we are obsessed by food. As French people, it's true. But we are also interested in many other things. For example, as you, I decided to launch into this Great Human Adventure because I'm convinced that Synthetic Biology is the futur and I'm looking forward to meet people from everywhere. Sport also represents a large part of my hobbies: running, cross-country biking, swimming, climbing... One last thing to fit with the French stereotype! Even if I come from the Alpes, I prefere dishes from the South like Ratatouille, Bouillabaisse or Soupe au Pistou.

Hi everyone! I’m Morgane, and I come from Grenoble. Logic? Well no! As Grenoble is one of the best student cities, almost the entire team doesn’t come from here.  On the other side, I prefer listen music rather than sports making: I have never skied. The participation to iGEM is a unique experience, to have an approach of synthetic biology but is also a human adventure. And I’m proud to participate.

My ambition is to become a researcher, at the interphase of microbiology and immunology. moreover, my other passion are badminton, makeshift job, and informatic. iGEM is really in line with my love for biology. I think this adventure will give to me a great experience and plunge myself in the scientifc world, and show up some meeting with differents people who have alternative science-thinking.

Dear competitor, I did not have the pleasure to grow up between the beautiful mountains of the Alps. But since I'm studying in Grenoble, I'm taking the opportunity to go skiing or hiking. What better feeling than to admire this awesome landscape and thinking to the tartiflette waiting for your return in the sweet heat of your beloved home ?

Why Plug 'n' Play with DNA?
We have developed a standardized assembly system, called “Plug’n’Play with DNA”, where any biological parts can be gathered without use of restriction enzymes and ligases. The method applies long complementary overhangs on the PCR product as well as the destination vector. These overhangs are custom made and can anneal to each other to form a stable hybridization product. This means that the parts in the form of pre-produced PCR-products are directly mixed with a vector, which makes assembly of an expression vector possible within a few hours. All the parts in the form of pre-produced PCR-products will be distributed in microtiter plates directly ready for cloning. The simple and easy use of the system was demonstrated by developing a reporter targeting system for the mammalian cell line, U2OS, where GFP was targeted to the peroxisomes. In addition, application of our system was demonstrated in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans.
Team
We are five students that have been working hard the whole summer. We were lucky to be able to enter iGEM at a late time in the competition but this also gave us extra challenges and little time. You can learn more about our challenges and about us on our Team page.
A new assembly standard
We think that iGEM should be about assembling biobricks fast and combining them in any thinkable way with existing or new parts. Therefore we introduce a simple and fast way of building new devices or whatever you want with ready to use PCR products. Read more about the Plug'n'Play with DNA assembly standard.
BioBricks
We have been working hard to construct over 48 biological parts and have constructed over 25 vectors. Our favorite parts can be found on our Data Page .

Stanford,2009,Team:Stanford#ProjectPage_-_-_TEXT.html," post-operative patients of Crohn's Disease. In this stage of the disease, the patient's will require a burst of high dosage retinoic acid localized to a specific section of the small intestine. This would result in a short-term, more intensive treatment. However, this system is not sustainable; eventually the treatment would switch to the low copy vector as more of a monitor device.
Biosafety
1.  Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
a. researcher safety, b. public safety, or c. environmental safety?
Answer: There are no risks regarding our general system design other than the use of probiotics in humans. A few concerns regarding probiotics have been noted from previous iGEM competitors such as NYMU Taipei (2008) and CalTech (2008).
2. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Answer: There is a local board at Stanford University called Health and Safety at the Stanford University School of Medicine.
3. What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Answer: We spoke with David Silberman who is the Director of Health and Safety at the Stanford Univeristy School of Medicine about using the HlyA signal sequence alone for the export of non-hazardous protein, IL-6.  Dr. Silberman considered it safe to use the signal sequence as long as the pathogenic HlyA protein was not used.  The Health Safety board at Stanford University found all other parts nonhazardous.
4. Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Answer: For our second device, our export system was taken from pathogenic bacteria which uses HlyAs, BBa_K223054, to export hazardous material. We use the same proteins, the Hly gene cluster B, C, D, R and As involved in the export, however we do not include the hazardous gene, HlyA, to export IL-6.

Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part) In order to find out whether our design of mag-receiver can work, Ruipeng Wei and Weiyan Chen simulated the temperature field around one single ftnA molecule. But unfortunately result showed no optimism. So we then searched deeply and got several new formulas to calculate temperature transmission.
(Device Part)For the sake of watching fluorescence better, Qikai Qin and Weiyan Chen decided to make a box named “Blue Light Generator” just for this usage. Qikai Qin ordered the blue LEDs whose wavelength is around 450 nm. The 450nm light is the second excitation wavelength of GFP, under which wavelength the GFP can stabilize for more minutes. At the meantime, Weiyan Chen and Ruipeng Wei made a solenoid.

Here are a few examples from previous teams:

MIT,2012,Team:MIT#ResultsTest_-_-_TEXT.html,". We expect mRNA to produce less output than a corresponding DNA input mimic (comprising of just the toehold and sensing domains) in the same amount.
Results indicate that there is a difference between the 4 domains we chose, and that the output signal from mRNA is less than the signal from DNA mimics.
In vitro results from a DNA-based mRNA sensor. Graphed here is the fold increase in RFU - comparing the pre-input fluorescence to the fluorescence after (TODO) hours. Baseline (light gray) reflects no input. DNA input mimic (dark gray) is a DNA oligonucleotide with the same sequence as the toehold and sensing domains in mRNA (black).
Comparing mRNA as an input to DNA as an input. Graphed here is the ratio of fold increase fluorescence comparing mRNA inputs to DNA inputs. This indicates the possible completion level due to mRNA inputs. As described above, we expect this to be <1.
Not Gate in vitro
Figure 1 - DNA molecules that constitute the NOT GATE
The original strand displacement paper demonstrated AND and OR gates, but did not include NOT gates.  We successfully designed and built a strand displacement NOT gate in vitro, expanding the computational structures possible with strand displacement.
The design of our NOT gate is in Figure 1 above, where a letter with a '*' depicts a complementary domain to the one denoted by the letter alone. We arrived to this design after iterating through numerous other ideas, trying each time to reduce the number of molecules involved and their complexity.
To understand the behavior of this NOT gate, it can be useful to consider two extreme cases: no input and saturation-level input.
When the input is not present, molecule B can bind reversibly with A (by partially displacing a1) and reversibly with C (by partially displacing c2). When B binds with C, molecule D finishes the job and fully kicks c2 off of c.  c2 then triggers the readout E by irreversibly displacing e2 from e1.  Meanwhile, D also frees B from c1, making B catalytic and allowing it to react with more C molecules, amplifying the output.  Therefore we will see high fluorescence.
When the input is present in high concentration, B binds to a2, partially displacing a2 from a1.  The input then binds to a1, completing what B started by fully and irreversibly separating a2 and a1.  This step was inspired by the mechanism of the cooperative hybridization (Cooperative Hybridization of Oligonucleotides,David Yu Zhang"

4. Stochastic diffusion of formaldehyde within microcompartments: (see 'Modelling the diffusion of formaldehyde inside the microcompartment' ) Stochastic diffusion of formaldehyde within cell: Building on the stochastic diffusion models developed previously, we then predicted how the concentration of formaldehyde within a cell would change over time given the restrictions imposed by the microcompartment.
5. Star-peptide model: (see 'The Star-Peptide Model' ) Our major collaboration with Unimelb iGEM involved modelling the effect of attaching multiple enzymes to a star peptide. This built upon the stochastic diffusion models developed earlier and represents an alternative method of reducing toxic intermediate accumulation to microcompartments.
Figure 6
Plotted here is the logarithmic relationship between star peptide bond length and reaction rate. This was simulated for Melbourne iGEM and suggests that the rate of reaction will be inversely proportional to average peptide length to the power of four.
Realisation
Realisation
For the containment of our bacteria, we have managed to:
1. Synthesise novel agarose beads: these have a polymeric coating which limits DCM diffusion into the beads. This allows optimum degradation by the bioremediation bacteria, while physically containing the bacteria for safety reasons.
Figure 1
Illustrated here is the concept design of our biopolymer containers. Not only does the diffusion-limiting polymer coating prevent the concentration of DCM the cells are in contact with from reaching toxic levels but maintains it at the optimum concentration for DCM turnover. Furthermore, by decreasing the size of the beads, this results in a decrease in the depth of penetration for DCM required to reach the bacteria.
2. Verify the functioning of the biopolymeric beads: this was done by measuring diffusion using indigo dye.
3. Design and construct the sensor system: this was achieved with the aid of 3D CAD software, 1 2 3-D Design, and a 3-D printer .
Figure 2
This is a simulation we developed of the biosensor case using 3-D CAD software. This was then converted to a 3-D printer-compatible format and printed using ABS plastic. The final print out was a full scale version of the actual design.
4. 3D print a cartridge to hold our biosensor bacteria: this sensor was designed to be easily replaced by a user.
5. Construct a prototype circuit: the circuit lights up when the photodiodes detect light emission from our biosensing bacteria that are contained in"

RIP secretion : BBa_K2616001
To easily measure the effect of RIP on Staphylococcus aureus, we designed an initial construct allowing us to simply produce RIP after IPTG induction. Thus, we designed a part containing a T7 promotor, a ribosome binding site (RBS) upstream, followed by a signal sequence for secretion fused to the RIP sequence downstream of the coding sequence.
Eight different secretion systems have currently been identified in Escherichia coli, and more generally in Gram-negative bacteria [1]. Type I and type II secretion systems are the most commonly used for secretion of recombinant proteins. We chose to use Type II to secrete RIP [2].
Type II secretion system is a two-steps system: proteins are first exported to the periplasmic space, between E. coli’s two membranes, and then secreted to the medium [2].
We target RIP to the periplasm using the Sec-dependent secretion system [1], [3]. Our peptide is fused to an amino-terminal signal sequence that gets recognized by the chaperone SecB, then addressed to SecA and then translocated across the inner membrane through the SecYEG complex. One advantage of this system is that the signal sequence gets cleaved during translocation through SecYEG [1]. Several different signal sequences have been characterized (all formed of 18 to 30 amino acids) [3].
Following the advice of Dr. Jean-Michel Betton, Research Director in the Structural Biology Department at the Institut Pasteur, we chose to try two different signal sequences to export our peptides, which he knew about and which are known to be efficient: MalE and DsbA [2], [4], [5]. A secretion machinery called “secreton” then enables the release of proteins extracellular"

From 2010.igem.org
As a tutor game aimed at improving the understanding and facilitating IGEM and synthesis biology, iGAME itself is exactly a great way of human practice. With iGAME, people do not feel any distance to synthesis biology any more. Actually, it is time for everyone to join this trend to be as cool as Sheldon’s new biologist girlfriend. However, we do not stop here. We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge of synthesis biology from classes and tried to share the part we contribute to the worldwide. We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.

Background
On September 14, 1990 at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, W. French Anderson M.D. and his colleagues R. Michael Blaese, M.D., C. Bouzaid, M.D., and Kenneth Culver, M.D., performed the first approved gene therapy procedure on four-year old Ashanthi DeSilva. Born with a rare genetic disease called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), she lacked a healthy immune system, and was vulnerable to every passing germ or infection. In Ashanthi's gene therapy procedure, doctors removed white blood cells from the child's body, let the cells grow in the laboratory, inserted the missing gene into the cells, and then infused the genetically modified blood cells back into the patient's bloodstream. Then, with such controversy, the gene therapy initiate.
Gene Therapy
Gene therapy is defined as the introduction of genes into tissues or cells via gene transfer, with the purpose of deriving a therapeutic or preventative benefit from the function of these genes. It is the insertion of genes into an individual's cells and tissues to treat a disease, such as a hereditary disease in which a deleterious mutant allele is replaced with a functional one[1]. Although the technology is still in its infancy, it is one of the most promising and active research fields in medicine[1,2]. Antisense therapy is not strictly a form of gene therapy, but is a genetically-mediated therapy and is often considered together with other methods[1].

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Inspiration
Here are a few examples from previous teams:
ETH Zurich 2014
Waterloo 2014"
Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#drylab#deployment_-_-_TEXT.html," biosensor? One way to do that would be to go to the river in question, measure its height, width, length and volumetric flow rate and numerically solve the advection diffusion equation. However the Alberta Oil Sands are roughly 4,000 km away from Cornell so it was impossible for us to go there and measure the rivers. Instead we decided to use dimensional analysis to estimate what the value of $L$ would be for different rivers. To do this we first defined a time scale $\tau$ which is the time scale for advection. $\tau$ can be written as       $$\tau = \frac{L}{u}$$       where $u$ is the average velocity of the river and $L$ is the length scale for advection. Similarly we defined a time scale for turbulent diffusion which can be written as       $$\tau=  \frac{l^2}{D}$$       where $l$ is the length scale for turbulent diffusion and $D$ is the turbulent diffusion coefficient. Since advection and diffusion are happening at the same time we can set both time scales equal to each other and solve for $L$ which yields       $$L=  \frac{ul^2}{D}$$       The average velocity $u$ can be rewritten as       $$u = \frac{Q}{wh}$$       where $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate of the river, $w$ is the width of the river and $h$ is the depth of the river. Next, the turbulent diffusion coefficient can be rewritten as       $$ D=kh \sqrt{ghs}$$       where $s$ is the slope of the river, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $k$ is an experimentally determined constant. This constant differs for turbulent diffusion across a river (horizontal) and turbulent diffusion within a river (vertical). Since we want to place our biosensor at the point where the chemical is completely mixed in the river, we need to take into account both horizontal and vertical turbulent diffusion. Putting both of these definitions into our equation for $L$ gives us       $$L=  \frac{Ql^2}{kwh^2\sqrt{ghs}}$$       Finally, we need to define what $k$ and $l$ are. If we want to know how far downstream the chemicals will be mixed horizontally across the river ($L_Y$) then $l$ = $w$ and $k$ = 0.6 [1]. If we want to know how far downstream the chemicals will be mixed vertically in"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Air Samples Testing for ICT-Mumbai
ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

Osmotic pressure increase due to the Cell Wall turnover  and the Tol/Pal distinct location can explain the formation of blebbing
the hypothesis made in Reference about a link between vesicles creation and the turnover of the peptidoglycan act as  a physical motor for our model : Indeed during the division of the cell, the peptidoglycan is degraded and reconstructed to be given a new shape. This turnover isn’t perfect: a part of the murrains components are released in the periplasm which make locally increased the pressure and so cause the local deformation of the outer membrane.  Defects in the TOL-PAL system leads to vesicles maturation reference. We can consider that TOL-PAL is acting as mooring ropes. So the distribution of TOL-PAL in the lipidic bilayer would be vital for the integrity of the outer membrane of the bacteria and any defect in those distributions can lead to vesicle maturation if there is any increase of the periplasm pressure. During vesicle creation Tol-Pal system act as counter forces to the osmotic pressure increase unabling a global swelling of the outer membrane. Using those types of information we create a 2 dimension model to explain the formation of blebbing
Brownian diffusion in the membranes can explains the affinity for concave region of outer membrane in bacteria and local clustering on the border of blebbing.
Our hypothesis to this model is that simple Brownian diffusion on the surface can explain stable accumulation of TOL and PAL in the border of the blebbing ( Link toward Details). Indeed physically it appears that Brownian motion model on a non-plane surface doesn’t predict a non uniform concentration of particles"

Carbon Fixation
Project Overview
Introduction
Carbon fixation in autotrophic organisms is responsible for the net fixation of 7×1016 g carbon annually Berg IA. Ecological aspects of the distribution of different autotrophic CO2 fixation pathways. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 2011;77(6):1925-36. . Six different pathways related to carbon fixation have been discovered, but the most widespread of these, is the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle found in photosynthetic eukaryotes, e.g. plants and algae, as well as in photo- and chemosynthetic bacteria B. Bowien MG, R. Klintworth, U. Windhövel. Metabolic and Molecular Regulation of the CO2-assimilating Enzyme System in Aerobic Chemoautotrophs.  Microbial Growth on C1 Compounds: Proceedings of the 5th International Symposion. 1st ed. Institute for Microbiology, Georg-August-University Göttingen, Federal Republic of Germany: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers; 1987. . Out of the eleven enzymes needed for the Calvin cycle, only three are heterologous to E. coli, namely; ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo), sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK). By the concurrent heterologous expression of the three genes encoding these enzymes, E. coli can be engineered to perform the full Calvin cycle.

The carboxysome is a microcompartment utilised by many chemoautotrophic bacteria, including cyanobacteria, as a CO2 accumulating mechanism to increase carbon fixation efficiency .

Therefore, we will give Escherichia coli a simple, effective and controllable mechanism for binding on surfaces, namely binding by mussel glue. E. coli, expressing mfp-5 on the outer cell surface, can than robustly attach to a wide variety of surfaces including glass, plastic and to itself.
Combination...Our Goal
The word combination is essential in our project. First of all, the basis for our project is combining the beneficial adhesive property from the mussel with our working horse E. coli. To get a most realistic result as possible, we combine our results from the lab together with our mathematical model. This combination allows us to predict the attachment speed and stability as well as cell clustering and settling. The controllable, strong attachment opens up new possibilities for the use of bacterial machines in environmental applications, medicine and industry, since it is easily combined with other properties/features.
To reach our goal, we have four main projects on the lab. The first step is to integrate the mussel foot protein 5 into the outer-membrane of E. coli and to characterize and visualize the mfp5. Therefore we will use the already characterized Biobrick of the Berkeley Wetlab 2009 iGEM team (construct BBa_K197034 in vector BBa_K197039). Since a GFP linker is also present in this construct, this will give us the ability to visualize the protein in the membrane by the use of Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy.
The TIRF has also a prominent role in our second project: the characterisation of the transport of mfp5. Since it is rather difficult to visualize and characterize a protein in the outer-membrane, several techniques are combined. This includes as mentioned above TIRF microscopy, however this time different combination of dyes are used to visualise the transport. Beside the TIRF microscopy, also electron microscopy is used to get the optimal, visual prove. Further experiments include fractionation of the cells and protein gels.
The third project is the so called activation of mfp5, which means the hydroxylation of the tyrosines present in mfp5. For the hydroxylation the enzyme tyrosinase is required. There are several tyrosinases, all need additional compounds in order to fulfil the hydroxylation. For our project, the melA Biobricks from the Tokyo Tech 2009 iGEM team (BBa_K193601 and 602) are used. Once mfp5 is hydroxylated, it will be adhesive."

It is demonstrated to enable rapid screening of very large peptide libraries with high precision and efficiency. OmpX possesses four extracellular loops, with loops 2 and 3 forming semi rigid β-sheets protruding from the cell surface. The native N- and C-termini were fused together with a GGSG linker, and the newly formed N- and C-termini reside on the cell surface. See Figure 1 for a schematic overview of CPX and OmpX. [1]

Membrane Anchor Protein INPNC
In 2012 the iGEM team of Penn, University of Pennsylvania, created a generalized BioBrick surface display platform, the Ice Nucleation Protein N, C termini only (INPNC), BioBrick part: BBa_K811005 .  INPNC is a truncated Ice Nucleation Protein (INP, a protein which causes ice nucleation and formation but which is also used for its surface display properties). However, INP consists of a C-terminal region that is positioned on the outer membrane, as well as a central 8, 16 or 48 amino acid motif that is responsible for INP’s ice nucleation properties. These central amino acids motifs are not essential for INP’s surface displaying properties. Therefore INP was truncated, retaining only the N (179 aa) and C termini (49 aa) to create INPNC. The C-terminal domain is displayed on the cell surface, while the N-terminal domain remains in the outer membrane. Also check the Wiki Page of Penn iGEM Team 2012. [2]

LuxR generator (BBa_I0462): LuxR is a protein that can bind AHL present in the media, forming the complex that can activate transcription of PLux promoter [http://parts.igem.org/Lux]. LuxR generator is consists of RBS (BBa_B0034), LuxR (BBa_C0062) and Terminator (BBa_B0015) parts and is it the module able to synthetize LuxR protein when a promote is assembled at beginning
phasin (BBa_K300002):
signal peptide HIyA (BBa_K208006): This part is the HlyA signal peptide which is used to target proteins for secretion via the Type I secretion pathway of gram-negative bacteria. Type I secretion is a single-step translocation of protein across both inner and outer membranes (Binet, 1997). Accordingly (York, 2001), PHA recovery may be possible by tagging the phasin protein with HIyA for translocation, so we think it would be possible recovery PLA by the same method because of it similar properties to PHA

How does our PLAdora system work?
When HSL molecules diffuse from bacteria 1 to bacteria 2, will bind LuxR protein (completing quorum sensing) and will induced plux promoter so pCoAT and phaC enzyme and phasin-HIyA protein will be expressed at the same time. This system depend of the first system, because if pH is lower than 5.5 (e.g. due to a low consumption of lactate from medium by the second system), there is no production either of lactate and HSL in the first system so there is no induction of plux promoter by LuxR-HSL complex, thereby second system would be OFF.

Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," After the transient induction, integrase is expressed and completes the inversion. We can acquire the stored information in multiple ways, such as PCR or sequencing. Due to the unidirectional catalyzation manner of serine integrases, the storage of the information is not rewritable in common circumstances. However, with directional factors, the recombination reaction can be reversed, thus making rewritable memory devices possible11. Integrase-based memory device has been adopted to build more complicated system like state machine3, 12 and counter13. Memory device using several orthogonal serine integrases to record multiple events was also developed in 20144.
Figure 3 | Three recombination reactions catalyzed by integrases (serine integrases). a, Inversion of DNA sequence; b, Deletion of DNA sequence; c, Integration of DNA sequence.
Memory device that genomically encodes analog signal using beta-recombinase in cell population was successfully built in 201414(Fig.4). Beta-recombinase recombines ssDNA to its homologous sites on the genome. After building a retron with the ssDNA homologous to the desired site and making it inducible by certain inducer, we can retrieve the information of the inducer by simply detecting this homologous site. More inducer means more ssDNA. And more ssDNA means higher chance that recombination will take place in single cell of the population. So it can store not only the existence of the induction, but also strength and duration. If the site is on CDS of a reporter which the recombination of the ssDNA can mutate or recover form mutation, we can easily measure the information stored in DNA by measuring the reporter.
Figure 4 | Cellular memory device based on Beta-recombinase which can be induced by two signals.
Some interesting works have been done with CRISPR, which creates new memory devices. Self-targeting guide RNA(stgRNA) directs Cas9 to where stgRNA itself is encoded on the genome5. Similar to other memory devices based on DNA level, Cas9 mutates DNA, which changes the sequence of future stgRNA. Newly-transcribed stgRNA will still target itself. By controlling the expression of Cas9 using customized inducer, events such as inflammation in human cells can be continuously recorded and stored. Much more excitingly, memory device using Cas1-Cas2 complex is also created6.
The potential usage of cellular memory devices

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html," phage λ- and phage 434 cI repressor protein. The working of the dominantly present protein determines cell behavior. A promoter has been modified previously that is regulated by the two cI proteins in opposite ways: the λ cI repressor protein induces the promoter, whereas the cI repressor protein from phage 434 represses the promoter.
To create a subpopulation, the levels of the two cI proteins, or at least the ratios between them, should vary between cells. Inspired by persister cell formation, we investigated expressing the two cI genes in one operon behind the same promoter. Differences in the turnover of the two proteins leads to switching dynamics where changes in promoter strength induce temporary changes in the ratio between the level of the proteins. Imagine a system where both cI genes are transcribed at intermediate levels. 434 cI has a much stronger ribosome binding site (RBS) than the λ cI gene and therefore is translated at a higher rate. This leads to a situation where there is more 434 cI than λ cI and 434 cI is dominant. When the promoter regulating both genes is repressed, both genes will, in time, reach a new, lower balance of protein levels. However, as 434 cI is degraded faster than λ cI, 434 cI protein levels will decrease more rapidly. This allows for brief domination of  λ cI. We hypothesize that small differences, like cell age and metabolism, between cells can determine whether λ cI indeed gets the chance to dominate the system.
The principle described here is similar to (and was inspired by) how some cells become dormant persister cells, while others continue growing 5 . In the main model for persister cells, persisters differ from other cells in the balance between a toxin and an antitoxin. In these cells, the toxin dominates the antitoxin. This causes dormancy, allowing persisters to escape antibiotics and other environmental factors that might kill growing cells 6 . We decided against an attempt to create actual persisters out of safety reasons. Persister cell formation can be expected to increase the chance of bacteria evading kill-switch mechanisms and other bio-containment measures 9 .

Peking,2013,Team:Peking#Project#Plugins_-_-_TEXT.html," we reasoned that such enzymes may help to expand the detection profiles of existing biosensors. We analyzed the data of metabolic pathways provided by ( KEGG : Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), focusing on the potency of enzymes to that catalyze specific reaction to convert undetectable compounds into detectable compounds.
Excitingly, we found degradation enzymes can could serve our purpose well (Fig. 2). Analogous to the electronic adaptors that functionally connect two incompatible devices, these enzymes could be used as “Adaptors for biosensors circuits” to transform originally undetectable compounds into the aromatics that can be detected (Fig. 3).
To function properly as “Adaptors for biosensors”, the degradation enzymes need to be relatively biochemically well-studied. XylB (benzaldehyde dehydrogenase) and XylC (benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase) from the toluene degradation pathway and NahF (salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase) from the naphthalene catabolic pathway originated in Pseudomonas putida meet these requirements (Fig. 3). Using them as Adaptors, various benzyl alcohols, benzaldehydes and salicylaldehydes are expected to be detected by the downstream regulator proteins, XylS and NahR (Fig. 3).
The xyl gene cluster that specify the catabolism of toluene are organized in two units: the upper-operon xylUWCAMBN for the conversion of toluene into benzoate and the meta-operon xylXYZLTEGFJQKIH encoding enzymes for further degradation into TCA cycle intermediates [5] . The transcription factor XylR, which detects toluene, initiates transcription of genes in the upper-operon [9-10] , including xylB and xylC (Fig. 4).
XylB is a benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (BADH) that degrades benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde [7] . Previous studies showed the xylB gene can be expressed in E.coli, but the enzyme activity of the protein is much lower, compared with that when expressed in Pseudomonas putida. It is speculated that the reason are the inefficient transcription of foreign gene in E.coli [7] and different genetic regulation system altered the expression intensity of xylB gene as well as the enzyme's activity.

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," called to total expenditure (Totex) by Ofwat. In the past, water companies could spend lots of capital on building new treatment works and new assets instead of new technology. This increases the value of the company by improving the capacity but not the performance. With Totex, companies are now allowed to include the cost of operations expenditure (long term running cost) within their calculations in their business model. This means that by considering the cost of running a technology over 15-20 years, new technology that are more expensive in the short term (cost of setting up new equipment) can have its expenditure justified if water companies can demonstrate that the cost of running it is lower than existing technology.
5. It takes around 10-12 years for technology to come to the market in the water sector. The technology can be really attractive if it can replace an existing technology and save a lot of cost.
6. The government has no role in deciding the method to treat water; it is up to the individual companies as long as they can demonstrate that they can do it effectively and are not affecting public health.
7. Brexit is still a huge uncertainty although it is unlikely that they will change the existing Water Framework Directive . This is because it has been shown that the WFD have dramatically improved water quality across Europe.
8. Genetically modified organisms have not been used but it is not because they are being avoided.

Interview with Dr. Benjamin Tam - Isle Utilities 01/08/2017
We got into touch with Dr. Benjamin Tam from Isle Utilities after being referred by Jonathan Abra. We confirmed most of our findings regarding innovation in the water industry with Dr. Tam and also discussed the possibility of applying our technology for remediation purposes in the environment. Although we were skeptical about the idea of using our technology for remediation purposes due to financial limitations, Dr. Tam advises us that it is still possible and just because there are no direct consumers that would pay for the service, it does not mean that the market is not there.
“At the moment, reducing phosphate levels within the environment is limited in terms of available technology”
- Dr. Benjamin Tam
We were also introduced to current ways of remediating phosphate in the environment, which are usually chemical. To tailor this into our project, he told us that it would be more interesting if our technology can pull out dangerous chemicals in addition to phosphate. However, we were told that public reception on GMOs being released into the environment may be something to worry about. He agreed with us that perhaps it is best to pitch our technology to water"
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2010,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#result_-_-_TEXT.html," extraction was successful. From the RT-PCR results, we know the cells transfected by ChR2-eYFP (pcDNA3.1) then illuminated for 30min showed the brightest band in Zif268 expression, followed by transfected/illuminated (20min), transfected/no illumination and no transfection/no illumination. While the bands of GAPDH showed no difference among them. The pictures are below.
Conclusion: The ChR2 is able to function normally, causing the increase of the expression level of ZIF268 and ARC. But this method is not so precise; we'll need to use a more precise method to prove it.
Function by Real-time PCR
Back to top ↑
Idea: Although results from semi-quantitative PCR had primarily shown that lighting cells transfected by ChR2 could cause the ascend of the expression level of ZIF268 and ARC, which indicated that Ca2+ has entered cells, quantitative methods like Real-Time PCR should be more preciese and convincing. Therefore, we conducted real-time PCR for three times to render the result more precise. Besides, in order to quantify the ability of ChR2 to incorporate Ca2+ into cells, we refined the design of our experiment, which is shown below:
Method: We design two sets of experiments: one is time related, in which the Ca2+ concentration is uniform (16 mM) while different groups are lighted for different time (0min, 5min, 10min, 15min and 30min) and there are two repeats for each group; the second one is Ca2+ related, in which all groups are lighted for 30 min while having different Ca2+ concentration (0mM, 4mM, 8mM, 16mM, 32mM and 64mM) and each group has three repeats. After lighting, RNA is extracted from the cells with the method mentioned before and then reverse-transcribed into cDNA by Promega’s reverse transcript kit. By adding equal quantity of cDNA into the real-time PCR system, we assume that our target gene, zif268 and ARC, if whose quantity is different in different groups, is cause by the different expression level in the cells, not by deviation from the system. The reagent for real-time PCR is SYBR@Green Reagent.
By analyzing the data exported by StepOneR Software (supported by Applied Biosystems), we calculate out the ??CT between gene ARC and GAPDH, as well as ZIF268 and GAPDH, and the average expression"

The presentation was designed to engage the pupils by questions and tasks, instead of being an ordinary lecture. We started by explaining the term the relatively new term “synthetic biology” and the development of this field in science. We explained the current industrial use of synthetic biology and highlighted four previous iGEM projects as examples of what we can do with synthetic biology. We briefly discussed our own project and the ethical issues that are the driving force of our projects. This was followed by a lively debate on the ethical issues and considerations regarding synthetic biology and GMOs.
We ended the presentation on the perspectives of synthetic biology, where we are headed and what we hope to achieve in the future.   Many of the pupils found it interesting and even felt inspired after the presentation. Maybe and hopefully we managed to change their view on synthetic biology. To promote the development of synthetic biology it is important and necessary to educate the public early on. Hopefully it can change the next generations’ point of view on the matter.

Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," increased through gene dosing. While a number of copy number control systems have been in use, such as the traditional addition of chloramphenicol to increase copy number before miniprepping, or the multiple origins of plasmid pSB2K3 from the Parts Registry, these systems have largely been aimed at increasing plasmid yields rather than as useful means of controlling biological systems.
Copy number is not the only possible means of increasing the dynamic range of control. Translational tuning is possible, for instance by riboswitches which prevent or allow protein synthesis depending on the presence of an inducer through the usage of RNA aptamers. However, we did not want to have to introduce additional inducers into our  system. Additional tuning of transcription is possible as well, such as by including an additional repressor. For example, the WT lac promoter includes a CRP operator, leading to additional strong repression in the presence of glucose. Coupled with minimal media lacking any trace of lactose (unlike LB), a greater dynamic range is achievable (eg Kulhman et. al PNAS 2007). We were more interested in a simple, self-contained system. Finally, it might be possible to control cell growth, eg with nutrient gradients. However, copy number is additional to these mechanisms, and has the huge advantage of adding a large level of control: two and a half orders of magnitude between single copy and high copy, with the prospect of total and permanent repression if the plasmid is lost completely. The perfect off-switch! Zero copies!
Figure 7 below outlines the mechanism for controlling copy number with a repressor. Under antibiotic selection without an artificial means of control, plasmids that have the pMB1 origin are maintained at between 200-300 copies/cell. In the absence of antibiotic selection, the plasmid is lost passively over many generations [Velappan et al (2007)].  Others have shown however, that replication can be controlled transcriptionally (see Herman-Antosiewicz, Mol Biotech 2001 and Lutz NAR 1997). Replication from the pMB1 origin is initiated by the synthesis of an RNA molecule (RNA II) that uses a standard RNA polymerase promoter. Therefore by using the same kind of repressible promoter design already described, it should be possible to control copy number, colour gene copy number and colour intensity. In the previous examples cited above, copy control was used to amplify plasmid beyond normal limits for plasmid purification or as a method of protein over-expression for purification. Our goal"

Fig.1  The logic of SynNotch
The triggering of SynNotch pathway has 4 processes: antigen binding, cleavage, translocating and promoting transcription. SynNotch is a customizable platform for cell sensing and response.
Fig.2  Here, we replace the extracellular domain with anti-EGFP, which can recognize cell surface-expressed EGFP, and the incellular domain with TEV protease, which can cleave specific-designed TetR and activate the expression of recombinase.
Signal Processing
We want to convert the extracellular analog signal into an intracellular digital signal, using Tet-Off/Tet-On device. This part contains tetO(Tetracycline operator), TEV protease (Tobacco Etch Virus nuclear-inclusion-a endopeptidase) and TetR(Tetracycline repressor protein).
TetO is a operon which can be repressed by TetR.
TEV protease (Tobacco Etch Virus nuclear-inclusion-a endopeptidase), a highly sequence-specific cysteine protease from Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) [4], is currently widely used in synthetic biology.
TetR is a repressor from E. coli that blocks downstream expression when it binds to the TetO [3].In our project, we use specifically-designed TetR with TEV protease cleavage site which has been reformed by 2017 Oxford University iGEM project.
To our knowledge, the Tet control system is the perfect combination of prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression regulation systems.
Fig.3  TetR binds to the DNA operon and inhibits the production of export proteins. However, TetR has a cleavage site for Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease. When it is cut by TEV, the suppression will be alleviated and the downstream gene could express.
Initially，We thought that we can implement the filtering function using these devices. But, when we verificated system by the mathematical model, we found that there was a small amount of continuous tetO-downstream promoter leakage, when there was no extracellular signal stimulation. The leakage was 1% of the normal expression (fig.4), but this still need to be improved. To solve the problem, we introduced a recombinase into the system.

5. If your project moved from a small- scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise? (Consider the different categories of risks that are listed in parts a - d of the previous question.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the met hods you develop became widely available? (Note: This is meant to be a somewhat open - ended discussion question.)
Using site-specific mutagenesis of genes might bring in safety problems,  so strict treatment of waste is required in commercial production. Besides, the methods we use are widely used in the lab, and they won't cause any disadvantages if used properly.
6. Does your project include any design features to address safety risks? (For example: kill switches, auxotrophic chassis, etc.) Note that  including such features is not mandatory to participate in iGEM, but many groups choose to include them.
No.
7. What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)?  Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution's safety training requirements, if available.
Yes,every member  of our laboratory received biosafety training including standard laboratory operation and WHO Biosafety Manual training before the experiments. All members learnt about the ""C3H3""which is well known in the  college of chemistry and chemical engineering. http://210.34.15.138/rule/10384_2_c_18.pdf

a.  Please provide a link to  your institution biosafety guidelines .
http://210.34.15.138/rule/10384_2_c_18.pdf
b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised with your project, and any changes you made to your project plan based on their review.
No, we haven't discussed our project with an Institutional Biosafety Committee, but we discussed the safety problem with our instructors and confirmed that this project is safe enough if experimental rules are strictly observed.
c. Does your country has national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Best Basic Part Special Prize
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are *many* opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!"

8.25.2012
Today is Saturday. We did a PCR again to prove that the connection is Ok.
We’ve already digested the plasmid last week. Our next step is to digest GFP and RFP at the same time.
We’re going to check whether it is feasible to connect 3 fragments at the same time.

In order to increase the terminator efficiency in our plasmid we chose to use a double terminator. We selected two different double terminators that we have to test.
The first one of 129 bp, consisting of BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 as shown in Figure 4, available on the iGEM registry at this ID access: BBa_B0015. It is the most used terminator for forward transcription with a forward-efficiency of 0,984 according to measurements done by Caitlin Conboy, and of 0,97 according to measurements done by Jason Kelly. Procedures used for these measurements are explained in the IGEM registry .

The second one of 95 bp, consisting of BBa_B0011 and BBa_B0012 as shown in Figure 9, available on the iGEM registry at this ID access: BBa_B0014. It is a bidirectional terminator with a forward-efficiency of 0,604 according to measurements done by Caitlin Conboy and of 0,96 according to measurements done by Jason Kelly, and with a reverse-efficiency of 0,86 according to measurements done by Jason Kelly.

Safety
Considering Researcher Safety
The Wellesley Human-Computer Interaction team is a computational team, and worked on designing software that not only improve clarity and efficiency in designing synthetic biological parts, but also increase public awareness through education of the next-generation of scientists through outreach.
Considering Public Safety
Synthetic Biology training at MIT
As part of our computational team’s preliminary Synthetic Biology training, we attended the BioBuilder program at MIT with Natalie Kuldell. During this instructive session, we were introduced to laboratory safety, techniques, and protocol. Lectures concerning Synthetic Biology education, awareness, and safety provided insight into the concepts, methods, challenges, and policies in the field, as well as an appreciation for the need for greater public awareness. At BioBuilder we also had the opportunity to work in the wet-lab and execute two iGEM-inspired experiments. This hands-on experience helped us to better understand the importance of lab protocol and procedure, as well the necessity for precision and communication. We were also able to put into practice the safety training we received.
On the software side, we executed our user studies attentively and considerately.  Prior to the studies we thought about the user’s prior experience and knowledge, preparing introductory materials and providing appropriate supplemental information when necessary. We also kept the study environment quiet and peaceful for optimal concentration. With respect to the users’ privacy and consent, we used consent forms for the release of any images or personal information for use in our research analysis.
Considering Environmental Safety
Natalie Kuldell and Rebekah, a high school
biology teacher, visit and provide feedback
In addition to wet lab training, the Wellesley Desyne team consulted various experts in the field of synthetic biology to help aid us in our design and implementation process. These experts ranged from synthetic biology instructors to researchers to professors, all who informed us on the ethics, biosafety, and biosecurity of putting our projects together and then testing with human users. The questions and concerns raised"

Russell:
Welcome to the NYU iGEM Lab Notebook! Today we initiate writing in this notebook in order for each of us on the team to know the trials and tribulations everyone else is going through, and for our advisers to know what's going on with the team without having to be in the lab all the time.  While it may not have the formatting of some of the more computer-literate teams, it will certainly work for us!
John:
Performed digestion of 32 plasmids using either EcoRI, PstI, or both.  These plasmids included RBS, Flag, E1, F1, sectag (multiple), NUB, and Strep.  This was performed to see if our digestion enzymes were working correctly.  After digestion, these solutions were run in 4 1.5 gels with large sized wells to verify if the enzymes were cutting.

Meeting with David went well, though he did not have too much additional information that Caroline had not already provided to us.  It appears that no one really knows where the placement of the binding sites for each promoter should be.  He did convince us that Cell-ID is a necessary approach for our project.

Cost in Mass Production?
To offset the high cost of growing a large amount of bacteria for medical applications, it would be beneficial to purchase effluent waste products from agricultural processing of grains and vegetables as cultivation media for our bacteria. These waste products contain high levels of proteins, carbohydrates, sugars, and vitamins, and thus can be used as low-cost growth media for lactic acid bacteria, including the species of lactobacillus that will act as our treatment.2 This reduction in production cost will assist in keeping the treatment burden low for the patients.

Determining an appropriate dosage of the bacteria that provides an optimal level of IL-2 production in GI tract cancer patients is an important consideration, one that will require several rounds of animal trials and phase 1 clinical trials in order to perfect. Prior work using lactobacilli in the treatment of IBD has used a dosage of two tablets a day containing 1010 colony-forming units (CFU), for a period of six to nine months.3, 4 As our treatment would not require substantial colonization of the gut as in IBD trials, we predict a lower dosage, ideally at one tablet a day. However, as bacteria have never before been used in cancer treatment, dosing experiments on animal models are required before any reliable approximations of human dose can be made.
Concerns on Safety:
Lactobacilli as delivery:
Lactobacilli, including Lactobacillus brevis, are “generally regarded as safe” worldwide.  Support for this stems from its long history of use in food products and from clinical studies examining the safety of many lactobacilli strains.5 In fact, this safety status is considered one of the major benefits of using lactobacilli as a vector for the therapeutic targeting of GI pathologies.6
IL-2 as therapy:
IL-2 is a regulatory cytokine, and too much of it in the body can have severe adverse effects. The most common manifestation of IL-2 toxicity is capillary leak syndrome, when fluids within the vascular system leaks into the tissue outside the bloodstream.7 This results in low blood pressure and poor blood flow to the internal organs. Capillary leak syndrome is characterized by the presence of 2 or more of the following 3 symptoms; low blood pressure, swelling, and low levels of protein in"

Gray Value-Concentration Model
Gray Value-Concentration Model
By building a mathematical model, we demonstrate the principles of the project and provide guidance                     for optimizing product design and its application.
A grayscale model is built to solve the image quantization problem.
A kinetic model was established to solve the problem of time optimization of antigen fixation,                     reaction concentration ratio and detection time optimization.
The spatial perturbation model provides relevant conclusions about liquid crystal interference. A                     fixed antigen concentration threshold is given.
The relationship between the gray value and the added substance                     concentration
To describe our results in antigen fixation, antibody ligation, and detection, a grayscale model                         was established. The model can more accurately reflect the results of the three phases.                         Especially in the test, the results can be digitized to provide better detection limits.
For the result of the gray value calculation, it is firstly grayscaled. Since it is a color                         picture, it needs to be grayed out first with Matlab. At the same time, in order to give a clear                         grayscale image, image equalization is performed and a balanced image is given[Attachment                             1]. After obtaining the grayscale image, it is necessary to calculate the grayscale of                         the image using the formula (1). To make it easier to get accurate data, design a small software[Attachment                             2] in a programming language that calculates the average grayscale of the image. There                         is an error in the data of the grayscale image. According to the experimental results, when the                         gray value is not too low, it is about 5%. The error is about 10% compared to the balanced                         grayscale image.
$$ g_w = \sum_{i=0}^{255} i \times T_i \div T \tag{1} $$
For the experimental results, no matter which process. In the initial stage, the gray value is                         positively correlated with the concentration of the additive; as the additive concentration                         increases, the gray value is not proportional to the increase. There are two models that satisfy                         these properties, equation (2) and equation (3):
Michaelis-Menten model: $$ y = \frac{\alpha x}{\beta + x} \tag{2} $$
Exponential growth model: $$ y = \alpha (1- exp(-\beta x)) \tag{3} $$

Tsinghua-A,2012,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," of logic on the physical layer. Through controlling the direction of the signal stream we can achieve our goal to make a logic-flexible device. Now let’s come to a simple example. We replace the Gene of Interest with a kind of promoter. Under the initial condition, the promoter is able to induce the Output. But once the external signal comes, the expression of the Cre recombinase will be activated and it will lead to the flip between the two LoxP sites. Consequently, the promoter cannot bring out the output.
What we exactly want and how?
Without loss of generality, we decide to start our project with the conversion of the two basic gates mentioned above: the And gate and the Or gate. And when it comes to the situation with 2 inputs, we construct our design like this.

Between the LoxP site there’re promoter A&B. Initially promoter A can only induce signal X, and promoter B signal Y. The Output is under the regulation which can only be induced by X AND Y.So only when both promoter A&B are activated can we get the expression of the Output. Definitely it serves as an And gate. In response to the external stimulus we’ve given, the Cre recombinase come out and start the flip. After the flip either promoter A or promoter B can activate the expression of both signal X and signal Y. Then we can get the Output. So the system works as an Or gate. That’s how we construct the switch between the And gate and the Or gate.
An Introduction to Cre-LoxP System
The system consists of two components: Cre recombinase and LoxP site. Cre-Lox recombination is a site-specific recombinase technology widely used to carry out deletions, insertions, translocations and inversions in the DNA of cells. It allows the DNA modification to be targeted to a specific cell type or be triggered by a specific external stimulus. It is implemented both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems.

Ecoli.PROM: an Erasable and Programmable Genetic Memory in E. coli
Figure 1: Genetic circuit
The specific goal of our project was to design a bacterial reprogrammable memory, i.e. colonies of genetically engineered E. coli immobilized in solid medium where they work as an array of binary memory cells. To engineer the bacteria we designed a modular genetic Flip-Flop composed of two parts (Figure 1): a binary memory block and an induction block, sensitive to UVc radiation .  UVc has been chosen to have a fine spatial selectivity in programming the memory cells, whereas IPTG should be used to reset the entire memory.
The molecular circuit can switch between two different stable states (LacI-ON and TetR-ON), driven by the external stimuli UVc and IPTG. LacI-ON represents the stable state in which LacI gene is active and LacI protein represses the TetR gene expression, with a positive feedback. Therefore, the LacI-ON state coincides with the TetR-OFF condition. On the contrary, the TetR-ON represents the state with the TetR gene active and the LacI gene silenced (LacI-OFF). Owing to the coexistence of two stable states (bistability), this circuit is capable of serving as a binary memory. We denominated it genetic Flip-Flop since it works as a SR Latch: LacI state is the
output and TetR state is the
output. Uvc is the set signal and IPTG is the reset signal. Indeed, IPTG stimulation inhibits LacI repressor, thus can cause the transition from the LacI-ON state to the TetR-ON. UVc radiation, inactivating LexA repressor through the SOS response [Friedberg et al. 1995] can cause the opposite transition from LacI-ON to TetR-ON.
The core elements of this epigenetic memory are the two mutually regulated promoters (see Figure 1), each designed"

This domain is part of the Cellulosome Integrating Protein A (CipA), which forms part of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum. The cellulosome is an extracellular protein scaffold attached to the bacterial cell wall and displays cellulose-degrading enzymes (cellulases). For increased cellulose degradation, the cellulosome of C. thermocellum includes a Cellulose Binding Domain (CBD) named CBM3a that brings enzymes and substrate together. This domain is also thought to increase stability of the secreted scaffold.

Kids! Kids! Kids!
As part of our overall Human Practices strategy, we wanted to engage with our local community. One way that our team engaged with the community was at our local children's museum where our team taught young kids about synthetic biology.
Our team were Guest Star Scientists at the Marbles Kids Museum in Raleigh, NC. There, team members worked with youth volunteers to teach kids about synthetic biology. Candy DNA, origami DNA, and DNA extractions were all the rage with the young demographics. Kids enjoyed learning about the shape of a double helix while they built their own double helices with Twizzlers and marshmallows. The kids then went on to make origami DNA and learned about how hard our body works to make DNA in our cells. Finally the children made DNA necklaces out of tubes filled with DNA they extracted from wheat germ. Both our team and the kids we met had a truly DNAtastic time! Below are details about each of the activities as well as pictures from our fun filled day.
Throughout our day at the Museum, our team members were assisted by members of the Without the help of these volunteers our event would not have been as successful so a big thank you to them! It was also a great opportunity to our team to help teach these volunteers how to teach about synthetic biology and to engage with them about future career options.
Candy DNA
One of the kids favorite activities was making candy DNA! We originally came up with the idea from a Guardian article . We used this basis but through some image searches of Google, we found a good alternative to jellys would be marshmallows (a little easier for the kids to manipulate). We then made up a set of instructions for volunteers that is attached below. The kids had a really good time playing with their food and learning about their DNA too! We took this opportunity to"
NAWI_Graz,2017,Team:NAWI Graz#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,",             we have decided that these strains are the safest variant for our planned experiment.
Another problem we solved with the aid of an expert was the time delay from the production of the proteins till their             degradation. After endless discussions, we came up with the solution to integrate a TEV-protease which accelerated             the subsequent degradation.
Finally, for the fluoreszenz proteins a problem occurred referring the detection. Originally it was planned to detect             the proteins after induction by means of a plate reader or through the robot, but since the fluorescence signal             was way too low we had no chance in proving the presence of the proteins. Coincidentally, we came up with this             problem during our discussion evening, which led to a lively discussion. Many solutions came up, finally we could             agree that a Western Blot would be the most promising variant. And indeed, we have succeeded in detecting the             protein. We are currently working on improving the fluorescence intensity. During Nerd Nite, we discussed possible             improvements with dedicated students. Their intellectual approaches were very interesting, some of them have             been implemented. The students were very enthusiastic that they were able to contribute to our project.
Some experts were able to support us with new input, in which areas our project could develop in the future. Many             novel ideas that on how this project might emerge are listed in the “application section”. There, many speculative new ideas are described and some of our team members hope             to be able to help bring them to life in the course of our scientific career.
Model
At the beginning of our project, we already had a model of our entire experimental process. Thus, we were able to             take this to public events, such as the “Spritzerstandl”. There, we got a lot of input from the public and even made fundamentally changes on how             the robot works. After fierce discussions, the pH-based controller has been improved by several aspects, instead             of just reacting to sensors' left and right input signals, additionally a kind of memory has been introduced             into the system through the creative use of the “bacterial medium”. By this, the robots could no longer get stuck in corners of the maze.
In addition, the model was sent to various other iGEM teams, who also created individually mazes. Unfortunately,             we did not have time to solve this with our physical robot, but we can show in the model that this would theoretically             be feasible.

Introduction
For our project, we decided to submit seven BioBricks to the iGEM Registry in the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone. Our submitted parts can be divided into two separate collections (Named as Collection One and Collection Two). Collection One is associated with Engineered biofilm subunit CsgA, while Collection Two is relevant to construction of hydrogenase gene clusters.
All of the constructs are protein-coding parts have been confirmed with gene sequences, demonstrated with expected functionalities, and thus it would be easy to handle for other users. Specifically, in order to make hydrogenase expression more productive, we optimized the gene sequences of 5 hydrogenases parts with the help of OptimumGene™ (GenScript). We changed the codon usage bias in E. coli by upgrading the CAI (Codon Adaptation Index) from a low level (around 0.30) to 0.97.
Characterizations of the parts are included on the webpage of the parts section, but for more information about the submitted parts in real use, please go to Biofilm or Hydrogen page.

Penn_State,2012,Team:Penn State#Other_-_-_TEXT.html,", Michael Speer. His partially-assembled construct was the basis testing codon bias.
IDT, or Integrated DNA Technologies , synthesized the majority of small oligonucleotides for the Penn State iGEM team. The codon optimization repeat-sequences and varying RBS length and strength sequence variations were annealed from IDT's ssDNA oligos.
Since Penn State did not extensively collaborate with other iGEM teams this year, most parts were locally obtained, or synthesized off-campus.

A proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend"
WLC-Milwaukee,2013,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," potential benefits of this project is provide impoverished people with more access to food. This project would allow a greater array of options for food sources, as well as increase the nutritional value of the food that is already present. The mechanism that this project provides will be extremely helpful to other iGEM teams. This system can be used to secrete any other enzyme or molecule chosen by an iGEM team or even general researchers.
 
Reception:
The intent of this project is to create a product that would aid developing countries, without necessarily changing their cultures, or “westernizing” them. In these countries, nutrition is a major concern. The lack of nutrition in developing countries has the added adverse consequence of increasing chronic diseases. “Nutrition is something easily changeable that has to power to prevent chronic disease, with scientific evidence increasingly supporting the view that alterations in diet have strong effects, both positive and negative, on health throughout life.” Nutrition is the first step to overall health, and therefor, our product could improve the general health of a developing country. Some sources even venture to say that food production is considered an evolutionary advance. Culture is not static, but dynamic. It is the aim of this project to enhance the cultures that it touches.Countries also have varying concerns about GMOs, especially the UK and India. Countries like the United States, Canada, and China would be more likely to accept these products. This product would go through further testing to ensure that it is safe for consumption in order to send to countries that could highly benefit from this product.
 
Future:
Polysaccharides are a convenient energy storage system for many organisms. In order to use the energy, the organism must break down the polysaccharide chain into smaller mono- and disaccharides. Cellulose is one such polysaccharide, an energy storage form for plants. Glucose monomers link together in long rigid chains to form cellulose. The plasmid breaks down plant products that are not cellulose, but similar in structure (hemicellulose and pectin). We have three enzymes to accomplish this: xynA, bglS, and yesZ. The endo-xylanase xynA cleaves xylan polysaccharide chains to form shorter xylan chains. The enzyme yesZ has beta-galactosidase (beta-galacturonidase) activity, cleaving exo-beta-D-galactans to produce single galactose molecules from RG I Pectin. The endo-beta-glucanase (bglS) will cleave internal"
