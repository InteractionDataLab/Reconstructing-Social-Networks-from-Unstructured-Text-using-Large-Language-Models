Safety
The lab part of our project is basic molecule biology and cell biology experiment. There are not many problems in safety. The common sides in biological lab safety are biological hazard, chemical damage and physical danger.
Firstly, about biological hazard, the risk doesn’t exist in our lab mainly. The genes we need are GFP, RFP and AMP. They are harmless no matter when transcription and translation. Besides, the E. coli we used has already undergone mutation in gene level, which means the E. coli we used can’t cause any disease.
Secondly, as for chemical damage, there are some processes we have to care. The common method to check up the result of enzyme digestion and link of DNA fragment is electrophoresis. In a important process of electrophoresis, DNA is dyed by ethidium bromide. Ethidium bromide is a kind of poison. It is bad for our people health, and may cause cancer. So we must take care of it.
Finally, in physical danger, the most dangerous being is ultraviolet in the whole lab process, because other bacteria or fungi are forbidden appearing in some lab processes.
Besides, about the key questions, we can show our answers to you.
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Researcher safety:
In Augest, Our team members, Shui Jing, Xianggeng Liu, Mengshi Zhang and Boyu Qie went to BGI to do experiments. On Augest 18th, we run a DNA gel and use the UV light to visualize the gel results. However, because we never used UV light before and did not know much about the safty guidline of UV light, we did not put the protection glass in front us, therefore, we are exposed to UV light for a few minutes. Although it is a small accedient, but we realized that we are lack of lab"

Urea assay
Motivation
The motivation of this assay is to improve the Biobrick parts associated with ArgBox, used in the project Urea cooler by iGEM2011 tokyo tech. ArgBox is an arginine operator sequence(Arg boxes), which bind to the arginine repressor. It has been reported by iGEM2011tokyo tech that ArgBox can suppress the transcriptional repression of ArgR by introducing this into E. coli, and increase the amount of urea synthesis. We used the ArgR biding site as a 8 tandem repeat (ArgR BDS rep 8) or 16 repeats(ArgR BDS rep 8). We expected the amount of urea would rise compared to using the Arg Box as a single copy

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," not permissible in a BSL1 environment. So on Dr. Mickelson’s advice we decided not to do direct functional testing on samples but to extract DNA from samples using a protocol that the Brady lab at Rockefeller University has used to mine soil samples for new antibiotic synthesis pathways. This consisted of collecting samples in Mason jars, using 250g in the protocol that was optimized to extract DNA keeping relatively long pieces intact, and gel-purifying them. At Genspace the samples were sprayed down on the outsides with 70% alcohol. The samples were sealed into smaller biohazard bags and stored at 4C prior to DNA extraction. Under constant supervision by Dr, Jorgensen, adult team members removed aliquots of about 250g each from each of the 14 jars. The members wore PPE (gloves, lab coats and eye protection) and the aliquots were immediately placed in the lysis solution and agitated to disrupt the cells.  As usual, all pipettes and labware used were disposed of in the biohazard bin, which is taken away for incineration by a professional service. Blenders were decontaminated with bleach solution.
Although we plan to eventually use the purified DNA to make a cosmid library that will hopefully contain long stretches of DNA with entire metabolic pathways, we could not let the team do it at Genspace because of the safety concerns above. Again, we have Dr. Mickelson to thank for providing advice. So we had to think of a new strategy. So we decided to use PCR to probe the extracted DNA to see if there were any sequences that seemed homologous to those characteristic of a particular type of metabolic pathway.  With the help of Brady lab publications, we were able make some primers that we could use on the extracted DNA prior to library production to show that some of the samples had DNA that could possibly contain pathways for new antibiotics. Dr. Mickelson saw no unusual safety issues with this protocol. In the future we hope to partner with a BSL2 facility to create the cosmid library and screen it for functionality.

At 5:45 PM the best colony from 5 plates were cultured in 5 ml culture tubes with respective antibiotics (two 1xKan and 3 1xAmp) and incubated at 37 °C and 160 rpm. So tomorrow we can proceed to the DNA extraction step, since for assembly we can use pTet instead of pBla or any other constitutive promoter in future.
Found that the competent cells must be prepared. Tim Weenink has already cultured top 10 cells for competent cell preparation. I diluted the culture in 100ml flask and grown till 0.49 OD at 600nm. While the culture was growing I prepared the TSS buffer and filter sterilized with 0.2 µm syringe filter and stored in freezer. Then 50ml culture was split into two falcon tubes and centrifuged. After throwing the supernatant it was resuspended in each tube with 2.5ml TSS buffer.

I cultured the best colony in each plate in 5ml culture tubes with 1x ampicillin added and incubated at 37 °C and 160 rpm at 5:30PM. So tomorrow we can proceed to the DNA extraction step.

Since Sriram became busy with culturing the transformed colonies, I made 40x100 µl aliquots into cool and sterile eppendorfs in laminar flow and stored in -80°C freezer. In the freezer the competent cell containing eppendorfs were not labelled and kept in the box for each module. The 40 eppendorfs were separated as follows: 18 eppendorfs for 36 transformations in Delay device box, 11 eppendorfs for 22 transformations in Conjugation box and 11 eppendorfs for 22 transformations in SDP box.

From this, it seemed like the bombs that pose problems for our method, namely those with thick metal walls, are quite easy to find, and that the bombs which are more suited for our method (thin-walled bombs) usually have low metal content and are hard to find with current methods. Bergman confirms this: “The methods seem quite complementary.”
We asked Lt Col Bergman how important speed was for the detection of bombs, since promoter-based biosensors like ours are inherently slow. “When on out-of-area missions, we have to clear a route before a patrol drives there, so if the detection method is slow, we’re halting the whole convoy. However, if you can somehow spray your bacteria on the area the night before and this method would make the bombs clearly visible, it would be a great method.” Furthermore, Lt Col Bergman indicates that our method is well suited for screening of, for example, building sites.
Visit to PAX
We visited PAX, a Dutch peace organization which was until recently known as IKV Pax Christi. Here we met with Suzanne Oosterwijk, Programme Officer Security & Disarmament. With her, we discussed the “soft” side of the battle against landmines and cluster munitions, in which PAX is an important player, and the landmine detection module of our project.
PAX is one of the founding organizations of the Cluster Munitions Coalition (CMC) and has until very recently been a governance board member of the ICBL-CMC (merger between the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and CMC). PAX is still closely involved with the activities of this organization. “These coalitions are very diverse,” Ms. Oosterwijk tells us, “You have organizations involved in victim assistance, clearance and also organizations that are more focused on lobbying and research, all working together to create a world free of landmines and cluster munitions.”
“Our main focus is cluster munitions. We are very active in a disinvestment campaign, Stop Explosive Investment, which aims to prohibit the investment in companies which make cluster munitions. We also focus on the monitoring of compliance to the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) and universalization of this treaty.” PAX has had particular success with their disinvestment campaign in the Netherlands: as of January 2013, investments in companies making cluster munitions are prohibited. “In the CCM, assistance"
UESTC-China,2014,Team:UESTC-China_-_-_TEXT.html," formaldehyde metabolism related genes from both methylotrophs and plants were transferred into tobacco to rebuild a new formaldehyde metabolism pathway in our super plant.
To further increase the degradation efficiency of formaldehyde, we co-expressed gene AHA2, which is original from Arabidopsis thaliana, to regulate stomata opening. In addition, by taking into account of biosafety of genetically modified organism, we introduced the gene of cysteine protease into our super plants. The transgenic tobacco pollen will be aborted while cysteine protease gene is specifically expressed in tobacco tapetum.
With more and more achievements have been harvested about the super plant, we organized various activities such as questionnaire survey, school seminar series, video making, etc, to vigorously promote synthetic biology, iGEM and our super plant. Along with the happy summer vacation, we had completed our project successfully with the efforts of all members. Let's meet at MIT and share each other's achievenments.

A given promoter with both regulator and inducer being unspecific
Unspecific inducers binding to the regulators as well as unspecific binding of the regulator to another promoter species was observed in almost all possible combinations.  To conclude, we were not able to find an orthogonal quorum sensing pair out of the three systems investigated ( LuxI/LuxR, LasI/LasR, or RhlI/RhlR ). While we see a significant effect when implementing the influence of these crosstalks (on an inducer-, regulator- and promoter-level) in our whole cell model , the logic gate still continues to function for a range of inputs at physiological concentrations.

Riboregulators
High basal expression from inactive inducible promoter (leakiness) is a common challenge in the implementation of robust biological control system. The problem is especially severe for systems that approximate digital Boolean logic or drive an amplified downstream response. In the first case an OFF state can be interpreted as ON resulting in incorrect computations. The second scenario leads to high levels of undesired final response. Many former iGEM teams have encountered unwanted basal expression of their genes of interest (goi) due to promoter leakiness ( ETH2013 , Groningen2012 , amongst others), resulting often in narrow optimal operation conditions for their biological devices. Since our system is based on Boolean Logic for its decisions and relies on downstream amplification to regenerate and propagate the signal as a first step we investigated strategies to improve tight gene control. Looking into the available literature we found riboregulators as a promising, highly generalizable approach to address the issue of leakiness [32] .  As a convenient proof of concept we coupled the system with quorum sensing modules characterized the response and made the resulting parts available for the iGEM community in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . We suggest that this approach can be generalized to improve many of the inducible system contained in the registry
The riboregulator systems include two parts: 1) a cis-repressed RBS in front of the goi, and 2) a co-expressed trans-activating RNA.
To characterize this system for reliable cell-to-cell communication, we combined the riboregulator part with promoters of the quorum-input-sensing systems used by our team ( LuxI/LuxR, LasI/LasR, and RhlI/RhlR ). In our final gene circuit , the riboregulators were intended for tight control of integrases . However, to have an easily quantifiable and proportional output, we initially used GFP as our rib"

Training
Briefly describe the topics that you learned about in your safety training.
Our safety training covered hazardous material storage and usage, biohazard usage practices, protective personal equipment, engineering and human safety controls, and in-depth properties of select hazards, such as peroxides and flammable compounds. The laboratory safety training requirements at UCLA can be found here
In your country, what are the regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories? Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
In the USA, biosafety regulations are provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Biological Safety Association (ABSA), and National Institute of Health (NIH)
Project Risks
Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
E. coli K12 strain does not pose a major safety risk to humans. Nephila clavipes silk, which is the expressed protein product in our project, does not pose a safety risk either. Nevertheless, skin contact and potential ingestion should be eliminated or minimized.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public, particularly if any biological materials escaped from your lab:
Spider silk does not pose any safety or health risk to the environment if released. E. coli may have unpredictable impacts on the local ecosystem if released, but this is unlikely.
What measures are you taking to reduce these risks?
We chose a very safe chassis organism to use, K12 E.coli. We are also wearing proper Personal Protective Equipment, such as lab coats, gloves, and safety glasses when handling biological materials. Additionally, any surfaces that have been potentially contaminated by bacterial species are thoroughly cleaned using ethanol and/or bleach.
Risks of Your Project in the Future
What new risks might arise from your project's growth? Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
No safety risks would arise from the availability of our product or the knowledge of how to generate our product. There may be some impact to materials industries if the generation of genetically altered recombinant silk became commercially viable. For example, the natural silk industry may"

Comparative analysis
In the following Table 3 the advantages and disadvantages of Biotic Blue are presented, indicating the points of superiority compared to existing solutions and the features that need further development. Table 3 can be used as a valuable guide for future improvement driving through different stages the evolution of Biotic Blue.
Table 3. Advantages and disadvantages of Biotic Blue implementation in WWTPs.
Although Biotic Blue may not be the ultimate solution for treating pharmaceuticals in WWTP, undoubtedly, it bears significant competitive advantages against its two major competitive methods, Ozonation and Activated carbon. Our solution has a higher cost-effectiveness profile, lower operational energy consumption, does not pose any threat to its handlers and the environmental risk of degradation residues is less than Ozonation by-products.
In comparison to Activated Carbon, Biotic Blue has significant cost benefits since the magnetic beads can be retrieved in a more efficient way and they can be regenerated with lower capital demands as well. Furthermore, our solution offers lower installation costs and space requirements, making it particularly attractive for WWTP with limited available space.
However, at this point it is important to highlight that the implying capability of Biotic Blue immobilizing any enzyme on the magnetic beads, allows it potentially to treat wastewater contaminated from any mixture of pharmaceuticals. This unique tailoring capability according to the synthesis of the contaminants in the inflow, is what makes Biotic Blue resource-efficient, outperforming the other solutions.
Impact on Society
In order to assess how Biotic Blue affects society in practise, we decided that there is no better way than examining its fit with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as Global Goals, are a set of universal goals, targets and indicators that meet the most urgent challenges facing our world. SDGs came into effect in January 2016 and since then, with 15 years horizon, set the framework for the United Nations Development Programme. SDGs follow and expand on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in which all 191 United Nations member states declared commitment from 2000 to 2015 (21).
The success of the goals depends unsurprisingly on their translation into introduction of new legislations, improvement of existing regulations and implementation of action plans in both governmental and sub-governmental level. Therefore, as it seems paradoxical at first, “localization’’ is the key to attain these ambitious global goals. Localization means to put everything within subnational frameworks, from setting targets to deciding the mode of action and selecting indicators for monitoring"

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Model#Larginine_-_-_TEXT.html," the knowledge of the pathway, but at the same time are not hard to model. This model was intended to help us to formalise analysis of the pathway during our experiments, to help us to describe the involvement of individual regulatory mechanisms in the pathway and to predict the quantity of arginine produced by E. coli strains with various modifications in the arginine production pathway.
We found several published models of the arginine pathway. The focus of the first model (2) was gene expression - in particular promoter activity of the elements of the arginine pathway - as a function of bacterial growth. The authors argue that the level of gene expression is a result of two mechanisms: specific (the pathway) and global. Two principles have been proposed:
1) During metabolic steady state, repression of transcription dominates. Under stable conditions the promoter activity never reaches its full activity.
2) Maximum promoter activity depends on global regulation of growth and metabolism: promoter activity peaks only during transient adaptation in response to dynamic changes – this is linked to the global regulation of the promoter activity.
What was important to keep in mind when developing our model is that the repressive activity varied at most three-fold amongst the seven targets of argR present in the pathway, and that self-repression of argR was ten-fold weaker. Additionally, the observed enzyme concentrations followed the just-in-time rule, according to which concentrations of enzymes decrease along the pathway, and thus the observed concentrations were:  argA > argCBH > argD > argE > argF > argG (with argI being the exception).
The drawback was that the published code of this model contained only the argA and argR parameters, whereas we were interested in understanding the whole arginine pathway. However, in the future, we could use the model to include global regulatory mechanisms in our model: the experimental modifications we planned are likely to affect the growth rate of the bacteria and thus our model may deviate from the experimental data because of not taking the effects of the global machinery on promoter activity into account.
The second model (3) is a mathematical description of the arginine pathway and its cross-section with the pyrimidine pathway. The model is divided into three segments where each segment contains only one regulatory step, whereas other steps are considered non-rate limiting and not linked to other pathways.
In comparison to the second model, we wanted our model to include more steps of the arginine pathway and exclude those elements of the pyrimidine pathway which do not converge with the arginine pathway. However, the publication was a useful guide when it comes to estimating parameters of our model.
Because of the reasons mentioned above"

UCLA,2013,Team:UCLA#Project#mrnaDisplay_-_-_TEXT.html," an in vivo system (the BPP-1 phage) and using it as the scaffold in our in vitro protein selection system.  We know that in that native system of the BPP-1 phage, a large library of phages are generated with unique variants of the Mtd protein on their tail fibers.  Out of this large library, some phage are able to effectively bind to a certain target using the Mtd protein.
A major concern is that the Mtd protein may not behave the same way in vitro as it does in the natural BPP-1 system.  Although we are theoretically able to generate more variants of Mtd than in the natural phage system, it is possible that isolating it from the phage could seriously affect its binding capabilities.  For example, the native phage has several tail fibers, each with a copy of the Mtd that could potentially bind to a target.  It may be that one isolated Mtd has a very low binding affinity and that it is necessary to have several in order to create a strong enough binding interaction with the target (Dai).

There were a lot of information thrown at us today; I think we might need a few days to digest everything, but we do not have the luxury of time...  Also, we did a short interview with Professor Kuldell today, but I think we might need to talk to her in the future when we have a better idea of what exactly to ask her in terms of UCD.
Thursday, 6/14: Today we attended a talk by Tamara Hendrickson from Wayne State University on bioethics and working in academia.  It was especially insight, and made us realize that regulation and training and organization all come into HUGE play when working in a wetlab.  I think it would be great if we had the chance to interview her later on, and ask specific questions about troubleshooting in the lab, as well as more about bioethics in general.
Friday, 6/15: Today we talked to Professor Arumainayagam (Chris A) from the Chemistry department, and interviewed him on a variety of topics, from development ideas on the ELN, to visualizing troubleshooting trees, to recording citations for papers, to managerial tools in his lab.  We also talked to him about a variety of lab-organizing softwares and tools that are used in his lab.  Chris A suggested that we look more into Quartzy, because his lab plans on using this tool for management in the lab.  He gave us a lot to think about, as we realized that the concerned between his research and say, Traci's research, are oceans apart, but we needed to design tools that may be used by both for organizing their labs.  Also, Chris A mentioned that Windows 8 was not very intuitive to him; perhaps that's something we also need to think about when designing things for synthetic biologists- there always has to be a balance between cutting-edge technology and design, and what people deem comfortable and intuitive.  We need to think about all of these problems when going to do design the ELN.
Also, because G-nomeSurfer was on an ""ocean"" theme (thus, the surfer board), it might be a ""cute"" idea if we renamed the ELN the PLOTBox (Personal Lab Organizational ToolBox), because it seems to compromise of several tools used for organization, including a presenter function on the Beast, a notebook component, and an organization component used in-situ in the wet lab.  PLOTBox also just makes me think of sandcastles and shovels, so that"

Thank you again for Thursday. The girls really enjoyed the day and absolutely loved receiving the ‘My Favourite Enzyme’ envelopes after the session. Thank you for attaching the PowerPoint and again for all your hard work in making sure the day was filled with valuable learning about enzymes.
Kind regards,
Julia”
The students were asked to do a survey after completing the excursion and they also had a positive response to the experience. The survey allowed students to make comments on the excursion, enabling us to gauge possible improvements to the session for the future – some of which are detailed below.
Table 1: Suggestions from the survey of students conducted after the excursion that could be used to improve the session.
Finding
Improvement
Many students said that their favourite part was talking to the instructors and hearing about their research.
We could incorporate this into the presentation, with each student instructor having the opportunity to explain what they are studying, and why.
The students appeared unsure about the concept of synthetic biology, even after the presentation.
We could have a very clear “mission statement” for synthetic biology, which would lead into a group discussion about what the statement means.
The majority of students enjoyed using air displacement micro-pipettes.
We could introduce other university equipment and techniques that students are not exposed to at high school, such as handling microbial cultures.
The survey also indicated that there is potential for development of other sessions that are specific to the other modules of the syllabus, particularly since the majority of students (when asked) expressed interest in ‘genetics’ and ‘medicine’. Expanding on either of these topics would allow for improved engagement with the concept of synthetic biology.
However, time and resource limitations meant that further lesson development was alternatively channelled into a creating a teaching package from the lessons that were given in the workshop. This is also targeted at upper high school students, particularly those learning the new Biology syllabus.

This bodes well for future laboratory endeavours where the bioreactor schema along with an engineered cell-line optimized for flotation from gas vesicle formation could be tested in a small scale laboratory model of the system to test its empirical performance. This is useful for model validation, and proof of concept.
An improvement to the bioreactor could be seen in the form of incorporation of an experimental growth dynamics model as demonstrated in the Growth Dynamics section with the Goempertz equation. The Monod equation was chosen initially for this model because it is scalable and its parameters are known for BL21; however, it only describes the exponential phase of growth and it is not guaranteed that the biomass will remain in exponential phase during the bioreactor process. Another shortcoming is that it is a single-substrate model and in practice, this would not be the case as the likely nutrient source would be from carbohydrates, lipids, and organics present in the waste-water effluent. For future application-based analysis using the bioreactor model, Goempertz coefficients could be determined for a biomass of industrially relevant size for the volume demands dictated by the industry requiring bioremediation using a similar experimentation and analysis technique as described in the Growth Dynamics section.
To further enrich the analysis of the behaviour of the bioreactor model, in addition to the existing sensitivity analysis, identification and characterization of stable points resulting from different combinations of parameter values could be performed.
It would also be informative to apply the stochastic temporal tracking algorithm to real flotation data (images), once obtained, to estimate the buoyant force for ARG1 and compare different modifications of ARG1 to determine an optimal gene combination for flotation.
A next major step is coupling cellular flotation assays with cell surface engineering for application-based testing for different bioremediation tasks. Much research has been done relating to selecting peptide sequences for metal binding [4][5]. Existing techniques would include constitutively expressing cell-surface protein along with OD regulated IPTG induction ARG1, or optimised constructs of ARG1 for flotation.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," in the iGEM biosafety White List
Our project choose C.elegans as the model organism. C.elegans is a harmless organism which is on the iGEM white list. It is very safe to use C.elegans to do researches and scientists have utilized C.elegans in molecular biology and developmental biology researches since 1965.
2) Bacteria
E.coli is a naturally derived organism from humans and we used the strain DH5alpha to express our parts. These strains are so called “lab strains” and cannot survive in the human digestive system. They are also not able to produce toxins. Therefore, E.coli are classified as the lowest risk organisms in biosafety.
Environment safety
After we finish our experiment, we properly dispose our experiment materials. We use alcohol to sterilize all tools that have been exposed to source of contamination. When we discard C.elegans plates, we do bleaching to the worm with alkaline hypochlorite solution so that we can avoid any gene pollution. Besides, those C.elegans plates are treated specially with a separate Bio-medical waste bin.
Parts safety
Our project aims to express channelrhodopsins (Chrimson and CoChR ) in AWA and AWB neurons and use calmodulin GEMgeco to measure cytosolic calcium concentrations. We build our parts (str1::CoChR::GEM-GECO::GFP and ord-10::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::mCherry ) by ourselves, whose elements are safety and nontoxic. The red-light sensitive Chrimson is from Chlamydomonas noctigama and the blue-light sensitive CoChR comes from Chloromonas oogama [1] . In addition, the GEM-GECO is evolved by pre-existing protein engineered fluorescent protein. [2]
Biosafety community
Bio-safety needs to be supervised by a healthy biosafety community, thus, we attended the biosafety sharing session held by HKU iGEM 2017. In this meeting, iGEM teams shared with each other about how to keep biosafety at iGEM lab. Moreover，a senior shared her experience of setting up first community lab at HK. And end with her word, "" Setting up the first community is a difficult job, but it is worthy for great contribution of spreading the idea of bio-safety.""

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," year during the construction process of iGEM biobrick parts for     our new project, we felt the need for an application to find interacting     parts based on an input/output model to design the genetic constructs.     Using a specialized software for searching the parts registry to find     possible biobricks to include into our construct would be much easy,     fast and accurate than manual. We have shared our need with a group     of friends who are software engineers, and initiated the METU_Turkey_SOFTWARE     team where we worked together over this summer to build the BIO-Guide     software.
Scope and Future Aspects
The partregistry.org is     a continuously growing collection of standard genetic parts that can     be mixed and matched to build synthetic biology devices and systems.     The Registry is based on the principle of ""get some, give some"". Registry     users benefit from using the parts and information available in the     Registry for designing their own genetically engineered biological systems.     In exchange, the expectation is that Registry users will contribute     back to the information and the data on existing parts and will submit     new parts they have designed in order to improve this community resource.
As an expanding database partregistry.org needs to be more organized and the standardization template needs to     be improved. Additionally, the potential of multiple ways of using each     part in different construct combination brings out the necessity for     an application to search through the database. BioGuide is the first     designed software that organizes over 1000 parts in partregistry.org as possible     atomics parts to build new biological device and systems for specific     input and outputs based on graph theory. The requirement of similar     applications and software tools are now inevitable in the emerging field     of synthetic biology. The innovative approach that makes the partregistry.org easy to use     for synthetic biology applications is the collection of standardized     parts that can be used in any combination with minimal effort under     one database. But while working on our algorithm to search for possible     combinations of parts depending on the given input and output, we have     realized that present standards are inadequate and parts registry form     must be improved.
In very near future a new format for parts registry form is needed     and few additional features should be implemented to have more control     on the database. We are planning to suggest a new format and features     for the parts registry based on the survey results we have received.     And planning to build the next version of Bioguide based on the revised     parts registry form. Along with using new parts registry standards we     will be improving the algorithm, so that the software can search through"

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

We could observe that even after fourteen days of continuous growth in optimal conditions without the presence of antibiotics, our chassis still managed to express sfGFP and therefore contained the plasmid. However, considerable loss of fluorescence can be seen due to progressive loss of plasmid. Also, a decrease in the number of colonies can be observed. The lower number of colonies is due plasmid loss. Plasmid loss can be attributed to the replication rate of the bacteria being faster than the replication rate of the plasmid.

2.1 Anti-holin expression
We have completed stage 1 of the assembly of the Gene Guard. A protein gel showed a clear band of the appropriate size right at the bottom of the gel when compared to a control cell. Therefore, we have sequence verified and shown that the BBa_K515104 expresses a protein of the appropriate size (Figure 3).

2.2 Gene integration of the anti-holin
Once we knew that the anti-holin construct was alright and seemed to be producing a small protein we had to excise the insert and ligate it into the CRIM plasmid. This was complicated as the high copy number plasmid was placing a heavy metabolic burden on the cells making them grow incredibly slowly (something that is not desirable for when you have to be working for a deadline). Not only that, the cells seemed to be losing the plasmid after four days on a plate in a cold room and some of the colonies managed to alter the plasmid in a way that made it lose the sfGFP and allowed the cells to grow quickly and out-compete any cells with the correct plasmid. However, after a lot of trial and error we managed to isolate eight plasmids that were possible candidates for the plasmid we wanted to integrate.

The final result is presented below:
The unit is a.u.
Processing the data:
1. We obtained 9 technical replicates of liquid culture, so we got the average of fluorescence of the liquid culture .Then we subtracted the average number from the data of fluorescence of the other samples.
2. We divided the data by the OD600 measurement to get that of fluorescence released by a unit of each device.
3. We calculated the standard deviation of each device.
4. We omitted the number after the decimal point of all the data.
Notice:
1. Because the number we subtracted from the data of fluorescence was the average of that released by liquid culture, some data became below zero which we presented as ""/"" in the charts below.
2. Because of our own problems, we did not do the ""extra credit work"" of J23117 + I13504.

Collaboration with UCAS
To fully characterize UCAS's need of their data, we helped them characterize their nitrogen promoter to make their data more solid. In addition, we used their promoter to construct new parts which could sense the concentration of nitrogen, which could help enrich our input library.
Collaboration with Fudan-China
Our team visited Fudan_China in August to exchange ideas of two projects. We discussed the problem met in their modeling and found an available method to describe this complex dynamic model. Each part of this system will affect others at the same time, so it is impossible to give an analytic solution. We talked about the possibilities of dividing their circuit into smaller parts that can be delivered by their multilayer signal processing system and finally gave a realistic model.
Library construction
We collect parts from other teams to help with our project,constructing our library
Meeting
In this summer, our team attended several meetings organized by other iGEM teams. We have learned a lot from these meetings by interacting with other teams. We are also benefited from exchanging ideas and initiating collaborations during these meetings. On the other hand, our idea about the synthetic biology platform also synergized with other team’s project.

Unfortunately, due to the difficult nature of detecting an instantaneous luminescence signal and the unstable nature of coelenterazine-Luciferase reaction in different conditions (inhibition due to various molecules such as glucose), our attempts in detecting it on the plate reader failed. Further tests are planned, including an experiment in the microfluidic chips, to directly measure the effect of mechanical pressure, but will not be done before the wiki freeze.

Culturing E. coli with constitutive GFP on chip
We loaded E. coli, which contained constitutive GFP, in the chip. By using LabVIEW, a protocol was launched overnight to ensure the growth of the cells (the protocol can be found here ).
The next morning, a scan of the chip was done to see the intensity of the GFP in the chip.

Who We Helped
University of Ottawa
We collaborated with the uOttawa iGEM team to design, implement, and analyze an ODE model of a genetic switch to determine under what conditions we could achieve tristability. We produced phase plane diagrams over a wide range of parameters to show their design was possible. This was a continuation of our cooperation with uOttawa from last year in their search for tristability. You can go to their wiki page and click “Modeling” in the sidebar to view their modelling work.
Aalto-Helsinki
We provided bulk data from the 2014 teams for Aalto-Helsinki's Team Seeker software tool to better search abstracts from all 2014 iGEM teams. We also provided information for the team's Collab Seeker tool.
Tec-Monterrey
We provided three plasmids to the Tec-Monterrey team from our 2014 project . The first plasmid contained DsRed, ermM, Amp, oriV (S. aureus) + oriV (E. coli), the second had oriT-Nes, and the third had the trs region.
Surveys completed and shared
We were asked to fill out and share a number of surveys, and did so for the following teams: University of Indonesia , IIT Kharagpur , Paris-Saclay and University College London .
Who Helped Us
University of Ottawa
We had some trouble with assembling some of our plant constructs, and the uOttawa team stepped in and helped us out. They assembled most of our B-set pCAMBIA plasmid [insert link] for us using yeast. From here we used Gibson Assembly to add our B2 target to complete the plasmid.

Furthermore additional  factors like secondary structures, diffusion rates and degradation rates of RNA fragments. With that a model of the actual expression rate of proteins can be modeled with a given sequence that shall be silenced. This modeling approach turned due to the high potential into our software project . The experimental part was shown on the silencing results site .
Discussion
The modeling for the point of time where the toxicity kicks in showed, that due to the troublesome way to find the right promoter strength a universal promoter library would be an important addition to the synthetic biology community. That way the promoter library in the parts collection represents an universal standard for the iGEM community to characterize their promoters.
The crossflow reactor design was strongly influenced by the toxicity modeling. Another way to approach the high copper uptake were our anti toxicity measures the BioBricks BBa_K2638101 , BBa_K2638100 , BBa_K2638103 , BBa_K2638105 , BBa_K2638106 , BBa_K2638120 and BBa_K2638121 enrich now the parts registry.
The siRNA/RNAi modeling went over into our software project because it showed way more potential like this.
The ferritin modeling was a important measure to make sure the characterization of the ferritin molecules didn’t encountered any issues.

Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," vitro diagnostic device used by laboratories to determine the MIC and whether or not a specific strain of bacterium or fungus is susceptible to the action of a specific antimicrobial. This type of test is most commonly used in healthcare settings to help guiding physicians in treatment of patients by indicating what concentration of antimicrobial successfully would treat the infection.
MIC test has been used as standard test method of the detection of antibiotic resistance in hospitals. It has weaknesses such frequent error caused by agar LB, disk, tested pathogens, reference strain, and cultivation condition, and lab technician.
Another shortcoming of MIC test is the time to get the result. In terms of accuracy and required time, other advanced tests such as mecA PCR Method is recommended by some hospitals. But still majority of detection is being by MIC.
3. Cost of the Detection
Actual cost needed for the detection varies hospitals from hospitals. However average cost of susceptibility test is 55000KW ($50) to 90000KW ($85). For other test, the testing cost is more than 250000KW ($ 200). Testing expense is not covered by mandatory government insurance plan. Thus, if the patient does not have private insurance policy, she should pay by herself.
US
The CDC reported that each year in the United States only, at least 2 million people acquire serious infections with bacteria that are resistant to one or more antibiotics designed to treat the very infection.  At least 23,000 people die each year as a direct result of these antibiotic-resistant infections.  Many more die from other medical conditions that were further complicated by an antibiotic-resistant infection. (Source: Antibiotic Resistant Threats in the United States 2013, Center for Disease Control and Prevention)
In order to cope with the threats, CDC is adopted five major tasks in order to support initiatives of the White House’s National Strategy to Combat Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria (https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/carb_national_strategy.pdf)and the President’s Executive Order(https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/18/executive-order-combating-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria)

Project Description
The development of synthetic biology aroused the concerns of biosafety problems due to the great editing and recreation of genome, resulting in the difficulty predicting the behavior of synthetic organism. Accidental spreading of synthetic organism may pose a threat to our environment. In the past few years, several iGEM teams has discussed and reported the need               for a standard safety cassette for synthetic biology. Our teammates viewed this as an important issue. Some past teams also focused on this topic, such as xx using DNase e.t.c. We would like to design a better circuit, which is highly regulated and cheaper control to suit the goal.
This summer we investigated the innate function of CRISPR Cas systems in prokaryotes and               tried to apply its cleavage for the purpose of biosafety. In our project we design and engineer a               biological circuit called killing switch, which can perform destruction of DNA when the genetic               modified organisms leave the required conditions, and then transfer the system into ''E. coli''.

5. Other data
Q2. How were your understandings in each field of projects changed after poster session?
1. unchanged 2. not so much 3. got better a little bit  4. got better 5. got better so much
From two graphs above, we can see clear differences.
See the choice d, e, f, the fields difficult to imagine from daily life.  Understandings of those who don't have much knowledge on iGEM projects and   biology, tend to think the explanations were hard to grasp in contrast to that of iGEMers'.                   On the other hand, choice a, b, c the fields easy to imagine from daily life, shows that non-iGEMers' understandings were drastically improved in   contrast to that of iGEMers'.

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#HolographicModel_-_-_TEXT.html,", Bottom: no additional magnification (pure lensless setup)
These modelling results show that a magnification of 10x drastically enhances the contrast and visibility of both the beads and the bacteria. The reason therein lies that when having a magnifying unit below the sample, one can choose the focus       plane to be very close to the sample (e.g. 10um) through adjusting the objective lens. However, when using a lensless setup without this magnifying unit, one has to assume a bigger spacing between the sample and the sensor. When assuming this       distance to be approximately 1mm, as shown in the lower row, it is almost impossible to see E.coli even in the simulation. This is due to the bacteria having very little contrast and multiple interferences due to the long path between the       sample and the sensor. Unfortunately, the HoloPy simulation only provides the Signal Intensity in arbitrary units and therefore it is impossible to draw a final conclusion as one does not know how sensitive a real imaging chip is.
Conclusion
These theoretical results were in line with our experimental data and showed that a lensless setup would not be applicable with commercial sensors. Thus, we decided to primarily focus on the brightfield imaging. There was also no room for       improvement in the pixel size of the sensor as our own with a pixel size of only 1.2um was already one of the smallest available. This decision was also in line with the literature available, as [REF1] and [REF3] were also using       an additional magnification to successfully resolve E.coli.

The Microguards: Overview
Nowadays, there are numerous industrial processes that use microorganisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce compounds of interest, like insulin, ethanol and various enzymes. The success of these processes depends on the absence of contamination by other microorganisms in the culture medium. The presence of contaminants in a fermentation process reduces its efficiency due to competition between the contaminant and the fermentative organism, causing losses of 5 to 10% of the gross production. To try to solve this problem, the aim of our project is to engineer strains of E. coli and S. cerevisiae that are able to recognize and destroy contaminants during industrial processes.
The Coliguard: Our Model
We want our engineered E. coli to be able to recognize and destroy contaminants in culture medium. Since we want our bacteria to show maximum efficiency during the industrial process, we decided to create two different lineages of E. coli:  the worker lineage – responsible for executing the industrial process – and the killer lineage – responsible for detecting and killing the contaminants. Both lineages are going to be simultaneously present in the culture medium, but their proportion will vary due to the presence or absence of contaminants. In the absence of contaminants, the amount of worker cells will be much higher than the number of killer ones, so that the industrial process will occur at its maximum efficiency. In the presence of contaminants, killer cells will induce surrounding worker cells to differentiate into more killer cells in a transient manner. After elimination of contaminants by the killer lineage, the proportion of worker and killer cells will return to its original rate.
Based on our model, we divided the project into three subparts.
Recognition mechanism
Differentiation mechanism
Killing mechanism
1) Recognition mechanism
Our idea is based on the premise that the engineered E. coli most be able to recognize contaminants in the culture medium as non-self. As most bacterial species produces AI2 (auto inducer 2) as a secondary metabolite, we decided to use this compound as a recognition factor. Our E. coli will be an AI"

Collaboration:
Throughout iGEM, we have communicated with a great many other teams via twitter and facebook, and a few through Skype.
We have corresponded with the Bielefeld iGEM team via email and Skype as, like our team, Bielefeld are focusing on cell-free systems as part of their project. Their team managed to build their own cell-free kit - they kindly calculated the price of each reaction for us and provided a table of contents. This helped us see how viable it would be for use in the further application of our project. We also had some early discussions regarding chromoproteins. Bielefeld were kind enough to provide us with details on their home-made cell-free kit, which was incredibly useful in terms of costing our TB test and reduced the price signicantly.
The Oxford iGEM team also got in contact to discuss stochastic modelling and simulations with our modelling team. We exchanged information on our project, finding Oxford’s gene expression model particularly impressive.
Another group we contacted was the Manchester-Graz iGEM team , a merge of two groups of students from the UK and Austria. We Skyped their team and discussed chromoproteins and a survey they are undertaking.
We provided an article for the iGEM newsletter Amoy iGEM team are organising. This can be viewed here .
We attended the UK iGEM meetup, hosted and organised by Westminster iGEM .
A highlight of our iGEM collaboration was the group skype we hosted. Seven teams were involved, although ultimately we were plagued with technical issues and ended up in a smaller Skype call. Thanks to the teams we spoke with: Sydney , Manchester-Graz , and Warwick .
We took part in Kent iGEM team’s survey on nanowires, bioreactors, and renewable energy, and we hope that the data we provided will be useful to them.

This development plan assumes an approximate 2 month development cycle.  This will require approximately one year to fully develop our final product that will be ready for mass production.
Cost of Production
Once our finalized product is ready to enter mass production, estimated analysis for the cost of building the device would require an overhead of about $215.00 per unit.  Additionally, producing one of the cartridges would be equivalent to $5.80 per unit.  The information for this analysis is below:
Figure 3: Cost of production for each cartridge and the components that were included in this analysis.
Figure 4: Cost of production for each device and the components that were included in this analysis.
With these fixed cost of production, we would expect that in order to break-even for manufacturing, we would have to produce 390 cartridges and 9 detectors. This does not include any other over-head which will be required to produce these units. Estimating our profitability will require additional information and will be important to consider with the development of sales strategies and selling activities.
Manufacturing Operations
Production will be facilitated by partnering with key manufacturing services and operation experts. One such example of these partners would be ACAMP - the Alberta Center for the Advancement of MNT Products. This government funded organization provides expertise and funding in order to help commercialize products. The amount of manufacturing which is done by our group will be set to a minimum and only include those particular components which must be completed in a biological manufacturing facility.  This will be advantageous since many of these government organizations can off-set early production costs to allow for our products to reach the market faster. In addition, this allows our company to focus on other areas of production, namely the biological components.
Creating key manufacturing partnerships will be vital in developing the technology.  Our mass production strategy is summarized in the following figure:
Figure 5: Overview of manufacturing strategy and selling activities from in-hosue production to distribution.
Strategic partnership with manufacturing facility which will allow for production of a minimum of up to 10% market share value (government regulatory market detailed above) of cartridges and detector units - costs will be subsidized through government grant programs (for example Alberta Innovates Technology Futures Venture Funding) and government not-for-profit organizations focused on aiding groups to achieve manufacturing goals at limited cost.
The manufacturing facility will be responsible for design, assembly, and quality control of cartridges, specifically: plastics, electrodes, wiring, seals and bleach capsules.
The facility will also be responsible for the full design, fabrication, assembly, and quality control of the detector system: All components of the"

Introduction
La principale inquiétude de la communauté scientifique en ce qui concerne la biologie synthétique est que l’on ne peut pas encore mesurer les risques encourus. En effet, les connaissances actuelles ne permettent pas de prendre un recul suffisant pour prédire l’évolution et le comportement des micro-organismes synthétiques. L’ingénierie des systèmes biologiques reste pour le moment chère et hasardeuse essentiellement parce que la communauté scientifique ne maîtrise pas correctement les procédés moléculaires et cellulaires pour apporter des solutions fiables.
Trois stratégies différentes ont été mises en évidence afin de répondre à ce problème :
La première est la STANDARDISATION. Elle consiste à développer et promouvoir des standards auxquels on peut également appliquer la définition, la description et la caractérisation des entités biologiques basiques. La création du M.I.T. Registry of Standards Biological Parts est une première étape dans cette voie.
La seconde est la DISSOCIATION. Cette méthode permet de séparer un problème compliqué en un nombre de problèmes simples plus important. On peut ainsi avancer de front dans la résolution des différentes problématiques qui sont indépendantes et par conséquent résoudre des systèmes complexes.
La dernière est l’ABSTRACTION. Elle permet de classer les informations, qui décrivent les différentes fonctions biologiques, selon une hiérarchie (qui tient compte des différents niveaux de complexité).
Ces différentes stratégies aident à normaliser et standardiser les protocoles et méthodes de biologie synthétique afin d’en facilité l’utilisation et donc d’en limiter les risques. En attendant une utilisation plus importante de ces trois stratégies, il est nécessaire d’anticiper les risques potentiels pour les expérimentations qui seront développées dans un futur proche pour la normalisation de la biologie synthétique.
La biologie synthétique en étant seulement à ses débuts, il est difficile de déterminer les risques potentiels. Pour pouvoir néanmoins discerner les domaines à risques, on peut transposer l’expérience acqu"

The Problem
The human and ecosystem problem
One of the main issues for the Colombian growers is the extensive use of fungicides and pesticides to control field epidemics. Fungicides have enormous potential to cause adverse effects in health, not only for growers but for consumers. Most fungicides currently in use are unlikely to cause frequent or severe systemic poisoning, most of them may be moderately irritating to skin and mucous membranes (EPA, 1999). Nonetheless chronic exposure can lead to serious adverse effects in health, like hepatocymegaly and malformations, specially in children and adolescents (Muri et al., 2009). Moreover fungicides and pesticides are usually found contaminating soils and waterbodies close to the crop fields and because of their low biodegradation they persist in the environment.
GMOs and the Environment
The genetically modified organisms (GMO) are defined as living beings that carry foreign fragments of DNA in their genome; this DNA confers special features of human interest. Although these modifications imply large benefits for humans, we must consider that releasing GMOs to the environment can, and probably will, produce genetic disturbance in the natural populations reducing their genetic variability and affecting their evolutionary potential. In the case of bacteria, as in our system, the transference of genes is very common due to horizontal gene transfer, high growth rates and short life cycles.
Facing this issue, the Colombia Team @ iGEM proposes an innovative implementation of Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) chromosomal modules for the control of not only horizontal transfer of genetic material but also for population control and the prevention of plasmid curing.
Bacterial Wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum)
Ralstonia solanacearum attack almost 200 plant species in 33 different plant families. This constitutes one of the largest known host ranges for any plant pathogenic bacterium (Moorman BM., 2012). The disease it causes is known as Southern wilt, bacterial wilt, and brown rot of potato. Although Solanaceae (potato family) contains the greatest number of susceptible species, many"

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

SMITe - The Concept: Our Project
Our Project
Our vision is a functional wound dressing which will be able to disperse early-stage S.aureus biofilms in chronic wounds. The scaffold for this dressing is formed by spider silk – a material not only known for its high tensile strength but also for being biocompatible and largely non-immunogenic. Those features make it an ideal candidate material for potential wound dressings. [9]
To actively fight the biofilm, several biofilm-degrading 'combat proteins' are attached to the silk via Sortase A, a transpeptidase isolated from S.aureus. This constitutes a broadly-based approach which will hopefully forestall any bacterial escape or resistance mechanisms.
The combat proteins will target three main components of the biofilm:
extracellular DNA (eDNA)
Poly-N-Acetylglucosamine (PNAG) and Staphylococci themselves
Biofilm-associated proteins
Click on each of the components to learn more about it and about how we are planning to target it.
However, our mission is far from being limited to chronic wound treatment – products similar to our wound dressing could find applications far beyond the medical field.
Go to our 'Future' page to see where our imagination has taken us and exactly how far our project could go!

Module PHI
PHI
PHI is basically the pipette. PHI controls 3 pipette actions, Aspirate, Dispense and Clean. It consists of three motors whose functions are as follow
Motor 1 (3-way Toggle switch)
This motor controls the flow of the air. If you look at it from the side when the switch is visible:
When the switch is to the left, there is a direct flow from the pipet head to the air. This makes it possible to use the second motor (motor B) to attempt to aspirate without aspirating any liquid, and enabling it to blow extra air out.
When the switch is in the middle, there is no connection.
When the switch is to the right, the pressure built up in the air tank is released into the pipette head.
Motor 2 (Aspirate or Dispense Liquid)
This motor is connected to a piston, so it can aspirate and dispense liquid.
Motor 3 (Clean Pipette)
This motor is connected to compressors compressing air in the air tank. It runs for seven seconds once the air is released.
PHI module in action
This video shows Phi running by itself.
Current Functionality and Limitations
BioBrick-A-Bot V1.0 is only a proof-of-principle prototype.  In its current implementation, it is not user-friendly enough to be used by a standard molecular biologist directly. In our current program, both ALPHA and PHI provides a set of primitive functions that can be called by a driver program. ALPHA has a command that allows the pipette head to move to any location and tell PHI to do an action. PHI has primitive functions for ASPIRATING, DISPENSING and CLEANING. In Version 1.0, we still need a programmer to write a driver program and hence it is not usable by a molecular biologist.
In the planned version 2.0, we will build a nice GUI where a molecular biologist can specify what they want to do, without the need of having a programmer to write the driver program. The cost of a typical commercial liquid handling system is about $10,000. The hardware cost of this project is only about $700. We have developed the primitive functions to show that the robot works. The rest of the work is software based, and will not increase the cost of the robot, if we provide it to the user community in the form of open-sourced programs. This project also provides an open framework, where other iGEMers"

The conversion of PRPP   to PRA is a committing  step in the purine biosynthesis. The synthesis of the purine ring involves nine additional steps with the first six reactions being relatively similar. In every reaction, an oxygen atom which is bound to a carbon atom is activated by phosphorylation and a subsequent substitution by ammonia or an amino-group, which act as a nucleophile agent. These subsequent reactions lead to the formation of inosinate (IMP), which acts as a key intermediate in the purine synthesis. Inosinate is converted into either AMP or GMP. AMP is synthesized by a substitution of the C-6 carbonyl oxygen with an amino group by adenylosuccinate synthase (ASS). In this reaction, GTP instead of ATP is used as a donor of the phosphoryl group. The conversion of IMP to GMP is catalyzed by the GMP synthase and starts with the oxidation of IMP to xanthylate (XMP) and the subsequent addition of an amino group. In a second step, XMP is converted into GMP, a reaction that requires ATP as a donor for an AMP group. GMP and AMP are again phosphorylated to GTP and ATP by specific kinases.
Conversion of Ribonucleosid Diphosphates to Deoxyribonucleotides
Figure 1: De novo Synthesis of Purine Bases
Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized from ribonucleotides by substitution of the 2´-hydroxyl group of the ribose by a hydrogen. The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, which is strongly conserved in all living organisms (Berg et al., 2012).  In E. coli, two main types of ribonucleotide reductases exist. Ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductases can convert ribonucleoside-triphosphates into deoxyribonucleoside-triphosphates, while ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductases convert ribonucleoside-diphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside-diphosphates (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000).
Salvage Pathways
Both purine and pyrimidine bases can be recycled and converted into the corresponding nucleotides through salvage pathways. Adenine can be recycled through conversion"
TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," without the use of bio-ink, the cells are not structured and a mixture of red and green cells is formed. This proves that the hydrogel assists in layer formation and that we can use this system for printing the biofilm; the cells can be printed in a structured way and no mixing occurs, even at the interfaces between layers.
Conclusions and Future Directions
We started these experiments with the question whether we can print biofilms in a defined structure. To assess whether we can do this, we wanted to show that we can structure the cells and that they do not mix. The first experiment, layer formation, showed that we can indeed structure the cells in layers. In the second experiment, 3D-stack, we additionally proved that these layers are separated from each other and do not mix. Therefore we conclude that we can print bacteria in a defined structure.
The iGEM team Groningen already set the foundation to the future, where our developed procedure could be tested on different species of bacteria, to assess whether they can also be printed in layers. Supported by interest from industry, further experiments with an applied focus could prove very interesting.

When he got to know that we wanted to fight IBD, he pointed out to us that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), which is an important factor of his ongoing research, is a molecule that has the ability to promote regeneration of cells in the inflammatory regions. Prof. Lu introduced us detailed mechanisms of this growth factor and emphasized that in different human tissues, EGF will have different effects. Therefore, as a growth-promoting factor, EGF may bring about the risk of over-proliferation and even cancer. He reminded us that we have to pay great attention to safety issues.
In the end, Prof. Lu encouraged us to be ambitious and have a try. It turns out that this interview became the foundation of our project!
In our project, we chose intestinal bowel disease as our object of study. To have a better understanding of IBD and obtain the first view of the current situation of patients, we contacted two doctors and set up an interview with them.
One is Ge Wensong, who comes from Shanghai Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. The other is Zhang Shengyu, who is from Beijing Xiehe Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine,Tsinghua University.
Here is the summary of the interview script. (Q= question, A= answear)
Q: Human diseases include not only intestinal diseases, but also many other diseases which threaten human health seriously. So what’s the reason that made you choose to do the research in the field of intestinal diseases?
A1: Diseases involved in gastroenterology are complicated. One of the most prominent disease is intestinal diseases. There are so many different types of intestinal diseases and a major part of them consists of inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal tumors. Studies of intestinal disease are the core research of intestinal diseases nowadays. Personally, I’m very interested in the field of intestinal tumor.
A2: There are three reasons:
Upon the development of social economy and the change of life styles, disease spectrum of digestive system also has been changing. For example, the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease is closely related to the the process of industrialization in Europe and America. And I antipate that intestinal diseases will be one of the most common diseases of digestive system in the 21st century in our country. And the obvious increase of the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease in our country in recent years proves this opinion.
During my years of clinical training, I truly understand the influence brought by intestinal diseases to our patients. For example"

Promoter digests and plasmid vector were each ligated together and incubated at room temperature according to ligation protocol ligation protocol
--JR--Ligation mixtures were each transformed into DH5alpha competent cells according to transformation protocol and then plated on both LB+Cam, and LB+Cam+Amp plates. Plates with both chloramphenicol and ampicillin anitibiotics we expect will select for successful transformants, those which have the standard plasmid backbone and a functioning promoter and beta-lactamase gene
--CS-- Today I ran a gel of the PCR products that I got from last week using a normal gel running at 175 V for about 20 minutes. I included a picture of my gel below:
All of my genes amplified as they should! They are all the appropriate length and have nice defined bands so I continued by using the PCR purification kit to clean up my DNA. I then ran restriction digests of my genes and the pIG91 vector with XbaI and SpeI, using 1 μl CIP to keep the vector from self-annealing. I loaded the digested genes onto a low-melt gel, ran it for about 45 minutes, and then cut out the sections that contained my desired genes. The bands were very faint in my low-melt gel though so I am not sure how well they will actually turn out. I then followed the ligation procedure in the protocol to insert my genes into the backbones. I let these go at room temperature overnight.
I also transformed some promoter plasmids (J23102, J23104, J23111, and J23118) into DH5α and plated it out on some LB+Amp plates overnight to replenish some of the promoter plasmid stocks that Julie had used up in her experiments.

--CS-- Today I picked some colonies from the DH5α that I had transformed with the 4 promoter plasmids and put it in 5 ml of LB+Amp to grow overnight. I then transformed DH5α with the ligations of the 4 denitrification genes and plated that out to grow overnight on LB+Cam plates.

Making competent cells of E. coli for transformation
CC1.1
How to make competent cells for transformation
Compotent cells enough for 12 transformations
Important remarks
Use 2 ml eppendorf tubes
Cool eppendorf tubes at 4°C prior to use
Cool 50 ml 50 mM CaCl2 at 4°C prior to use
Materials
• Overnight culture of TOP10 cells in LB media
• Ice cold 50mM CaCl2
• LB media (pre-heated to 37°C)
Protocol
1. Dilute the culture to OD550 = 0,02 in 110 ml of LB. Incubate at 37°C with shaking until OD550 reaches 0.5
2. Divide the cells in 2x55 ml and transfer to Falcon tubes (the can hold only 55 ml). From now on proceed with the 2 tubes in parallel
3. move the CaCl2 to -20°C
4. Harvest cells by centrifugation at 4100 rpm (2160 G) at 4°C for 10 min.
5. Discard the supernatant (keep the cells on ice!)
6. Resuspend cells gently in 5 ml ice cold CaCl2 (50 mM) taken from -20°C and kept on ice.
7. Repeat the centrifugation step.
8. Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 1.2 ml of icecold CaCl2 (keep the cells on ice!)
9. Leave the cells on ice for 30 min => now the cells are ready for transformation.

    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria"
