Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," and proved the concept of the biobricks standard syntax which allows for the regulated assembly into composite devices we investigating putting this under trial of real-life conditions to transform Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplasts through biolistics. Please read more about the demonstration of the DIY biolistic gene gun we have developed in the lab this summer.  Taking advantage of the aadA resistance gene which we were able to verify in E. coli colonies, we constructed this Phytobrick with a 5’ UTR psaA promoter and a rbcL 3’ UTR terminator, each flanked by the homology regions for insertion into the trnE2-psbH intergenic region (shown to yield high expression rates of the transgene).
As a side note, biolistics is a complex transformation process which requires  a high precision in template preparation and sterility conditions. Our team, due to the time constraints of working with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, were only able to shoot in our constructs once (takes approximately 2 weeks for the algae to grow and can be assayed on plate). To ensure we could obtain all the information from a single transformation we designed the experiment with the appropriate controls: negative control was biolistic transformation with water, positive control was transformation with verified backbones from Saul Purton algal biotechnology lab at UCL which contains the same homology regions are our constructs.
For each plasmid, the biolistics was done with 3 different concentrations of plates:
A,B -- 1 million cells per plate
C,D - 10 million cells per plate
E,F - 70 million cells per plate
The following constructs were shot in:
Construct 1
5’ end homology region + psaA 5’ UTR promoter + aadA gene (conferring resistance to spectinomycin) + rbcL 3’ UTR terminator + 3’ end homology region
Construct 2
5’ end homology region + psaA 5’ UTR promoter + aphA6 gene (conferring resistance to kanamycin) + rbcL 3’ UTR terminator + 3’ end homology region
Purton backbone plasmids were cloned with a aadA cassette into a unique Mlu1 site allowing for the insertion of a gene of interest at the cloning site (flanking enzymes Sph1 and Sap1). This plasmid could not be submitted to the registry due to lack of standard parts. The genes inserted were: VFP ("

The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Engagement.html_-_-_TEXT.html," on our project, how far we have come, and how much we were still planning to do in the last few months before the Jamboree. After, the viewers were able to ask questions, and vote if we made enough progress to proceed and participate at the Giant Jamboree. We got some valuable input and tips on the science part of our project, as well as the way we tell our story. Luckaly, more than 90 percent of the public voted for a go!
Topsector Chemie
One of our team members pitched our project at the annual Topsector Chemie closing ceremony in Wageningen, at the 30th of August. This short pitch focussed on the challenges we face in using synthetic biology. Topsector Chemie is an organisation with the goal to find solutions to big social challenges. These are the so-called Grand Societal Challenges by the Horizon 2020 program of the European Commission. The topsector approaches these challenges from a chemical point of view, collaborating with other top sectors wherever possible.
SynCity
The Wageningen University organised SynCity : a film and art festival on the 5th and 6th of October about synthetic biology to involve the general public in this field. Here, both citizins, scientists and students could discover the field of synthetic biology and how it can be used for many purposes. This is done from an artist point of view. Via art, synthetic biology is depicted, for examples with a series of short movies. Together with iGEM Wageningen 2014 , we presented our view and projects.
Media attention
Snapchat Wageningen University
For one day, we took over the Snapchat account of the Wageningen University. Here, we Snapchatted throughout our day. We showed the target audience, mostly secondary school students who are interested in the Wageningen University, what we do throughout the day, and that science is really versatile and interesting! In this way we not only promoted the Wageningen University, but also brought the iGEM competition under attention by these future scientists.
NEMO Kennislink
NEMO Kennislink , an online magazine that focuses on making scientific news reachable to the general public, posted an article on iGEM and our project. This magazine targets Dutch citizens with an interest in science. You can read the article made by Nico Claassens ""Spanning in het lab voor de synthetische biologie wedstrijd van het jaar"" (in Dutch) on the website of Kennislink.

Dynamic Flexibility
The bonds between segments vary over time
Self-avoiding random walk
Self-avoiding means that once a point on the grid is occupied, it cannot be occupied again. It is effectively excluding a portion of the total volume.
MATLAB Simulation
A self-avoiding random walk simulation on a periodic lattice was constructed to visualise the structure of the star peptide. Using this simulation in MATLAB, we developed a probability distribution for r.
The star peptide shape model can be downloaded here.
The following values were used for the simulation:
$N_{seg} = 100$
$a = 1$
The simulation was run 10,000 times and the following probability distribution for the arm length $r$ was obtained.
The corresponding normal distribution curve is also plotted.
Summary Statistics
Mean

Standard Deviation

The following is a visualisation of the star peptide's probabilistic diameter.
Theoretical Size
In order to obtain a theoretical relationship between arm length and the number of amino acids on each arm, we shall attempt to analyse the energy of the system. We can define the star peptide as four connected springs as shown. We will assume that each arm is the same and thus has the same spring constant.
Now, assuming the springs obey Hookean dynamics, we will develop a relationship between force applied and extension.
$$k_{eff} = (k+k)||(k+k)$$ $$k_{eff} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2k} + \frac{1}{2k}}$$ $$\therefore k_{eff} = k$$
From polymer physics, we know that:
$$F_{elastic} = kr$$ $$F_{el} = \frac{3k_B T}{Na^2} \cdot r$$ $$E_{el} = \int F_{el} dr$$ $$\therefore E_{el} = \frac{3k_B T}{2Na^2} r^2$$
Repulsion from excluded volume (V),
$$E_{rep} = \frac{k_B T v N^2}{2r^3}$$
Assume $v = a^3$,
$$E_{rep} = \frac{k_b T a^3 N^2}{2r^3}$$
Calculating total energy,
$$E_{total} = E_{el} + E_{rep}$$ $$E_{total} = \frac{3k_B T}{2Na^2} r^2"

On the visit to Styropack we had a tour of the factory which was a amazing opportunity to learn a vast amount of information about polystyrene which has been very useful in the project, for example the expansion process utilising pentane. As well as that we learnt about innovate ways the company are tackling the problem there expanded polystyrene product has on the environment with recycling initiatives with B&Q and designing new Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) forms of expanded foam that have similar properties to polystyrene however can be industrially biodegraded yet still retain most of the same chemical strengths. This also gave us some ideas about ways we could lead our project in the future to turn the waste polystyrene into the raw material for creating the PLA.
The visit was also a great opportunity to teach people about iGEM and a bit about synthetic biology which we managed to do with our presentation, not only that but we spoke to a wide variety of people about iGEM and the positive impacts synthetic biology can have, following up with information on where to find out more about the project and iGEM.
The trip down to the Styropack innovations conference was also the first time we made and presented a official presentation for our iGEM team. Although this was a challenge, we feel it was necessary practice for the presentation to come at the UK iGEM Meet up and then at the regional final in Amsterdam as well

Meetup with SKLBC IGEM high school team
On 1st of June, 2014, we are invited to attend a meetup organized by SKLBC high school team, in order to discuss ideas about iGEM projects. In the next few weeks, the IGEM high school team would embrace their first presentation under the world’s attention. At first, two girls form the high school team introduced to us how they think about their software as a social medium to collaborate people’s efforts in finding biobricks. With increasing public engagement in Wechat, a widely-used smartphone app through China, they thought that maybe they could grasp that opportunities and provided the services of presenting biobricks to the users. More importantly, the idea of making full use of social media distinct them from other teams that concentrate more attention on disciplinary knowledge but pale due to a shortage of more advanced knowledge. Then, a boy who was mainly in charge of the app gave a speech about how he developed that app. We surprisingly found that despite lack of experience, he displayed app skill of high level and uttered his determination for better.
In the end, we share our stories in IGEM and found how much we have grown with the help of other IGEMers. Thanks to the platform-IGEM, we strives for better in the years to come.

Toulouse_France,2016,Team:Toulouse France#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the art and science.           But it has leaded us to ask different questions about the role of the synthetic biology in art. We have           known, at the beginning, it is essential to save the Lascaux cave belonging to the World Heritage of           UNESCO and containing an artistic treasure for the Humanity. But different questions have surfaced:           why save art? It is destined to disappear? Why Human need art? Moreover, the Lascaux cave is a           particular piece of art, because is alive: it contain a very complex and dynamic ecosystem. We think           synthetic biology can be a solution to regulate this disturbed ecosystem. Thus, the Lascaux cave is an           alive work of art, it deserves to protected. It carries a memory of the Palaeolithic man.
Scientific concerns
The first step in the project of preserving the Lascaux caves was to get in touch          with the scientists and managers who are taking of the cave. The last information we had about the          condition of the cave was from 2011 and we needed to know the current issues regarding the cave.          We have really appreciated the discussion with Muriel Mauriac, who as a Lascaux cave conservator,          guided us at the beginning of our project about the Lascaux historic, with Yvan Moënne-Loccose,          microbiologist of the Lascaux cave, who helped us analyzing the state of the cave and gave us          precious scientific remarks concerning our project and with Jean-Jacques Cleyet-Merle, director of          the national prehistory museum who encouraged us in our activity. They were pleased by our          initiative and agreed that our project was an original way to conserve the frescoes, but worried on          the probiotic design of our project, that was to modify the microbiota of the caves. They made us          realized that the ecosystem as it is, is important for the integrity of the caves and of the frescoes.          Thanks to these feedbacks, we therefore modified the design of our scientific project.
Public concerns
At our first meeting with the public during this spring, at a time where we had just           chosen the topic of our project, we felt that the public was concerned, not by the objective itself but           by the means to reach it. Interestingly the kind of reactions was age-dependent, the younger ones           were rather enthusiastic whereas the older ones much reserved. It also appeared clearly that there           were some misconceptions about the OGMs, a lack of concrete knowledge about what DNA           manipulations and Synthetic Biology mean.

Reporter
For the purposes of this project it was necessary to select a method in which our system could inform the user of a positive test result; a reporter system. Many choices were considered to be our reporter systems. We decided upon an enzyme/catalyst reporter as we believed that using a reporter such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) simply would not provide a strong enough of a signal for a portable device. GFP would only provide a constant signal that would not increase in intensity over time. The fluorescent output of GFP would also require the device to have the ability to excite the protein with the appropriate wavelength of light. This would add to both the complexity and cost of the device.
With this knowledge in mind we knew an enzyme with a colour output would be more suitable and easier to understand out in the field. Many common enzymes were analyzed for this purpose. One example is horseradish peroxidase. This enzyme has high enzymatic activity and is commonly used in many biological applications. One problem with its use however is that it cannot be effectively produced within E. coli. There are other common enzymes that do not have this issue such as alkaline phosphatase. These enzymes however are often multimeric which presents an issue with our in vitro strip system. If the enzymes are not able to assemble correctly with the rest of our proteins the device will be ineffective. Based on this knowledge we decided to move forward with two potential reporter systems; the ampicillin resistance enzyme beta-lactamase and chemically modifying ferritin to become a strong catalyst.

UCL,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Functionalizing Fibers_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s physical properties.  Therefore, spinning the functionalized proteins with normal silk proteins helps maintain the physical integrity of the resulting fiber.  In order to get the functional peptides to associate with the silk, we attach the peptide to either a short silk repeat or some other sequence with affinity for silk.
For our particular project, the proteins that we plan to co-spin are natural Bombyx mori silkworm silk and a recombinant protein fusion consisting of a silk-GFP hybrid. There are two recombinant fusions that we are testing: the first is a single MaSp2 subunit of Nephila clavipes silk genetically fused to superfolder GFP, and the second is superfolder GFP flanked by the N and C termini of Bombyx mori silk.
The sequence for one of our silk-GFP hybrids. This is based off of a sequence used in vivo in experiments by Iizuka, et al. [1]
sfGFP in these experiments can be swapped out for any other functional protein that is small enough in size so as to not interfere with the silk fiber formation when co-spun with natural silk.
The silk sequences in the protein fusions function somewhat as affinity domains, encouraging the fusions to bind to the native silk proteins at homologous amino acid sequences during the co-spinning process.
This has been previously accomplished in vivo in recombinant silkworms, but we aim to translate the process into an in vitro protocol [1] .
Functionalization Constructs
Functional recombinant silk fibers can be produced through several means. One of the approaches our team took to make such fiber is by fusing GFP to one subunit of MaSp2. In theory, the MaSp2 subunit would facilitate intermolecular interactions between the GFP-MaSp2 protein fusion and the native silk proteins, allowing the GFP to intercalate into the final fiber when extruded via co-spinning. The part was produced using standard iGEM Assembly RFC10, after replacing the stop codon with two nucleotides at the end of GFP to keep everything in frame. The final construct consists of a 6x His Tag fused to the N-terminus of GFP in the GFP-MaSp2 fusion, flanked by the BioBrick prefix and suffix.
What We've Done
This summer we have established protocols for processing Bombyx mori silk for co spinning. (see protocol page and processing silk page).  We have also designed, ordered, and assembled functional silk sequences.  These sequences include the N terminus-sfGFP-C termin"

Discussion
All the cultures showed a similar growth curve; doubling time was computed as described here in order to obtain information about the burden due to the synthesis of such fusion proteins. It is possible to see that all doubling times are very similar except for induced cultures. In this case doubling time is much higher than both positive control and non-induced cultures; for this reason it is possible to assert that induction gives a high metabolic burden.
From GFP curve and mean protein synthesis rate it is possible to appreciate that induced <partinfo>BBa_K300091</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K300092</partinfo> GFP accumulation profiles are comparable and they significantly differ from the GFP raw time series of the negative control <partinfo>BBa_B0031</partinfo>. On the other hand not induced <partinfo>BBa_K300091</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K300092</partinfo> show a profile that is very similar to the negative control. These results show that the green fluorescent protein assembled downstream of the construct is correctly folded and that the inducible system works as expected.

Le transport du gène-médicament est une des problématiques les plus difficiles que rencontre la thérapie génique. Trouver un système de transfert efficace qui stabilise, induit et exprime le transgène n’a pas encore été trouvé.  Le transfert du gène-médicament nu dans les cellules reste peu efficace. L’expression du gène médicament est faible aussi bien en intensité qu’en durée étant donné la nature polyanionique de l’ADN qui ne lui permet pas de franchir la barrière que constitue la membrane cellulaire. Ainsi, il faut environ 100 000 molécules d’ADN par cellule cible pour qu’une seule séquence d’ADN parvienne à pénétrer dans le noyau.   A cela, s’ajoute l’inefficacité  du transfert de ce médicament nu. En effet  l’utilisation d’ADN nu diminue l’efficacité du ciblage vers un tissu donné, ainsi le nombre de cellules ayant incorporé le gène-médicament reste faible. Or, l’objectif de l’industrie pharmaceutique est l’administration, par voie systémique, de ces gènes.
Une des solutions consiste à intégrer l’ADN dans un vecteur. Ce dernier doit répondre à plusieurs critères :
- être capable de protéger l’ADN,
- cibler la cellule désirée avec une grande spécificité,
- délivrer le gène facilement à travers la membrane de la cellule,
- délivrer le gène jusqu’au noyau afin de permettre son expression.

A: What we anticipated from this interview was to speak with Dr. Yadav about our research project of creating a microbial co-culture and receive some advice on if there is anything in the project that may not work as planned and if there is something we are able to do to recuperate that. We were also anticipating certain aspects of our project such as our biosensor to not function as we have had certain trouble understanding how the biosensor would function.
R: Meeting with Dr. Yadav allowed us to reflect on our project as there were aspects that inherently E. coli has that might not work when we try to genetic manipulate them to work for our project. This meeting was very positive and knowledgeable. We walked out feeling inspired and very motivated to continue working troubleshooting.
E: Dr Yadav told us that we are able to us his HPLC (high-performance light chromatography) machine to quantify our product of Kaempferol. Additionally, he gave us advice on patenting and how we would proceed if we were to patent this optimizing production co-culture. Furthermore, Dr. Yadav reminded us that we need to compare rates of our first and second strain as if the two strains don’t grow at the same rate that means there is a lot of heavy hydroxation machinery and there would be a lag with the production for which we need an inhibitor (Gp2) to increase the rate of the resultant. If the rates were equal we wouldn’t need an additional factor. Also, we were told to find the dissociation constant as we want high kb to have enough naringenin production. As well, we would need to test out if naringenin, FdeR and GfP system is robust as well as if Gp2 can effectively inhibit bacterial growth. Over engineering our strain → biosensor team.

I suggested that he do the test and at 43 we discovered that he was suffering celiac disease and lives with it, now he keeps a gluten-free diet and feels much better, the environment does not have any affect.""
Does it accompany other diseases?
""Celiac can accompany other diseases involving the immune system, for example diabetes and thyroid problems.""
Do you think it is necessary for schools to carry out publicity related to the disease (to raise awareness)?
""Yes it is always good; it can help children with the disease and build their confidence.""
In conclusion:
Celiac disease according to the opinion of Dr. Irena can be diagnosed at a very young age and save the child and the family the suffering of biological thinness, swollen belly, weakness, and unexplained abdominal pain. If the family doctor is professional enough and knows the family's medical history, he can make an early detection of the disease. However, if not the disease will be discovered at a later age or will never be discovered. The product we are developing, in her opinion, may resolve celiac patients the dilemma whether to eat a certain product or not. Well done.

Uppsala,2017,Team:Uppsala#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"H2946 as the peaks in figure 5 can be interpreted as energy barriers being crossed. This can also be seen in the movies where crocetin dialdehyde gets stuck in two positions. Thus, the CsADH2946 model demonstrates specificity towards crocetin dialdehyde.
Figure 5: Pulling force applied to crocetin dialdehyde and acetaldehyde from one subunit of our CsADH2946 homology model. For crocetin dialdehyde there are two peaks which indicates energy barriers where more force is required to pull crocetin dialdehyde out. For acetaldehyde there is no clear peak indicating that our model is not able to bind acetaldehyde as strongly as crocetin dialdehyde.
Using the Pulling Simulation to Estimate the Dissociation Constant of Crocetin Dialdehyde
The resulting maximum force applied to crocetin dialdehyde could then be used to roughly calculate the dissociation constant. To do this the following equation was used where 𝜟G is Gibbs free energy, R is the gas constant, T the temperature and Kd the dissociation constant:
\Delta G = -RTln(K_{d})
What we need is 𝜟G to be able to calculate the dissociation constant. To get 𝜟G  the maximum force (284.2160 kJ/(mol*nm)) was first converted into pN. The resulting force was 471.9628 pN. 𝜟G was then calculated by extrapolating data from a study where they plotted the maximum force against their experimental 𝜟G values (12). Calculation of Kd using the equation above yielded a value of 4.9321 µM.
Thus we are able to compare the dissociation constant from our molecular dynamics simulations to the value of KM (~20.7842 µM) we estimated in our Bayesian inference model using our experimental data. Under the equilibrium approximation where substrate and enzyme complex are in an instantaneous equilibrium KM and Kd are equal. From our experiments and simulations we indeed see that the estimated KM and Kd are similar considering the fact that the dissociation constant has been calculated from an energy. This further shows that the molecular dynamics simulation is accurate, validating the result that CsADH2946 is specific to crocetin dialdehyde.
Experimental Estimation of KM for CsADH2946
Since the kinetic parameters for CsADH2946 have never been determined, we wanted to characterize the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the reaction and estimate KM of our CsADH2946 using the"

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," sometimes they build up. When I started BICO, I started with two people, no funding and my idea was to maybe have four or five people. But along the course people got attracted. They linked up with me, started working with me and then we started having bigger projects, including clinical trials and ended up having a staff of over 50. Which was not in the original plan. […] When we started BICO, trachoma was not our main focus. Our main focus was on blindness in children. In general blindness, but eventually infectious diseases. […] This is where BICO has come from and it’s done well for Malawi with [the help] of NGOs. The NGOs are very international. You don’t get many locals who have international reputation. So BICO has worked with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, as our main collaborator on the funded study. We also work with the task force for global health in Atlanta on trachoma studies and several other institutions. […] Overall in BICO we get 30 to 50 international visitors a year coming to see our project, like you do. […] Next week we have people coming from the US task force for global health coming about trachoma. We are doing the mass drug administration next week, so they are coming to observe the exercise. They are also bringing a photographer, to photograph the whole procedure.
Kai:
Can you talk about the impact trachoma has, on the people and the society?
Prof. Kalua:
Trachoma is an neglected tropical disease. It affects the poorest of the poor because of the conditions of poverty, lack of hygiene. So […] it is usually neglected. But for the few individuals who end up being in that bargain. When they get trachoma and it causes blindness, it is a lifelong bargain. It comparison to other diseases, that have at least some [possibility of] intervention, like cataract or age-related macular degeneration. There is a lot of things you can do with a lot of eye diseases. But trachoma, once you become blinded from it... you can’t do a cornea transplant, because the cornea becomes vascularized. So the impact on the [affected] becomes so huge. It is also a huge burden for the country. For every trachoma blind person, there is a child that is put out of school. Because the child has to physically take this person around. We don’t have social structures here. [...] And when the children don’t go to school, they just become poorer and poorer and poorer.

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Conference: Community labs and synthetic biology
In 2012 our team held a public panel discussion about bioethics. Moreover, in the last years we had a lot of debates about the future of synthetic biology and the chances and risks of community labs during our work for Synenergene and the german iGEM meetups. Since a new biohackerspace is forming in Darmstadt, with close connections to our team, we decided to lead a panel discussion about these two topics.  As a first step we had a round table discussion with the iGEM team of RWTH Aachen. Here we talked about the pros, cons and possible trends of community labs (please visit the wiki of RWTH Aachen for further details and results). This formed the fundament for our panel discussion.
 
 
The panel discussion
We had several experts for the discussion, which was divided in two subtopics. The discussion was moderated by members of our team while the audience was encouraged to ask questions and thereby become an important part of the debate. The investigated questions lead to interesting results that gave our team new views on the prior executed researches as well as on possible future projects.

1 The Selection Chip
Previous reports show that exogenous genes will express well in worms at the L4 stage. Thus, we need to select worms at L4 stage to get the more suitable experimental group. The simple method is to distinguish them by sizes, because worms at L4 stage have medium sizes. Thus, we design two plans to screen worms.
The first one is to use microfluidics. With the flow filled with worms going through this chip, only the medium sized worms can remain in the medium chamber, and we could collect them by injecting the flow from the bottom and gather them in the top. (Fig. 3)
Fig. 3 the Selection Chip after injecting worms. A) The whole worms are injected into microfluidics. B) Medium and small sized worms pass through the left chambers. Small sized worms go through the medium chambers, remaining medium sized worms. Get them by injecting the flow from the bottom.
The second plan is to ensure the growth of worms synchronously, which is utilized to get a large number of worms at the same stage. Detailed Protocol We collect embryos (Fig. 4) by bleaching adults, and culture embryos to get a large number of worms at the same stage after three days. Our synchronous rate is calculated as the formula below.
\frac{N_1*100\%}{N_2}
N1 equals the number of worms at L4
N2 equals the number of all worms.
The successful synchronization rate can reach to about 80%.
Fig. 4 The Embryos after Bleaching Adults
Compared with those two methods in experiment, we find that we can get almost 50 out of 100 worms (One adult has no less than 3 embryos) in three days by the synchronization method, while we can just get 20 out of 100 worms in one day by microfluidics method. Given that we need a large number of worms to do the following experiment, we think the synchronization method is better. Detaied Results .
2 The Gaussian Plate
In order to study locomotive behavior of C. elegans populations, we design the Gaussian Plate, a pillar-filled area, where the pillars are designed such that they allow crawling-like behaviors even though worms are immersed in a liquid environment. (Fig. 5) [1]

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," model maps 3D, constrained growth (within a mold). Note that early iterations of the SBR model mapped 2D, unconstrained growth; this was changed to better suit our unique use-case for the model.
Both models incorporate density but define it differently: DTU’s defines density as the concentration of individual hyphae in a given surface area, whereas SBR’s defines density as the proportion of the physical mold that is filled from the base upward.
Both models’ parameters can be fine-tuned in accordance with lab results in order to account for the use of different fungi.
The SBR model is based on the Eden Model for tumor growth; DTU’s is based on a few different approaches, including a branch-extension simulation that provides the bulk of their rationale.
Finally, taken together, the two teams’ models can form a cohesive use-case. DTU’s first model simulates fungal growth kinetics from a single spore, growing into 2 dimensions and forming the initial “plug” used to fill the mold--this is the SBR model. Finally, DTU’s second model gives the properties of the brick necessary to make the final structure. In essence, DTU's model depicts the beginning and the end of the process, and SBR's model depicts the middle.

Physical Testing
Despite our two teams being separated by almost 6000 kilometers we were able to meet up with one advisor from the DTU Team, Kyle Rothschild-Mancinelli (in the gray jacket) who stopped by the Ames Research Center to look at our progress and exchange mycelium so that we could perform testing in our respective labs. Thanks to this visit we were able to test our glue on an independently created mycelium, further validating our results. In turn our advisor also was able to visit the DTU team in Denmark and advise on any questions they had about creating a mission to outer space.
To see the results of our physical testing on DTU’s bricks as well as our own please see our physical testing page, linked here"

Table 2 shows the calculated specific activities and RPU relative to the in vivo reference standard BBa_J23101 for the second set of measurements. This can be represented as the ratio of the specific activity of the SPL promoters to the specific activity of the reference standard BBa_J23101.
Conclusion
We successfully designed a BioBrick compatible SPL and demonstrated its functionality. The resulting constructs contained promoters with a wide range of different promoter strengths. The strengths of the measured promoters ranged from 0 - 1.35 RPU compared to the reference standard BBa_J23101. This range is comparable to that of the existing promoter libraries already present in the parts registry. Thus we have shown that the DTU Synthetic Promoter Library Standard is a great alternative method to quickly and easily construct a promoter library, with a wide range of promoter strengths, compared to using already existing BioBrick promoters.

Chemotaxis Results
Modelling
Introduction
E.coli is a motile strain of bacteria, which is to say it can swim. It is able to do so by rotating its flagellum, which is a rotating tentacle like structure on the outside of cell.    Chemotaxis is the movement up concentration gradient of chemoattractants (i.e. malate in our project) and away from poisons. E.coli is too small to detect any concentration    gradient between the two ends of itself, and so they must randomly head in any direction and then compare the new chemoattractant concentration at new point to the previous    3-4s point. Its motion is described by ‘runs’ and ‘tumbles’, runs refer to a smooth, straight line movement for a number of seconds, while tumble referring to reorientation of     bacteria [1]. Chemoattractant increases transiently raise the probability of ‘tumble’ (or bias), and then a sensory adaptation process returns the bias to baseline, enabling the cell    to detect and respond to further concentration changes.  The response to a small step change in chemoattractant concentration in a spatially uniform environment increase the      response time occurs over a 2- to 4- s time span [2]. Saturating changes in chemoattractant can increase the response time to several minutes.
Many bacterial chemoreceptors belong to a family of transmemberane methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) [3]. Each chemoreceptors on the bacterium has a periplasmic binding domain and a cytoplasmic signaling domain that communicates with the flagellar motors via a phosphorelay sequence involving the CheA, CheY, and CheZ proteins. Modeling of this chemotaxis pathway in single cell is very important, as it will help us to determine, with certain numbers of chemoreceptors, the threshold of ch"

XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"osome Binding Sites work?
The bacterial ribosome binds to particular sequences on an mRNA, primarily the SD sequences and the start codon (ATG). The SD sequences base-pairs with an RNA molecule that forms part of the bacterial ribosome (the 16s rRNA), while the start codon base-pairs with the initiator tRNA which is bound to the ribosome. In addition to SD sequences and the start codon being important, these two sequences need to be positioned approximately 6-7 nucleotides apart so they can both make contact with the appropriate parts of the ribosome complex.1
The Shine-Dalgarno sequences
Figure 1 The RBS sequences logo representing the sequences of 149 RBS from E. coli. The height of each letter represents the frequency of the base at that location. From Tom Schneider, ""A Gallery of sequences Logos"".
The end of the 16s rRNA that is free to bind with the mRNA includes the sequences 5′–ACCUCC–3′. The complementary sequences, 5′–GGAGGU–3′, named the Shine-Dalgarno sequences, can be found in whole or in part in many bacterial mRNA. Very roughly speaking, ribosome binding sites with purine-rich sequences (A's and G's close to the Shine-Dalgarno sequences will lead to high rates of translation initiation whereas sequences that are very different from the Shine-Dalgarno sequences will lead to low or negligible translation rates. You can see how common the sequences is by looking at the RBS sequences logo on the right (where the height of a letter indicates the frequency of the letter at that location).
Algorithms
As we know, the RBS strength is greatly influenced by the SD sequences, where the 16s RNA of the ribosome binds to, so the strength can be determined by the binding free energy between the SD sequences and the 16s RNA. So we designed a program calculating the binding free energy but the results show that the correlation between the free energy and the strength of RBS is rather weak (R2=0.5517). So we decide to find other algorithms for better accuracy.
Inspired by the strength prediction algorithms used in promoter part, in which the similarity to the sigma factors' PWM is interlocking with the binding affinity between the protein and DNA sequences. We obtained the Position Frequency Matrix of SD sequences of E. coli and use the PMW method (illustrated in detail in the promoter part) to calculate the similarity between the RBS sequences and the Position frequency sequences, what is different"

Fig. Effect of agar concentrations in the first network on mechanical properties of agar/PAAm DN gels at the feeding concentrations of AAm (a) 3 mol/L, (b) 5mol/L, (c) 7 mol/L.
Figure shows that at a low AAm concentration of 3 mol/L (a), the tensile stress of DN gels increased from 0.15-0.6MPa. At higher AAm concentrations, DN gels prepared exhibited high mechanical stress of 0.4-0.9MPa at AAm 5mol/L(b) and 0.3-1.2MPa at AAm 7mol/L(C),indicating that the increase of the AAm concentration can enhance the fracture stress of DN gels. Besides, the failure tensile stress was generally improved with the increase of agar concentrations at AAm concentrations of 3 mol/L. However, it presented another pattern at high AAm concentration. Instead of increasing all the time, there was an turning point at the agar concentration of 17mg/mL, where both reached the maxium tensile stress of 0.87MPa (b), 1.25MPa (c).Then, we specifically examined the effects of AAm concentrations on the mechanical properties at the feeding concentration of agar 17mg/L.
Figure. Effect of AAm concentrations on the mechanical properties at the feeding concentration of agar 17mg/L.
Figure shows that the fracture tensile stress improved with the increase of AAm concentration

See <partinfo>BBa_K415138</partinfo> (complete) or <partinfo>BBa_K257001</partinfo> (sans leader sequence).
Our final fusion will need the leader sequence followed by the gene of interest followed by pIII proper.

Summary&Result
Cells of all organisms process numerous signals originating from the internal biological processes or from the environment to produce the appropriate cellular response [1] .Signal integration or pathway in cells are just like logic circuits in electronic or digital system. Previous work that designed gene regulatory circuits have already demonstrated the abilities to perform basic logic functions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. [2] [3] However, these previous fantastic designs all have drawbacks or problems.
  This year, we Fudan iGem team tried to solve some problems of these work or designs. So we design a new kind of genetic logic circuit, which works only in eukaryotic cells, based on tet-on shRNA expression [4] system and Cre-ERTII system [5] with the help of ribozyme. This logic circuit can do all 16 boolean logic gates calculation ideally. We will test all three elements by using fluorescent proteins.
  For application, we considered using this design to make an “iGemage” ,which is a kind of cell conversion machine. By this machine, we can get three types of cells -- iPSc (inducible pluripotent stem cell),iNSc(inducible neural stem cell) and diffentiated neuron by dosing the cells with two kinds of drugs: Dox and Tamoxifen. We believe this machine will be beneficial to both cell therapies and regenerative medcine.

15/08/2011 - Team Amsterdam among favourites
Team Amsterdam has been pointed out as one of the teams to keep your eye on during the competition by Christian Lund, a medicine student from Denmark. He participated in last year's iGEM competition, and is now following the different teams.
Lund wrote a previous blog about the teams of Cambridge and Bielefeld , but in his latest blog he wrote solely about the Amsterdam team. He called the project very ambitious and impressive. “The project has the wow-factor; imagine E. coli growing at freezing temperatures, that’s impressive!” Although the project has already partly been done, the team has a new and exciting approach. Using the results of previous teams and elaborate those results is following the iGEM spirit. “Some guys have created bacteria that can grow at low temperatures; let’s drop the temperature another couple to degrees to freezing!” Read the full article here .
The expectations for the Amsterdam team are high and the competition is enormous, but the team is confident about the project and is looking forward to the jamboree.

UCL,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Spinning Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," spider's glands are forced through small-diameter spinnerets, and expelled as solid threads.
A simple syringe extruder setup. It consists of a gas chromatography syringe (Hamilton Co.) in a syringe pump (Pump Systems, Inc.)
Centrifuge Extrusion
Another method that we are investigating is centrifuge extrusion, in which a column with a small-diameter channel is loaded with silk dope, and placed into a centrifuge tube containing the coagulation solution. The loaded column and tube are then centrifuged at high speeds, and the resulting centrifugal force extrudes the dope through the channel into the coagulation bath, causing a fiber to form. The extrusion column was designed this past summer by the UCLA iGEM team for rapid, small scale production of experimental fibers.
An ""extrusion column."" 3D printed with a Stratasys PolyJet printer.
Our extrusion column fits into a 15 mL centrifuge tube, which can be kept empty or hold a coagulation bath.
Rotary Jet Spinning
The rotary jet spinner, designed and diagrammed by the Parker lab at MIT [4] .
A final method for fiber production that we worked with is rotary jet spinning. Rotary jet spinning is very similar to centrifuge extrusion, in that the dope is spun at very high speeds and centrifugal force pushes the dope out of the channel. However, in rotary jet spinning, the dope is loaded into a reservoir that is mounted vertically onto a motor shaft. This method does not allow for the usage of a coagulation bath, as the reservoir holding the dope must be spun in air [4] . If the reservoir were to be spun in a liquid bath, the resultant turbulence in the bath would cause structural instability and destroy the apparatus.
Post-Spin Stretch
A very important part of creating fibers from expressed recombinant silk is the stretching of the fiber after it has been extruded. This can be observed in actual spiders, who tug on the silk threads they produce in order to stretch them. This stretching not only results in longer lengths of threads to work with, it confers extra strength and elasticity to the fibers [5] .
What We've Done
Over the summer, we carried out steps 1 through 4 of the silk processing procedure according to published protocols (see above).  Additionally we made silk pH gels by treating the dialyzed silk with acid. Overnight incubation caused this mixture to solidify into a gel.   We have put together our syringe pump extrusion setup based on published protocols.  As an alternative,"

Background
Background
In the past several decades, in the biological engineering industry, we use the engineering microbe to produce what we expect. To meet our diverse needs, the microbe should be transformed with various exogenous genes, and the most popular vector for this job is the plasmid. There are many advantages of the plasmid vector, such as the convenience and its high transforming efficiency, but there are still many problems in the process of using the plasmid vector, one of which is the plasmid-loss,  the most common and serious problem. Imagine that we transform a vital gene into the microbe in our biological lab, only to find that the plasmid with the gene get lost after generations. Things like that always upset and trouble the scientists, not to mention the industrial factories. [State the problem]
To figure out the possible reasons of the loss and find out a feasible solution, the mechanism should be understood. According to the research, the plasmid stability can be divided into plasmid structural stability and the plasmid segregational stability [1]. The former is because of the genetic mutation in the plasmid and the latter is because of random distribution of the plasmid during the cell division. Once the plasmid is unstable, there will goes the problem called plasmid-loss. Actually, in the industrial fermentation processes, the problem of plasmid segregational stability is more common, so our project focuses on the segregational instability phenomenon. After an unequal distribution, the cells divide into two groups, one with high plasmid concentration and the other with low concentration. Since the high plasmid concentration in microbe leads to low growth effect and high production rate while low concentration will lead to high growth effect and low production rate, the low concentration ones consume more but produce less. We label these black sheep as ‘slackers’. [How the problem goes]
For many years, researchers come up with various ideas to prevent the birth of these ‘slackers’. The most widely used way is antibiotics control, which will kill the ‘slacker’ whose plasmid doesn’t integrate the antibiotics resistance gene. Thus, adding antibiotics will kill the ones without enough plasmids. But this way complicates the industry procedure and results in high cost. There is"

[3] In order to make the distribution of light intensity more even, we built a model to simulate bottom light distribution.
Assumptions: The luminous flux of LED is the same at all angles above the surface. Only specular reflection occurs on the side face and no reflection on other surfaces. Only reflections for the first time is considered.
You could see it in detail in our modeling part.
The experiment proved that a cylinder was better to solve the intensity problem, as our modeling suggests.
3. Hardware 1.7 for fluid medium
To make the distribution of light intensity more even, we soldered some patch LEDs on a circuit broad. The patch LED was small in size, around a few millimeters. We adjusted the position of the LEDs so that each well of a 96-well plate could be illuminated by one LED evenly.
The next picture is semi-finished product. We connected these LEDs in series and used some resistances to balance the current.
Figure 13. Circuit board in process of being soldered.
We soldered additional LEDs to fit the 96-well plate. Here are three primary colors of light.
Figure 14. The successful result of the three primary colors.
4. Hardware 2.0 for solid medium
To get mixed light, we put three LED beads in one carton. We used the three primary colors of light and they produced much more beautiful light! When the red and green beads were turned on, they turned to bright yellow. Red and blue turned to purple. Green and blue turned to cyan-blue, a pretty color.
Figure 15. Bright yellow mixed by red and green.
Figure 16. Purple mixed by red and blue.
Figure 17. Cyan-blue mixed by blue and green.
5. Hardware 3.0 for solid medium
It was time for our beautiful rose. Obviously LED beads could not satisfy our demands, so we purchased a projector. By simply using a reflection mirror[3], we cast an image of a rose on a piece of filter paper.

Project idea
The idea for the conversion of blood types from A, B, or AB to O was drafted by the team members themselves, although research on this subject had been done before, the idea for the topic of our project emerged independently.
System design
The project idea - the conversion of blood types from A, B, or AB to O - and the overall system design were developed by the team members themselves without outside help. However, the feasibility of the project draft was then discussed with our instructors, Professor Dr Ralf-Peter Jansen and Dr Elisabeth Fuss.
Biosafety concerns for potential experiments with human blood were also discussed with Professor Dr Jansen since the experiments would have taken place in his laboratory. Permission for working with tested blood conserves was granted by Dr Michael Kittel from the office of biological safety at the university of Tübingen.
All part and primer design was performed by student team members. Plasmids were obtained from Dr Fuss.
Lab supplies
We have ordered most consumables and reagents ourselves without the help or advice of instructors or other scientists. Some reagents like Bacto-Yeast Extract were obtained from Professor Dr Jansen's stock. Consumables were also obtained from the stocks of Professor Dr Doron Rapaport and Professor Dr. Thilo Stehle .
Lab and lab hardware
Most experiments were carried out at the team's laboratory at the IFIB (Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry) in Tübingen. The team's laboratory was kindly provided by Professor Ralf-Peter Jansen. For practical reasons one team member carried out plasmid preparations at Dr Peter Pimpl 's lab at University"

   When α is the fold-change of activated transcription, n1a and n1r means the hill coefficient of the activator and repressor, respectively.
3.Metabolic network
   There are also cases where metabolic networks like enzymatic reactions and degradation process are involved. And metabolic reactions are also suitable for the transition from monomeric molecules to polymers like the mature of repressor protein. In these cases, we apply refined Michaelis-Menten equations to describe them.

Stochastic and Time delay models
1.Stochastic models
   Stochasticity in synthetic networks arises from fluctuationsin transcription and translation.First, the binding among different parts are the result of random encounters betweenmolecules, some of which are present in small numbers[15]; What’s more, the time evolution of a biological reacting system is not a continuous process because molecular population levels can only change by discrete integer amounts. As a result, stochastic models are introduced to describe the dynamics of single molecules.
   The most famous and common model is Gillespie Algorithm[16], but the obvious disadvantages of this algorithm is that a lot of calculations has to be performed. Due to the efficiency of our software, we adopt a Poisson tau-leaping algorithm[17]as following:
   1.Choose a time step,τ, we recommend0.1s as a time step.
   2.Multiply each term of each differential equation( the right-hand values) by τ.
   3. Apply Poisson distribution function to each result from step 2 and generate a random number using the Poisson distribution.
   4. Calculate the new number of molecules by adding or subtracting each random number from step 3, from the initial number of molecules.
   5. Repeat steps 1-4 for a specified number of reactions, N.
   To make it more stable for calculation, we divided the right side of our deterministic equations into synthetic parts and degradation parts, for example,
   CN∙TS is the synthetic part,DeRNA∙ [mRNA] is the degradation part. For each part, we generate Poisson random numbers and the other procedures remain the same. We find it more aligned with the real biological situations.
   2. time delay models
   Knowledge of molecular noise filtering and biochemical process delay compensation in synthetic circuits is crucial to understand the design of noise-tolerantand delay-robust gene circuits for synthetic biology[18].A linear stochastic time"

Ethics Workshop
Today, we attended the ethics workshop with the other 2 Albertan teams. We discussed the E3LS of our respective projects, and learned a bit regarding things that we should explore more into, such as biosafety hazards and patenting/the issues with open source biology. As well, we examined past successful ethics explorations of other iGEM teams and discussed what made them successful, and what we felt was lacking/could be improved upon.

Molecules!
Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
My first ever biobrick simulator molecules created today! A single device, comprising a constitutive promoter, RBS, GFP coding sequence, a Terminator, and an RNAP. Later I would switch from coding sequences to 'translational units', as they are becoming the new standard in the registry, and the biobrick simulator has yet to incorporate mRNA.
RNAP's DNA binding function, and protein production, would not be implemented for a while yet.
I had believed I would be able to manage most of the interactions in world by the 'collision' event. It fires when two objects collide, and provides information about them. Unfortunately, it doesn't provide the right information for an object made up of multiple linked objects/prims (aka primitives), so I would end up building a workaround.
I had at this point realized the need to minimize the freefloating objects tendency to escape. The method I used was to continuously set the object's speed and rotation to zero, on a short timer inside the object, but this would turn out to be very glitchy, and would be improved as well.
Spent some time grappling with just what functionality a 'promoter' has, and determined that the"

This room is key-closed and the wearing of a lab coat, gloves and glasses is mandatory. Everything in direct contact with something in this room has to stay there. Wastes are treated specifically. A specific trash can is dedicated to gloves or paper and another is dedicated to the agarose gels that were contaminated.
- Chemical hood: We used the chemical hood when we had to manipulate dangerous and volatile chemicals (for example: the usage of alcohol 96°)
Safety for our project
We have described above the relevant security measures taken all through summer to minimize the risk of incidents in the lab. However, when working in the field of synthetic biology, one of the main concerns is the dissemination of our engineered strain, which could be a threat to the public and the environment.
We have used E. coli and B. subtilis chassis, since their genomes are very well characterized and, of course, since these bacteria are non-pathogenic. E. coli was used for genetic manipulations, moreover the genes that were inserted (BioBricks) into this bacterium, did not increase its pathogenicity. B. subtilis was the final therapeutic agent because of its natural presence in the cave’s microbiote. Therefore, the main threat is the dissemination of our bacteria in the external environment where gene transfer could occur between microorganisms.
This is the reason why, to prevent any risk of dissemination, all our waste was autoclaved before being appropriately disposed. Moreover, the French regulation does not allow any genetically modified microorganisms to be taken outside the lab. We are therefore aware that it won’t be possible to test our genetically modified bacteria in real conditions. In fact, it is unthinkable to release our bacteria in the environment without being confident enough that there won’t be any disturbances of the ecosystems of the Lascaux caves and the surrounding environment.
That’s why, to minimize both the risk of dissemination and of gene transfer, several solutions were planned. First of all, we have designed a physical device that would confine our engineered bacteria to the area to be treated (see the device part).
Apart from this physical containment, we also planned of adding two toxin/anti-toxin systems that would considerably decrease the probability of gene transfer (see project section).  We also thought of including a biological clock that would limit the lifespan of our therapeutic bacterium. Moreover, we planned to use a spo- B. subtilis strain to prevent the bacterium to form spores that would allow"

Hi, I'm Zhen Wang, I mainly work on MoDeL and Database of iGAME. As a member of Lixin He's research group, I focus mainly on calculation of quantum information, quantum correlation and entanglement.
You might have noticed that my address is same as Liao's. Yes, we are from the same Research Group, and the same department, too. It will be boring if I repeat all the information again, so I am going to write some experience of myself participating iGEM2010.
As a student majoring physics, it is hard for me to believe that I can participate in a biology project. Luckily, to my great surprise, these two areas are not so far apart. Modeling and analyzing skills of physics can also be used in biology, and dry project always means a lot of coding task, I can handle that, too. Of course, there is plenty of biology I need to learn, but with the help of our instructor and wet team members, I learn it fast. So I want to tell everyone that there's no limit in iGEM, join in and unleash your power!

Safety
The Safety Level of our lab is Level 1 (low risk), our work areas to handle biological materials include open bench and biosafety cabinet. All of our team members have received biosafety training from CMUQ’s biosafety office prior to entering the lab. The training topics included, Lab access and rules, responsible individuals, difference between biosafety levels, biosafety equipment, good microbial technique and chemicals, fire and electrical safety.
Dr. Ravichandra Bachu (rbachu@qatar.cmu.edu) is in charge of the Safety of the labs in CMUQ. The laboratory biosafety guidelines followed by us are the same as Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh. The link to these guidelines is here . Fortunately, we didn’t encounter any uncertainties concerning institutional, regional, national or international rules and regulations.
Regarding our project, the team intends to clone a bacterium which will respond differently to different salt concentrations in its surrounding. As a result of this, we will use the determined salt concentrations to estimate the Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) populations in the sea water at any given time. Based on this estimate, it will be easier to decide the amount of biocide that should be added to kill the SRB in order to prevent Microbial Induced Corrosion (MIC).
Our project could be applied in the natural environment, as the engineered cells are a strain of E. Coli, which are abundantly found in the environment . Therefore, they do not have any health hazards for the Marine life. Our project does not include the use of gene drives nor animals. Antimicrobial resistance factors are used as they are commonly used in research and all parts used are included in the whitelist.
During the project, only bacteria will be used, DH5a strain of E.coli will be transformed with a proU osmolarity promoter that will detect high salt in the extracellular environment. To avoid any uncertainties or gaps in our project safety, we have worked with one of our PI, who is a Microbiologist and also received guidance from the laboratory technicians."

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," oscillations externally. After reading about the effectiveness of  blue light mediated promoters/repressors studied by Jayaraman et al., we decided to utilize this system. The biggest advantage of this method was only needing one signal to control both gRNA’s. As an added benefit, these researchers had already estimated kinetic parameters, which we could easily incorporate into our base editing model (see our design page for more details).
Figure 14: Blue light promoter and repressor equations, along with associated kinetic constants
Figure 15: Brief overview of the EL222 reactions with and without blue light
Bionetgen simulations of the blue light activated transcription matched results from the original paper and are demonstrated below.
Figure 16: Blue light simulations in Bionetgen, compared to simulations by Jayaraman et. al
To incorporate the blue light promoter/repressor into the base editing model, we simply used the concentrations of the two mRNA species as gRNA inputs for our cas9.
Figure 17: Bionetgen simulation of the base editing circuit using alternating gRNA's
While lower frequency oscillations result in less signal attenuation, the trade off is temporal resolution. With standard base editing rates, an acceptable period was found to be ~14 days (see our results page for more work on increasing base editing rates). At this timescale, the effect of regulating the base editing with a second gRNA produced a much cleaner signal in simulation, indicating the Alternating gRNA system would be a much better design choice.
Questions about Playback
How can we interpret our experimental readouts to quantify target (and off-target) base editing?
Sanger sequencing was utilized to characterize the mutation rates of each DNA frame during testing. Because our cas9 relies on only a few base pair mismatches to distinguish between frames, it was essential that we compared our on and off-target mutation frequencies. In response, we developed a python module to automatically find these sites based on binding affinities and compare the experimental data.   See the CrisPy page for a detailed explanation.
Figure 18: CrisPy workflow
Conclusion
The goal of this model was to characterize and improve the function of our CUTSCENE recording system. By developing an accurate base editing model, we were able to find ways to enhance the definition of our recording signal. During the implementation phase, we developed a method for testing our system for off-target effects. It is our hope that future teams will not only utilize our optimized recording system, but are inspired to utilize our methods for generating models and test procedures. We believe that both CrisPy and our suite of recursive bayesian"

We are a small group of undergraduate students studying life science with professors as mentors at Stockholm University. This is our website about our work and effort in representing our school as Team Stockholm in the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition against other teams from all over the world.
iGEM is an international research competition focused on synthetic biology. Each team is given a kit containing biological parts for practical work, which takes place at each teams' university. The use of these biological parts in combination with self-designed parts, will lay the ground for building innovative and useful new biological systems and operate them in living cells.
This competition opens for students to think “out of the box” when engineering living organisms to be applied as tools for solving problems in healthcare, bioenergy, chemical and material production and bioremediation, to name a few.
The principles in the field of synthetic biology is to combine science and engineering in order to genetically design and build living cells with novel biological roles and systems, aimed at overcoming the obstacles in modern life.
Stay tuned for daily updates in the run up to the finals at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)!

TFrom the digestion it seems that the assembly of the linkers had succeeded. To confirm it we decided to run a PCR with the iGEM verification primers: BBa_G00100 and BBa_G00101. The expected bands for the ten small linkers are supposed to be 338 bp and for the one large linker it is 386 bp which corresponds well to the gel pictures displayed in figure 22 and 23.

Both of the verification methods showed that all 11 linkers submitted are present in the backbone (pSB1C3).
We also decided to send the linkers for sequencing the results of the sequencing is available here .
In conclusion the assembly of all linkers succeeded.
Assembly of composite part
An unregistered composite part was ordered as an IDT gBlock. The gBlock was assembled by digestion, ligation and transformation. It was done in several attempts with different protocols. The parameters that were changed during the troubleshooting was the ligation ratio, incubation temperature and time. Unfortunately despite these alterations the assembly was unsuccessful.
The composite part BBa_K2355302 was ordered as an IDT gBlock but delivered very late in the process. It was assembled by digestion, ligation and transformation.

Preliminary tasks done, let’s head to the lab! We carried out a transformation, growing the vector in a DH5-α strain of E. coli with ampicillin as the antibiotic marker. Well, we attempted to carry out a transformation. It failed, much to the glee of the Metal Mickies. Fortunately, we were able to use some pET-15b grown in E. coli for a different purpose. The colonies were allowed to grow, and we then carried out a mini-prep to isolate the vectors. Visualization was done by running the DNA on an agarose gel and using UV light. Once we were sure the transformation was successful, it was time to add the restriction enzymes!
Also, a PCR was run with the genomic DNA of Leishmania major, the trypanosomatids that are providing us with the 4th gene of our synthesis pathway. We ran 5 samples total: 3 using high-fidelity PCR at different temperatures, and 2 of Clontech’s PCR kits at 2 temperatures. We added the primers for Δ6 elongase (GenBank LmjF32.1160). This gene is around 1.200 kb large. The results show that the Clontech kit run at 48° C gave the strongest result.
Week 3
""Metal Binding Protein"" Weekly Summary
Having tried to digest our pGEX without diluting the buffer, and then running the DNA gel using dye instead of ladder, we made a second attempt at digesting our vector. Thankfully, this one went smoothly, and the pGEX was cleaned up using our epoch kit.  As our insert is so small, we were able to simply order complementary primers with the sequence we wanted in them and then anneal these to make a primer dimer. We ordered primers that contained peptide sequences to bind nickel, platinum and palladium. We then progressed to ligating our primer dimer into the clean cut pGEX vector. These ligations were transformed into DH5 cells and left overnight. The nickel transformation was successful and a PCR was done on the product to see if it did contain our nickel insert. This, however, was a disaster. But more on that later.  The platinum and palladium attempts yielded no colonies. More pGEX vector was grown up for miniprepping and digestion, and the nickel primer dimer was"

1.2 Chronicle of the philosophical evenings
First meeting - Introduction
After a short introduction in the definition, aims and different approaches of the synthetic biology ([1],[2],[3],[4]), we clarified some special philosophical terms in order to have a common basis for further discussion. During the first meeting we soon realised, that the synthetic biology grounds on a different epistemology as that from ‘pure sciences’.

Second meeting - Epistemology
On our second meeting we tried to work out what the special epistemological characteristics of an applied science are [5]. We expounded the general epistemological problems and possibilities of an engineering discipline. We noticed that causal knowledge and natural laws are not the main aim of an engineering discipline, but efficient maxims and sufficient rules. In order to judge a technological system we only refer to their efficiency. We just see if something works or not. In the epistemology of technological sciences the concept of efficiency plays a similar role to that of which the concept of truth plays in the epistemology pure sciences, since scientific theories are judged by their truth value. Therefore, if the synthetic biology aspires to define itself as an"

Creating ‘The E.ncapsulator’: in situ manufacture and oral delivery of human biopharmaceuticals | A major, yet unsolved, challenge in the pharmaceutical industry involves overcoming the harsh acidic environment of the stomach in order to deliver proteins to the gut. This year the Imperial College iGEM team has decided to tackle this problem by developing an innovative, self-contained drug fabrication and delivery system. In our 'E.ncapsulator', Escherichia coli will be engineered not only to efficiently manufacure important biopharmaceuticals, but also to coat and protect protein based drugs until release in the small intestine.
Furthermore, in order to create E.ncapsulator tablets for oral delivery, there has been much focus on designing and engineering a number of modules for implementation in E.coli. The modularity that is central to our project will be evident in the areas of protein drug production, self-encapsulation and genomic neutralisation. Utilising the E.coli bacterium, we are creating a re-usable chassis that will allow the development of a range of biopharmaceuticals to be delivered to the gut. Our E.ncapsulator is therefore intended as an elegant solution to, not one, but a range of human ailments and conditions, which cannot currently be successfully treated by oral drugs.
The first module involves engineering E.coli to synthesise the protein drug of interest to a tuneable threshold. Once accomplished, activation of module two initiates the encapsulation phase, in which E.coli coats itself in a protective layer of colanic acid to form the E.ncapsulator. This protective capsule is what shields the biopharmaceutical against the harsh acidic environment of the stomach. The third module, genomic neutralisation, is composed of a ‘suicide trigger’ mechanism that destroys the genetic material of the bacteria. Finally, once in the small intestine, the capsule will be degraded, thereby releasing the designed biopharmaceutical to the gut micro biota where it can carry out its intended function.
The self-encapsulation of a synthetic biology chassis is new to iGEM and represents a completely novel and innovative approach to biopharmaceutical design, manufacture and delivery. Throughout the project we have followed an engineering approach that incorporates modular design"

The size of this band, its occurrence in conjunction with EutM and the absence of a band in conjunction with the anti-FLAG antibody has led us to hypothesize that this band corresponds to a dimer of GFP-EutM.
Following our findings from the Western blot, we focused our induction trials on GFP fluorescence. This allowed us to determine if the expression of EutM had been successful. There was a significant increase in fluorescence at both the 4 and 20-hour time point (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.0054 respectively), produced by cells containing the EutMN construct under inducing conditions. Similarly, there was a significant increase in fluorescence produced by cells containing the EutSMN construct at both the 4 and 20-hour time points (p = 0.002 and p = 0.0007 respectively). This confirmed that the TetR promoter was working as expected, controlling the induction of the EutMN construct (see figures 4 and 5).

Throughout the GFP induction trial we also recorded optical density measurements at 600nm for each of our constructs. OD readings were taken at 0 hours, 4 hours and at 20 hours (see figure 6). We observed that between 4 and 20 hours, the OD of cultures containing the constructs EutMN, EutSMN and EutLK were reduced by 75%, 81% and 67% respectively. In contrast to this, the OD of the EutS culture continued to rise and had increased by 45% when the final reading was taken at 20 hours. This suggests that the production of microcompartment subunits EutM, EutN, EutL and EutK are toxic to the cell, however, the production of EutS may be less toxic. This may be due to less"

Readings were made at OD 600 nm
Blank: LB medium
Both green and red fluorescence were measured as well as optical density at 600nm. The control used for the OD600 measurement was the blank LB medium without cells, and for the measurement assay the blank was TOP10 cells in PBS buffer. The measurements were taken every four hours for 16 hours. The time required for each measurement was about an hour and a half.
In order to determine whether to include or exclude each sample from the data set, the mean and standard deviation of the triplicates were calculated and with them the coefficient of variation was obtained. When this value was higher than 15, the atypical value was eliminated.
The main practical limit on the number and rate of measurements with this instruments and protocol is that the time required was too long; plus, there wasn’t enough available material to do many repetitions of each sample. No extra material was acquired for the Interlab Study; the only difficulty was to obtain permission to use the microplate reader.
Section III: Measured Quantities
The units of the fluorescence measurement are relative units of fluorescence. The lowest value in fluorescence is 0 and the highest are superior to 900 relative units with this configuration and instrument.

Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Toggle Switch_-_-_TEXT.html," from Bothfeld et al.(Bothfeld et al., 2017)
Bothfeld et al. designed a tandem toggle switch that can be switched (ON) with only altering glucose levels. While this device is still using nutrients (glucose) to induce protein production (Figure 1), the advantage is that with the toggle switch, protein production will continue even if glucose is added back into the system. In their study, gfp was switched out with phaECAB to produce PHB to test the ability of the toggle switch when expressing large genes(~3.5 kb). PHB production was measured using different carbon sources in the media to test if the carbon supplements could maintain high culture density even after glucose had been depleted. They found that media with containing glucose and supplemented with 0.05% and 0.1% glycerol had improved growth rates relative to cells with constitutive expression of the pha operon and similar growth rate to chemically induced expression. The use of glycerol as a carbon source allowed for the toggle switch to maintain growth while not limiting CRP because the switch solely relies on the concentration of glucose. However, the titer of PHB was lower than the standard chemically induced cultures. Yet, their results indicate that a toggle switch can separate growth and production phases.The advantage of the CRP system is that it allows for quick induction because of E. coli’s natural affinity towards glucose over other nutrients like phosphate, nitrogen, or secondary carbon sources(Huergo and Dixon, 2015).
Our iGEM team knew that growth coupled production can limit yield and growth(Soini et al., 2008). By placing this toggle switch before a gene, that gene’s expression could be controlled through concentration of glucose in the medium. This would eliminate the need for expensive inducer chemicals and therefore improve the economics of production as well allowing future iGEM teams to only use one common additive in media. William Bothfeld was contacted about using the toggle switch design in our iGEM project. Bothfeld agreed to send the plasmid maps, and the plasmids pKDL071, pKDL071-TaraF, and pKDL071-TaraF-phaECAB described in the paper.
This project aimed to produce a genetically engineered bacterium that could produce precursors for a biodegradable plastic whose production could be optimized and controlled using a genetic element. Specifically, a toggle switch that would use only glucose as the inducer would be used as a control element.  This toggle switch leads to the optimization of expression of a useful enzyme by inducing"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Design Lab, urban agriculture in cities not only address questions of food security, but also encourages social development, public health, and environmental education [1]. Urban agriculture is an underutilized public resource, and therefore promoting community focus farming may sow the seeds for community self sufficiency while also engaging the youth in these living areas.
Key Takeaways
Urban agriculture and science education truly go hand in hand.
OxyPonics is an avenue for experimental farming, and when woven into community gardening, has the potential to become a pedagogical tool in the context of gardening to teach students about synthetic biology and its many possibilities.
JUNE 10, 2017
Rasheed Hislop
To run with this potential avenue of innovation, we talked to Rasheed Hislop of GreenThumb NYC, a gardening program sponsored by New York City Department of Parks & Recreation.   We learned about citywide initiatives such as New York City’s “Grow to Learn” program in the schools, which uses the garden and the greenhouse as the classroom. Mr. Hislop told us this education program encompassed a variety of hands on skills, such as urban agriculture, rainwater harvesting, composting, pest control pests without using chemicals and pesticides, and mulching. The program puts a large emphasis on reducing and reusing with its partnership with the Climate Justice Organization. It gives students the opportunity to take up extensive service projects in improving the gardens while also providing teachers and parents workshops and trainings in the field of environmental education.
Mr. Hislop also mentioned that gardens with hydroponics are increasingly popular, and that they provide educators who lack green spaces and land to grow produce conventionally with a portable hydroponic gardening classroom. This take on bigger picture of environmental education gave us much to think about with respect to hydroponics and our project.

Dr. Marianne Krasny
Professor Marianne Krasny, a research extension associate who teaches teachers with the Cornell Cooperative Extension, which aims to translate research done in academic institution to the people, told us that the farms provide a unique and visceral learning environment that can't be replicated in the classroom. Unlike lectures, these situations have a “learn as you go” atmosphere. Community and school gardens in the cities therefore offer an “incredibly rich learning experience,” especially to underserved and low income urban areas. Professor Krasny gave us a unique take on this “formal, but informal” education that also has the potential to combine culture, science, and community engagement. Community farms allow students to connect with the culture capital of a"
INSA-UPS_France,2017,Team:INSA-UPS France#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," Purpose of the project
Our team wants to make a new system to detect the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae in water and purify the contaminated water to make it drinkable. This device will consist of two elements:
A sensor to detect the presence of V. cholerae in water consisting in an engineered Vibrio harveyi strain;
An effector to secrete antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) consisting in an engineered Pichia pastoris strain. In Nature, these AMPs are successfully used by the crocodile immune system against bacteria. The peptides selected for our system have a broad spectrum of action and are particularly effective against V. cholerae.
The device will be designed for local populations. Thus, the goal is to set up a system as user-friendly as possible  for the purification of water contaminated with V. cholerae.
III. Organization of the project
This project is run by a group of nine students from three universities: Paul Sabatier University (Toulouse), INSA Lyon and INSA Toulouse. It is supervised by Stéphanie Heux and Brice Enjalbert, researchers at LISBP (Toulouse), assisted by eleven other researchers. The team was formed in January 2017 and will work on this project until November 2017, date of the final restitution at the MIT, Boston.
Chapter 2 - Project requirements
I. Functional specifications
1. Detection of Vibrio cholerae
A. Description
Our system must detect the presence of Vibrio cholerae in water so that the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are produced and released only if it contains Vibrio cholerae. In fact, the production of AMPs has to be controlled for two reasons. On the one hand, if water is drinkable, there is no need for AMPs production. On the other hand, other microorganisms (either from the user’s microbiota or the nearby environment) won’t develop peptide resistance.
B. Constraints
To develop the disease, the minimal quantity of V. cholerae cells a human being must ingest  is about 104 cells, in one dose of water1, 2. The constraints are the following:
to detect this concentration of cells;
to activate AMPs production for water purification only starting from this concentration.
C. Priority
Detection is not the top priority of our system. Purification could work continuously but the implementation of this function is better for safety reason. Moreover, according to the testimonies, the detection function of our system is a novel and important point in the treatment of water contaminated with"

Future works
1. Expand the scale of our database.
Projects in iGEM and literature field are grow at a remarkable speed, thus it's a responsible for us to update the data in our database regularly so that our users can catch the latest ideas and utilize into reproduction and testing. In next year, every team and publisher will be invited to redraw their genetic circuit on our design platform for seamless reutilization in future works, which is the most fastest and accurate way we can imagine for expanding the database. For display aspect, a wiki plug-in tool of S-Din will be developed so that all the teams next year can using the same editable tools in their wiki so that no more PS will be needed and also benefit us for gathering data from the first hand.
