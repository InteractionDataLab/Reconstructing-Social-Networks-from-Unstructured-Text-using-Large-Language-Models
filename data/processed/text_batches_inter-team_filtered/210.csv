Today we made the sequencing reaction of our bio bricks (BB_Essential, BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + E0840 and BB_Essential + K346004, BB_Essencial + BB_Bioremediation).
We also continued the total DNA extraction from wild bacteria that present resistance to high Hg concentrations using the phenol-chlorophorm method, started on September 6th. And we finally could finish it!! \o/ Will we be able to check on the electrophoretic profile a plasmid presence?!?! Let’s check!

7: Total DNA of sample P3 collected from stream 40
8: Total DNA of sample S1* collected from stream 40
*Resistant to 100ug/ml Hg.
We could see that some bacteria present plasmids! Super cool! Next step is to amplify the 16S rRNA and sequence them to identify!
We also continued the new constructions. Today we made plasmid DNA extraction from DH5α with bio bricks K611025 (promoter 1), J23100 (promoter 3) and K516030 (mRFP generator).

Introduction
Rubber demand, a new approach, and what we accomplished
Team logo.
Rising global demand for quality rubber calls for innovative ways of satisfying needs without compromising the environment. Natural rubber is produced by draining the rubber tree, and the establishment of new rubber plantations causes deforestation of the rainforest and occupation of arable lands.
We thought of an environmentally friendly approach. Imagine a world where natural rubber is produced by gene manipulated bacteria; perhaps inside fermentors that can be placed underground or in barren environments unsuitable for agriculture.
We introduced natural rubber-producing abilities from the rubber tree into the widely used production bacteria, Escherichia coli. Moreover, we tested whether the manipulated bacteria were in fact capable of producing the natural rubber.
The result? We found strong evidence for proof of concept: rubber producing bacteria. We look forward to presenting this - both throughout this wiki and at the jamborees.
The chassis of our production system will be the bacteria E. coli. The team carrying out the project consists of 9 undergraduate students in the fields of: medicine, biochemistry and molecular biology, biomedicine, and applied mathematics. Furthermore, our team was guided and supported by 3"

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2015,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Human Practice#Intake_-_-_TEXT.html," Tianjin and Hubei districts are its surrounding area, suffering from water stress for long time. Beijing, Tianjin and Hubei district is a perfect example supporting the low regeneration capacity of groundwater when misuse it.
The area of groundwater depression cone reaches 400 square kilometers, the underground water level will drop about 1 meters every year, and groundwater storage will unwater 280 thousand tons everyday(Tan,H,2013).
Over all, the seawater might have more advantages than brackish water due to its stability and its large water preservation capacity.

As a rather new industry, desalination truly has several environment concerns remain unsolved. In this intake section, both seawater and brackish water has problems when it comes to expanded production.
Seawater extraction design has to avoid mariculture areas or extracting small wild creatures including shrimp and shells. The damage those creatures cause is called impingement and/or entrainment. This is rather easy to achieve.
However, brackish water has a bigger disadvantage. In large demand, brackish water extraction might cause ground settlement and relating problems. As Figure 6.2.4, land subsidence resulting from removal of groundwater has affected areas in 45 states in US and ranges from regional lowering to ground failure and collapse (Galloway et al., 1999; NRC, 1991).
California drought
2015 is California’s fourth year of drought (Smith, 2015). The study done by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory shows the ground is sinking nearly two inches each month in some places.
Land in Central California’s agricultural region is sinking so quickly because of the state’s historic drought that it is forcing farmers to spend millions of dollars upgrading irrigation canals and putting roads, bridges and other infrastructure at risk. This state owns the second biggest desalination capacity among US. (GWI, 2006b) As"

In our system, we used roGFP2-Orp1, which can reflect the ROS level in cell immediately through                         the rate of the concentration of two kinds of protein states, as our signal output. But                         according to this measurement principle, the concentration of whole roGFP2-Orp1 can effect the                         final signal output strength, even detect the same sample. So, we built a series of gene                         circuits with different transcription level promoters to express roGFP2-Orp1 and hoped to solve                         this interfere. Four common promoters were chosen, FBA1, TEF2, TEF1, ENO2. We tested four gene                         circuits and found different promoters could work as expected. Considering the application of                         our system in the future, we made this collection of these four parts and wished these parts                         can be used in different antioxidant detection.

TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Notebook#Conrad_-_-_TEXT.html," cells on substrate. Therefore, we will give Escherichia coli a simple, effective and controllable mechanism for binding on surfaces, namely binding by mussel glue. E. coli, expressing mfp-5 on the outer cell surface, can than robustly attach to a wide variety of surfaces including glass, plastic and to itself.
Combination...Our Goal
The word combination is essential in our project. First of all, the basis for our project is combining the beneficial adhesive property from the mussel with our working horse E. coli. To get a most realistic result as possible, we combine our results from the lab together with our mathematical model. This combination allows us to predict the attachment speed and stability as well as cell clustering and settling. The controllable, strong attachment opens up new possibilities for the use of bacterial machines in environmental applications, medicine and industry, since it is easily combined with other properties/features.
To reach our goal, we have four main projects on the lab. The first step is to integrate the mussel foot protein 5 into the outer-membrane of E. coli and to characterize and visualize the mfp5. Therefore we will use the already characterized Biobrick of the Berkeley Wetlab 2009 iGEM team construct BBa_K197034 in vector BBa_K197039). Since a GFP linker is also present in this construct, this will give us the ability to visualize the protein in the membrane by the use of Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy.
The TIRF has also a prominent role in our second project: the characterisation of the transport of mfp5. Since it is rather difficult to visualize and characterize a protein in the outer-membrane, several techniques are combined. This includes as mentioned above TIRF microscopy, however this time different combination of dyes are used to visualise the transport. Beside the TIRF microscopy, also electron microscopy is used to get the optimal, visual prove. Further experiments include fractionation of the cells and protein gels.
The third project is the so called activation of mfp5, which means the hydroxylation of the tyrosines present in mfp5. For the hydroxylation the enzyme tyrosinase is required. There are several tyrosinases, all need additional compounds in order to fulfil the hydroxylation. For our project, the melA Biobricks from the Tokyo Tech 2009 iGEM team (BBa_K193601 and 602) are used. Once mfp5 is hydroxylated, it will be adhesive"

Stability Assay
Stability assay through liquid experiment was performed with both inserts in the pUCIDT (Amp) vector. 1 mL of LB with ampicillin (25 ug/ml) was inoculated with one single colony in eppendorf tubes in 10 replicates for each part. In order to allow 10 generations of growth, a 1:1000 dilution was made of the overnight culture and incubated for 24 h. The colour comparison was done through visualization of centrifuged cultures and by analyzing the color intensity we could deduce the stability of the chromoprotein-encoding plasmid.
Figure 7. Results after 10 Generations of growth. Culture pellets marked as IDT have the plasmid with the codon optmized AmilCP sequence and culture pellets market as ORI have the plasmid containing the original native AmilCP sequence.
Submission Preparation
The plasmid containing our biobrick part with the codon optimized AmilCP sequence was extracted from an O.N. culture with JeneGET plasmid miniprep kit from Thermo Fischer Scientific.
A 2A assembly was then performed to move our Biobrick part from the pUCIDT (Amp) cloning vector into pSB1C3 backbone.  This experiment was done according to the iGEM protocol for 3A assembly. The size of digested DNA was checked by gel elecrophoresis. After ligation into pSB1C3, the concentration of plasmid DNA was measured with Qubit before the pSB1C3 plasmid containing our Biobrick part was sent for submission.

Conclusion
Color Intensity Comparison
Already after 10 generations of growth it was clearly visible that the color intensity was better distributed in the cells containing the plasmid with the codon optimized AmilCP sequence. The result confirms that the plasmid containing codon optimized part generates better maintenance of protein expression than the plasmid containing the original native part. The improved stability of expression makes this part, BBa_K2669003 , a good candidate as a reliable reporter or biosensor.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-lys_-_-_TEXT.html,".0 mM IPTG also showed zones of inhibition. The zones from induced samples were larger than that of uninduced samples. This indicates that even though bacteriolytic substances or proteins could be present in the cell lysate (based on the zone of inhibition from untransformed samples) the samples containing lysostaphin showed a greater lytic activity.
Figure 6. Kirby-Bauer Test of Expressed Lys on E. coli TOB1.
Demonstrating efficient biofilm inhibition
The detection and quantification of biofilm inhibition was obtained by crystal violet staining. Since crystal violet also stains bacterial cells, an absolutel clear distinction between baceriolytic and biofilm-dispersing activity is hard to make. However, the assay is appropriate for evaluating the results of both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms as long as caution is taken with the interpretation. The results may be assessed visually, photographed or quantified spectrophotometrically using a plate reader to measure the absorbance at 595 nm. For the inhibition test, the experimental procedure includes adding liquid cultures to a microtiter plate which we immediately treat with lysostaphin at four different volumes; 1, 5, 10 and 20 µl. Gentamicin was used as positive control and cell lysates of BL21(DE3) cells as negative control.
The significance of the results obtained were analyzed using a t-test.
During protein extraction of lysostaphin, the cells were lysed and both the cell pellet and the supernatants were tested for biofilm inhibition. The supernatant samples were labelled Lys (S), whereas the pellet samples were labelled  Lys (P). The treatment had been done on 3 different samples of Lys (Lys 1, Lys 2 and Lys 3) but for simplicity, only one is shown in each experiment.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

To 2 tubes of sterile LB nutrient broth, a sample of cultures 2 and 3 were introduced. They were then placed into the shaking incubator overnight.
Introduction
Today's procedure is straightforward. Using aseptic technique, we are to innoculate 2 flasks containing LB nutrient broth with the 2 cultures grown overnight. Once carried out, these flasks will be incubated overnight and used in tomorrow's larger scale plasmid prep.
Procedure
Mathew pipetting 50ml LB into a flask
Prepare 2 sterile flasks and to each of them, add 50ml of sterile LB.
Remember to use aseptic technique throughout, i.e. flame the lids of the flask and the LB bottle with a Bunsen burner before and after transferring liquids
Label the flasks appropriately. To one flask, pipette 100 microlitres of the first culture and to the second flask, pipette 100 microlitres of the second culture. (In this case, they are cultures 2 and 3 - GFP and RFP transformed E.coli respectively)
Place flasks in shaking incubator. To ensure that the right amount of cells grow in the media for the plasmid prep, the incubation period should be limited to 16 hours.

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter3_-_-_TEXT.html," one-pot reaction with high efficiency. We chose the native TALE AvrBs3 as a scaffold for customized assembly of TALE constructs. The central DNA binding domain of AvrBs3 is formed by 17.5 tandemly arranged 34 amino acid repeats, with the last half repeat showing similarity to only the first 20 amino acids of a full repeat. To reduce the risk of recombination events between the 17.5 highly homologous repeat sequences, we codon-optimized avrBs3 applying the codon usage. In a single Golden Gate cloning reaction, cloning efficiency is significantly reduced for assembly of 17 repeat modules. Therefore, we split the assembly in two successive steps. In the first cloning step, 10 repeats are assembled in one vector. The preassembly vectors confer SpecR and encode a lacZ-&alpha fragment for blue/white selection. On both sides of the lacZ-&alpha fragment a type IIS recognition sequence - BsaI - is positioned. Similarly, 11~17 repeats and NG-last-repeat are respectively ligated and inserted into another vector. After preassembly of the 10 and 7 and last repeats using BsaI, the intermediate blocks are released via Esp3I and cloned into the final assembly vector (modified pTAL1). Modified pTAL1 confers AmpR, and allows plasmid replication in E.coli. The vector pTAL1 also contains all elements of the final TALE expression construct, except the repeat modules.
Report System : We construct a report system so as to test the reliability and efficiency of our ‘Telling TALE’. In this section, we test the TALE’s DNA binding ability and report it with a common report gene ‘RFP’. We attempt to put the target of TALE’s DNA binding target sequence inside the expression cassette of report gene and binding TALE can disrupt the express of report gene. We use iGEM standard parts to build our report system.
Plan for future steps: Better modeling in the optimization of the TALE. Golden Gate Assembly of the optimized TALE coding sequence. Construction of the Report System.

Using such logic, we can hypothesise that any sequence element that can adjust the expression of the catalytic biomolecule can be measured and its influence on the Product Nucleotide - recorded. In other words, this influence is the activity, or strength of regulatory element.
Proof of concept
To demonstrate that CAT-Seq can be applied to record the activity and cross interactions of regulatory sequences we have chosen two main objects: Ribosome Binding Sites and synthetic Toehold Switches.
1. Regulatory part activity recording
Ribosome binding sites (RBS) are sequences that are responsible for recruiting the ribosomes during the initiation of protein translation. RBS can have different sequences, and depending on those sequences, the frequency of ribosome binding rate to the RBS will be different. In this way, gene of interest translation rate can be controlled in a constitutive manner.
Having a large RBS library with known activities would allow to precisely pick an RBS sequence with a specific activity, while engineering sensitive and complex genetic circuits. Yet, it is not easy to screen large libraries of RBS, as each individual known sequence must be selectively placed in a physically separated compartment and then measured.
With CAT-Seq, such activity recording becomes much easier. While keeping all the workflow from the main Catalytic Activity Sequencing design, all we need to do is to change the way we prepare the library. Firstly, instead of using a library of catalytic biomolecules, we can use a single esterase enzyme. Then, specific or random RBS sequence library can be prepared and attached to the esterase enzyme sequence. After that, every step of CAT-Seq method is the same.
After the library is encapsulated into droplets, depending on the RBS sequence strength some droplets may have different amounts of the esterase. For example, the droplets with more esterase will produce more Product Nucleotides and vice-versa. After the amplification and sequencing steps we can learn two main things about the measured library - the RBS sequence and its relative RBS strength in the form of Product Nucleotide concentration for every library variant screened.
For our proof of concept experiments, we have chosen to measure multiple already established RBS sequences from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. First, we measured the activities of RBS using standard methods as a control. Next, we have measured the same constructs using the CAT-Seq system.
2. Regulatory part interaction recording
Next, we want"
EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," to contain any heavily repeated sequences. On the other                   hand, the low score of the per base sequence content can be attributed to a aggressive trimming of adapters that can introduce bias in the library. This typically occurs at the end of the reads (Andrews). The per base sequence content                   for the study reads as seen in Figure 2, seem to be extensively trimmed as the sequence content at the end of the reads deviate from the general trend. This is further confirm by the GC content of the data which shows a deviation from                   the normal distribution of more than 15% of the reads (Andrews).
Figure 2 - Sequence content across bases for sample ERR2683866. The samples in the study follow similar trends.
Sequence Duplication levels were also found to be abnormal, since non-unique sequences make up more than 20% of the total library for all the samples. This can be appreciated by high duplication peaks in the center of Figure 3. FastQC                   also calculates the overall loss of the sequence for the library after removal of the duplicated sequences, found on the title of Figure 3. For the sample ERR2683866, the non-duplicated sequences represent 65.2% of the total library.                   This might be due to specific PCR enrichment during the sequencing process (Andrews).
Figure 3 - Sequence Duplication levels for sample ERR2683866. Similar trends were observed in the other samples of this study.
Based on the output of these reports the pipeline was optimized to ensure that any possible adapters that might affect GC sequence content or Per base sequence content are removed, using BBmap or Trimmomatic. Furthermore, given the high                   content of duplicate reads its necessary to ensure that the library is filtered to remove any bias information that can affect the final outcome. Duplicate reads were filtered using MarkDuplicates package in picard tools.
Sequencing Adapter Cut and Quality Control - Trimmomatic/BBmap
The sequences were analysed using BBmap (v38.36) and Trimmomatic (v0.38), to remove any sequencing adapters related to the reads (Bolger, Lohse and Usadel 2114-2120). Usually sequence data contains adapters used for indexing and sorting                   the reads in the genome. Normally, is ideal to use the specific adapter-sets according to the technique used to perform the sequencing. TruSeq is commonly used for performing this analysis, however, the original method of extraction                   of the libraries of study PRJEB27635, are not known which makes the task of assessing the quality of reads a challenge.

We participated in the Valencia UPV iGEM team’s research on the status of transgenic regulation, consumption, and perception in various countries. The opportunity to reflect on how genetic engineering affects our day-to-day lives beyond the research lab was interesting. We also asked our peers about their perceptions of genetically engineered products to have a more representative sample of US consumers than just iGEM team members. The variety of reactions we heard ranged from ambivalent to strongly negative. This was an important reminder of how the importance of projects like our human practices outreach and engagement initiatives.

Game overview
    There are many factors (Like initial number of each populations and spatial factors) can have influence on the results of population interactions in our system, and we found that it will be much easier to consider effects of these factors if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---E.coli War to satisfy our needs.
    Our games are made on structure of html5. The videos below are two short videos of our Fluid E.coli War and solid E.coli War.
See more details on Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War
   After we designed our game preliminarily, we visited Beijing Perfect World Network Technology Co., Ltd (Perfect World), one of the largest game company in China, to learn more about the design of a game. The useful advice from the experts  help us a lot in improving our E.coli War, making it more fun and easier for kids to play.
See more details at Visiting Perfect World
    Afterwards, when children played this game during our exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM), they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. (See more details at Exhibition at National Museum and Game Discovery ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.

Adenylation domains
The adenylation domains are responsible for activating and attaching the amino acid monomers to the PCP domain. They act as gatekeepers, ensuring that only the desired monomers are incorporated. They may be highly specific, only binding a single amino acid, or as in the case with Tyrocidine, see below, allow multiple similar amino acids to be incorporated in the peptide [3]. In the late 1990's the so called specificity-conferring code of A domains was revealed [4]. This code consists of the 10 amino acids, which were identified by sequence alignments to the first solved A domain crystal structure PheA [5], that are responsible for substrate binding (READ MORE LINK TO FURTHER DOWN MISSING).
Peptidyl carrier protein domains
The monomers are covalently bound to the PCP domains through thioester bonds. Before they can accept the monomers, they must be activated by posttranslational modification. A 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTase) transfers a 4'-phosphopantetheine (4'-PP) moiety, carrying the sulfhydryl group required for thioester bond formation, from coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue in the PCP domain [2].
Condensation domains
Elongation of the peptidyl chain is performed by the C domains, which catalyze the condensation of the peptidyl chain bound to the upstream PCP domain and the amino acid bound to the downstream PCP domain. These domains have a strong stereoselectivity and may have some specificity towards the side chain of the amino acid incorporated by the A domain of the same module, whereas little specificity has been observed towards the peptidyl chain [6].
Thioesterase domains
The TE-domain catalyses the final step of NRP synthesis. It is the TE-domain that determines if the peptide is relased or cyclised to form a cyclic structure. Despite, the important role of TE-domains they are the least understood in the pathway. While it is possible to predict A-domain specificity, it is not possible to predict TE affinity [7].

Overall Workplan: The Approach in Designing the Circuit
Our Circuit
In building a spatial oscillator, the genetic circuit must fulfill at least 3 main properties.
1. Cells must be able to react to stimuli to start the oscillation.
Our circuit is induced with the absence of light (as indicated by the moon symbol) and arabinose (as indicated by the red molecules.) The light sensor allows the cell to detect the external stimuli, and sends a signal to the light-sensitive promoter to initiate the signal cascade to propagate the spatial oscillation.
2. Cells must be able to transform into one of two states.
In our circuit, all promoter have dual functions.  They are activated or inhibited by specific molecules. For example, the ON promoter is lambda-activated, but inhibited by the ""434"" protein. Likewise, the OFF switch is lux-activated, but inhibited by the lambda protein.
3. Cellular expression must be robust to external environmental perturbations.
In our circuit, robustness is achieved through the use of positive feedback. For example, in the ON switch, once the lambda protein activates the ON promoter, it continuously upregulate its own production to keep the promoter ON. Simultaneously, this reinforces the inhibition of the OFF promoter as well.

Scheme
The first plasmid contains the efflux pump for Nickel (RcnA), which  will maintain its natural regulation dependent of RcnR and  additionally, it will contain a promoter regulated by the repressor of lambda  phage, cI as well as a resistance as a marker of the plasmid.
The second plasmid contains everything needed for regulating RcnA dependent on an external signal (AHL). Both luxR and aiiA will be synthesised constitutively. LuxR with a strong promoter (pTetR), as we do not want the presence of LuxR to be limiting and aiiA under the control of a moderate or weak promoter (pLacZ) for it is a very efficient enzyme, and we don't want it to degrade all AHL and prevent the signal from being transmitted. And cI*, which is a version of cI tagged with an LVA tail for rapid degradation, regulated by a promoter dependent of LuxR +  AHL. It will also contain a resistance as a marker.
When AHL is added, it will bind LuxR and stimulate the production of cI*, which in  turn will represses the transcription of rcnA. Like cI*, the signal produced by AHL will be short-lived since aiiA will be degradating it constantly, so the system quickly returns to its initial state.

Fig.13 Strain Growth Curve under 2mM H2O2 Stress
Figure.14 The OD600 of strains at 12h under 0mM, 1mM, and 2mM H2O2 Stress stress
As Figure.11~ Figure.14 shown, comparing the growth curves of yno1 and yno1-∆yca1 under H2O2 stress with 0mM, 1mM and 2mM, we can see that, the growth of                         strain knocking out yca1 is always better than the strain without knocking out yca1 after overexpressing yno1.
It can be concluded that knocking out yca1 can improve our engineering strain tolerance                         to H2O2.
Conclusions:
Knock out yca1 gene can increase the yeast tolerance to hydrogen peroxide.
Summary of regulator part
To summarize briefly, overexpress ndi1/yno1 can accumulate ROS successfully, also,                         knocking out gene yca1 can improve the tolerance to high level of ROS content.

Later the cell enters the G2 phase when the cell becomes incompetent for DNA replication and it keep growing until finally compartmentalizing into two cells, either of who contains stalk and flagellum in one pole. For the swarmer cell which possesses flagellum, the rotation of flagellum is activated and two pili are generated as well. The swarmer one enters G1 phase when its chromosome is different from the stalked one and it cannot reproduce itself. However, in G1 phase, the holdfast is formed predominantly in the swarmer cell stage and these swarmer cells reenter S phase like a cell differentiation process exacterly simultaneously when rotating flagellum disappears and holdfast is synthesized. As the research says, the development of stalk and holdfast helps C.crescentus to live in some tough surroundings and enhance its ability to absorb phosphate passively when nutrition provide is limited and swimming using flagellum waste the energy that is original manuscript for necessary metabolism. Scientists found that Pst family correlate the length of stalk. As the hypothsis contains, if it is correct, stalk elongation may function to elevate single cell away from surface thus bacteria receive much high-level nutrient flux and if C.crescentus colonize with other organisms, stalk ensures bacteria to have greateraccess to nutrients comparing to other nearby surfacespecies to be superior in competition and survival. Consequently, C.crescentus is able to survive withour flagellum and even much more stronger when containing holdfast.
In accordance with recent research, many kinds of protein are assistedly, antagonistically or stimulatively working for a distinct process during the life cycle of C.crescentus such as RodA and MreB are required for stalk synthesis and prevetion of ectopic pole formation, PodJ is an organelle development protin that differentailly localized and required for polar targeting on PleC development regulator,sigma-factor is also required for polar morphogensis and normal celldivision, BapE DNA endonuclease induces an apoptotic-like response to DNA damage whichis useful for future kill switch design and SpmX localizaion relates to stalk position not only working in C.crescentus, but in A.xcentricus and A.biprosthecum etc.
In the whole life cycle of C.crescentus, we mostly focus onthe process of degrdation of flagellum and biosynthsis of holdfast. Thus, we will discussthe pathway of the two parts dividedly and design a reasonable"

Introduction
An important segment of human practices is the integration of suggestions and advice learned from experts into our own project. Our team contacted potential stakeholders such as the Warwick Printing Company and worked to incorporate information learned from the interview into the experimental procedures of our project. To delve into the business realm, we also reached out to a business liaison at the University of Lethbridge. Overall, the advice from the different experts greatly improved the project design.
Warwick Printing Company
This year, team members received the opportunity to interview the president of a local printing business here in Lethbridge. Warwick Printing Company is a company that prints to consumer demand, printing books, posters, and any other paper material. President Dave Warwick had a number of useful pointers to give to us about our product that we then took into consideration. For example, when asked about the possibility of using our product in his company, he stated that as long as our ink remained consistent throughout uses, and remained cost efficient, it was a possibility. His advice on looking at consistency when developing our product helped us to consider a method of checking the ink’s consistency in the creation of our ink. In addition, Warwick shed light on the effects that the recent increase in technology has had on his business. He explained how technology has been working with his company, not against it, and advised how the printing industry has nothing to fear in technology. Overall, the advice received from this interview was very helpful in the designing of our product. This has influenced our decision making process regarding the creation of ink. For example, after hearing Mr. Warwick’s suggestions for our ink, we decided to implement quality control tests, such as photobleaching, to compare our ink to the inks found in the current market.
Interviewing Dave Warwick led to the arrangement of a tour of their facility. On July 12, 2017, members of our team were given a tour of the Warwick Printing building. We were lucky enough to have the president of the company, Dave Warwick, be our tour guide. He took us through the entire building, starting with the design area. This was a section in the building for workers to create designs"

we performed three times in YPD medium and three times in SD-Leu-deficient medium. A time                         period of 0h-48h was selected and detected once every four hours. After excluding some                         experimental operational errors, we obtained the results in the figure.
It has been shown that external NADH dehydrogenases Ndi1 and Yno1 are involved                         in the generation of intracellular oxidative stress, however, the results measured by the                         fluorescence microplate reader cannot exclude the interference of dead cells on OD600, we                         therefore examined the ROS accumulation through flow cytometry.

Replace the                             promoter of yno1/ndi1 in yeast genome
In order to reduce the pressure on our engineered strains from the addition of plasmid and to                         prevent plasmid loss, we decided to introduce the gene circuit which increases the level of                         endogenous ROS into the yeast genome. We chose to replace the ndi1/yno1 promoter with                         the galactose-inducible promoter GAL1p we used. Because the promoter of the endogenous ndi1/yno1 gene in yeast is a bidirectional promoter, we chose to insert the gal1 promoter upstream of the ndi1/yno1 gene by OE-PCR.
Fig.6 Replace the promoter of yno1/ndi1
After successfully replacing the promoter of the yeast endogenous ndi1/yno1 gene,                         to obtain the overexpression effect, we tested the mRNA quantity. The results are as follows.
Fig.7 qPCR result in original strain (C, in blue below), and in strain with yno1 overexpressed and yca1 knockout (YY, in red below).
Fig.8 qPCR result in original strain (C, in blue below), and in strain with yno1 overexpressed and ndi1 knockout (YN, in red below).
According to the result, we could find out that strain with yno1 overexpressed and yca1 knockout had an obvious increase of mRNAs. However, we didn't get the same result in ndi1                         overexpressed strain. We believed this result showed that the overexpression of ndi1 was                         failed while the yno1 one succeeded.

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

We learned that they detected colorectal cancer through the nitric oxide inducible promoter PyeaR, and at that time we were having trouble using nitric oxide to drive PnorV to transcribe our reporter. So, we also tested the effect of PyeaR (BBa_K381001) in the Distribution Kit (Figure 3).
We also tested the response of BBa_K381001 to NO in the Distribution Kit (Figure 3).
We transformed the plasmid containing BBa_K381001 into DH5α, and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight to dilute to OD = 0.4. Then we took half as control and the other half added SNP aqueous solution and induced at 37 ℃ for 6 h. Then we detected the fluorescence using a microplate reader and a fluorescence microscope (Figure 4). We can see that PyeaR can also be effectively activated by NO with almost no leakage. In the future, we will compare the performance of PyeaR and PnorV in depth.
Histogram of GFP fluorescence: LB control, without SNP, with 100μM SNP. B, GFP fluorescence image from top to bottom: without SNP, with 100μM SNP.
In conclusion, we have confirmed that the NO sensor in E. coli we built capable of responding to chemically produced nitric oxide in vitro. And we believe that as a naturally NO response mechanism in E. coli, the NO sensor we construct will also work in vivo.

2 Transport and Production
At the beginning of the experiment, we directly constructed the plasmids of YebF-IL10 and YebF-myrosinase, but the effect of extracellular detection was not satisfactory. During the participation in CCiC, iGEMer suggested that we first start from testing the performance of the secretory tag YebF, so we constructed the plasmid YebF-GFP shown in Figure 5A. To express IL10 and myrosinase, we constructed plasmids IL10-flag and myrosinase-his as shown in Figure 5B and Figure 5C.
A, the construction of our YebF-GFP using strong promoter. B, the construction of IL10 production module. C, the construction of myrosinase production module.

We were provided with data for the minewater intial concentrations, final effluent permit limit (desired concentration), the volume of their reactor chambers (equivalent to our MBR) and the flowrates of the system. The model was ran for the values provided for Zinc and Iron. The values for the other 4 metals were not used for the following reasons: the inital concentration of Nickel and Copper were already below the final effluent permit limit, Magnesium did not have a final permit effluent limit and no data was provided for Cobalt.
The input values for Zinc were: Initial Concentration 19.95 mg/L, Desired Concentration 0.02 mg/L. The input values for Iron were: Initial Concentration 82.20 mg/L, Desired Concentration 3 mg/L. The Flowrate and MBR Volume were the same for both metals, with the Flowrate input 600 L/s and MBR Volume input 1340000 L. Below is the graphs of output concentration against time for Zinc and Iron.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," is laminar or turbulent of even transitional. In our case, the Reynold's number has a very low value equal to 0.00003 and thus, the viscous effects dominate the fluid. The reason why Reynold's number takes such a low value is that if we zoomed in the fluid we could see bacteria swimming at the same velocity as the fluid velocity field. Assuming that the size of a bacterium is about 10-6m, their swimming velocity is 30x10-6 m/s and the density of the fluid in which the bacteria swim is 1000 kg/m3 and the dynamic viscosity is around 0.001 Pa.s, the Reynold's number turns out to be equal to 1x10-5.
Life at low Reynolds numbers
Life at low Reynold's numbers: In environments such as a fluid with a very low Reynold's number, the particles which “live” inside the fluid are considered “swimmers” as they deform their surface to sustain their movement. In our case, the E. coli bacteria, which constitute an important part of the gut's flora, have helical flagella to help them with their locomotion.
If a bacterium suddenly stops deforming its body, it will become a “victim” of the inertial forces of the fluid and thus, it will decelerate. At low Reynold's numbers, the drag force acting on the bacterium takes the form of viscous forces, $f_{drag} \sim \eta UL$ , and the bacterium can reach a distance of about 0.1 nm before stopping its movement. In contrast, at high Reynold numbers the distance is longer and thus, Re at low values can be interpreted as a non-dimensional coasting distance.
One could describe the locomotion of a bacterium in low Re as a function of the swimming gait ${{\bf{u}}_s}(t)$(velocity field on the body surface). At every instant, it can be assumed that the body is solid with unknown velocity ${\bf{U}}(t)$ and rotation rate ${\bf{\Omega }}(t)$. Thus, the instantaneous velocity on the body surface is ${\bf{u}} = {\bf{U}} + {\bf{\Omega }} \times {\bf{x}} + {{\bf{u}}_s}$. To calculate in every time step the values of ${\bf{U}}(t)$ and ${\bf{\Omega }}(t)$, one needs to determine both the velocity and stress fields in the problem in order"

In our new version, we abort this design and change the passageway in the box into small holes. Customer can judge whether there are termites by observing whether the holes are blocked.
Trap
The inspiration of our trap unit is from an existing device. The device works like this: Pine put in the device will attract termites and when climbing into the device, they will eat the Toxin accidently and die in or out of the device.
Kill
We want to kill all termites but our toxin will not be influential for a very long period. Our experiment has shown that is it enough to return. Along the same way, termites goes into their nest and spread Toxin to their family.
Total Design (DRAFT 1.0)
Mechanical Parts
Besides functions, we think more to improve our device. We design a box with a removable cover instead of a pressurized cuboid. By this way, customer will clean our device more easily, and it is convenient to reload wood bricks. We also design a wider ring under the cover, to avoid the slide when device shaking
Instruction Manual
Usage
When using the device, customers should place the Attracting Cover with wood to attract more termites. Once they notice the bottom holes are getting smaller, or stuck by termites’ secretion, the Trap Cover should take the place of the attracting cover and the Kill Function works!
Warning
By writing application scenarios, we have already visualized the intended impact of TERMITE TERMINATOR and present Techno-moral vignettes, focusing on the potential wider impacts of our application. According to these unintended scenes, to reduce future risks, a series of warnings have been added to the Instruction Manual can be proposed.
Online Server
Furthermore, we have designed an application to make a Real-time tracking online system. With this application, it does not matter if our customers have any problem using our device. We have thought of putting 14 functions into this application. The functions are listed as follows.
The app has more usage than providing convenience for customers. By analyzing the data about the frequency of downloading the app and buying the baits, we can know lots of information about termites in a certain district, which will be shared on the internet. So people can learn more about our termites and terminate them more easily. We, iGEMers from ZJU, are termite terminators!

Sadly the primers arrived just a few days before wiki freeze and we had no time to test that. The switching to the constitutive promoter had no obvious effect (no green colonies or culture). Changing the expression strain of E. coli BL21 didn't do no positive effect ether. Which led us to the conclusion, that besides further information the problem has to be the space in between the two proteins and the CBD and GFP must hamper each other from folding correctly. To test and solve this a very long linker with three serines followed by ten asparagines should be assembled in the already existing parts via a blunt end cloning. This also is right at hand, just wasn't successful in the time which was left.

BCCS-Bristol,2010,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Human Practices#Marketing Campaign#Public Perception_-_-_TEXT.html," the release of our organism, we have attempted to glean a better understanding of the opinions held by non-experts, by also considering the role of the media in scientific reporting. By identifying approaches taken by the media that have caused controversy in the past, we hope to construct clear and truthful materials to inform and interest the public in the wider synthetic biology debate.
Further research could be conducted into the genetic modification debate, of which we have only scratched the surface, exploring other nationalities’ viewpoints, regulations and activist groups. We also acknowledge that the surveys conducted by the many iGEM teams were done so in different countries and cultures and of different levels of scientific understanding: from the general public to lecturers and professionals, however they have provided an insight into the varying opinions.
iGEM survey analysis
There are some recurring themes in the conclusions drawn by iGEM teams that have conducted surveys of public opinion. Questions posed by many different teams have explored public and scientific opinions of synthetic biology and its implications, and they have made recommendations based on their findings. Issues have been identified by previous teams when presenting synthetic biology and research to people uninvolved in iGEM, and a summary of the 2005-2008 team findings has been produced by the Valencia 2009 team [1] .
Some of the issues relevant to our campaign are listed and considered here:
the need for more public information
careful communication requires input from the scientific community
safety and security are a major concern
current opinions of synthetic biology
We will attempt to address these issues in our public information leaflet, as the main purpose of our approach is to produce a careful response to public opinion whilst providing information about the potential of our synthetic biology research.
More public information is needed
Further motivating our advertising approach, several teams have concluded that more public information is required.
‘there should be more information for the general public about new technologies’, (Valencia 2009 [2] )
‘general public knowledge of science is democratically necessary for ethical decision making’ (conclusions of Heidelberg 2008 summarised by Valencia 2009 [3] )
These conclusions suggest that public information at present is not sufficient, but also that to make good decisions, the public need to be involved as a stakeholder and as such they need to be well informed to make the best decisions possible.
Additionally, the synthetic biology community has been found to be majority supportive for public information. TUDelft 2009 found that 61% of the community agrees that scientific advances should be communicated to society [4] . Our campaign is designed such that our own"
Duke,2013,Team:Duke#Modeling#2 1_-_-_TEXT.html," the Pbound values for the three cases--1 binding site, 3 binding sites, and 5 binding sites--were calculated for repressor level from 0.1 to 10,000 molecules/cell. Then finally, the Pbound values at these three cases were divided by the basal Pbound value to find the fold change in Pbound for the three cases. The result from these steps are graphed below.
Figure 4. Graph of Fold Change in Pbound vs. Number of Binding Sites
The black, blue, and red data points indicate the fold change in Pbound when 1, 3 and 5 repressor binding sites are present. Qualitatively, it clearly looks like the slope of the hill function becomes steeper with additional binding sites. When a hill function was fitted onto these data points using ""cftool"" command on MATLAB, it was quantitatively shown that the apparent Hill coefficient increases from 1.00 to 2.99 then to 4.86 as the number of binding sites increased from 1 to 3, then to 5.
The significance of the result above is that a non-Hill equation that models the effect of multiple repressor sites on the probability of RNAP binding demonstrated increase in cooperativity with increasing number of binding sites.
Gene Expression Level vs. Binding Strength of Repressors
Figure 5. Pbound vs. Kd
Similarly, the relationship between Pbound and the dissociation constants of repressors was studied in this section. In addition to the variables and the values from previous section, a new set of variables were introduced to distinguish between weak and strong repressors. A value of 0.1nM was used for ""Kd,strong"" and this was the dissociation constant for strong repressors. Also, 10nM was used for ""Kd,weak,"" which wass the dissociation constant for weak repressors. Because the strength of binding is represented as the ""dissociation"" constant, higher value translates to equilibrium shifting towards dissociated repressor ([DNA]+[Repressor]) instead of bound repressor ([DNA-Repressor]).
Just like in the previous section, the basal level of Pbound was calculated using Freg = 1 (no Transcription Factors). The key difference was that there were two types of Fregs: one for strong binding and one for weak binding. The effect of different combinations of weak and strong binding was demonstrated by plotting the fold change in Pbound for 5 Binding sites for the following cases:

26. Analyzing the in vitro Transcription via Thin layer chromatography (TLC)
Aim: Comparison of traditional methods to analyze small molecule changes. Thin layer chromatography will be applied to analyze ATP consumption during in vitro transcription. To analyze ATP consumptions during the RNA transcription, ATP is converted to AMP after the transcription process by Apyrase
Procedure:
Transcription has been performed under the same conditions as described in previous assays such as protocol 22
As a template we used the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2
5 µL samples were taken every 5 min from the reaction
Samples were heated up to 95 °C for 10 min to inactivate the T7 RNA polymerase
After 1:30 h of incubation 0.01 U Apyrase and 4 mM CaCl2 were added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C
2 µL of each sample was spotted on a fluorophore coated TLC Plate (ALUGRAM®Xtra SIL G/UV254, Macherey Nagel)
Mobile phase contained 4:6 1 M Ammonium acetat: ethanol
TLC ran for 4 h 45 min at room temperature
Results:
Pyrophosphate precipitate was observed during the in vitro transcription, which is a sign for a successful reaction. ATP could be converted to AMP by Apyrase as well and monitored by TLC. However TLC method is not sensitive enough to measure small changes in ATP concentration during in vitro transcription reactions.

Our project, though appearing from scholars to be imperfect, attracted the middle school students. A middle-school student, Annie Kong, asked to be in our team and was accepted!
2016.7 Nankai University, Tianjin. We held a meeting with Tianjin University in the Lotus Festival.
Biologue in Interview
The differences between Mainland China and Taiwan can generate different ideas on the same thing. For example he ways of thinking are quite different. That's really obvious among scholars! So we went across the Taiwan Straits and interviewed a professor to get new ideas about biology! It was an unforgettable 'biologue' for us!

In order to get professional opinions on our project and to learn more about quorum sensing, we conducted an interview with two specialists, Ms. Weixia Gao and Ms Yufen Quan, After the introduction of our project idea, we discussed some particularly interesting points. We received advice that helped us to improve our project. After this helpful and enriching interview, we became clearer of our whole project. This interview greatly helped us on the design and actual execution of our project.
In order to get professional opinions on our biosafety considerations, we had a dialogue with the experts in this field, Jun Feng. After introducing our investigation and consideration of biosafety, Jun Feng gave us highly appreciation. Also he proposed some suggestions on how to construct a biosafety system. After the discussion with Jun Feng, we read plenty of literature about biosafety system design. Finally, we designed a biocontainment system for our AI-2 Controller.
Biologue in Collaboration
No team in iGEM is an island!
Working with other teams is an important part to be an iGEMer. We are ready to help other teams with their work and get new friends! See the 'Collaboration' page to get more information.

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots"

Human Practices
To ensure that our project would stay on track to tackle real-life problems,    we continuously sought input from people working ‘in the field’. This included    professionals with backgrounds such as synthetic biology, computer sciences,    education, academia and industry. By presenting our project at several events    and always engaging in discussions, we received a lot of opinions and feedback    and worked to evolve our project according to this interdisciplinary spirit.
Rapid Prototyping Workshop, EPFL
A first step in this direction was taken when one team member went to the    Rapid Prototyping Workshop : “Teaching how to develop creative and practical    solutions to real-life, complex, scientific and engineering problems” on June    8th 2017 to represent EPFL iGEM and gain valuable insights on problem solving,    how to approach problems in general and as well as feedback on organizing the    Wiki space and our web page. The workshop consisted of small groups having to    solve individual problems by making use of a given ‘toolbox’. The problems    included making prototypes for a project webpage, improvising an informative    video describing a project, organizing the lab/office space optimally, how to    improve the team performance and identifying the composition of an ideal curriculum    for future (bio-)engineers. We later on implemented a lot of the feedback    (for instance in teamwork) and believe it helped us for getting more efficient    at organizing ourselves and meeting deadlines.

Oversight
The development of our project is overseen by Dr. Janie Brennan and Eugene Kim, both of whom we formally meet biweekly. During these meetings, Dr. Brennan makes sure that the direction of our research is environmentally safe. In the wet lab, the Zhang Lab and Tang Lab graduate students, including Eugene, oversee our work and make sure that we are conducting our experiments safely.
Technique and Waste
While working in lab we followed all the safety protocols put forth by the Zhang and Tang labs and the WUSTL EHS department. We properly disposed of all hazardous material in the appropriately labeled containers. Cultures containing bacterial cells were bleached and disposed of accordingly. Sterile technique was utilized when handling cultures of bacteria,  or any equipment and media that would eventually come in contact with bacteria."
Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#project#hprac#ecovative_-_-_TEXT.html," to submit their research as a solution to Canada’s current oil sands problems. Although some teams did receive recognition from OSLI, the work has yet to make an impact on the current issues facing the OSLI corporations [1]. Teams have also attempted partnerships with local farms, technology groups, and breweries, but have yet to successfully market their research to any of these companies [2].
Some iGEM teams believe they can use their research to promote a nonprofit organization. In 2012, the Wellesley team partnered with the National Science Foundation and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and encouraged the development of software tools to advance the way medical patients interact with computers [3]. The team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison worked with a Great Lakes research center to increase awareness of pollution in the lakes [4]. These cooperative efforts between teams and nonprofits promote the iGEM foundation’s mission as a nonprofit organization. However, they usually end after the competition along  with the projects.
With the support of a company, we are confident that our work will continue to have a positive effect on Ecovative’s manufacturing process and, as a result, the environmental issue of Styrofoam pollution.
Direct Application of Our Fungal Toolkit
Our novel approach this year encouraged us to tailor a scientific project to the needs and goals of a collaborator. From the beginning of our brainstorming process, we have been focusing on how we can use the tools available to us to support Ecovative's work. Our goal has always been to fit the company's needs and ensure that our results are safe for the company to implement upon completion. We stayed in constant contact with Ecovative about how our research could play a role in the manufacturing process, keeping in mind during the design and execution of our project that our work could affect a product that is currently serving a growing market.
Following the completion of our fungal toolkit, Ecovative will have the ability to use the genetic parts to directly facilitate their own wetlab work and manufacturing process. Our biosafety constructs will allow for the removal of any resistance markers that we may introduce to prevent horizontal gene transfer in the spirit of environmental sustainability. At the same time, our project has vast future applications, including bioremediation, pharmaceutical production, and the creation of other useful biomaterials.
In this way, our project will have an impact beyond completion, distinguishing our team from others and refocusing the core goal of the iGEM competition: to create synthetic biological tools to solve real world problems.

Materials and Methods
4 X 500 mL of LB media in 2 L flasks were inoculated with E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells expressing ELS. Cells were grown at 37°C with shaking until the culture reached an OD600 of 0.683. The cultures were then induced with 10 mM IPTG. Culture samples containing equal amounts of cells were taken before induction and 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours post induction for analysis by SDS-PAGE. At 5 hours post induction the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 5 min. The cell lysate was resuspended in 42 mL of buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 60 mM NH4CL, 7 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, 7 mM MgCl2, 300 mM KCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 15% glycerol. Afterwards, 0.05 g of crystallized lysozyme was added to the cell suspension and incubated on ice for 1 hour. The lysate was then centrifuged for 70 minutes at 30000 x g to obtain the S30 fraction.
Results
Figure 1. 12.5% SDS-PAGE of His-tagged ELS Overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Samples were taken at 1 hour increments after IPTG induction. Lane 1: zero hours; Lane 2: 1 hour; Lane 3: 2 hours; Lane 4: 3 hours. The expected molecular weight of enhanced lumazine synthase is 18.5 kD.
Conclusion
Figure 1 clearly displays an increase in expression of a protein smaller than 25.0 kD, which is approximately the expected size of enhanced lumazine synthase monomers (18.5 kD).
Protein Purification
Enhanced lumazine synthase microcompartments were purified using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to determine if the purified ELS formed a homogenous mixture of compartments, heterogenous mixture of microcompartments, or remained in monomer form.
Materials and Methods
In order to obtain a sample of ELS that was near homogeneity for characterization with SEC, the ELS sample was first purified by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). Ni2+-Sepharose beads supplied by Sigma Aldrich were pre-swelled in buffer containing 20% ethanol and 1m"

At destination, our habitats will assemble with the help of robots (the mycelial growth is effectively rate-limited by access to feedstock) on the order of weeks, and is designed to provide a safe living environment for our astronauts or to enable human colonies on other planets.
III. Cyanobacteria Oxygen-Production Validation
Cyanobacteria play an important role in our structure: serving as feedstock for the mycelia, and producing oxygen for use by astronauts. We wanted to quantify the ability of cyanobacteria to provide sufficient oxygen to sustain a habitat. We chose the strain Anabaena 7120 mainly because it is diazotrophic and photosynthetic, in addition to other favorable qualities for use on other planets5.
Figure 3: Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy Image of Anabaena 7120. Credit: Lynn Rothschild.
Using 425 ml of Anabaena in liquid culture, we used wireless oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors (Vernier Go Direct Series) in an airtight environment to quantify the production of these gases on a short time-scale. We used BD Anaerobic Sachets to achieve a <0.5% oxygen environment, and a 1627 mL Nasco Whirl-Pak airtight bag to maintain a suitable environment.
Given the empirically observed rate of oxygen production from our liquid culture, we reason that it will take ~92 hours (4 days) to achieve 20% oxygen, almost mimicking Earth's atmosphere. This time-frame is certainly reasonable in the context of our mission architecture. (For more details, please refer to the Results page.)

We took cross-talk into account in our whole cell model .
Alternate Design
As cross-talk is a burning issue in quorum sensing, we thought about a theoretical solution. Edinburgh iGEM team 2014 also worked on communication between E. coli. They developed new communication channels via metabolic wiring. By assuming that quorum sensing molecules would not cross-talk with metabolites, we used their idea to develop a model on the molecular level. The idea is finally to combine our whole-cell model and their idea on metabolites.
Metabolic wiring is based on the fact that when a resource is at disposal, a cell will produce an enzyme to break it down to smaller pieces. There is often a chain of metabolites. Using the fact that metabolites can diffuse through the membrane, this can allow communication (for more information, please see the Edinburgh iGEM team 2014 wiki).

Innovation in Disruptive Technologies
DNA origami is an example of disruptive technology, where innovation impacts pre existing value networks and generates a new market place. The implications behind the technology are usually broad and leads to accelerated development of varied downstream technologies. For example, the dNANO project is an application of DNA origami that aims to create standardized nano circuits which builds off the work of DNA origami. After speaking to Dr.Ferguson Pell, a biomedical engineer at the University of Alberta, adoption of these new technologies are hampered by the cost and accessibility at the time. Both these factors make early adoption of innovation unfeasible and therefore growth in these areas are likewise slow. For example, the field of synthetic biology has become a recent field exploration due to disruptive innovations in low cost sequencing and nucleotide synthesis making it economically feasible for innovators to innovate.
Our team recognized limitations which made DNA origami difficult to work with such as abberent base pair interactions, a lack of readily accessible resources, a lack of standardized documentation for structure construction and a community that is able to foster exploration with DNA origami. So we aimed to develop an open source repository for DNA origami. Open sourcing is a model in which information is able to be shared amongst a developer community composed of early adopters and enthusiasts, the benefit being knowledge spreading leading to rapid development. We then played around with the idea of sending DNA origami as a biobrick as iGEM has its own infrastructure for open source development. However, after realising the biobrick standard was incompatible with DNA origami, we decided to create our own initiative, the DNA origami library. Our tentative library would serve as a catalogue of entries for DNA origami shapes.
Each entry in the library will then contain the following:
Sequence of the template strand
Sequence of staples
An in silico visualization of the structure
A TEM of the actual structure
A detailed protocol that was utilized in the constructions. Parameters such as oligo concentrations and incubations will be some of the mandatory requirements included in each entry
Any other notes that may assist in reproducibility the structure folding"

Module I:The growth-promoting effects of glucose dehydrogenase(GDH)
Several studies have proven that overexpression of GDH does have growth-promoting effects on bacteria. In our experiments, E. coli was used as the chassis species and the gene sequence of GDH came from the genome of E. coli K12 strain.
Former studies only applied SDS-PAGE Gel electrophoresis in order to confirm the existence of GDH, which merely provides the information of molecular weight. In order to validate the existence of GDH precisely, two tags (6xHis and V5) were added at the C-terminal of the protein, which enabled further experiments including purification and western blot. Eventually, we proved the expression of our recombinant plasmid (Fig. 14a) in E. coli through western blotting (Fig. 14b).

Summary:
In light of the toxity of perchlorate and chlorate, we decided first to investigate the toxic effects of the compounds on E. coli growth and survival. The goal of this experiment was to discover the range of concentrations of sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) and sodium chlorite (NaClO2) in LB broth. Two serial dilutions were performed (one each for sodium perchlorate and sodium chlorite) and E.Coli viability was measured qualitatively by observation of solution turbidity. The range of compound concentrations that we selected were based on the previous study of  Kwolek-Mirek et al. (2011) who performed a similar analysis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae. Our experiments revealed that E.Coli is able to survive in a NaClO4 solution at concentrations up to 0.1M, and are not at all viable in any of our tested concentrations of NaClO2 (0.0125M and greater) (Figure 6. The results from this experiment will be applied to future work in which E.coli will be transformed to express a plasmid that will allow them to create the chlorite dismutase and perchlorate reductase enzymes. If we know the range of concentrations that E.coli is able to survive, we will know at which concentrations of perchlorate and chlorite we should begin with to test our transformed E.coli. Our alternative strategy would be add these compounds to saturated cultures expressing the enzymes understanding that it will kill the cells but may still produce oxygen in a non sustainable way.

Experimental Design:
Our treatment groups were the cultures grown in 0.2M, 0.1M, 0.05M, 0.025M, and 0.0125M solutions of perchlorate and chlorite ions in LB. To create these concentrated solutions, we performed serial dilutions through five different test tubes, each containing 5.0mL of the perchlorate/chlorite - LB solution. A sixth test tube was included as a control group, which contained only LB.
Each serial dilution was performed twice to ensure precision in our results.

We think there must be some mathematical principles that govern     the differentiation process. By simulating differentiation, we     want to get a closer understanding of the differentiation process.     However, E.coli can’t sense as much stimulus as stem cell, we     intend to utilize RNA aptamers what has the potential to response     to almost all stimulus to cover that shortage. Thus, we can get a     more precise stimulation. We also try to utilize pseudotaxis to accomplish some experimental     meaning. As far as we know, the motile ability is proportional to     the amount of protein CheZ in certain range. By measuring the     average chemotaxis distance, we can get a precise evaluation on     the RBS efficiency which is evaluated by fluorescence strength     previously.

TEAM'S QUESTIONS
From Goettingen
To Valencia : Which insect pheromones are you using? To Paris Bettencourt : No doubt there are persons who may feel insecure      because of their personal odor and who will benefit from your project, but      it seems that you are categorizing a single and only kind of “malodor”.      It’s interesting to consider that the attitude towards body odor is a      culture-related trait. How can the concepts of “strong personal odor”      and “malodor” be defined in a multicultural context without any cultural      bias? Wouldn’t it be more politically correct to leave the users decide if      they have “malodor”?
From Paris Bettencourt
Would any other iGEM teams like to repeat our experiment? They would      project sad, happy and romantic movies in a controlled environment, and      analyze the sweat samples by smelling them and rating the strength      and pleasantness before and after.

How would you quantify the secretion of volatile compounds into the air? Would you use an alternative genetic switch to the cooper-activated one      we’re using? Do you think our biosafety module is safe enough? If not,      how would you improve it?

Meeting with IISER-Mohali
We recently had a discussion with Team IISER-Mohali in which we discussed each other’s project. It was an interesting session, and we found their project an innovative one. Our session was focussed on critically analyzing each other’s project and discussing potential questions that can come up during Jamboree presentation. It helped both our teams to prepare robustly for the same. Since the team had participated in iGEM 2017, they shared their experience about judging criteria, presentation and poster session at the Giant Jamboree which was helpful and gave us additional insight into the competition.
Accepting BioBrick Part from Team TecCEM
In iGEM 2015, Team TecCEM_HS participated and worked upon developing a system to degrade SDS, similar to our project in idea. A member of their team, Borreguin JC,  is participating in this year’s Team TecCEM as well, and he was helpful in figuring out the issues they faced in past project so that we could avoid committing them.
Since isolating the sdsA gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was difficult, we contacted them if they could provide us with the plasmid containing the same. They gifted us the BioBrick(BBa_K1629002) which they had submitted in iGEM with the corresponding gene, thus helping us move forward with our project.
Survey amongst iGEM 2018 teams

For the detection of diacetyl, we found the receptor Odr10, that activate the promoter pFUS for peptide production. For diacetyl production, the gene ALS is known to enhance diacetyl production, so we’ll need to express ALS gene in V. harveyi only when C8-CAI-1 is detected. This is complicated because the receptor of C8-CAI-1 induces a repression of the promoter pqrr4. We need to find a inhibitor regulation in our system.

We’ve asked to Bassler’s lab to give us 2 V. harveyi strains: a WT one, and the JMH626 strain deleted from the gene CqsA, which can’t produce C8-CAI-1 by itself. We’ll need that strain to detect C8-CAI-1 from our engineered “E. coli cholera-like”. Purified diacetyl has been commanded to do induction experiments on P. pastoris. We find the Tet on/ Tet off repression system for diacetyl production in response to C8-CAI-1.

We will most notably refer to both Joseph Stiglitz’s (Nobel prize in economics in 2001) and Elinor Ostrom’s (Nobel prize in economics in 2009) theoretical work in the economics of innovation and intellectual property to back up our study.
The patent system: an efficient economic model ?
What is a patent, how is it awarded?
A patent grants its owner a monopoly in a country on an invention he was the first one to describe and claim. At a firm's scale, this also means being able to shield the potential commercial exploitation of the R&D work which has led to the invention, against the company's competitors. It rewards this work by granting the patent’s owner an economic advantage that will probably make the financial cost of the R&D be worth it. The perspective of this heavy economic asset is the major reason why patents are said to be a driving force that encourage innovation.
Nonetheless, such a profit-making privilege has a cost for both the claimer (patent offices fees, attorney fees, translation expenses if necessary, and so on) and the society, namely the ""monopoly rent"" it generates (see below). Indeed, targeted invention have to meet tough conditions for a patent to be granted. Consequently, knowing the granting conditions is very important to fully understand the patent system.
A patent is granted:
for a new invention never publicly revealed, which can lead to industrial applications ;
on a precise territory ;
for a maximum of twenty years ;
to the one who revealed the invention and described it with enough precision.
NB : A patent has to be paid annually for its delivery and maintaining.
The 1930 plant patent act marked the beginning of a new economic era for biology as emerged with it the patentability of the living world. Nowadays, even the genetically modified bacterias may be patentable (the latter have been patentable in the USA and then in Europe since the beginning of the 80s even if the precise conditions to be met to make ""living things"" patentable remain quite fuzzy.).
The goal of this brief study though, is not to discuss this matter.
Why patents have been created?
In France, patents have been created after the 1789 French Revolution. They were then considered as a human right : their aim was to recognize the inventors’ rights on their ingenuity. And so was born the first legal mean to claim authorship of an invention: a new age for intellectual property began.
Instead, the justification for patents became quickly socio-economic. Patents are now conceived as an incentive for production and knowledge spreading"

Introduction to recombinant Insulin
Insulin is a central hormone of human metabolism. Diabetics cannot produce it at all or not in the required quantity. Hence, patients depend on the active intake of insulin. Until the 1980s, insulin was solely gained from bovine and porcine pancreata. But 1.5bn porcine pancreata were necessary to satisfy the demand for insulin by 300m diabetics world-wide.
In 1982, scientists were able to insert the human gene coding insulin into the bacterium E. coli. These bacteria produce human insulin in large amounts. It is purified and used for treating diabetes. Still, the produced quantities are not yet sufficient to relinquish animal-derived insulin.

Ccas-ccaR system was characterized by measuring fluorescence, and production of PHB was measured according to Protocol 13 .
Inhibition of bacteria growth by type I-e CRISPRi was tested by measuring cell density, but the result was not good enough.
Week 20 (September 17th to September 23rd) ▲ back
We found two mutations in phbCAB gene cluster by sequencing, and we wondered it might be the cause of the low production of PHB. At the same time, plasmids that would be used as control were under assembling.
Week 21 (September 24th to October 1st) ▲ back
We were busy with standardization and part registry, at the same time, bacteria strain responsible for production of PHB induced by green light was under constructing. We were still struggling testing the effect caused by crRNA to bacteria growth. Characterization of Ccas-CcaR system was done in 24-well plate. At the end of this week, part BBa_K2627000 is successfully assembled and finished sequencing.
Week 22 (October 2nd to October 7th) ▲ back
We were happy with the National Day Holiday, but we still need to continue our experiment or we might leave the project unfinished. Bacteria strains which can synthesize PHB induced by light were selected through Nile Red according to https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/d/d3/T--SDU-China--Nile_Red.pdf. Characterization of Ccas-CcaR system was done in 24-well plate, and characterization of crRNA was going not very well. But the good news was that at the end of this vocation, the rest of the parts we were willing to send were assembled and sequenced.
Week 23 (October 8th to October15th) ▲ back
Finally, we finished constructing the bacteria strain that could produce PHB under green light, and the new strain was tested by measuring the relative weight of PHB through Gas Chromatography and HPLC following the protoco l. Since the effect of type I-E CRISPRi was not ideal when induced by light, so we chose to test it with arabinose as its inducer.

In the absence of IPTG, LacI would bind to lacp, inhibiting transcription and thus bringing sfGFP expression to a halt. In the presence of IPTG, however, LacI would lose the ability to bind to lacp, allowing transcription to proceed, resulting sfGFP expression.

要旨
""E.coli Pen"": Draw with your own color.
私たちKIT－Kyotoは、新たなArt Toolとして「E.coli Pen」を提案します。このE.coli Penは大腸菌の菌液をインクとする全く新しいペンです。同じ一種類のインクで複数の色を創り出すことを最大の特徴とし、そのメカニズムには酸化ストレス応答機構を利用しています。私たちは、酸化ストレスを与えると蛍光タンパク質を発現する大腸菌を新たに作製しました。さらに、酸化ストレスへの応答が異なる様々なプロモーターを使ってそれぞれの下流域にある蛍光タンパク質の遺伝子発現の調節を行うことで、１種類の大腸菌に無限の色を作らせることに挑戦しました。私たちが作製したこのインクを用いたE.coli Penを使えば、これまでのiGEMにおけるBioartとは一味違う、「一般の人」が親近感を持って、純粋にScienceとArtを楽しむことができるようになると期待しています。

The proNGF did not seem to be retained on the Ni-NTA affinity column, although in fraction A6 we also identified His-tag bound proNGF. To test if the His-tag is accessible for binding to Ni-NTA, we've performed a batch purification using Ni-NTA beads under native and partial denaturing conditions (Urea 2 M) followed by Western Blot analysis with immunodetection through Anti-His Antibodies Alexa Fluor 647 (Figure 10). Detection of His-tag in the pellet supernatant of induced BL21(DE3) pLysS with 1 mM IPTG and flow through when partially denatured.
Native His-tagged proNGF was not retained on Ni-NTA beads. We believe that the N-terminal His-tag may be hidden in the protein fold. Consequently, we denatured with 2M urea before purifying on the beads. As seen in lane 8 even 2M urea could not improve the binding. We also tried with an 8M urea concentration, without better results.

Conclusion
In our human practice, we went to ministry of science and technology of the the people’s republic of china to talk with Dr. Wei Yang, and we discussed about the safety of our project in detail. In addition, we also communicated with the Chinese experts in the field of food online, we did a full investigation and understanding in biosafety. We believe that no investigation, no right to speak. We organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to make a big chat about what we had done. Further to make our project more reasonable, and good for the world.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
