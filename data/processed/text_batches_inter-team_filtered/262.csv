2) Take 2 x falcon tubes (15ml) and, under aseptic conditions, add 10ml of MM competence media to each. Also using aseptic technique, remove some B. subtilis cells from the agar plate and inoculate one of the falcon tubes.
One tube will have Bacillus subtilis cells growing in it and the other will contain the just media with no B. subtilis cells. The latter will serve as a contamination control
3) Place both falcon tubes into shaking incubator (at 37ºC) and leave overnight.
On the day of Bacillus subtilis transformations (starting in the morning)
1) Make up the MM competence medium using the recipe seen in the ‘Solutions needed’ section.
2) Into two 50ml falcon tubes place 10ml of MM competence medium.
3) Pipette 0.6 ml of each of the 2 overnight growth media into the two tubes containing competence medium
4) Incubate these 2 tubes for 3 hours at 37ºC – in the meantime it might be worthwhile making up the starvation medium and keeping it incubated (this solution needs to be prewarmed when added later).
Diagram showing steps 2-4 of the transformation protocol
5) Once the 3 hours have elapsed, add 10 ml of prewarmed starvation medium to the two tubes and incubate at 37ºC for 1-2 hours.
6) Transfer 0.4ml of the competence solution (WITHOUT B. subtilis) into one Eppendorf tube and transfer 0.4ml of competence solution (WITH B. subtilis)twice into two Eppendorf tubes (so that each tube contains 0.4ml). To one tube containing Bacillus subtilis add 10µl of the DNA. To the other two tubes (one containing B. subtilis and the other containing just competence solution with no B. subtilis) add 5-10µl of water. Place these in the shaking incubator for 1 hour at 37ºC. To find out how to carry out the incubation step successfully, see the ‘Important Notes’ section below.

01 August 2012,Ali and Sandra conducted their presentations in our weekly seminar.
Today was the first time we met before the general meeting and thus were able to discuss a lot of different topics, like human practice and the participation of an ""intern"", a student from a lower semester, who is very interested in our work. Due to the fact that we still did not find another sponsor, Anna, Bianca and Simon proposed the team for the ""Preis des Stiftungsrates"" of the university.
Because our strains only show movement after three days of incubation, we had requested the strains RP 437 and MG from labs working with these. Now we can start testing them in our assay! Afterwards we started to discuss a few possible targets for our mutated Tar receptor.
After the official meeting we listened to two presentations. Ali´s paper had the title: ""Engineering microbes to sense and eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human pathogen"" (Saeidi N., et al., 2011) and presented an example of a synthetic biology based system to inhibit biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. Saeidi et al. engineered E. coli to produce a bacteriocin, an antimicrobial peptide and a lysing enzyme, which lyses the E. coli cell as response to the quorum sensing molecule AHL, secreted by P. aeruginosa. They were able to show that through this system an eradication of P. aeruginosain vitro was possible. Thank you Ali, for your inspirational talk!
Sandra presented to us the review ""Synthetic Biology: Integrated Gene Circuits""(Nagarajan Nandagopal and Michael B. Elowitz, 2012). In general a signal activates specific signaling cascades but synthetic biology theoretically enables us to ""create"" signaling pathways with outputs of our choice. The possible methods are ""functional replacement"", ""integrated synthetic circuits"" and ""rewiring"". In addition, she explained the mechanism of chemotaxis. Thank you, for your interesting talk!

Validation of the survey instrument would require us to assess statistics known as “validity” and “reliability” [REF #.3].  Validity basically refers to whether or not the survey is measuring the concepts we think it’s measuring while reliability assesses how consistently the survey produces valid results. Dr. Pagliarulo has offered to help with this process if we can collect enough data.

Our goal for the wet lab portion of the project was to develop an inexpensive biosensor for triclosan to implement in a high school laboratory setting. The problem we wanted to approach was to find a molecule that could interact specifically with triclosan and whose interaction with triclosan could be coupled to a measurable readout. In trying to understand the biology of triclosan, we discovered that its natural target might fit these requirements:
It is an enzyme (FabI) that is directly inhibited by triclosan and
Whose activity also depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH
In addition, our device requirements needed an enzyme that could also:

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Implementation#financial_-_-_TEXT.html," help to give patients some autonomy over their condition. Thus, we wanted to quantify the number of days a typical member of the CF community was absent from work/school for hospital IV treatment on an annual basis.  We constructed two models; one based on the paediatric CF patients, Fig 1, and one based on those aged 16 or above in employment or full time study, Fig 2.
Currently on average, a working or studying CF patient is losing 40 days a year to IV treatment. With 10% implementation, these days could be cut down to 36 days, and then with 50% of the length of IV treatment cut down by The Lung Ranger this could cut down to 20 days.
Furthermore, a child with CF spends on average 30 days annually getting IV treatment; regularly missing school days due to the Monday-Friday schedule of clinics. With 10% implementation these days could be cut down to 27 days. With the length of IV treatment reduced by 50% by The Lung Ranger this could cut down to 15 days, changing the time lost from a month to a fortnight.
Whilst regarding the costs related to the NHS we investigated the cost associated with one day of hospitalization, which we discovered to be £264 per patient 1. We looked into the average number of days for which patients are hospitalized along with the number of patients and computed the reduction-hypotheses alongside this data. From this we concluded that if the length of hospitalized IV treatment could be cut down by 10%, it could save £1.5 million in costs for those patients on the CF Registry. However, if the long term tracking of lung infections could cut down the length of hospitalized IV treatment by 50%, the cost could be cut by half thus saving £7.7 million (Fig 3).
Finally, to investigate the implementation of the L.A.S.S.O. on the scale of the UK we considered the hours off work CF patients had to take due to IV treatment and the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We considered the GDP per person of the UK which is £22,3362 along with the average number of hours worked annually per employee in the UK; 1,669 hours3. From this we were able to estimate the average contribution of a person towards the GDP per hour, which was £13.38. Currently due to IV treatment the hours off work that CF patients are missing contribute to a loss in £26M to the UK GDP. From this we considered the possible recovered contribution in GDP based on our L.A.S.S.O. hypotheses,"

Redox media, non-chemical water treatment: This fluid treatment passes the lead through a proprietary filter, causing a redox reaction in which “soluble lead cations are reduced to insoluble lead atoms, which are electroplated onto the surface of the media.”[14]
Guar Gum: Adsorption by this unique compound,[15] produced from the ground seeds of guar beans, was sufficient to remove 56.7% of lead from water at a gum concentration of 1,000 parts per million.

The transport protein being utilized for our project is the calmodulin-binding protein CBP4 from Nicotiana tabacum.  This protein is structurally similar to non-selective membrane channel proteins from other eukaryotes and has been shown to confer nickel tolerance and lead hypersensitivity.[10] Transgenic plants overexpressing NtCBP4 were found to have increased uptake of Pb2+ ions into cells, likely leading to the increased toxicity.[10] While it has been suggested that NtCBP4 could possibly be used for bioremediation purposes and other attempts have been made at lead removal from water using genetically engineered organisms, to the best of our knowledge no attempt has been made at utilizing NtCBP4 for precisely this purpose.[9],[10],[16] We believe that the specificity of this transport protein for lead and its readily available sequence make it an ideal candidate for bioremediation.

We prepared and presented a poster at the poster session by the Indian Institute of Scienceâs undergraduate science club on September 10, 2016. The audience consisted mainly of freshman year students. The director, undergraduate deans and several other faculties also attended the event.
The poster explained the motivation behind our project, the different modules of our project and how they worked, methods of assembling BioBricks, the parts we had characterized, the InterLab measurement and introduced the iGEM competition. The intention was to expose our peers to our project and inform them of the existence of the iGEM competition to motivate the freshmen to form their own team and ensure an unbroken succession of teams from our institute and also to obtain feedback and suggestions from faculty members.
The turnout for the event was around 150 people. Like any normal poster session, after each round of presentation, questions were taken and the audience was asked to give their comments in writing. The PDF of the poster presented there can be found here .

Explanation: This is based on the law of mass action. Two molecules of 3OC6HSL binds to one luxR protein to form a complex, which can then activate the transcription of luxpR promoters.
5) Dissociation of 3OC6HSL-LuxR Complex
- Reaction:  3OC6HSL-LuxR Complex$\to$2 3OC6HSL + 2 LuxR
- Reaction rate (Re-formation of AHL) : $v=2k_2C(t)$
- Parameter: $k_2\Rightarrow $rate constant of complex dissociation
Explanation: This is based on the law of mass action.
6) Degradation of AHL inside the cell
- Reaction:  3OC6HSL $\to$ NULL
- Reaction rate  : $v=d_1H(t)$
- Parameter: $d_1\Rightarrow $rate constant of AHL degradation inside the cell
Explanation: This is based on the law of mass action. We assume that AHL gradually degrades in the cell, while the rate is proportional to its current concentration.
7) Degradation of AHL outside the cell
- Reaction:  3OC6HSL $\to$ NULL
- Reaction rate : $v=d_2H_{ex}(t)$

Brown,2010,Team:Brown#Modeling#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," CI is in cyan. As we can see, the S1 protein gradually increases at first. When LovTAP* begins to increase in concentration, CI is produced which flips the bi-stable switch; thus, the concentration of S1 decreases.
State 2
The following is the above graph with S2 protein included, signaling the entrance of the circuit into the second state after a sufficient quantity of CI has been produced.
State 3
State three is triggered by the introduction of LacI, which is produced in the second state of the bi-stable switch. In the following graph it is visible how the introduction of Light (it is clear when the light is on by the presence of LovTAP*, in green) switches from state 1 to state 2, and how the termination of that light switches the cell to state three. Notice that state 2 remains active even when state 3 is activated.
State 4
State 4 is triggered through our AND gate, which is adopted from the PKU 2009 iGEM team. When the light is turned on for the second time, we expect to enter our fourth state. However, as we can see from the below graph (S1 is yellow, S2 is black, S3 is blue, S4 is green) we actually enter state 4 BEFORE state 3.
This is a problem with the biological functions underlying our circuit. We have traced this problem to the fact that our hybrid LacI inducible / Mnt repressible promoter that we were using is not sufficiently repressed by Mnt to prevent activation of the fourth state, which is then magnified through our AND gate.
Caveats
Despite our lack of solid parameters based on our own experimental data, we were able to find several issues with our circuit design with parameters based on literature and estimated.
State 4 before State 3
Firstly, we find that our circuit enters state 4 before state 3. Using the information from our model, we were able to trace this problem to a lack of sufficient repression of the Mnt-repressable promoter by Mnt.
To verify this, we simply artificially increased the binding affinity of Mnt to the Mnt-repressable promoter in our model, which means we decreased the K_d. In the result, which is below, we can see that our hypothesis was indeed correct and this in this situation state 4 (green) occurs after state 3 (blue), although it appears as though expression of S3 is limited by this.

Uppsala,2015,Team:Uppsala#Results enz_-_-_TEXT.html," an already existing biobrick and supplemented further characterization of wild type CueO ( BBa_K863006 ) when it is compared with ModLac. The new biobrick that we have designed has additional properties that makes it easier to manipulate than the wild type with simple tools in biotechnology.
Ion-exchange chromatography
During the purification of the modified laccase, we tried using an ion-exchange column since the IMAC results was unsatisfying. However, to verify which fraction contained the CueO D439A/M510L mutant we used the Nanodrop and SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE showed that the fractions didn’t contain any protein of significance (Figure 12) and the NanoDrop showed some clearly irregular numbers. Spectrophotometric measurements of the fractions with ABTS also confirmed what the SDS-PAGE showed, there seemed to be no proteins in the fractions, or they were very diluted (Data not shown).
The SDS-PAGE (Figure 13) showed that we did not manage to purify the CueO D439A/M510L mutant, though the NanoDrop results shows that there should be 11 g/ml of the protein.  The SDS-PAGE and Nanodrop relative to each other we can establish that the NanoDrop results are unreliable.
The results clearly showed that it’s not CueO D439A/M510L mutant in the SDS-PAGE. The NanoDrop results can be discarded since 11g/mL also it not an accurate result of the protein concentration, by itself and compared to the SDS-PAGE results.
The error sources could be many but when going through the method of choice; there is an obvious error in the pH of the buffer. The theoretical isoelectric point of CueO D439A/M510L mutant is 6.5 and the buffers pH differs med +0.2. This is not a sufficient pH for making the CueO D439A/M510L mutant negatively charged. This however may not be the only source of error. No protease inhibitor was used during the experiment, thus the proteins could also have been degraded.
The IEC is an anion exchange column and was used earlier with good results. It was also thoroughly washed and equilibrated with the mixed buffer.
The probable source of error is the buffer. The SDS-PAGE (Figure 13)results showed that it can be carbonic anhydrase (Can), that is produced during stress and starvation in the BL21DE3 strain and has a pI of 6.4. The overnight had been in the cold room for some time and"

Results of Transformation
Redo of the transformation using Tuesday's protocol seemed to work, presence of large growth of individual colonies formed on the plates.  1:1 dilutions showed expansive lawn growth of colonies, whereas the 1:10 dilution showed growth of fewer, but larger colonies.  1:!0 dilutions showed little to no colony formation, suggesting higher transformation effect in the 1:10 range.  Images of plates will be posted via Benchling.
For each of the devices, 4 colonies were picked from the three ligation 1:1 plates.  Each colony was circled and labeled, as showing the plate group below.
To screen for proper insert size and presence, colony PCR was conducted using RedTaq master mix and VF2/VR primers.  The following protocol was used.
First, each colony was picked and suspended in 50 uL of sterile LB using a sterile tip.  The suspension was left at RT during the day to later be used to inoculate overnight cultures of sequencing and stocking.

What was your responsability during this project?
In the project, I took part of the group in charge of the entrepreneurial part. I was brought to meet many people to familiarize myself with this aspect of the project. I also took part in the manipulations during the summer with the other members of the team
What did you learn from this experience?
During the preparation for the competition, I learned many things from a scientific point of view. In fact, I discovered many tools and synthetic biology techniques. I also learned a lot about starting a business and how to complete a project.
To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
This experience allowed me to understand the difficulty of setting up a project and so the difficulty of the engineer work. Nevertheless it confirmed my desire to work in applied research in my future life.
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
I think that biotechnology are essentials for improving the human life quality. Nevertheless, I think we must be vigilant with the excesses. Especially from an environmental point of view, we must be careful not to disseminate modified strains in the wild.
Marion Toanen
Why did you take part in iGEM?
I wanted to join the iGEM team in Toulouse for many reasons, the main one is to participate to a human adventure and the scientific dimension that goes with it. Moreover iGEM led us to work in many disciplines that we are not used to practice such as business or social commitments and I liked this diversity aspect.
What was your responsability during this project?
I was accountable for the Human Practice part of the project with Jean. The parts I loved to set up iwere the interventions in schools and the organization of the different events to which we participated!
What did you learn from this experience?
I learned a lot of things from this project, especially on a scientific level. I was able to learn to develop a scientific project from A to Z within a team while being a student, it's crazy! When I see where we started and the work we have done to get the results today I am proud of our team.
To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
Although I really like synthetic biology, this project taught me that the many hours of laboratory were not made for me... But the other entrepreneurial aspects of the topic and the social commitments that we were able to do allowed me to know what scientific ways are more suited for me!
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?

Carnegie_Mellon,2014,Team:Carnegie Mellon#Fish_-_-_TEXT.html," or not they are feminized. The chance for a male fish to be feminized is captured by the   formula below:
The RNG then generates a floating point number between 0 and 1.0. If said number is less than the feminization   chance of a particular male fish, then that particular male fish will become feminized. Thus fish with high   amounts of estrogen accumulated in their body (representing a prolonged exposure to estrogen) and placed in a   very estrogenic environment will have a high chance of becoming feminized.  The reproduction function for both the fish and birds follow the same exact principles (they differ in only the   parameters they use). The fish reproduction function will be explained below, and the reasoning will be the   exact same for the bird reproduction function.  Essentially each female fish that is above the reproduction age will call a reproduction function that uses RNG   to determine whether or not it successfully creates offspring. The chance that a female reproduces is based on   the following formula below:
Thus the chance any female can successfully reproduced varies as a function of the number of fertile males of   reproduction age. If there are only a few males in the lake relative to the size of the lake, adding more males   will greatly increase the chance that the eggs of a female are fertilized. Conversely if there are a large number of   males in the lake additional males will not really affect the rate at which eggs are fertilized. The constant fish- find-egg represents the number of males after which additional males will not greatly affect the rate at which   eggs are fertilized.
Results
The most important thing to take away from the model is how fickle the organisms at the top of the food chain  are to changes in the chemical composition of the water. Even though the estrogen directly affects the fish by   feminizing them, the birds are the species which are more prone to dying out first if the estrogen level is too   high as they are highly responsive to even slight dips in the population of their food source, due to the fact that   they are a trophic level higher than the fish.
Scenario 1: No Estrogen Added
The above video represents the ecosystem with no estrogen in the water.
If there is no estrogen added, the ecosystem is in dynamic equilibrium. Essentially the ecosystem follows the classic predator prey relationship described in the section titled 'Outline'.
Scenario 2: Low Concentrations of Estrogen (ppt 0 – 20)
The above video represents the ecosystem after 20 ppt estrogen is added to the water.

Short introduction
“The sea is everything. […] The sea is the vast reservoir of Nature. The globe began with sea, so to  speak”, Nemo said while the “Nautilus” was cruising with a school of hammerhead sharks deep  beneath the waves.
And the captain was right. Deep in the ocean billions of years ago the miracle of nature took place as  a pool of small molecules evolved to self-replicating lifeforms. The flagship role in this development  was probably taken by the most versatile class of molecules in the history of life: RNA.
Seemingly random nucleotides happened to be in the right order to form the first biocatalysts that  made life on the blue planet possible. Today we know those miracles of nature as ribozymes. Inspired  by this, humanity took evolution into their own hands to create aptamers – nucleic acids capable of  encaging molecules. This allows for the detection of virtually anything. Still this process has been  tedious and time consuming much like fishing with a rod in an ocean. We want to revolutionize this  former evolutionary process and want to make it swift like a shark tracking down its prey.
Yet to really bring out the strengths of these simple yet powerful molecules just comprised of A, U, C  and G we want to combine aptamers and ribozymes to create a toolset for the synthetic biologist to  create allosteric ribozymes able to sense a variety of molecules. Therefore, we hope to introduce the  true origins of life and the capabilities of functional RNA to iGEM.
Join us as we sail forth into new  waters"

modelling and simulation
Replication of E.coli cell
Model written in SBML format is shown below. The dynamic curve of E.coli replication is plotted by time course simulation. Exactly speaking, dynamic behaviors of biological system are meaningless after 4000s because of termination of reproduction of E.coli. However, the curve is in qualitative agreement with that from experiments in the first and second stage of reproduction of E.coli.

Basic example with pLac-LacI repression system
introduction
MoDeL provides poweful supports for description of interactions between two species. No interactions exist in the previous example. In this example, we will construct a plasmid backbone with promoter, rbs, coding sequence and terminator inserted in and transform it into E.coli. LacI repressor are produced after two steps of transcription and translation. It binds with itself to form a dimer and then a tetramer, which could bind with promoter LacI on the plasmid to repress the process of transcription. Besides, replication of E.coli cells, degradation of proteins and mRNAs, as well as dilution due to replication of cells, are also considered.
database construction
Actually, it is a complex molecular process and takes many steps to complete a transcription reaction. It includes binding and initiation, elongation, and termination. So does translation reactions. The first version of MoDeL DOES NOT support transcription and translation reaction templates and they will be handled by our core program of iGame and thus no need to write in the database.
All binding reactions in the database demo are modeled using law of mass action. They are dimerization of two LacI repressors and that of two LacI dimers. LacI tetramers will bind with promoter LacI in the plasmid and thus repressing the expression of plasmid DNAs. However, MoDeL enables any mathematical model form for species-species interactions and is not constrained within only law of mass action. Users could change the reactants, modifiers, products, as well as kinetic laws arbituarily and validate their models via output of dynamic curves.
Species reaction templates are worth mentioning to show features of our new language MoDeL. It is never a easy problem to calculate degradation rates of proteins since different parts in a fused protein may have different degradation rates and the"
USTC_Software,2009,Team:USTC Software#hoWAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html,", i.e.,
<math>\int_{0}^{1}f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{n}}(x_{i_{1}},x_{i_{2}},...,x_{i_{l}})dx_{s}=0, s\in{i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{l}}</math>
Using the orthobonality property of the RS-HDMR component functions, it can be proven that the total variance of <math>f(x)</math> caused by all input variables sampled uniformly over their full range may be decomposed in to distinct input contributions in the following manner.
<math>\begin{align} \sigma_{\bar{f}}^{2} &= \int_{K^{n}}[f(x)-\bar{f}]^{2}dx \\ &= \sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_{0}^{1}f_{i}^{2}(x_{i})dx_{i}+\sum_{1\leq i< j \leq n} \int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}f_{ij}^{2}(x_{i},x_{j})dx_{i}dx_{j}+... \\ &= \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sigma_{i}^{2}+\sum_{1\leq i< j \leq n}\sigma_{ij}^{2}+... \\ \end{align}\,\!</math>
Thus, the total variance <math>\sigma_{\bar{f}}^{2}</math> is the sum of first-order variances <math>\sigma_{i}^{2}</math> , second-order covariances <math>\sigma_{ij}^{2}</math> , etc. The magnitudes of the indices <math>\sigma_{i}^{2}</math>, <math>\sigma_{ij}^{2}</math> reveal how the output uncertainty is influenced by the input uncertainties and the nature of the cooperativities that exist. The direct determination of the component functions of RS-HDMR at different values in the unit hypercube by Monte Carlo integration can require a large number of random samples. To reduce the sampling effort, the RS-HDMR component functions may be approximated to any desired level of accuracy by either analytical approximation or numerical approximation. In our code, we implement the former approximation, which approximate the RS-HDMR component function by expansion in terms of a suitable set of functions. Specifically, orthogonal polynomials \cite{paper7}"
Kyoto,2018,Team:Kyoto#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," solve the environmental problems of salt damage by fixing salt-absorbing yeast on a column and applying it to a practical field. As a result, we finally reached the following desalination system.
First, we supposed to install our system on mild salt-damage farmlands where agriculture is somehow being carried out, to try to prevent further salt accumulation. Then, wastewater containing salt will be collected through drainage equipment such as underdrains, passed through a column set with fixing yeasts, and desalinated so that drainage can be reused as clean water. In addition, we chose dry areas for the installation of our system. This is because serious salt damage occurs in irrigated agriculture in arid areas, and our system, which can conserve water, also attribute to an alleviation of water shortage in arid areas.
3 Integrated Human Practice regarding progress of project
Similar to the circumstances of reconfiguring project objectives and consideration of safety equipment discussed above, dialogue with a number of experts were involved in the progress of our laboratory work. In what follows, we will show how our project has changed by feedback from each expert.
3-1 Zygosaccharomyces rouxii
Dr. Watanabe, a specialist in soy sauce yeast, taught us various important information about Zygosaccharomyces rouxii. As we mentioned in Human Practice section, the direct reason why we introduced ZrGPD1 and ZrFPS1 gene in parts used for subsequent devices is that we confirmed the salt-tolerance of soy sauce yeast by our experiments based on the information from professor Watanabe.
We give great thanks to Dr. Watanabe's lecture because without it we couldn’t culture soy sauce yeast nor analysis genome information.
3-2 mutant strain of yeast
Professor Uozumi is an expert who has analyzed salt tolerance by introducing plant genes into budding yeast. We got advice from Prof. Uozumi to select the budding yeast mutant needed for our device. As a result, we got a clue on the yeast strain to be used and additionally got the information about the strain G19, which is a yeast mutant that absorbs the salt very well. Although this G19 strain could not be used directly for our device due to the limited number selective markers, we aimed to create yeast mutants which have similar genotype by ourselves with the aim of the making the similar type of strain G19.

IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," in the field of Electrical Engineering.We got the survey filled by the students who attended our workshops in NEN sessions and schools since we wanted the students to fill our survey carefully after attending our workshop.It was filled out by 85 NEN students and 196 School going students.The Survey for Researchers was made out to be slightly more technical and was filled by 16 Researchers of our Institute.  The conclusion from our survey was definitely not as pleasant as we would have wanted it to be, but wasn't surprising as well.While a majority of students had not even heard of Synthetic Biology before we gave them a workshop, the response to our workshops stood in stark contrast to it.A special mention to the students of DAV Public school, Sector 14, Gurugram whose response to our workshop was way beyond our expectations and it really showed us the difference our workshop had made.As for Researchers, while only some of them knew about Biological Oscillators, most of them were interested in integrating their field of research with synthetic biology

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," of our protein had worked out and which parameters are needed to model the effects of the incoporation of our amino acid DMNB-serine.
The iGEM Team Technion did a lot of work when they tried to model our photocaged subtilisin E and to confirm the idea of inactivating our protease with the help of the unnatural amino acid DMNB-serine. In the beginning of their collaboration part the iGEM Team Technion met with Prof. Meytal Landau from the faculty of biology at the Technion. She gave them some useful information and hints about visualization software and how a protein could be modelled with the help of this software. Afterwards they tried to draw our photocaged aminio acid with the help of the software Chemdraw. Unfortunately they were not able to draw our amino acid because of its complex structure. So the iGEM Team Technion  contacted Einav Tayab-Fligelman with a request for assistance to draw our unnatural amino acid. In the next step the iGEM Team met with Dr. Fabian Glaser and asked him for assistance with the prediction of the final fold of the subtilisin and on how the folding process is influenced by our protease. He told the iGEM Team Technion, that it would be impossible to receive a credible result for the fold of our protease within the two months left in the iGEM project. Because of the time being the limiting factor, Dr. Glaser suggested to write a document, which describes the steps for an exhaustive computational work, including some insights from the comparison of the structures. The iGEM Team Technion sent us this document in the middle of September and because of this document we were able to assess the theoretical aspects of our project. Moreover members of the iGEM Team Technion created a 3D visualization of the subtilisin and the photocaged serine. In the document they included some scientific remarks of Dr. Fabian Glaser. In this context we want to thank the iGEM Team Technion, Prof. Meytal Landau and Dr. Glaser for all their support and their help in this collaboration. The document of the iGEM Team Technion and all their conversations with different experts from their university gave us a chance to confirm the theoretical idea of our project and recognize the influences of our photocaged amino acid in the folding process of subtilisin E. The counterpart of this collaboration can be seen on iGEM Technion Israel's wiki .

Positive control to OD600 = 0.35 in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth (LB) with antibiotic at 37 C
Inhibitor to OD600 = 0.35 in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth with antibiotic at 37 C
Negative control to OD600 = 0.35 in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth at 37 C
Target overnight (16 hours) in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth with antibiotic at 37 C (Target OD600 is not important)
Mix inhibitor (or control) and target cell at a ratio of 10:1 (determined through concentration relation listed below) in LB without any antibiotic
Multiply the Mass Attenuation Constant for the bacteria with the reading obtained from the OD600 to get the cellular density of the target, use this to prepare a 10:1 ratio of inhibitor to target cells.
Incubate at 37 C at 225 rpm while plating samples at 0 and 4 hours after mixing
Plate ten-fold serial dilutions from 1:1 up to 1,000,000 (experimentally determine which dilutions are best for your needs) in a M9 salt solution or SOC

Count Colony Forming Units per mL of the co-culture
Choose plates that haven’t formed lawns, you want easy to identify colonies ideally
Count the number of colonies on that plate (choose a dilution in which all three co-cultures can be counted)
Divide the number of colonies by the dilution factor to get the number of CFUs
Divide that value by the fraction of mLs plated to get CFUs/mL
Compare the CFUs of the inhibitor with the positive and negative control to determine if the inhibitor properly inhibits the target strain"

To test complementation with our biobrick ( BBa_K1951008 ), strains were stabbed into soft (0.3%) LB agar plates, and incubated at 37°C for 4 hours. Three strains are shown: Escherichia coli W3110 wild-type strain, which has a good swimming capacity (lower right); a fliC deletion mutant of W3110 (lower left); and the fliC mutant complemented with BBa_K1951008 (top).
Electron microscopy of the flagella
This check the flagella assembly and the integration of the flagellin protein expressed from our biobrick BBa_K1951008 we have observed bacteria with an electron microscope.
The image shows mutiple polar flagella in an E. coli fliC deletion mutant containing our biobrick. We saw that these cells had more flagella than wild-type (W3110) cells. The experiments suggest the functionality of our biobrick even if this experiment need a proper negative control i.e. a deletion mutant with no flagella in order to prove effect of our biobrick.

Improvement of FliC E. coli BBa_K1463604
This biobrick is an improvement on the biobrick designed by the Glasgow 2014 team. BBa_K1463604
The improvement of this part is multiple.
First there is no mutation in the promotor or RBS of our part so the flagellin is well expressed and functional. Unfortunately when the Glasgow team trie to make this part they picked up a mutation in the promotor.
Second the sequence that we have used it a synthetic gene with codon optimisation, designed specifically for high level expression in E. coli. Thus as an expression part is improved over the initial design.
Third in the functional swimming assay, we see evidence for improved swimming (denser halo), in cells expressing our biobrick, a phenotype not observed by the Glasgow team in 2014.

WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the units for maximum ATP are tied to biomass; therefore the maximum ATP value for nitrogen fixing E. coli is  actually much lower, not higher, than the wild type values.
Mass balance constraints are imposed on each metabolite using the stoichiometric coefficients of each metabolic reaction and the assumption that the organism is in the logarithmic growth phase (i.e. its metabolic fluxes are at steady state). This assumes that the total amount of any compound being produced is equal to the total amount being consumed. Upper and lower bounds are also applied to constrain the maximum fluxes based on the directionality of the reactions.
(from Orth et al) [1]
Linear programming is then used to identify the flux distribution throughout the model in order to maximize the flux through the biomass equation, subject to the previously defined constraints.
Our modeling hypothesis:
How can we use genome scale modeling and flux balance analysis to optimize nitrogenase activity in vivo?
The key limiting factors of the nitrogenase reaction are ATP and reduced flavodoxin. Therefore, our analyses focused on ways to either produce or provide more of these essential metabolites to the nitrogen fixing cell.
How?
Looking for potential gene overexpressions which lead to increased production of intracellular reduced flavodoxin and ATP
Looking for potential gene knockouts which redistribute flux, decreasing ATP consumption or leading to increased production of reduced flavodoxin
Determining which supplemental metabolites lead to the largest increases in reduced flavodoxin and ATP production
Problem Formulations:
Where Sij is the stoichiometric coefficient for metabolite i in reaction j, vj,min and vj,max are the minimum and maximum flux values for reaction j, vj is the flux value of reaction j, N is the number of metabolites, and M is the number of reactions.
What we did
The math behind it
Maximizing Biomass
In general, FBA can be formulated to maximize the biomass (growth) of an organism.
Maximize vbiomass
Subject to:
Coupling flavodoxin production to biomass production
With the goal of supplying the maximum amount of ATP and reduced flavodoxin to the nitrogenase reaction, a major part of our analysis involved performing all single and double gene knockouts in the model and iteratively retrieving FBA results for each.  We aimed to find instances in which flavodoxin production was coupled to biomass.
Maximize vflavodoxin
Subject to:
Performing flux range analysis
While FBA only produces one optimal solution when multiple valid optima may exist, FVA (flux variability analysis) reveals the entire optimal solution space and provides flux ranges for"
Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," their use in Gram-positive organisms. Secondly, since these promoters have been well documented in E. coli they could give a good indication of the strength of the Clostridial promoters when used in E. coli.
Occasionally cloning dCas9 in E. coli can be problematic, potentially due to unwanted off-target effects of the protein, the DNA binding nature of the enzyme or due to the size of the gene itself. To facilitate cloning and yet maximise dCas9 activity in C. difficile the ideal promoter would have low expression in E. coli and yet high expression in C. difficile. The choice of promoters and decision to assay them in both E. coli and C. difficile was designed to help us choose the optimal promoters for the toxin suppression projects, characterise existing iGEM registry parts in novel contexts and add  potentially valuable Clostridial/Gram-positive promoters to the registry. Two different assays were chosen to assess the promoters described above. In E. coli, a GFP assay was chosen due to its widespread use, ease, cost, precision and reliability. However, GFP assays have not been successfully used in Clostridia, due to the requirement of oxygen for GFP, and as such other reporter assays are commonly used. One such reporter assay is the GusA assay in which the expression of the reporter gene gusA can be accurately measured via the eventual release of a fluorescent compound 4-methylumberlliferone (4-MU). The assay relies on the fact that the protein encoded by gusA is a glucuronidase which converts the non-fluorescent 4-methylumberlliferyl glucuronide (4-MUG) into the fluorescent (4-MU).
GusA assays can be performed in E. coli as well as Clostridia and so both GFP and GusA assays were used in E. coli. Our GFP assay was inspired by our InterLab experience as we thought it would be useful to use the protocols and calibration curves we obtained from the study to standardise our data. This would help us give context to the strength of the promoters by comparing them to the InterLab positive and negative controls, using the calibrations curves generated through our InterLab study to ensure that the results would be reproducible by any other laboratory using different equipment.

The goal of our project was to find stress using mammalian synthetic biology. And we found it.
Figure 1. The image on the top left corner shows the induction of MT1 construct by H2O2. The image on the top right shows the induction of MT1 construct by CuSo4.       the image on the bottom left shows the Michaelis-Menten fit for the induction of MT1 construct by H2O2.the image on the bottom right shows the Michaelis-Menten fit for the induction of MT1 construct by H2O2.
t.   From our processed data, we found that Metallothionein 1 (MT1) had a high quality induction curves, so we selected this construct as our proof of concept. From the induction curve of copper sulfate against Metallothionein 1, we can see a well defined induction curve. We took this data and fit it into our Michaelis-Menten model of saturation kinetics to determine the sensitivity of our promoter constructs.
After maximum expression, as concentration of copper sulfate increases, expression decreases. We hypothesize that this is due to the cells dying at higher concentrations of chemical of concern.
From literature review, we found that the relevant cytotoxicological dose for copper sulfate is less than 1.3 parts per million, which is equivalent to 6.25 uM [1].
First, allow us to define some parameters from our model: Kstimulus is our michaelis-menten constant, which for our project is used as a measure of the sensitivity of our promoters. Vmax is the maximum reaction velocity, and in the context of our project, Vmax gives us maximum EGFP expression. Kstimulus is the concentration at which EGFP expression is one half of maximum expression.
From our curve-fit data, we found our Kstimulus value to be 0.2784 uM. This implies that our promoter construct is approximately "

DnaK
DnaK is composed by two domains, the N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and the C-terminal substrate binding domain. The bound and hydrolysis of ATP cause great conformational changes on DnaK. The closed form containing ADP has stable interactions     with substrate, opposite to the opened form containing ATP. It was demonstrated as well in vitro as in vivo the cooperation between ClpB and DnaK to disaggregate and reactivate insoluble protein clumps (GLOVER et al., 1998).
IbpA/IbpB
sHsps (small heat shock proteins) are molecular chaperones that binds to still not folded proteins, keeping them in a proper state to be folded. Two elements of this family, IbpA and IbpB are present in E. coli. The cooperation between these two molecules     is essential to avoid proteic aggregation (STÓZECKA et al., 2012). By their disposal as an operon, and acting together, they will be cloned together. The original sequence from E. coli does not have restriction sites for the restriction enzymes necessary     to the assembly pattern.

Overview
What makes S-Din work are the clever algorithms behind it. Our modelling team uses many techniques e.g. Machine Learning, ODE to develop the Recommendation System and the Simulation System which help S-Din achieve state of the art performance.
Recommendation System
Introduction
The users of our software are all innovative researchers on Synthetic Biology, who are interested in many different biological fields. The purpose of our system is to recommend most related genetic parts to the users based on the research interest the users offer to our system.
The information that we use to make recommendation is a database built by NLP and Random Walk which contains scores between each key word and each genetic part. Formally, it is a n * m matrix A, where n is the number of key words and m is the number of parts. The element at row i, column j is the score between the ith keyword and jth genetic part, which reflects the connection between them(higher score means higher connection).
The overall strategy of our system is Collaborative Filtering , i.e. we first search the similar key words in our database of the unknown word offered by users and then recommend the genetic parts which are highly related to key words that we found to the users.
A natural question is how to find the most similar key words in our dataset of a given unknown word in an accurate and efficient way? Here is our general solution : To quantify the semantic similarities between words accurately ,we use technique in Deep Learning to convert words into numerical vectors and the cosine similarities between each vectors can represents the semantic similarities between words. To search the similar key words efficiently, we use the KD Tree Algorithm, a fast algorithm based on binary tree, to implement the K Nearest Neighbors strategy"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," be made public, as this internal disclosure does not provide actual protection on the intellectual property. This meant that it still had to be protected against publication at this stage. As a team we had to decide that we can not communicate the idea to the public unless it has been decided if a patent will be pursued. We soon were invited to meet with Justin Kok, a patent officer from TU Delft, to further discuss the invention and so that he could assess whether it would meet the requirements for a patent application. Upon his approval, the next step could be taken, which was writing the patent.
How was the patent application written?
The writing of the patent application happened in close correspondence with an assigned patent attorney, who was responsible for taking our scientific input and write it in the format of a strong patent application. The legal text of a patent indeed is very different from a scientific text, and quite mind-twisting.
Who owns the patent?
Before the final document is sent it must be clarified who the owners of the patent will be. In our case, the employers of the inventors (TU Delft and NWO) share ownership rights, meaning that the inventors would not have to contribute to the costs of the patent application. As one of the students was also an inventor, things got a little more complicated. When students are involved as inventors in patent applications, they either have to sign to transfer their IP rights to the university, or they should contribute to the costs that come with the filing of our patent. In our case, the student involved chose to sign the transfer of IP rights. This means that the institutions TU Delft and NWO are the owners of the patent once granted, and that the institution will have exclusive rights regarding its licensing and selling. On October 20th, one week before the Judging Form deadline and twelve days from the Wiki-Freeze, the patent application was filed by the attorney and official confirmation of reception was given by the Dutch patent centre. From that moment on we were free to communicate our findings with the public.
Interest from industy
The farm animal sector is committed to reduce of the use of antibiotics. To realize that ambition, our detection system can help. We have presented our detection system to Hendrix Genetics . Hendrix Genetics is a multi-species animal breeding organization that invests in innovation to improve the sustainability of animal protein value chains. This includes systems to reduce the use of antibiotics. After the Giant Jamboree we will continue discussion with Hendrix Genetics on the use of our detection systems in their programs.

Micropipetting
1) Choose the right pipet for the amount of liquid you want to transfer. You should choose the smallest pipet capable of transferring the amount of liquid you desire. (If you want to transfer 185 uL you should use the pipet with a 200 uL maximum volume NOT the pipet with a 1000 uL maximum volume).
2) Set the desired amount on the side of the pipet by twisting the knob on the top of the pipet. Be careful where the decimal point is located on the display as this varies depending on the size of the pipet. The decimal"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#pTet_-_-_TEXT.html,". aTc is a derivative of tetracycline, tetp’s native inducer, which has shown stronger binding affinity to TetR (Gossen & Bujard, 1993). On top of that, it has also exhibited much lower antibiotic activity on Escherichia coli (Oliva, Gordon, McNicholas, Ellestad, & Chopra, 1992), making it a more suitable inducer for our Tristable Switch system.
Mechanism of tetp - TetR - aTc Interaction
Figure 2. Behaviour of TetR in the presence/absence of aTc
In the absence of aTc, TetR would bind to tetp, inhibiting transcription and thus bringing mTagBFP expression to a halt. In the presence of aTc, however, TetR would lose the ability to bind to tetp, allowing transcription to proceed, resulting mTagBFP expression.

RIP secretion : BBa_K2616001
To easily measure the effect of RNAIII Inhibiting Peptide (RIP) on Staphylococcus aureus, we designed an initial construct allowing us to simply produce RIP after IPTG induction. Thus, we designed a part containing a T7 promotor followed by a ribosome binding site (RBS) and a signal sequence for secretion fused to the RIP sequence upstream of the coding sequence.
Figure 2: Schematic diagram of BBa_K2616001
Eight different secretion systems have currently been identified in Escherichia coli, and more generally in Gram-negative bacteria [4]. Type I and type II secretion systems are the most commonly used for secretion of recombinant proteins. We chose to use Type II to secrete RIP [1]. Type II secretion system is a two-steps system: proteins are first exported to the periplasmic space, between E. coli’s two membranes, and then secreted in the medium [1].
We target RIP to the periplasm using the Sec-dependent secretion system [4] [5]. Our peptide is fused to an amino-terminal signal sequence that gets recognized by the chaperone SecB, then addressed to SecA and then translocated across the inner membrane through the SecYEG complex. One advantage of this system is that the signal sequence gets cleaved during translocation through SecYEG [4]. Several different signal sequences have been characterized (all formed of 18 to 30 amino acids) [5]. Following the advice of Dr. Jean-Michel Betton, Research Director in the Structural Biology Department at the Institut Pasteur, we decided to try two different signal sequences to export our peptides to the periplasm: MalE and DsbA[1] [6] [7]. Once in the periplasm, due to the small size of RIP (7 amino acids), a leaky release through the outer membrane of the bacteria should allow us to obtain RIP in the medium [8].

iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

Biofilms
Biofilms are a way in which single-celled organisms can act in a multicellular manner through cooperation. They are strongly resistant to antimicrobials (Donlan and Costerton 2002), which means that combating them is an important step in the fight against healthcare-associated infections, which have many times been shown to be associated with medical devices or surgical sites that are colonized by biofilms (Abdallah et al. 2014), which are thought to be causative (Akers et al. 2015). Biofilms are also the primary source—and a persistent one—of food product contamination (Abdallah et al. 2014).
Biofilms are largely made up of an extracellular matrix that is produced by the organisms. The matrix composes 90% of the biomass in a given biofilm, and is made up of extracellular polymeric substances, carbohydrate-binding proteins, pili, flagella, adhesive fibers, and extracellular DNA (Kostakioti et al. 2013).
Biofilm formation occurs in steps. The first step is introduction of bacteria to a surface, which is followed by the second step, adhesion. Motile bacteria have an advantage in this step; flagella allow bacteria to overcome forces that might otherwise prevent attachment (Kostakioti et al. 2013). Other extracellular appendages, and adhesins secreted by the bacteria, affect adhesion as well. However, initial adhesion is reversible based on repulsive or hydrodynamic forces, or the availability of nutrients. If the bacteria are capable of sticking despite those forces, they will become irreversibly attached. Irreversible attachment is facilitated by a variety of factors, including type 1 and type IV pili, curli fibers, and Antigen 43 (Kostakioti et al. 2013). Surface contact results in the up-regulation of genes that will make the bacteria become sessile—that is, anchored.
Following attachment, dispersal can occur. Dispersal can be passive (as a result of shear forces) or active, as in a bacterial response to detected environmental factors, such as oxygen levels or nutrient availability. Occasionally dispersal can occur in other ways;"

That is why we discussed the importance of         organizing seminars, lectures to school children in order for them to have a wider outlook         on the gene technology as well as other innovative biology related fields
From the practical part of work they have suggested that we could perform         transformations of our plasmids into different species of yeast in order to compare the         efficiency.
Collaboration with OUC iGEM team
In the end of July, the OUC iGEM team from China reached out to us with a collaboration request. We immediately agreed to collaborate with them and translated their creative comic book about synthetic biology into Estonian and Russian languages.
Collaboration with Tec CEM team
Later in July, we contacted Tec CEM iGEM team. During a video call we discussed our projects, current progress and further plans. Moreover, we discussed their ""Labs Like Me"" video collaboration request and enjoyed participating in it!

In the beginning of August, we contacted Hebrew University iGEM team from Israel in         order to discuss our collaboration ideas. They agreed to make a survey for us about the         sunscreen usage by the Google form and from our side we did a research about TCDD         polluted areas in Estonia and together we analyzed information regarding exposure of the         material in Estonia. On 5th of September our team participated in their livestream         conference about the latest news of synthetic biology. Our team enjoyed the lecture and         further interactive discussion with professor Jonathan Gressel a lot!

In the beginning of July we reached out to Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team from Finland. As the idea of their project was to produce proteins, which already have colours and use those dyes to dye materials we noticed, that both of our project ideas can be applied in cosmetics field. After a video conference we had several creative ideas on how to potentially combine our projects:
Hair protection from UV light by including sun protecting compounds which can be included in the dye.
Combining our sunscreen and Aalto-Helsinki’s dye in order to distinguish whether a               person still has a sunscreen on or not - if the skin is coloured then the sunscreen is still               present and if not, then it’s removed"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
The algorithm of species matching is of the most importance since it provides technical support for structure-based description of species and reactions. It costs most of the running time. We will try to increase the efficiency of the codes of this part.
Generation of products based on reaction templates
Within MoDeL definitions, product templates are composed of both ST parts and NST parts. The ST parts are all transfered from reactants or modifiers. A transfer table is defined in each reaction template to label where does each ST part comes from and goes to. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, X-A-B-Y, where A and B are both NST parts and X and Y are both ST parts with type ANY. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be X-A and B-Y. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products are connected by the tree node. To generate the structure of products correctly, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.
Mixing, trimming and splitting: three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched to the templates as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. For example, it may have two unbound and uncorrelated chains. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone"
SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour42_-_-_TEXT.html," means that it might be difficult to have OneProt expressed in high amounts controlled  by pTet (+/-LVA), with the TetR repressors overexpressed at present levels. However, as argued on the previous page, the levels of TetR would have to be lowered, which would probably alleviate the attenuated growth-rate.
Figure 4: Growth curves showing E. coli K12 MG1655 expressing OneProt, TetR(+LVA), TetR(no LVA), wild-type and odor-free E. coli YYC912. Because OneProt is self-designed, we wanted to test if the protein has any toxicity. To do so, we fed Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) with E. coli K12 MG1655 containing an empty vector and a vector  expressing OneProt on separate plates. On both plates, 20 C. elegans were tested. Articles recommend  using heat shock assay for 7 hours: 1 hour at 35° C followed by 1 hour at 22°C, repeated.

After approximately 5 hours no effects on C. elegans was detectable. Therefore we decided to stress C. elegans a little more, incubating them in 2 hours at 35°C followed by 1 hour at 22°C, repeated. After 7  hours, every C. elegans on both plates were alive. Thus we conclude that the strain expressing OneProt at presents levels doesn't display toxic effects on C. elegans. This suggest that there are no obvious toxic effects towards eukaryotic cells such as human cells. However, the resulst are far from conclusive, and extensive testing is necessarry to confirm this suggestion.

USTC-Software,2016,Team:USTC-Software#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," Some participants told us that solving them manually was often a harsh job and there might probably be miscalculations in the result, which was a huge cost of time. We paid attention to this demand. Therefore we asked our programmers to design the module ""Simulation"" and module ""BLAST"" which was exactly made for those who want to delegate this time-consuming work to machines.
To find out whether our improvement above is useful or not, in September we packed up an alpha version distributing to schoolmates whose major is biology. We introduced them to Biohub and its basic usage. After they had used this software for a while, most of them reported that it was quite useful, so was the Module:Simulation.
While, this time several students told us that the solution function of the simulation may be unstable after a certain period of time, he wondered if we can find out the critical point which divided the stable state and the unstable one. We are convinced that it should be concerned. Thus we worked it out soon. At the second time biology students used our software, more of them approved it. Some users became optimistic on our project and expected for the issuance of a formal version.

Minipreparation of plasmids
Purpose: Minipreparation (miniprep) is done in a laboratory setting in order to extract a plasmid from bacteria. There are several different scales of executing this task, but miniprep is the smallest. The steps of the miniprep are to weaken the cell wall, lyse the cell, precipitate out the lipids and proteins, remove of any chromosomal DNA or RNA that is still present, and then wash the plasmid to make sure that all salts are removed so that only the plasmid remains. This process uses a binding column that is comprised of a silica matrix in order to bind the plasmid DNA so that any other remaining cell fragments can be washed away. This procedure follows the E.Z.N.A. plasmid DNA Mini Kit 1 from the Omega Bio-Tek company.
Vacuum Procedure:
1. A culture was inoculated and grown overnight in a shaker at 37C at 300 rpm.
2.  The culture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 minute at room temperature
3. The culture median was decanted being careful not to discard any of the cell pellet.
4.  250 µL of Solution I was added and mixed thoroughly and resuspend the pellet. *Note: Solution I is used in order to weaken the cell wall.
5. After the pellet has been resuspended, the contents were added to a microcentrifuge tube.
6. 250 µL of Solution II was added and the microcentrifuge was gently inverted until a clear lysate formed. *Note: Solution II is used in order to lyse the cell wall. Vigorous mixing was avoided to prevent DNA shearing.
7. 350 µL of Solution III was added to the microcentrifuge tube and then it was inverted several times until a white precipitate forms. *Note: Solution III is used to bind all of the proteins and lipids from the cell so that they can be removed.
8. The solution was centrifug"

Recent studies have shown that multiple organisms have the ability of metabolizing 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).             For instance, enzyme able to oxidize HMF into Furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has been discovered in fungal             species such as Caldariomyces fumago [1] or in prokaryotic species Cupriavidus basilensis (C. basilensis) [2]. and Methylovorus sp. [4].
As we intended to work with Escherichia coli (E. coli), we focused on the enzymes discovered in prokaryotes. Due to glycosylations on             the enzymes that has been found in Caldaryomyces fumago and Eukaryotes/Prokaryotes gene compatibility issue, fungal enzymes have been dismissed.             The following section describes the enzymes selected to achieve an efficient transformation of HMF into FDCA.
HmfH is an enzyme that has been discovered in C. basilensis. This enzyme is part of a gene cluster implied in furanic compound degradation. HmfH homologues             has also been found in several other bacterial species [6]. In a study, HmfH gene has been cloned into Pseudomonas putida in order to enable this bacteria to synthetize FDCA from HMF. HmfH catalyse two successive             oxidations that transform HMF into 5-(hydroxymethyl)furoic acid ( HMF acid) and then into FDCA [5] ( fig 2. ).             The modified P. putida with HmfH was able to produce FDCA without excessive amount of other furan derivatives. One issue             with this enzyme is that the second oxidation of HMF acid into FDCA is slower than the first one. It results             in the accumulation of the intermediate product, HMF acid. In fed batch culture the accumulation of intermediate             product could lead to an efficient production of high pure FDCA.
One way to compensate for that is to add other enzymes to the artificial metabolic pathway, in order to speed up             the second oxidation of H"

I Background
Scale insects like to be parasitic on many kinds of fruit trees, flowers, and crops. For example, succulent plants, apricot, and apple trees attract them a lot. Besides, the honeydew they secrete can cause sooty mould. Therefore, it is extremely important for farmers to prevent the rampancy of scale insects.
However, the way people use to kill the scale insect now is contaminant and inconvenient. The most effective method is to inject pesticide into the trunk, so when the scale insect bites the trees, they would be killed. However, chemicals into their body would also let them develop resistance to pesticides, and these traditional pesticides would cause other animals’ death in the earth and pounds*1. Another method for farmers is to use contact pesticides, which can be easily applied but have to be in a great amount. Though direct and convenient, the large amount of chemicals into the environment would cause damage to the trees surface*2. In order to bring convenience and safe to farmers, we decided to develop a bio-safe contact pesticide, which makes the pests-controlling process faster, stronger and better.
Background Diagram
II Introduction
Our thought of this project comes from the basic structure of the scale insect. Scale insects vary in appearance, but the common thing is that they all secrete a waxy coating as their “armor”. According to other research*3, the thick shell of the insect is made of three different kinds of material: a layer of wax, a layer of chitin, and a layer of protein. These substances compose the harsh shell of the scale insect.
Without its shell as a protection, scale insects would find it difficult to make a living in the harsh environment, or at least, a little amount of pesticides is able to kill it. Therefore, we put forward our solution: decomposing the layers of scale insect with natural, safe enzymes.
In our project, we tested our enzymes which were transformed into E. coli and proved that they function well in degrading the shell. However, after we contacted some experts[], we realized that these enzymes may also cause harm to the plants. Thus, we developed a system to let the bacteria release pest-killing factors only when scale insect exists. Scale insect secrets sucrose (sugar) for ecological reasons. We then introduced"

As a control, we diluted the T4Do stock to 10^-6 and tested 20 uL at 45 sec intervals (up to 6 min) under UV light.
Also, we diluted the T4 mutagenized stock to 10^-6 and tested 20 uL at 45 sec intervals (up to 4 min 30 sec) under UV light.
UV tests were done by placing 20 uL spots on parafilm and placed in a BSL-2 hood with the UV light turned on.
UV test-3
Using the same procedure as for the 45 Second UV exposure set, we exposed the phage to UV in intervals of 90 seconds.
(We left the plates in the incubator for 48 hours, which caused contamination on many plates to grow.)
When checked at 24 hours, the T4 mutagenized stock had a web plate at 10^-3 and less than 5 plaques at 10^-6. This experiment will need to be redone from 10^0 down through 10^-6.  The whole mutagenesis may need to be redone if this only represents a dilution of our titer when we were trying to grow it in liquid culture.
Under UV light, the T4Do stock (diluted to 10^-6) has 19 plaques after being irradiated for six minutes (down from almost cleared at 0 min). Under UV light, the 180 sec UV plate spot (diluted in 1 mL) has a few hundred plaques on it, but the amount dropped significantly at 4 min 30 sec from when it was UV-ed for 0 min.
We will re-titer the T4-Mut stock so we can learn whether it was diluted or whether an infection worked. We will also re-run the UV test comparing the T4-Mut (10^-3) with the T4-Do stock (at 10^-6) for survivability. The mutagenized phage should survive better.
Since the loss of plaques seemed to level off for the T4Do stock at 5:15 (23 plaques) and 6 min (19 plaques), we will test a 7 min and 8 min timepoint to see if it stays level, suggesting these phage have multiple genomes and are severely mutated.

In this engineered V. Harveyi strain , diacetyl production will be produced in response to both CAI-1 or C8-CAI-1.
Figure 3: Production of diacetyl from pyruvate.
The effector organism: Pichia pastoris
The function of the third partner is to efficiently produce a killing molecule (i.e. anti-microbial peptides, AMPs) to lyse both V. cholerae and V. harveyi. This microorganism has to be resistant to the AMPs that are specific to prokaryotic cells. Therefore we chose an eukaryotic cell. Last this eukaryotic microorganism has to communicate with prokaryotic cell. Team SCUT 15 previously described a binding-receptor system involving diacetyl and a eukaryotic receptor, Odr-10 16 , 17 . It is a G Protein Coupled Receptor isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans that once activated by diacetyl, lead to the activation of the pFUS1 promoter through the endogeneous Ste12 pathway (Figure 4). For all this reasons, we chose P. pastoris as the effector organism since it already possess the ste12 pathway and is good protein producer 18 , 19 .
Figure 4: The diacetyl/Odr-10 activation cascade. 15 .
We engineered the yeast to secret the AMPs under control of the pFUS1 promotor. We choose the AMPs from crocrodiles 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 . Indeed crocodiles display a remarkable and efficient defense system, allowing the reptiles to resist to a large spectrum of bacterial infection. Thus, they produced antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) which are able to lyse bacteria such as V. cholerae. AMPs are cationic pore-forming molecules targeting bacterium membranes, causing bacterial lysis and death 24 .

Introduction
Overview
Pernicious anemia is described first by James S. Combe in 1822. Pernicious anemia is a type of anemia occurs due to malabsorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine due to problems with the production of Intrinsic Factor, which is responsible for the absorption of vitamine B12. Pernicious anemia shows its stiking effects on blood, gastro-intestinal tract and nervous system and pernicious anemia usually develops together with an autoimmune disease. Our aim as ITU MOBGAM IGEM Team, is to design a bacterium that is capable of surviving in small intestine and secreting Intrinsic Factor dependent on pH. Also, we design a genetic circuit for controlling the overgrowth and containment of bacteria.
Introduction
Geneal Information
Pernicious Anemia, which is recognized as an autoimmune disorder, is caused by atrophic damage of the gastric body mucosa in which results loss of parietal cells that express a 60-kd glycoprotein called intrinsic factor (IF). (1,2) Function of IF is binding and transporting vitamine B12 in small intestine. It is essential for the absorption of vitamine B12.(3) The main cause of pernicious anemia is vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 cannot be synthesized in the human body and it must be taken by diet. Only the animal products contain vitamin B12 and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin B12 is about 2.5 µg.  (3) Absorption of B12
The main source of vitamin B12 is daily diet. When the source vitamin B12 reach to stomach, gastric secretions digest and reveal vitamin B12 content which will bind R-binding protein (haptocorin). Vitamin B12 and R-binding protein travels through duodenum of small intestine. R-binding protein switch with intrinsic factor. Vitamin B12 is transported to terminal ileum where absorption occurs with IF. Vitamin B12-IF complex is recognized by intrinsic factor receptors on luminal membranes of ileal cells and absorbed. (2)

The iGEM Team from Virginia created a survey about synthetic biology which was also to be conducted by teams from other parts of the world. Therefore, we translated the survey into German and conducted it at our university’s open house. The survey dealt with the public awareness towards and acceptance of synthetic biology and the aim was to get an impression of how people from all ages, origins and professions think about this. We do not know the results yet, but we still hope we could make a contribution for this survey to become more representative with regard to the control sample.

1.CysDes-pLuxR-pSB1C3 construction and transformation
We obtained the sequence of CysDes gene from Genbank and synthesized this gene from IDT. We inserted this gene to plasmid pSB1C3 with promoter pLuxR on it which was provided by iGEM headquarters. The sequence of gene CysDes was validated with DNA sequencing by Sangon. We transformed this plasmid pLCys (one contains gene CysDes and promoter pLuxR) into strain BL21. Then we picked some colonies for cultivation and confirmed the transformation result by PCR (shown in Figure 1). From the result of electrophoresis, we confirmed the transformation of pLCys was a success.
Figure 1. Electrophoresis result of bacterial PCR (positive result: Cys+pLuxR-1 Cys+pLuxR-2  negative result:Cys+pLuxR-3 Cys+pLuxR-4)
2.Expression of CysDes
We inoculate 2 mL overnight culture to 200 mL LB media (1mM cysteine, 30mM glucose and 10mM HEPES are included) and cultivate for 2h at 37 ˚C. When OD600 reach 0.4-0.6, added AHL to final concentration of 250nM. After 3h cultivation, collect the bacteria by centrifugation. Then extract the raw enzyme of CysDes by ultrasonication. We run SDS-PAGE of samples of the raw enzyme, cell content obtained by 100 ˚C heating and wild type (shown in Figure 2). The protein CysDes is about 46kDa, we can find obvious bands at the about position of 45kDa which are unique to lanes of cell contents after induction and raw enzyme compared with the wild type.

Fifth meeting - Necessary properties of a ‘living machine’
In our firth meeting, we discussed about the necessary properties that a living beings needs to have in order to be considered a ‘living machine’ ([8],[10],[11],[15]). For the following meetings we decided to analyse in detail the properties of artificiality and technical functionality, as machines are usually understood as physical objects, which were intentionally produced by human beings to achieve certain goals. Only if we can justify why products of synthetic biology are artificial and why do they have a technical function, we can use the expression ‘living machine’ as a proper term.
Publications we worked with:
[15] Schark M (2012): Synthetic Biology and the Distinction between Organisms and Machines. Environ. Values 21: 19-41
Sixth meeting - Artificiality
Our inquiry of artificiality showed that we ought not to use the adjective ‘artificial’ as an honorary title.  Due to the existing continuum between the natural and the artificial (e.g. [16]), we cannot argue that something is simply natural or simply artificial. A bioengineering product is less artificial than Venter’s Synthia, which is respectively less artificial than a product of the protocell approach. All the products of synthetic biology are not simply ‘artificial life’: a bioengineering product has ‘artificial parts’, a synthetic genomics product an ‘artificial genome’ and, according to our argumentation, only the bottom-up protocell approach might be capable of producing entities, which could be meaningfully called as a whole ‘artificial life’ or ‘synthetic life’. Thus, all references to biological systems with the adjectives ‘artificial’ or ‘synthetic’ not being marked as a metaphor or as a future aim are therefore not warranted.

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

Project's background
       The area near Qiantang River has a profound history of wealth. Hangzhou, in the heart of this area, situated many astonishing lithic cultural relics. Most of them were made during The Ten Kingdoms (A.D. 891-A.D. 979) and Song Dynasty (A.D. 960- A.D. 1279). Not only do those lithic relics represent the cutting edge of stone carving technology in contemporary time,"

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#testing#Wikipage template new_-_-_TEXT.html,""") for the construction of randomized promoter libraries. We modified Assembly PCR [12] to create promoters with randomized spacing and frequency of Transcription Factor Binding Sites. It relies on using different oligos containing a transcription factor binding site (or random DNA) plus two annealing sequences (see Fig. 1 for a comprehensive explanation of the method).  We use two sets of oligos, one for the top strand, one for the bottom strand. The oligos for each strand have the same annealing sequences (which are complementary to the annealing sequences of the other strand). If these oligos are pooled, they will randomly anneal to each other, thus generating randomized repeats of the transcription factor binding sites of interest at varying spacing. In order to be able to clone the construct, we also add two stop oligos (termed stop 5' and top 3') which contain only one annealing sequence, plus a cutsite (SpeI 5', HindIII 3'). Double-stranded DNA is created by running a seven-cycle PCR, and amplified by a  25-cycle PCR. Then, the resulting (proximal) promoter is cloned 5' of a core promoter (we used the core promoter of JeT [10] ) by inserting it into pSMB_MEASURE ( Part:BBa_K203100 ), the promoter measurement plasmid we developed (from there, it can be excised like any standard biological part in a submission plasmid). Thus, a mixture of different promoters in the same plasmid backbone is generated. These can then be transformed into bacteria. Each colony represents a single putative promoter, which can be transfected into mammalian cell. 24 hours after transfection cells are exposed to the conditions of interest and control conditions, serving as a reference. Promoters active under the desired conditions, but not under control conditions, are selected for further characterization.
Please see a detailed protocol for RA-PCR below .

Generation of a library of constitutive promoters
Most efforts of obtaining such promoters focus on cloning them from nature. This approach is, in eukaryotes, flawed for three reasons: First, promoters in eukaryotic cells are very complexly regulated by a wide variety of transcription factors, and thus, pathways [1] . One is the concept of ""genetic switches"" (see [2] for a recent review)

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Human Practices#Crowdfunding_-_-_TEXT.html,", the projects and backers are much more focused which results in a fairly high rate of projects that are completely funded (in case of our search, 56% biology and science projects received full funding).
Questionnaire
In order to further analyse the crowdfunding potential of science, we approached Gregory Vincent, the founder of Sponsume, one of the crowdfunding platforms that we researched as part of our project and which was used by UCL to fund their project. We asked him several question related to crowdfunding, science, synthetic biology and iGEM.
Question 1: Do you think that scientific projects (specifically biology projects) are within the field of interest of Sponsume users?
Absolutely, particularly if these projects can appeal to the broader public. I think that's what Plastic Republic's success demonstrates.
Question 2: Can you think of any quality that distinguished UCL's Plastic Republic project from a non-scientific project?
Research and innovation to solve a problem that affects us all are probably the key qualities that distinguished the Plastic Republic project.
Question 3: Can crowdfunding sites provide an alternative, independent way of funding a scientific project?
Yes. The key variable is actually that the scientific community itself needs to become aware of the power of crowdfunding for raising funds and awareness about scientific projects.
Question 4: Can crowdfunding be a better platform for funding research with no immediate application but with future potential/just a cool idea?
It can but you will have to be able to explain to the public why it matters in simple terms, or appeal to a narrower public of more knowledgeable enthusiasts or activists.
Question 5: Do you think that DIY communities could use crowdfunding to fund their projects?
Yes, I don't see why not. In fact we will soon add tools on Sponsume aimed at facilitating co-working or co-creation on the site. We think crowdfunding can be very powerful in particular with regard to ""open source"" innovation and research (already highly developed in the world of software development).
Question 6: As Sponsume representative, do you think funding DIY biology projects could raise safety or legal issues at any point?
We would have to look at specific cases.
Question 7: Do you think that Sponsume and other crowdfunding platforms could be a good way to sponsor iGEM projects in the future?
Yes. Once again Plastic Republic have been pioneers and showed it worked.
Question 8: Do you think that crowdfunding projects will be more useful as a means of acquiring funding or as a means of widening general awareness of synthetic biology?
That's a great question! We generally stress the fact the main benefit of crowdfunding is"

Water Testing in Developing Countries
Water testing in developing countries is a problem. Most countries do some water testing, as it is required by law. However, they do not usually have the resources to test all drinking water sources. Rural areas in particular are often neglected by water testing. To be more efficient with money, countries spend most of their resources sampling and testing the water in the main pipelines that residents of the urban community use. Rural communities in developing countries do not always use pipelines, making it slightly more burdensome to have to test, so these tests can be neglected [1].  Additionally, each rural drinking water source serves a minimal amount of people, so using precious resources to benefit such a small group could seem wasteful from a budget perspective.
In the World Health Organization’s water testing guidelines, it mentions that for most water supplies, bacteriological testing should be done once initially and then only needs to be tested if the situation calls for it [2]. The situations that could require follow-up tests include, “change in environmental conditions, outbreak of waterborne disease, or increase in incidence of waterborne diseases” [2]. The issue here is that people may get sick with diseases associated with water-borne pathogens, but they may not test the water to know for sure that the water is not safe. Then, people will continue to drink unsafe water, putting them at risk of contracting a serious disease. This same problem can also happen with “improved water sources”. Improved water sources mean that they are a step up from where they were previously, but to imply that they are uncontaminated is a dangerous assumption [3].
The economic effect of water testing and providing clean water is also of high importance. A developing country’s resources can be put toward other important necessities, but then the people become less productive because they are incapacitated with illness [6]. This correlates with data suggesting that developing countries with clean water sources tend to have more economic growth than the poor countries that survive on contaminated water. In order to complete the long term goal of economic growth, one must start with clean water. Clean water will eliminate many types of sickness and keep the citizens of developing countries productive. In order to purify the water, it all starts with inexpensive testing to identify the contaminated water.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," PCB. Because UV-light is harmful to human eyes and skin, we integrated multiple safety features into our PCB design to prevent unintended exposure caused by maloperation. First of all, the latest design includes a fuse that limits the maximum amount of current drawn from the power supply. Together with the aforementioned 1 kΩ resistor at the reference pin of the PWM controller, this effectively prevents overloading mounted LEDs.
HC05 Bluetooth dongle that receives advanced settings from our android application.
In addition, a protective circuit was included to prevent the user from damaging the device and himself/herself by accidentally inverting the polarity at the power connector. The protective circuit consists of a p‑channel MOSFET connected as a perfect diode, as it is shown in the circuit diagram in the figure on the left. A p‑channel MOSFET transistor conducts current if the voltage difference between gate and source UGS is equal to or more negative than the threshold voltage Ugsth. This is only the case if the polarity at the input is correct. In case of a reversed polarity, VGS is not negative and the MOSFET conducts no current.
Furthermore, we integrated a status LED into the circuitry that is indicating that the LEDs are potentially active. This feature is working independently of the microcontroller, meaning that the LED warns the operator even in case of software failure or defects of the microcontroller. This is possible because the status LED is not controlled by the microcontroller - it is connected to the common blank pin of the LED‑controllers via a PNP transistor. The blank pin of the TLC5947 is used to reset the PWM settings of the controller. If the blank pin is high, no current can flow through the output pins of the controller. In our design, the blank pins of all four controllers are connected with each other and pulled up to VCC so that all LED are initially turned off when the power is connected. Only if blank is set to ground by the microcontroller, the LEDs can be turned on software sided.
Manufacturing & Assembly
After the final PCB design was completed and the circuitry tested, the manufacturing process began. Normally, it is necessary to search for a board manufacturer first and design the PCB in accordance with their manufacturing specifications and limitations. Because of that, we were very conservative in terms of critical design decisions like conductor line distances and diameter and the minimal drill size. This way we ensured that the PCB can be manufactured by most board houses. In our case, the PCB was kindly provided by Beta LAYOUT GmbH.

I had to go back and redefine some of the rules as well as change names (e.g. ""absDevice to absDevice1"") for permutations to be generated.  Tomorrow we will focus on generating and displaying correct Level 2 permutations on the MoClo planner.  It's really good that now the front and back ends are getting merged together!  Also, today we started planning for the CS/Math department presentation that we have to do on Friday.
Tuesday, 7/17: Kara and I sat down today and started working on generating real permutations on the MoClo planner for Level 2, with the text files that we pulled from Eugene.  We ran into some trouble when some parts of the text files were parsed incorrectly (again, the difference between ""absDevice"" and ""absDevice1"") but we successfully fixed that issue.  We tested up to 4 permutations, but not 6, which is the maximum required, according to Traci.  Also, we fixed several ""minor"", but really important issues in the long run, such as checking for duplicates in parts generates for L0, highlighting the permutations that are selected for each level, and some bugs with switching back and forth between automatically generated permutations and manually generated ones. Since tomorrow is beach day, we worked extra hard so that tomorrow can be relaxing!
Wednesday, 7/18: Beach day.  I stayed in the lab and worked on getting through the Google power search classes and generating questions for the interview with Professor Hendrickson on Friday.  Also, I modified the powerpoint presentation for Friday, and finally figured out what I should talk about for Eugene, which is used for part of the back end of the MoClo planner, and thus is not as visually ""flashy"" as some projects that are in the lab.
