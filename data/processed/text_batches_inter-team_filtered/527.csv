To confirm proper presentation of the functional domains of the receptors on the cell surface, and in order to quantify the yield of stably transfected cells we used flow cytometry analysis.  The results presented in figure 11 hereby show a positive signal in the RFP channel for cells expressing the scAvidin and the eMA receptor. As already observed in fluorescence microscopy, mRuby-fluorescence could not be detected for the BAP-receptor cells. Still - surprisingly - about 40% were positive for staining of the extracellular A3C5 epitope tag, allowing the conclusion that this epitope must be functionally presented on the cell. Furthermore, a luciferase assay utilizing the extracellularly presented nanoluciferase confirmed correct topology of the luciferase of at least a part of the receptor (data not shown). These results may suggest a problem during folding of the mRuby beta-barrel - leading to a loss of fluorescence despite of correct localization and topology of the receptor on the cell surface.  For scA and eMA cells Dy634 signal could furthermore be detected, confirming correct localization and topology.  Another stain was the eGFP coupled with biotin giving a positive signal for scA and eMA to which the biotin binds. For obvious reasons, cells expressing the BAP receptor - and thus presenting biotin - did not show any signal.

Another way to verify the succesful transfection and protein expression is given by the two epitope tags (A3C5 and Strep-tag II) that are included in the receptor design, which allow detection via Western Blot analysis. After transfecting mammalian cells with the receptor constructs and selecting them for 2 weeks on hygromycin, we lysed the cells and checked for the presence of Strep- and A3C5-tag via western blot using primary antibodies (or a Fab for A3C5) against the respective tags and secondary alkaline phosphatase-coupled antibodies (see methods). As the figure shows, the Strep-tag wasn't detectable via Western blotting - however, the A3C5-tag-WB shows significant singular bands at the size of our proteins in the respective samples. This data corresponds with the flow cytometry results again showing that the BAP receptor"

emitted from the LED light                     after                     passing the first filter in the detection system4, 11. In order to estimate the electrical                     restrictions of the detector we need the sensors photon to electron conversion efficiency `E_(FITC)`                     and                     `E_(RFP)`                     for FITC and RFP emitted photons12. When used in combination with a resistance, R, and the amount                     of                     electron, `6.241*10^18`, required for 1 ampere current we can calculate the current created from a                     specific                     concentration of antibody complexes.
`U_(conversion)` is multiplied with the molar concentration change of the antibody complexes which                     yields the                     voltage change over time.
`(dU_(senso r1))/dt=(dU_(RFP))/dt=U_(RFPconversion)*(dEAC)/dt`
The Results
By using the model described in the section “The Model” the following simulations were created using                     Wolfram SystemModeler.
When comparing the two models we can see in Figure 3 that both models could in theory achieve high                     enough voltage, `10^-6`, for the detector to be able to read the signal. The main difference, for                     our purposes, seems to be that the process of changing from epitope to Ara h 1 takes up to 3 minutes to                     reach steady state in model 2, seen in Figure 4.
In model 1 on the other hand the biological process requires only 5-6 seconds to reach steady state                     after Ara h 1 has been introduced to the system, also seen in Figure 4. The detector should                     therefore in                     theory be able to give the user results within seconds after a sample has been taken.
Furthermore, a                     molar concentration for the epitope complex of `10^-6` seems to be optimal for the system, any lower                     and                     the detections systems hardware would not be able to detect the signal, any higher and the molecules                     in                     the detector would disrupt the photon flux too much resulting in a major signal disruption.13
The simulation of the detection systems sensor output as well as the calculated voltage generated by                     FITC is show in Figure 3. By using these two sensor systems it will be possible to determine if the                     signal change is created due to a complex change or simply because more"

But you can see the behavior of the head have changed a lot. It means the blue light can still infect the muscle near the head. When the light is on, the behaviors of the worms become stiff compare to the normal worms.  At the same time, after the light is given, you can find the speed of the worm obviously slow down. It is very interested that the worm will stop or even recede when the light is turned off. It means it will take some time for the worm to turn to normal.

Their reactions are always step back when they are about to changing directions, but the changes are not taken place instantaneously. It means it will be 5-7 seconds later when the worm changes direction. Secondly, you can see they twist their body when stimulated by the light.

POSTCARDS
Our first official collaboration was with Team Dusseldorf, Germany.  We were contacted by one of the team members via Instagram and we immediately wanted to join in on the fun. Their postcard exchange idea not only provoked our creative sides to come through, but we were also managed to establish long-lasting connections and, dare we say, friendships with teams all around the world.. even just via post.
SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGE
This collaboration opportunity  intrigued us immensely, as we are avid recyclers and overall fans of sustainable living. Naturally, Sustainability@BostonU caught our attention immediately. Not to mention the prizes are all adorable. We cleared our phones, downloaded the app and, in a two week period, documented all our good deeds for nature. We managed to snag first place (and the cutest aloe plant ever) and some of us still use the app daily.
SCIENCE EVERYWHERE
Even in the midst of all the #wikifreeze chaos, we managed to find a slither of free time to participate in Team Tec de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara’s fun collaboration - #ScienceEverywhere. This provoked us to check how far away we actually are from Boston and, as it turns out, there are 7274 km to be travelled in order for us to reach our final destination - iGEM’s Giant Jamboree.

Until this summer, I couldn’t do anything at “genetics” side of my own department. I studied on stem cells and tissue engineering fields during my internship and special project course. So, iGEM was a huge chance for me to study genetics and learn many techniques about synthetic biology. My dream is to be able to combine tissue engineering and synthetic biology fields.                                 I’ve worked mainly at wet lab part of our team. And, I also tried to find sponsors for our project, but it is difficult to say that I was very successful?

Collaborations
iGEM Stuttgart
In 2017, iGEM TU Darmstadt worked with chitosan-producing and chitosan-modifying enzymes. This year’s iGEM team from the university of Stuttgart is working with chitosan, as well. In this context, iGEM Stuttgart contacted us asking for help and advice. Since, we were excited to hear of another team seeing the potential in chitosan as an antimicrobial coating, we were happy to help.
In agreement with our team members from 2017, we sent them the most relevant parts of the 2017 iGEM TU Darmstadt project. Stuttgart planned to produce chitosan in one single cell, using our chitin synthase ( NodC ) and chitin deacetylase ( NodB ). Based on the work and progress of our last year’s team, we could provide Stuttgart with helpful information concerning chitosan research. In particular, discussions with experts such as Prof. Dr. Moerschbacher helped us to recognize and tackle problems coming up during lab work. We recommended the team to contact him and other researchers.
Before the European Meetup, we had agreed on meeting the team there and answer questions, which were still unanswered in a personal conversation. During the Meetup we talked about the chitindeacetylase NodB and pointed out which difficulties we had come across during expression, purification and the assays. Also, we recommended them the kit Prof. Dr. Moerschbacher had suggested. Due to the problems with NodB inclusion bodies, we recommended them to use COD from Vibrio cholerae instead. The team appreciated our recommendation and"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#Sensing_-_-_TEXT.html," in the cell steadily             increases even though no AHL was added, which means that the leakiness of the promoter is creating more AHL,             which then induces the promoter in a positive feedback loop. Since the purpose of the Sensing module is to respond             to an AHL signal before amplifying it, this is not an acceptable behavior of the system.
4.2 Simulation with asRNA
In the next simulation, we add asRNA. First, we will show simulation results for two levels of concentration, with             one high enough to activate the positive feedback loop, and the other being too low.
Fig. 3 Simulation with asRNA with [AHL]extracellular = 0 M
Fig. 4 Simulation with asRNA with [AHL]extracellular = 10−5M
Note that to show the relative concentration diﬀerences between the simulation with and without asRNA, we used             the same values for [mRNA]const , [GFP]const , and [AHL]const , setting them as the constitutively produced             concentrations in the simulation without asRNA.
The ﬁgure on the left shows a simulation from an initial AHL concentration of 0, while the right uses an initial             concentration of 10−5 M. As can be seen, the concentration remains low for the ﬁrst simulation, and             rises to an eventual plateau for the second as expected for the module.
The production of mRNA in the left graph can be attributed to the leakiness of the promoter. Meanwhile, the slightly             higher value in the middle of the simulation for [AHL] in the right graph can be attributed to the lower net             diﬀusion due to external AHL concentration. As the extracellular AHL gradually degrades, the intracellular concentration             also gradually decreases, but always remains at least the constitutively produced level with asRNA.
The following figure shows the AHL concentration for each initial concentration after 200 minutes. For the simulation with asRNA, as can be seen             from the graph, the eventual concentrations will have a sharp increase as AHL level increases to more than around             10−8 M.  This behavior suggests that the module has concentrations where it is on or oﬀ which is desirable             in a sensor to respond to changes in AHL . Meanwhile, without asRNA, the response concentration of AHL is at a             high value for most initial concentrations, which would hamper its function as a sensor. Both concentrations increase             when extracellular [AHL] increases above 10−7, which can be attributed to the"

System reset
To realize a resettable and more accurate 0/1 switch, we introduce recombination directionality factor (RDF) to our system. When the external signal disappears or falls below the threshold, our MOSFET is able to reset to restore the initial state.
In the signal processing part of our system, we have mentioned recombinases, which promote recombination between two different DNA sites, attP and attB, and in turn form recombinant attL and attR sites. The ‘reverse’ reaction requires another phage-encoded protein called RDF. RDF activates attL×attR recombination and inhibits attP×attB recombination. Recombinases can be fused to their corresponding RDFs to create single proteins that catalyse efficient attL×attR recombination in vivo and in vitro[7].
Fig. 7 RDF identifies the attL×attR site and flips it back to the original attP×attB state, which closes the device
Immediately, we started a new round of mathematical model verification. When the recombinase and RDF existed together, our system would be unstable. While the recombinase brought the system to the “0” state, the RDF would interfere with its behavior and make it into “1” state. (Fig.8). In order to enhance the stability of the system, we introduced the RDF-inhibitor part. RDF-inhibitor can interact with RDF and make it lose its flipping ability.In our scenario, RDF inhibitors can be siRNAs[8].
Fig. 8 Switching of downstream genes without RDF-inhibitor noise reduction
X axis represents whether the downstream gene is active. We can see that switches of downstream gene are controlled by signal concentration. Only when concentration level is more than 5, the switch will be on. However, because the expression of RDF is not restricted, it will reset the downstream genes directly, which will close the switch. Then the gene will be open by the effect of rec again, which will cause periodical shock in the system. Because of the shock of effectors’ gene, the expression of GFP is discontinuous. When the system needs to be turned on, oscillations may occur, which may damage the DNA.
Fig.9  T-cells constitutively express tetR and the promoter is inhibited. When the cells sense the signal in the environment, TEV will bind to tetR, so the recombinase and the inhibitor could be expressed.

The iGEM team from University of Copenhagen organised an ethics workshop in August 2014 where all the Danish iGEM teams were invited. The workshop provided an introduction to some of the main theories of philosophical ethics and their use regarding synthetic biology. The workshop inspired us to carry out an analysis of the ethical aspects of our chosen project, characterising promoter strengths in absolute terms by means of the RNA aptamer Spinach.
Synthetic biology is aiming towards being able to combine known, well-characterised elements into novel constructs. By developing a method for determining absolute promoter strength our project is a step towards realising this vision. Due to the increased possibilities brought by better characterisation and standardisation of promoter strengths several ethical issues arise. Most of these are variations of issues already seen in the ethical debate about synthetic biology in general, including concerns about genetically engineered organisms being released to nature and synthetic biology being used with harmful intentions. These and other arguments will be discussed in the following sections.
We have chosen to look at arguments for and against synthetic biology from a utilitarianist point of view when applicable. Utilitarianism have been chosen since it, in contrast to many other ethical theories, allows quantification of different arguments, by analysing the consequences that a given action has on people. In this regard it is also important to be aware of the consequences of not taking an action, which is often referred to as cost of lost potential.
Easier Construction of Biological Systems
Our project aims at developing a method for easier characterisation of essential biological parts, to allow synthetic biologists to better create new and useful biological systems e.g. for producing medicine or cleaning up the environment in a superior manner. Better characterisation of biological parts can, however, in the wrong hands, have hazardous consequences. Improved characterisation of parts will make it easier, even for people with limited"

About USTC_Software
A bunch of energetic young guys bumping into each other in pursuit of the truth of life, and this is basically the essential reason why we are here now.
This year, we are much more populated than before. This not only gets solid proof from the increasing coverage of participants' number, but also can be demonstrsted by the big variance among participants' backgrounds. The 2009 iGEM team of USTC, well, if we just count the dry team, consists of two graduate students and four undergraduates. Our major varies from  electrnic engineering to condensed matter physics, from geophysics to computational biology. By such a colorful combination, anything exciting could be possible relying on our brotherhood. We feel so lucky to get acquaintance with each other and really enjoy all the funny days we are together. We will enjoy the days in MIT, just join us!

Induction: At 3:30PM (2 hours) 0.0477g of IPTG was dissolved in 1mL of LB, and added to the flask for a total concentration of 0.2mM. The OD600 was measured to be 0.165. Because there was no access to an 18C incubator, the flask was left in the 30C incubator.
Observations: OD600 should have been measured before induction, as the ideal OD600 at time of induction should be 0.6. Also, the flask should have been sterilized the day before in order to not have to leave the bacteria culture on the bench."

Implications and Uses of a CRISPR/dCas9 RNA editing system
The most notable flaw in current CRISPR based gene therapies and other gene therapy methods is the significant number of mutations and inefficiency of homologous combination therapies involving double strand breaks in DNA that can cause unwanted deletion and substitution mutations, and Cas9 gene therapies being inefficient due to genomic repair reversing the changes. This RNA based gene editing system, holds promise for a more accurate and efficient form of gene therapy. By editing the mRNA of cells, there are no repair mechanisms that could reverse the changes. At the same time, the effects of this editing system can be controlled using outside medications (using doxycycline to control expression of the genes containing the editing system) and are made only to mRNA, leaving the DNA genome alone. There is also the issue of editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system causing unwanted or off target mutations. These mutations could cause problems for the cells ranging from cell death to cancer. Though more accurate CRISPR/Cas9 DNA based systems have been created, the chance for permanent off target mutations is still present. Fundamentally, this RNA based gene therapy dodges the main issue of off target cuts and mutations to the genome. In targeting mRNA, the dCas9 does not cut the mRNA, but acts like a delivery platform carrying enzymes. The tetracycline control of the editing system can also be used to stop any unwanted/off target changes from persisting in mRNA.  The proposed dCas9 based RNA editing system, if functional, can be treated like other gene therapy treatments. The DNA used for the system will be transported into target cells using specifically created associated adeno-viral vectors, injected directly into the area of the target cells or to the blood system if the target cells are all over the body(such as the nervous system)1. So far there has been only one case when adenovirus as a vector has caused the determent of the patient. This accident occurred when the viruses started targeting non-target cells causing a reactionary immune response, resulting in coma and death of the patient.2 Because of this, a more commonly used vector called Adeno-Associated Virus will"

The goal of phase 1 to establish a consistent method of gene activation through dCAS9-VPR and well characterize the components of our system. Using MIT's CRISPR  optimization tool, we generated 20 sequences to be used as our gRNA and target site. The dCAS9-VPR complex, the target sequence and reporter gene, and the gRNA expression vectors were constructed and transfected into HEK293 cells. Another set of transfections took place simultaneously with the same materials minus the gRNA expression vector as a negative control. The fold increase between the basal level of expression from the control and the activated level of expression was then recorded. The results can be found below.

The detecting chasis with gene exchanged can detect the lower concentration of tetracycline at 0.00005μg/ml in the water samples, but it need more time to growth and this section             is not a stable chasis for each time to detect tetracycline.
fig.5 The ABS value of the detection chasis gene exchange under different tc concentrations
Considering the stability of the project, we prefer to use the original tetracycline detection chasis to detect water samples.
For the Degradation chasis:
We successfully constructed four degradation chasis with lignin peroxidase, Manganese peroxidase and laccase. After the verification experiments,             we got lots of data about those enzymes performances under the co-culture system in the below:
Through the data comparison above, we can get that the lignin peroxidase perform the better ability to degrade the tetracycline in the culture media and Manganese peroxidase cannot work well alone. So we retain the composite parts that including lignin peroxidase and Manganese peroxidase to degrade tetracycline together in this parts.

Photodiodes:
A photodiode is a semiconductor component. This means that it has a conductivity (ability to conduct electric current) that is between that of an insulating material and a very conductive material, such as a metal. This can arise due to the presence of conductive impurities in a non-conductive material. One such example of a semiconductor is silicon, which is frequently used in photodiodes. By combining two different types of semiconductor material together a p-n junction can be formed as the boundary layer between these two different materials. One material, known as n-type has fewer holes (a particle with a negative charge) in it and therefore has a negative charge, while the other material, known as p-type, has more holes (a positively charged electric charge carrier) in it and therefore is more positive.
When light hits the photodiode, and an electron is dislodged and an electron-hole pair is generated. The hole (positive charge) then migrates towards the anode electrode of the photodiode and the electron (negative charge) migrates towards the cathode electrode due to the electric field, therefore a small current can be seen. This current is directly proportional to the amount, and therefore the brightness, of the light. In our device, the photodiodes were connected in reverse biased (input voltage to the anode) as this ensures the photodiodes will work correctly as light sensors.
The photodiodes were chosen as the sensor, because they were cheaper than other sensor options, such as the phototransistors, and they are able to make quick readings so that data can be collected frequently. The photodiode array is set up as shown in figure 4, by connecting all the anodes and the cathodes together as shown in figure 4.
Figure 4: This schematic shows how the photodiodes are connected in the array. All of the cathodes of the photodiodes are soldered together and are shown as orange in the diagram above. They are connected to both the input voltage and the multiplexer that connects them to the analog input pin on the microcontroller. All of the anodes are soldered together and connected to the multiplexer that puts them to ground. The complete, soldered device is shown in figure 5.

The Broad Host Range Kit is not simply a set of parts and plasmids, but rather a set of tools designed to inform researchers about the functionality of broad host origins of replication in non-model organisms. Once the assembly plasmids were synthesized, we needed to demonstrate that the kit can be applied to non-model organisms and produce results that are easy to understand. To simplify the process of validating compatible parts, color reporters and barcodes are included as indicators of different assembly plasmids. This allows us to transform multiple plasmids in a single reaction, dubbed the ""One Tube Method"".
To prove our kit is capable of testing multiple plasmids at a time in non-model bacteria, four types of experiments were organized. First, part plasmids containing the reporter protein coding sequences were plated together to determine which would be good candidates for integration into bridge parts. These coding sequences will be paired with specific origins of replication, allowing us to determine if the plasmids were replicated and expressed by the host. This experiment also provides an example for how a plate may look, when all the full assemblies are transformed into a non-model bacteria. Transforming all the plasmids into a single sample of bacteria at the same time is the quickest way to test many plasmids at once. Second, we tested the one tube method in E. coli via electroporation. During the third experiment, we electroporated the same one tube mixtures into Vibrio natriegens to begin testing kit design in non-model species. Lastly, we conjugated a single assembly plasmid from an auxotrophic strain of E. coli to Serratia marcescens to confirm that the Origin of Transfer (part type seven), which is responsible for conjugation, is functional. Then the eight plasmid mixture was transformed into the same auxotrophic strain of E. coli in preparation for conjugation with multiple plasmids. These experiments were instructive, and though some specifics need to be altered, we ultimately determined that the execution of the kit was effective .

As can be seen in the figures above, all Taq based polymerases are able to incorporate the unnatural base pair in the DNA. The best results were apparently achieved with the Go Taq G2 DNA polymerase. All lanes with the UBPs show clear bands and no mutations to T or A. The M.A.X restriction digest showed there are some mutations to C. The PCR product of the UBP_target fragment was digested because of the second MnlI restriction site, but one can see a difference between the M.A.X target mutC and the UBP_target PCR product. The digested PCR products of the BioMaster-HS Taq PCR polymerase and the Allin HiFi DNA Polymerase show more mutations to A than the other polymerases. But also the TiTaq polymerase seems to miss incorporate the A instead of isoG. Moreover, the Phusion DNA polymerase proceeds to miss the incorporated G while the Q5 DNA polymerase does not show any bands containing the UBPs. Both polymerases have a proofreading function in contrast to the other polymerases.
In the final analysis, the faster and the stronger the poof reading function of a polymerase is, the worse is the incorporation of the UBPs.
The M.A.X system seems to be a good method for the first review of the efficiency of the polymerases. One can see if there is any incorporation of UBPs, so that sequencing is worthwhile. Minor deviations are not detectable by gel electrophoresis. It is also difficult to make a clear statement about the proportion of correctly or incorrectly incorporated unnatural bases, because the digested fragments seem to be less intensive than intact sequences.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," thanks to our past activities, we remembered something they told us in the very beginning; “beekeeping needs scientific research from young minds.” With this in mind, we found out about Clubes de Ciencia México 2018 (Science Clubs Mexico 2018)
Clubes de Ciencia México (CdeCMx)  is a non-profit organization that seeks to encourage Mexican students to pursue professional opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math. This initiative was firstly introduced at Harvard with the objective to create relationships between students and important researchers, besides spreading science to young people. Thanks to this, CdeCMx has designed an education model for these areas called Clubs. These Clubs target high school and undergraduate students with the objective of making them learn theoretical and practical aspects of these topics.
Each Club is developed by a team of young scientists from the most prestigious universities and research institutions in Mexico and the United States. Each summer, the organization carries out the week of CdeCMx in several cities in the country with the partnership of multiple institutions.
One of the best things this organization has to offer is that every Club is free thus everyone who is interested in science has the opportunity to attend.
This is a project that involves 9 different headquarters in Mexico. It has over 162 Clubs, 300 instructors and 2200 students within the country. In Chihuahua, our university, the “Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Campus Chihuahua” was one of the 9 headquarters in Mexico for this important event.
Our campus hosted 120 undergraduate students from different institutions along the city who were advised by 12 professors that shared their knowledge and applied it to theoretical and practical lessons. 6 Clubs took place in our campus throughout the week and counted with instructors from different institutions. There were instructors from Tec de Monterrey
Campus Monterrey, MIT, University of Kentucky, Duke University, CIMAV (Center for Research in Advanced Materials), University of Chicago, UACH (Autonomous University of Chihuahua), University of Texas, University of Baja California, University of San Diego, Harvard, among others.
For iGEM Tec Chihuahua 2018 is very important to wake up interests for science in students, so it spreads a little more every time. That's why we decided to support one of the Clubs given at our campus which was “El mundo real de la biotecnología” (The real world of biotechnology in English).
This Club taught students the key concepts in molecular biology and practical lab activities to use living organisms,"

Enzymes are added to wells immediately after rinsing and allowed to sit for 1 hour.
After 1 hour, wells are washed again and the stains are applied:
0.16% filter-sterilized CTC incubated at room temperature for 2 hr, CTC solutions are prepared directly prior to staining
0.3% CV solution incubated at room temperature for 5 min
After incubation times, absorbed stain is eluted from attached cells with 95% ethanol
Wells are rinsed four times to remove excess stain
Wells then filled with 200 ul ethanol and incubated
CTC incubated for 15 min at room temp
CV incubated for 5 min at room temp
Absorbance Readings
Plates are vigorously shaken for 10 seconds, then light absorbances are read with BioTek FL600 plate reader
CTC absorbance is read at 450 nm
CV absorbance is read at 540 nm
Each raw absorbance value is then corrected by subtracting the mean of absorbance readings for the blank wells prior to statistical analysis

Human alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells are then introduced into the upper and lower microchannels, respectively, and grown on the ECM-coated membrane for at least 5 days to form two closely apposed tissue monolayers. During cell culture, medium is perfused continuously through both channels to provide cells with nutrients and to remove their metabolic wastes. Once confluence is reached, the culture medium is removed from the upper channel, and this channel is filled with air to form an air-liquid interface at the apical surface of the alveolar epithelium, which induces the cells to differentiate and express tissue-specific functions, such as surfactant production.
At the end, to test our device with its cells against toxicity, we infect them with multi-resistant microbial cells (Klebsiella pneumonia) for a 12 hour cycle. Next we introduce our modified Ga-siderophores so they hijack into the microbes and intoxicate them, while avoiding any human epi- and endothelial cells.

Marburg - Meet up
We followed the invitation of the iGEM Team Marburg and went for their Meet up with six students of our team. During the weekend we had a lot of fun meeting the other iGEM Teams, racing in canoes and enjoying a great barbecue and music. Of course we also talked a lot about the project of each team and tried to support other teams as good as possible. Many collaborations were turned up during the Meet up. One of them was the collaboration with Team Göttingen.

Sequence Verification from plasmid
For verification of insertion of lacZ gRNA into pACYCdxCas9Tn5, primers IV003 and IV004 were used for sequencing. Only plasmid isolates from colony 1 and 2 were sent for sequencing. The sequencing starts from the homology flanks, in the direction of the lacZ gRNA. The 10µL sequencing sample was prepared in a 1.5 mL tube as follows:

DNA Diagnostics
DNA Molecular Diagnostics
The rapid and sensitive detection of genetic mutations and pathogenic organisms is vital for improving patient care. Molecular diagnostics aid in genetic counselling, identifying suitable treatments, preventing the spread of disease, and identifying sources of infection in medical laboratory, home or field settings (Allegranzi et al, 2011). For pathogen detection the use of DNA-based methodology is derived from the premise that each species of pathogen carries unique DNA or RNA sequences that differentiate it from other organisms.
PCR
Numerous molecular diagnostic methods have evolved in biomedical laboratories.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology is the current gold standard for molecular diagnostic tests. PCR is an in vitro method of amplifying and detecting highly specific nucleotide sequences.  Developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis, PCR is now an indispensable technique used in biomedical and research labs for various applications including DNA cloning, sequencing, functional analysis of genes; hereditary disease diagnosis; forensics, paternity testing; and the detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases. The 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Mullis - along with Michael Smith - for his work on PCR.
Fig. 2 PCR. The method relies on thermal cycling, i.e. cycles of repeated heating and cooling of the reaction for DNA melting and replication of the DNA by polymerase enzymes. Primers (short DNA fragments) which contain sequences that are complementary to the target region along with a DNA polymerase are key components to enable specific and repeated amplification. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a chain reaction in which the DNA template is amplified exponentially.  Figure Source: Wikipedia Commons (User: Enzoklop)
Limitations of PCR
The sensitivity of PCR arises from the exponential amplification of the template DNA.  However, this feature of PCR can also be problematic when it comes to accurate DNA quantification because any errors during reaction set up are also amplified exponentially.  Also avoiding contamination of samples with the product of a previous PCR reaction is a concern.
To quantify a target DNA molecule, quantitative real"

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"-hand side, the state with no kanamycin bound is depicted. The toehold-switch is inactive as the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) is hidden in a strong stem. Upon binding of kanamycin, the regulatory construct that is fused to the aptamer and that keeps the toehold-switch in its inactive conformation (by not allowing base pairing between the regulatory construct and the toehold-switch) changes secondary structure. Thereby a previously existing strong stem unfolds and reveals a sequence complementary to the toehold-switch. As soon as this happens, the conformation on the right-hand side is formed and the RBS can be accessed.
Supporting iGEM Team Aachen
Back then when it was still summer, Michael Osthege from iGEM Team Aachen visited us. As a verteran of iGEM 2014, he already knew that one of the most important parts of every successfull project is sample management. Talking with him we got to know of other teams struggling to locate their samples. Their plan was, to get further information about the impact of this problem. Michael has had already prepared a draft for the survey which we then discussed. Of course in the following weeks we participated in the final version of the survery.
Not only did he bring a beta-survey, but also an already functional beta-version of a very promising software: tubefront . It's a mobile-optimized webservice which keeps track of all your samples, assigns IDs which can be written on the tubes and tells you where you can find them.
As of now the software is fully functional and availiable for free for other teams. They also developed a MediaWiki plugin which can be confortably implemented into any wiki.
Though we really loved tubefront with heavy heart we decided not to use tubefront ourselves, as we had already established a sample management system. We recommend any team to check it out though, as it has proven to work for various teams and future generations of teams could really benefit from it.
Supporting iGEM Team Paris Bettencourt
iGEM Paris Bettencourt has set up a visual databse that should help various iGEM teams collaborate and find common ground. In that database all teams can enter techniques, keywords, organism and many more thev are knowdledgeable in or have been working on. As common dots are connected automatically, it's easy so see, whom to ask for a collaboration.
Though we came a little late to the party, we really loved the idea and hoped, that the database has helped various teams!

Consulting with Doctor Hsing-Chih Chang
Fig. 1. Visited Dr. Hsing-Chih Chang.
The ultimate goal of BioWatcher is to apply this system on human to prevent late-stage cancers by early diagnosis. Therefore, we turned to Mr. Chung, a doctor who has a Ph.D. degree in molecular and cellular oncology in MD Anderson Cancer                 Center and currently works in Mackay Memorial Hospital for his experiences in clinical/cancer cases. What we discussed includes the potential and limitation of diagnostic biomarkers, the accuracy of diagnosis using biomarkers, and most                 importantly the design of BioWatcher.
1. What kind of cell is a suitable reporter cell candidate for modification?
A suitable candidate should possess properties listed:
1. Compatible with targeted human immune system
2. Can be easily modified
Prior to the meeting, white blood cell was on our list of choice. Yet, it was taken off list due to its inevitable interference with blood composition as the modified ones are introduced into humans’ circulating system. Dr. Chang suggested                 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Dendritic cells (DCs). Maturing of BioWatcher with time will give us more insight into the choice.
Known downside of MSCs-- its lifespan is not as long as we preferred—have us hesitate. However, regarding the immunoregulatory capacity of Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the fact that it has been widely used in many cell therapies,                 MSCs, in this case, become the top choice for us. DCs are considered because of its antitumor immunity and the cases of Dendritic cell-based immunotherapy.
2. Mechanism for erasing all reporter cells in users is needed.
Dr. Chang strongly recommended that we design a mechanism for wiping out the reporter cells introduced in user when we ignorantly think that the reporter cell is harmless and shortly mortal while overlooking the importance of biosafety                 and the possible allergy responses in users. Therefore, we introduce"

Proof of Concept
Overview
Our intended final product was a protein cage capable of disassembling due to specific proteolytic cleavage. This would disassemble the cage, exposing the inside of the cage and its contents to the environment where the targeted enzyme was in.
Using Protein Cage Mutants
We demonstrated proof of concept using thrombin as our targeted enzyme, and successfully mutated thrombin cleavage sites into a variety of positions along two protein cages, O3-33 and PCQuad.
Not all of these mutations yielded viable cages however. Some caused the subunits of the cage to no longer be compatible, preventing formation of the cage, and some caused the subunits of the cage not to form in the first place.
One mutant for each of the cages yielded properly formed cages, with nearly identical characteristics to their respective wild types.
We mixed a solution of each of these wild types with thrombin, allowing them to incubate for 16 hours at room temperature. Additionally, we created an identical mixture with the same conditions using the wild types of each cage as a control.
Assay Results
Detailed results can be found here
After the incubation period, we ran DLS and SDS-PAGE assays to determine the effects of the added thrombin. The wild types had no change, while the mutants showed clear signs of cleavage.
We further ran time variation experiments of the same thrombin assay. This involved allowing the thrombin-protein mixture to incubate for 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 16 hours. The longer the period of time, the more cleavage that occurred, as could be seen from the intensity of bands representing the unaffected subunits (fading over time) and the cleaved subunits (intensifying over time).
DLS Results for PCQuad Mutant M1 before addition of thrombin and after addition of thrombin:
DLS Results for PCQuad Mutant M1 before addition of thrombin and after addition of thrombin:
Explanation of Results
All of these results pointed to the explanation that thrombin was indeed causing subunit level cleavage in the proteins at the added cleavage sites, as expected. DLS results further confirmed that the subunit level cleavage was disrupting the formation of the full cage.
These results thus demonstrate that specifically through the addition of a targeted enzyme, we"
Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," containing criticism of biotech initatives and of the critics are in the references below under the heading ‘Criticism and Critics’ to illustrate this idea, some of the criticism and if you read the comments, some of the hysteria that surrounds the issues.
Any critical review of a large number of NGOs, many of which are truly single issue organisations, cannot escape from noting an ‘underdog’ complex, an arguably self-righteous and smug attitude, for example the Colalition Against Biopiracy award ceremony named the ‘Captain Hook Awards’ where they lambast those they deem “Biopirates” and laud those they call “Cogs” (after the merchant ships which featured a design to protect them from piracy) for fighting against the “pirates”. (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2008).  As no doubt humorous and well intended as the sentiments are, it is hard to defend such a polemic, self-aggrandizing (through the role of the underdog), self congratulatory antics as worthy of individuals who can be considered willing to give serious, impartial debate to such an issue.  Compounding these tendencies is that many NGOs who lead the debate on ethics in such areas spurn legitimate, democratic representation; personal, self-justified actions are undertaken without generalized debate or discourse.  An example would be the actions of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) or those of the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) groups.  Leaving aside whether their complaints have been valid, what could be argued as ethically questionable about these and other NGOs is that ‘the people who have set and who continue to set the ethical agenda of our time are absent from the chambers to which the citizens send their representatives.  They don’t want to be there.  When pressed, they tend to respond that elected officials have no real power.  But if they don’t believe it is worth being elected, then they don’t believe in democracy.  If they don’t believe in democracy, what do they think should replace it?  And however much they believe they are right, do they not believe that the citizenry have the right to make the final decision? If so, how, since they themselves have rejected the legitimacy of the legislature?  If not, then how do they differentiate themselves from others who believe that it is they who are right, also reject democracy, and happen to disagree with the NGO in question?  The growing neo-fascist movements, for example.’ (Saul, 2001).  He elaborates this point by saying ‘The le"

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," the red- and blue- light sensors need to be inverted, which is done by connecting them to NOT gates in circuits.
The resource allocator which connects the circuits and actuators, is based on a split-RNA polymerase system[3], in which the sigma fragments activated by light sensors can combine with the constitutive expressed non-active ‘core’ fragment to form complete RNA polymerases, then activated the expression of actuators accordingly. For more information on the circuit design, see LIGHT TO COLOR .
.
The actuators we chose were three kinds of color protein: fluorescent protein, chromoprotein and enzyme which can produce colorful products.
First, to make our rose more colorful, we put forward a concept—mixing colors in cells. Then using tandem expression we performed simple proof of our concept.
Figure 4. The color spectrum built from chromoproteins and their tandem expression products.
Next, we used the RGB system to achieve light-controlled color mix in bacteria, not only to test the function of our system, but to further prove our concept. By replacing actuators with fluorescent proteins and enzymes, we successfully built beautiful color spectrums and created a rose using the colors we created.
Figure 5. The color spectrum built from fluorescent color mixing.
Figure 6. The rose we created by using the colors we mixed.
Figure 7. The color spectrum built from mixing color with enzymes.
Then for more precise control of the color, we explored the relationship between fluorescence intensity and the wavelengths and intensity of input light using ELIASA (microplate reader) and flow cytometry (Figure 10, 11,12). After quantitative analysis, we could predict and control all kinds of colors our bacteria would produce. Our concept of mixing color on the bacteria cells were also proved to be reasonable and provided a convenient way for scientists and artists to create new colors and artworks.
Figure 8. The flow cytometry results shows the distribution of the cells in fluorescence intensity. BV421 represented the blue-fluorescence intensity, while the FITC-A represented the green-fluorescence intensity and Pe-TxR-A represented the red-fluorescence intensity. The horizontal axis shew the fluorescence intensity, while the vertical axis shew the number of bacteria cells.
Figure 9. The spectral response of the complete RGB system. “%maximum induction” is calculated as the fold change of the response divided by the maximum fold change across the spectrum.

Today we measured GFP for the Measurement Interlab Study.
Cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspended in ten folds the culture volume with a phosphate buffered saline (58 mM Na2HPO4, 17 mM NaH2PO4, 68 mM NaCl), as performed by Scholz et al., 2000. Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 were purchased from Panreac. NaCl was purchased from Fisher Bioreagents.
A GloMax-Multi Detection System form Promega fluorometer configured with the Blue optical kit (&Lamda;ex=490 nm, &Lamda;em=510-575 nm) was used to measure fluorescence. For measuring fluorescence 250 μl of each sample were placed in a black 96-well plate. Each sample was measured three times and an average was displayed on the screen.
A Biowave CO 8000 from Biochrom spectophotometer was used to measure absorbance at 600 nm. For measuring absorbance 700 μl were placed in a cubet and measured one by one in the spectrophotometer.

      In addition to exploration, explanation and prediction, the ultimate  goal of science is creation.  In the  field of life science, enthusiasm towards creation originates the synthetic  biology.  During the last decade, numerous  artificial biological networks had been made by rearranging the exited biological  macromolecules.  Recently, creation of the  macromolecules inside biological networks emerges as a hotspot.  Because of structural simplicity and manipulation  convenience, RNA becomes an ideal model for conducting such researches. 
      This year, in iGEM 2012 competition, the first  software that designs temperature-sensing regulatory RNA - RNAThermo is  reported by iGEM Tsinghua-D Team.   Structural and functional verifications of the designed RNATs were  made.  RNAThermo’s potential application  in the fermentation industry is discussed:   the software provides a new method for achieving controlled expression of products in the fermentation industry.

A repressor protein, which can switch off expression of the quorum molecule and shut down the positive-feedback loop, creating a negative-feedback loop, was selected. This would stop expression of the chromogenic reporter, and eventually, the bacterial cells would return to their normal colour.

Week 9
WE MADE BETA-CAROTENE!!! We must have pleased Julien, our supervisor, who encouraged us with “not all hope is lost”. Thanks Julien. Our engineers tested their solar incubator and successfully managed to heat up the water to over 90 degrees Celsius! Fergus made a rich (and “dense”) chocolate cake that was absolutely delightful.
Week 10 (the end)
Our last week in the lab (omg). After endless minipreps and thousands (?) of plates made, we are done. We successfully synthesised beta-carotene in E. coli (sadly, ran out of time to accomplish this in S. thermophilus) and we have a fully working solar concentrator (the engineers changed the name so many times, no one is quite sure what to call it anymore). We also managed to transform amilCP into S. thermophilus (HOORAY!!!). What a fantastic end to the summer. Simone finished our iGEM bake-off with a little bit of Italian culture, a tasty torta della nonna.

Neptune: Accessible microfluidics for all
In our Silver Medal Human Practices page, we outlined our public outreach and industry visits. These experiences drew our team to focus on accessibility in synthetic biology as a theme moving forward with our human practice contributions. For Silver HP, we contributed a set of informational blog posts on the history of intellectual property, and IP in software and in synthetic biology today. We welcome you to read these at our WordPress site.
WORDPRESS BLOG
Moving forward with the development of Neptune, we decided that we would extend our silver medal HP theme of accessibility in synthetic biology. Indeed, we were developing a complete, end-to-end microfluidic development workflow. Having seen how inaccessible and prohibitively costly microfluidics are for researchers, and also having studied the virtues of open source tools for synthetic biology, we decided to integrate accessibility into our implementation of Neptune.
In this page, we cover 3 ways in which we expand on and integrate the theme of accessibility to our final product, Neptune.
we made it a project criteria that Neptune must interface with low cost, open and readily available tools and hardware to create microfluidics
we partnered with the NONA Research Foundation, an organization dedicated to increasing access, collaboration, and building a community around synthetic biology software tools
we offer our team as a point of contact to other iGEM teams that have created software solutions and would like to have these tools protected and stored on NONA
Neptune: Low cost, easy to use, accessible
As we developed Neptune, we were faced with design choices that would have a large impact on how our workflow integrates with the synthetic biology community. In light of our Silver HP discoveries, we decided the most important design choice would be to make our workflow accessible to all: we want a workflow so easy to use that researchers in synthetic biology will be excited to make microfluidic chips. We want a workflow that interfaces with fabrication protocols that are low"

2.2. Cleavage by MazF dimers
MazF dimers recognize and cleave ACA sequences in mRNAs, thus acting as a toxin.We estimated the rate of recognitions of ACA sequences by MazF dimers at $$ 1-(1-f)^n $$ where n is the number of ACA sequences in mRNA and  f is the probability of distinction of ACA sequences on each mRNA. Then, we expressed the rate of degradation by MazF dimers in $$ F(1-(1-f)^{f_{mRNA}}) $$ and obtain the following set of differential equations.

Estimate the key parameters beta to be 0.775, gamma to be 1/7,         can be considered as a good approximation not only we estimate them from research papers and experimental         data, but also we constructed sensitivity analysis to these parameters and showed a low sensitivity. These results give us a clear relation about each factor and to direct our project design that gamma is the most important and easy factor we need to improved and make a difference.                 These results give us a clear relation about each factor and to direct our project design.         Numerical simulations on the model showed our product kill cockroaches indoors with a lethal time 50% (LT50) about 8 day, and lethal time 80% (LT80) about 15 day. Thanks to the assumption, we can simplify our model, however in future, we will consider more factor that may influence our prediction to make our model more real.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Modeling with Templates
Manual modeling of biological system is widely used in synthetic biology. However, it requires an overall understanding of the biological network and large amount of data, making it difficult even for professionals. Actually, the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur with a same mechanism. Based on this idea, we introduce the concept of Template, which is the minimal data set for describing biological reaction networks, as a feasible way to implement automatic modeling. The term “automatic” does not mean modeling without providing any information. Instead, we aim at providing minimal amount of data. Similar to C++ programming language, templates allow generic description of species of a certain structural pattern or reactions of a certain reaction mechanism.
Substituent and Template
There are two kinds of templates: Template Species and Template Reactions. They are designed to represent a family of species with similar structure and a family of reactions with similar mechanism respectively. In order to realize this idea, we add the container of Substituent into MoDeL. There are currently six objects in this container, ANY, ANYUB, ONE, ONEUB, NZ and NZUB. Though defined differently, they actually serve the same purpose: representing other parts. Let’s take ANY as an example (see Figure 4). ANY, represents parts on ONE chain and the number of represented parts can range from zero to infinity. For example, a DNA species with structure ANY - pTetR - ANY represents any DNA with part pTetR.
Figure 4: Template DNA species
A reaction with template species as its reactants, modifiers or products is a Template Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into functional groups -- a reaction template describes the interaction mechanism of these functional groups. For example, pTetR promoter is deactivated in presence of TetR dimer. The template species are pTetR DNA template and TetR dimer protein template (see Figure 5) and the functional groups are pTetR promoter and TetR dimer. All the parts of ANY should also be counted"

Their project aimed to develop a strategy to reduce UV damage in photosynthetic organisms, but were unable to express the system in plants due to lack of specialist resources. We set up a skype meeting to talk about the collaboration in which we suggested the experiments that we could conduct that would successfully test their hypothesis. These experiments involved using a phenotypic assasy to assess the effect of UV damage on tobacco leaves that had been inflitrated with a clone expressing their protein of interest.
Unfortunately WashU were unable to generate their clones in the Phytobrick standard so we were unable to take this collaboration foward."

“Gene Go!”
High School Education
Our Edutainment Item
Meet-up
Our work
""Gene go!""
“Gene go!” was held in Sichuan Science and Technology Museum(SCSTM) on June 17 by UESTC-China and UESTC-Software, which is an event of Education and Public Engagement. We released information on the activities through the platform of SCSTM. Within one day, we received registration forms from more than 300 families, reaching the maximum capacity of the activity.
“Gene go!” including five section, such as DIY classroom, “Cellulose Go” Show, Exploring the micro world etc. We created an atmosphere of synthetic biology, telling them what is iGEM and what we’re doing for the world.
“Gene go!” was appreciated by SCSTM and a lot of parents, they both expected us to hold such a great event next year.
 
 DIY  Classroom
a)   Making a leaf vein bookmark
Based on cellulose, which plays an important part in our project, we set up our first course called “Making a leaf vein bookmark”. Through the process of making vein bookmarks, the children can easily recognize the toughness of the veins and learn about cellulose which plays an important role in it
b)   Making cell model with plasticine
The second course we set up called “Making cell model with plasticine”. We introduced the cell model to children simply and took them to make cell models with plasticine. Under our careful guidance, the children succeeded in making beautiful cell models. After class, the children said they were happy to learn the structure of cell today.
 Exploring the micro world
After finishing the course of “Making cell model with plasticine”, we led the children to observe the real cells with microscopes. We also offer different types of slices, taking them to operate the microscope and introduce related knowledge to them.
 “Cellulose Go” Stage Play
We have adapted our project “Straw-Degrading Energy E.coli” into a stage play called “Cellulose Go” to explain our project. In the play, our protagonist “Cellulose” is an adventurer who is aiming at exploring"
Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Practices#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html,"As public outreach was one of our main concerns during the summer we created a survey which we handed out to people from Austria and the UK after a presentation. We are a multinational team and so the comparison of the two countries was important for us. We worked out 8 questions concerning the public’s opinion about synthetic biology and genetic engineering
All in all 91 people took part in our survey: 55 Austrians and 36 people from the United Kingdom. We were able to reach persons of different age, ethnicity and education.
Figure 1The blue bar refers to Austria and the orange one to the United Kingdom. SA stands for Strongly Agree, A for Agree, NS for Not Sure, D for Disagree, SD for Strongly Disagree and NA for not applicable.
Most Austrians (63%) agree that they feel they know what synthetic biology is. In comparison to that more people from UK do not feel sure if they do (Fig.1). British even disagreed/strongly disagreed at this question. Overall it can be said that Austrians feel more informed about synthetic biology than the British.
Figure 2 The blue bar refers to Austria and the orange one to the United Kingdom. SA stands for Strongly Agree, A for Agree, NS for Not Sure, D for Disagree, SD for Strongly Disagree and NA for not applicable.
The UK bars strongly agree, agree and not sure hold the balance (Fig.2). Most British people think synthetic biology is a good thing. Also most Austrians feel positive about synthetic biology. Only a small part of people asked do not feel confident about synthetic biology.
Figure 3 The blue bar refers to Austria and the orange one to the United Kingdom. SA stands for Strongly Agree, A for Agree, NS for Not Sure, D for Disagree, SD for Strongly Disagree and NA for not applicable.
A huge part of Austrians and people from UK do not feel sure about using products made with genetic engineering (Fig.3). Thus more educational work should be done in both countries to provide more information. However, only a small stake of people asked would completely refuse to use products produced by GMOs.
Figure 4 The blue bar refers to Austria and the orange one to the United Kingdom. SA stands for Strongly Agree, A for Agree, NS for Not Sure, D for Disagree, SD for Strongly Disagree and NA for not applicable.
In Austria as well as in the UK people asked (strongly) agree that they feel confident about using genetic engineering for medical purposes (Fig.4). Only a few percent of people of both"

introducing synthetic biology to professionals in this field. As well, we want to invite and inspire international beekeeping experts to relate to this newly emerging field.
To achieve this, we received an invitation from this national association to the XXVI International Apicola Update Congress 2019 from ANMVEA, A.C. to present this new science branch and our project in next year´s congress.
With an event of such major, we want to spread knowledge and to dialog with people who may have doubts about science. Therefore, we will be attending to the next year's invitation to the ExpoChihuahua Convention Center on May 22nd to generate knowledge and acceptance in people outside the lab.
We hope not only to spread knowledge but to get to know what people think about synthetic biology and the techniques it is using to try to contribute something good to the environment. We want to keep going with this project that’s why we look to keep engaging the community even when the Giant Jamboree has already taken place.
By assisting, we expect to learn more about bees and to implement everything international experts teach us to enhance our project and our social panorama with the rest of the community.
Here we annex the invitation ANMVEA, A.C. sent us in Spanish and below it, you can find the translation in English!

The protocols for fabricating microfluidic devices with the Neptune workflow are as follows:  Specify:
1.) Come up with a microfluidic chip idea!
2.) Write the idea out in terms of Liquid Flow Relations using the provided library of microfluidic components in the form of the User Constraints File.
[**optional**] Adjust the parameters of microfluidic components the UCF to fit the needs of the experiment. This enables rapid prototyping in that if one component needs to be edited, a change in one number can adjust all instances of a component on all subsequent designs!
3.) Let μShroomMapper convert the LFR to the more descriptive microfluidic language, MINT.
Design:
[**optional**] If necessary, make any precise edits to the MINT file (similar to editing parameters on the UCF, this is a method of rapidly prototyping designs; changing one number here will change the specifications of one specific instance of the microfluidic component of the design)
1.) Let Fluigi convert the MINT to the blueprint files depicting your microfluidic chip!

Human Practice
UT-Tokyo team set 2 goals for Human Practice in this year;
1. To make better circumstances of Japanese teams’ experiments and management
2. To familiarize Synthetic Biology more in general public
The motivations of these goals are as follows;
1.  In the present condition, some Japanese teams do not have enough support from universities orcompanies   and   it   directly   links   to   the   quality   of   projects. In order to develop Japanese teams’ projects, we thought it is necessary to make circumstances in which Japanese teams can have more support.
2.  In Japan, the word, ‘synthetic biology’, ‘genetic transformation’ is not broadly accepted with favored not understood fully. For future development of synthetic biology, we thought it is important toeducate general public.
The following is what we did in order to achieve these goals.
Foundation of iGEM-Japan
In this year, UT-Tokyo  founded iGEM-Japan with   other   seven   Japanese   teams   (HokkaidoU_Japan,  Tokyo-Tech, TMU-Tokyo, Tokyo-NoKoGen, KAIT-Japan, Osaka, Kyoto) and cooperated each other. As the result, we are offered a lot of reagents for free from Promega Corporation and also aided by IKEDA SCIENTIFIC Co., Ltd. These results were great help for us. We think it led to make the basement where iGEM is broadly accepted as the number of companies supporting us increased
Educational Activity
1. Educational Activity for general public
In order to familiarize synthetic biology and iGEM to general public, UT-Tokyo joined many eventsand did poster sessions or presentations.  For example, we explained about our projects and synthetic biology in school festivals at the University of Tokyo, and spoke on the future of syntheticbiology in Career Discovery Seminar, which was held by Leave a Nest Co., Ltd.
2. Educational Activity for high school students
It is also important to educate high school students, So, we joined Science Castle, which was the poster"

DBCO-PEG4-NHS Ester (Dibenocyclooctyne-Polyethylene glycol-N-Hydroxysuccinimide), which covalently binding to polymer membrane.
pAzF(p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine), a rare amino acid that would be implemented in bacterial transmembrane protein biosynthesis.
In order to introduce pAzF into bacterial transmembrane protein, we need to mutate one of transmembrane protein, which is called COMPX. COMPX is able to form mutatedly with a special tRNA. The plasmid containing tRNA as following:
Covalent binding between DBCO and pAzF goes as following:
To see more about constitution of our adhesion system, please refer to Notebook-Protocol-Adhesion Preparation
Mutation of Transmembrane Protein OMPx in E. coli
OMPx is a intergral outer membrane protein X from Escherichia coli, belonging to a family of highly conserved bacterial protein that promote bacterial adhesion to and entry into mamalian cells. Besides, these proteins as well play an important role in the resistance against attack by human complement system.
The modified COMPX structure is illustrated as below:
As planned, OMPx will be mutated at residue 16, from glycine to p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine, zooming in the mutated site in orange:
The Covalent Reaction Model
Consequently, the model of adhesion goes like this: modifed bacterial containing special p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine transformed tRNA carry OMPx with mutated p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine site. The laminated side in pAzF will covalently bind to alkynyl in DBCO-PEG4-NHS ester, and consequently form chemical reaction.
Optical Interference Module
What is Optical Interference?
Interference, in general physics, is a phenomenon when two waves superpose to form a resultant wave with a greater or lower amplitude, respectively called as constructive interference and destructive interference.
As for optical interference, because of high frequency of light waves(about 10^14 HZ), is it impossible to detect using current detector. Instead, only the intensity of an optical interference patteren can be observed, which is proportional to the square of the average amplitude of the wave.
The requirements of light source should be monochromatic, which means waves have a single frequency. Generally, a laser beam, in reality"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"5] (Fig.2, step 1)
Integral membrane proteins forming β-barrel structures are prone to aggregate in aqueous environments. Therefore, after they transit a Sec channel, chaperones are required to bind OMPs to transfer them through the periplasmic compartment, while keeping them in an unfolded state to prevent aggregation.(Fig.2, step 2) The periplasmic chaperone, SurA has been shown to transfer most of the OMPs to the OM.[6] It has been shown that SurA directly participates in Bam-mediated OMP assembly by associating with BamA POTRA domain.[7] (Fig.2, step 3)
Final folding takes place in BAM complex. However, the mechanism how BAM complex catalyzes the insertion of β-barrel proteins into the OM still remains not fully understood. Structure analysis implies that the cavity seems to be too small to accomodate a fully folded OMP substrate, even though it is large enough to house couple of substrate β-hairpins.[2] (Fig.2, step 4)Based on the structure, it has been suggested that the rotation of the ring-like structure by POTRA domains and lipoproteins leads to the opening of a junction between the first and last β-strands of the BamA β-barrel (lateral gate) which promotes the insertion of OMPs into the lipid bilayer.[8] (Fig. 2, step 5)
Our approach
In order to reconstitute the fully working Bam complex we relied on the mechanisms elucidated before. SurA is a periplasmic chaperone which binds to unfolded β-barrel proteins and retains them in unfolded state, thus preventing aggregation. BamB or BamD lipoproteins can bind BamA-SurA, direct the complex to the membrane, and catalyze BamA insertion as well as correct folding in the membrane. [9] (Fig. 3, step 1) Knowing that in bacteria most of the Bam lipoproteins are found in BAM complex and full five proteins complex can be purified with one tag without any cross-links, we expected high complex association constants among the components (Fig.3, step 2) and hypothesized that BAM complex could be assembled in vitro simply by encapsulating BamA-SurA associatives and Bam lipoproteins.

Current trends and methods in B. subtilis transformation were analyzed, with competency rates ranging from 104 to 107 transformants per microgram (Zhang & Zhang, 2013) . One method utilized xylose in conjunction with the pAX01-comK plasmid to overexpress the competency regulator gene, ComK, in B. subtilis and create ""supercompetent cells"" (Zhang & Zhang, 2013) . This yielded the highest transformation rate among the methods studied (Zhang & Zhang, 2013) .
Other members of our team developed the basis for a ""genetic circuit"" which could detect the DNA of pathogens upon uptake by a competent bacterial cell.
Week 4: May 20-23
Literature searches were conducted on the regulation of competence in B. subtilis. We contacted Dr. Zhang and requested the pAX01-comK plasmid, also making sure to ask if only certain strains of B. subtilis can be made supercompetent. Dr. Zhang stated that any 168 derivative strain could be made supercompetent and told us to request the necessary plasmid from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Centre. Further literature searches were conducted to find the best plasmids to induce competency in B. subtilis. A highly experienced B. subtilis researcher at the University of Calgary, Dr. Wong, was contacted in order to gain more information on B. subtilis and hopefully acquire a supercompetent B. subtilis strain.
Following the decision to use B. subtilis as the platform for our in-vivo diagnostic tool, we officially divided our team into two groups: the Transformers and the Detectives. The goal of the former is to facilitate high transformation rates in B. subtilis, while the goal of the latter is to develop and tweak the pathogen detection system.
Week 5: May 25-30
We attended the Alberta Innovates Technology Futures workshops hosted by geekStarter in order to learn more about policy & practices, presentation skills, current trends in synthetic biology, and 3D digital modelling. Speakers included Kelly Drinkwater of iGEM, Cesar Rodriguez of Autodesk, and David Lloyd of FredSense. Following the presentations, the speakers provided useful feedback on our project from both a scientific and human practices perspective. We also met the Lethbridge iGEM team and was introduced to their project.

S. pyogenes (figure 2b) was treated with the same concentrations as B. subtilis. At 21 h, both concentrations of apidaecin produced a decrease in OD600 compared to the untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) control. With the lowest concentration of total proteins with apidaecin OD600 decreases in 10.2% and with the highest one it decreases in 12.45%.
Figure 6. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing results for apidaecin. a) B. subtilis challenged with low (LC) and high (HC) concentrations of total proteins of transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) with apidaecin and total proteins of untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3). b) S. pyogenes challenged with low (LC) and high (HC) concentrations of total proteins of transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) with apidaecin and total proteins of untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3).
With the development of the antimicrobial susceptibility testing, it was observed that there was partial inhibition by both total protein extracts. It is probable that some proteins of E. coli BL21 (DE3) are toxic for B. subtilis and S. pyogenes, which allowed their inhibition. However, the protein extracts of the bacteria transformed with the composite for the expression of apidaecin showed greater inhibition, supporting the premise that the peptide is present and its activity is as expected. B. subtilis was found to be more susceptible to total protein extract with apidaecin than S. pyogenes at the end of 21 h. However, both bacteria were inhibited in a certain percentage by this extract compared to the negative control of the total protein extract of the non-transformed bacteria.

We made the cells competent using a protocol from the Penn iGEM 2012 team.  Once transformed with our construct, a single colony was used to grow a liquid culture. Expression was induced with 1M IPTG and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15%. The cells were then grown overnight at 37 °C.  The following day the cells were incubated for 8h in a faecal bacterial “cocktail” kindly provided by Dr. Arjan Narbad at the UK Institute of Food Research. The bacterial cocktail contained the following strains: Enterococcus faecalis GB 122, Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343, Bacteroides ovatus V975, Bifidobacterium bifidum NCIB 8807, E. coli K12 MG1655, Clostridium perfringens DSM 11780 and Lactobacillus gasseri DSM 20243. Growth media for this experiment (adjusted to pH 7.0 using 1M HCl and boiled under oxygen-free nitrogen for 15 minutes to provide anoxic conditions) were also provided to us by Dr. Arjan Narbad.  Following an 8 hour incubation the cells were centrifuged for 4 minutes and the supernatant was filter-sterilized. The supernatant was then analyzed using the Liquid Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer protocol.
RESULTS:
Figure 1: In non-induced (no IPTG added) control, no peak corresponding to butyryl coA can be seen.
Figure 2: In the induced sample there is a peak that does not correspond to the standard. It is unlikely that this peak is butyryl CoA. Further investigations are needed to determine if this might be a derivative or if this is experimental noise.

To combat this problem we have hosted an event with iGEM Stockholm and Lund which shed light on the growing problem of burnouts and how to prevent them. To further spread the knowledge we have published a booklet about it! The booklet is a summary of useful guidelines and techniques to prevent team members from burn outs. It also speaks about the current situation in iGEM which we have summarised after performing an international survey with answers from current team members and previous team members all over the world.

Here we should start to suggest actual 'real' parts that we can use to implement our designed system. Its important we begin to define a list because:
It will provide a list of parts for Megan to populate the repository
A constrained parts list will narrow down the search space for the genetic algorithm
It will provide a focus for the determining interactions and their parameters for the constraints repository.
It will help push the design process
We intend to design and implement a neural network to classify the quorum sensing profile presented as an input. The neural network will produce a defined output. This involves parts for the input layer, hidden layer and the output layer.
It is important that the normal Bacillus signaling machinery doesn't interfere with the neural net and vice-versa. Therefore the components either need to be sourced from bugs sufficiently taxonomically different from Bacillus, from systems that Bacillus doesn't have or encapsulated. One idea is to use a sporulation deficient mutant. We can then use various sporulation and germination genes including sigma factors.
Jan-Willem has sent a list of possibilities for the parts list :

Input Layer
The parts for the input layer really depend on what we want to sense.
The way in which quorum sensing peptides are act as inputs to cellular signalling pathways depends on the actual peptide. Some such as the PapR peptide act directly to activate a transcription factor by binding to it. e.g. PapR binds to PlcR (see http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/104/47/18490 ).
Others such as aip act by activating a two-component sensing system that in turn activates a transcriptional regulator e.g. See Cambridge 2007 entry .
We need an import system e.g. Opp to bring in the peptide. If this is non-specific we can possibly miss out the two component system.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
As the first modern university in China, Tianjin University has a history of 120 years. However, our School of Life Sciences is very young and fresh, which was founded in 2012. Though our college is so young, we have made many achievements owing to the great supports given by our university and the hard work of our professors and graduates.
This year is the first year when our school took part in the iGEM competition. The recruitment included all undergraduates in our university. After resume screening, audition and a tough winter vacation work which required candidates to submit a complete project design with protocols, 22 students were chosen as the members of team Tianjin 2015.
Our team consists of students majoring in life sciences, chemical/pharmaceutical/biological engineering, computer science, and even electric engineering. In particular, Yifan Zhang in computer science is from Zhejiang Sci-tech University. We are divided into four groups which are responsible for wet lab, wiki&design, modeling and human practice.
In our iGEM journey, our instructors always give us great help, and many graduates shared their experience with us. Since all of us are green hands in biological research, a small step for our project could be a gaint leap for ourselves. No matter what the result is, we have spent a happy and fulfilling time all together.
It is the second time for Ketong to take part in iGEM. And this year not many people would play jokes on him because he has become the team leader and usually shows his straight face. He doesn't like pretty loli anymore, but he still loves female.
Dongqi is another leader in our team. She is lazy in body but hardworking in mind. Larry in the book The Razor's Edge is her idol.
Jiashu is a gentle nice girl, and everyone is impressed with her warm smile. Meanwhile, she is often called Boss by Junjie Yu because she could conduct biological experiments perfectly.

Project Overview
Introduction
Microbial Fuel Cell
Electrochemical devices, such as batteries and fuel cells, are broadly used in electronics to convert chemical energy into electrical energy. A Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) is an open system electrochemical device, consisting of two chambers; an anode chamber and a cathode chamber, which are separated by a proton exchange membrane, as illustrated in Figure 12. Both the anode and the cathode in an MFC can use various forms of graphite as base material and in the anode chamber, microbes are utilised as catalysts to convert organic matter into metabolic products, protons, and electrons Khanal YLaSK. Microbial Fuel Cells, Capter 19. In: Khanal. EbYLaSK, editor. Bioenergy: Principles and Applications. First Edition ed: Published 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.; 2016. . This is carried out through metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, thereby generating ATP needed to maintain cellular life. This metabolic pathway also releases electrons, which are carried by NAD+ in its reduced form, NADH.
Figure 12. A microbial fuel cell utilising glucose as substrate. The glucose is consumed to protons, electrons, and CO2. The electrons are transferred to the anode while the protons diffuse over the proton exchange membrane. A gradient causes the electrons to flow through an external load to the cathode, which generates an electrical current.
Under aerobic conditions, the generated NADH will deliver its electron as part of the electron transfer chain, thereby returning to its oxidised form NAD+. Under anaerobic conditions the electron transport chain will be unable to continue, which will cause the generated NADH to accumulate, and as a consequence, the concentration of available NAD+ for glycolysis will decrease. This will drive the cell to carry out other metabolic pathways, such as fermentation, in order to maintain its ATP levels. Instead, the accumulating NADH generated under anaerobic conditions, can be utilised to drive an electrical current by depositing the retrieved electrons to an anode coupled with an appropriate cathode. The cathode catalyst in an MFC will usually catalyse the reaction of 2 H+ + ½ O2 per H2O. The transfer of electrons from NADH to the anode can be executed in three different ways, as shown in Figure 13: red"

iv)
We currently have D# (Lsr Holin), but not an endolysin needed to complete the Holin-Endolysin lysis system. In case our Art-E part (M#) again fails to successfully be cloned, procure BBa_K112806 [pSB1C3] from the 2015 Distribution Kit (Plate 3, Well 12K) and transform into DH5alpha. Subsequently we can potentially insert a promoter in front of it to complete the lysis system.
Colonies formed and the plate was transferred to the cold room.
v)
Since B* failed to PCR to give the Synbiota LasR and pLas parts that we needed, we will instead obtain them from the Distribution Kit as well. They are both in pSB1C3, LasR being BBa_C0179 in Plate 3 Well 6M, and pLas being BBa_R0079 in Plate 3 Well 5C respectively.
Colonies formed and the plates were transferred to the cold room.

Somewhere along the way a second set of primers to make a nickel binding peptide was made and ordered, so we now have nickel 1 (Ni1) and nickel 2 (Ni2). The 2Ni primer insert was annealed and ligated into pGEX then transformed into DH5.
""ω-3"" Weekly Summary
We received our sequencing results from our preliminary BioBrickTM this week, and ---- nothing. The insert has a 99% protein match when using BLAST; unfortunately, this match is to a mevalonate kinase of a trypanosome that we haven’t been using. Some sleuthing in slabs and moving of freezers uncovers the sad truth: the vector we have been using since week 1 was not in fact empty. So 4.5 weeks of work amount to 4.5 weeks of gaining lab experience, but no more.
There is some good news among the bad, however. The genomic data we ordered for Synechocystis sp. won’t arrive until the end of July, but Dr Markus Gierth at the University of Cologne was kind enough to send us some of his colonies. Excited as we were to receive green smears, it also gave us additional DNA sources.  After a Taq colony PCR, we ran high-fidelity PCRs to isolate our genes of choice. At the same time, we are also cloning D6 from L. major and T. cruzi. We hope that this simultaneous approach will give us fast results to make up for the time we have lost.
Week 6
""Metal Binding Protein"" Weekly Summary
We checked out the optical density (OD) of the six colonies (three each, 1Ni, Pd and Pt) we had grown up over the weekend. When these were all between 0.5 and 0.8 we added IPTG to induce enhanced expression of GST in our plasmid. These were left for 3 hrs and then the results run on a protein gel and stained overnight before being destained in the morning. This presented prominent bands at 26KDa.  This meant we were able to use the remainder of the lysed cells that had been run on the gel to run another one and this time attempt a western blot As we did this we also used colony PCR to discover that our 2Ni colonies did not contain our insert, so these were re-ligated into the pGEX vector and transformed into DH"
USTC,2009,Team:USTC Software#WhatDemo_-_-_TEXT.html," if the steady-state concentration of the negative regulator B is proportional to that of the positive regulator <math>A</math>, the equation determining the steady-state value of <math>C</math>, <math>dC/dt=0</math>, would be independent of <math>A</math> and hence of the input <math>I</math>. In this case, the equation for node <math>B</math> generates the condition under which the steady-state value <math> B^*</math> would be proportional to <math>A^*</math>: the first term in <math>dB/dt</math> equation should depend on <math>A</math> only and the second term on <math>B</math> only. The condition can be satisfied if the first term is in the saturated region region
<math>((1-B)\gg K_{AB})</math>
and the second in the linear region
<math>B\ll K_{F_{B}B}^{^{\prime }}</math>,
leading to
<math>\begin{align} B^{\ast }=A^{\ast }\cdot k_{AB}K_{F_{B}B}^{^{\prime }}/(F_{B}k_{F_{B}B}^{^{\prime }}) \\ \end{align}\,\!</math>
This relationship, established by the equation for node <math>B</math>, shows that the steady-state concentration of active <math>B</math> is proportional to the steady-state concentration of active <math>A</math>. Thus <math>B</math> will negatively regulate <math>C</math> in proportion to the degree of pathway input. This effect of <math>B</math> acting as a proportioner node of <math>A</math> can be graphically gleaned from the plot of the <math>B</math> and <math>C</math> nullclines (Figure feedforward). In this case, maintaining a constant <math>C^{\ast }</math> requires the B nullcline to move the same distance as the <math>C</math> nullcline in response to an input change. Here again, the sensitivity of the circuit (the magnitude of the transient response) depends on the ratio of the speeds of the two signal transduction branches:
<math> A\longrightarrow C</math>
and
<math>A\longrightarrow B-|C</math>,
which can be independently tunedfrom the adaptation precision.
