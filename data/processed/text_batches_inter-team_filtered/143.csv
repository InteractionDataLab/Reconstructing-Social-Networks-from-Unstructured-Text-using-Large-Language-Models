And our special guest, Will Wright, the Europeen Ambassador of iGEM, also presented and talked to the teams on the experience of iGEM and After iGEM.
To illustrate this day, we had the pleasure to host Nais Coq , a science and event illustration artist. You can find all her drawings on our Twitter account under the #parisianmeetup #iGEM2018 #drawiGEM . After a Ph.D. in Physical fluids and a short Post-Doc, she decided to come back to her true passion, drawing, and started her career in illustration and scientific drawing.

iGEM Aix Marseille Université – Summer Mediterranean MeetUp
Organized by the iGEM Aix Marseille Université team, the summer Mediterranean MeetUp took place in the CNRS lab of Marseille, gathering 8 French teams and two Spanish teams. On Thursday, the event started with a 180 second presentation of the projects, followed by questions by the Jury. Unfortunately, the weather changed the afternoon plans, instead of visiting Marseille under the hail, we got to know each other around card games. On Friday we attended a round table on bioethics to question the risks of our project. We also had the chance to meet the Ambassador Thea Chrysostomou and discuss with her about our project. In the afternoon, we presented our project to various researchers during the poster session. It was a very interesting and challenging task.
All in all, it was a great opportunity to meet new teams and to discuss with teams that came to our meetup, about the improvement each team had made over the summer. We managed to discuss with other iGEMers and to share tips between teams in a friendly atmosphere.

We’ve done a lot of practices in Engagement, including field investigation, education, consulting and special work.
For the purpose of sparking new scientific curiosity and establishing a public dialogue about synthetic biology outside the lab. We supported education of science at Elementary School; set up an Academic Salon; gave a lecture of our project introduction to students and held a biological competitive game“Running Bio-man”.
In field investigation, we went to pesticides plant and made a survey among the peasants to know pesticides situation. Meanwhile, through conferences and communications, we got useful feedback to improve our project design.
Notablely, we did a special work to reflect the situation and problems of iGEM teams in China.

Field investigation in Xinghua fertilizer plant
For the purpose of grasping current market conditions of pesticides, we visited Xinghua industry, a manufacturing plant dedicated to producing agricultural fertilizer, pesticides and some other industrial chemicals. We consulted the agricultural service bureau in Wugong district and the pesticide dealer in Chengguan district and obtained precious information like the application range, price and sales of agricultural pesticides as well as the local weeds distribution.

Investigation of the current situation in fertilizer plant
Nowadays, Herbicides can be used not only for crops, but also for weeding the lawn in horticulture.
For the purpose of investigating current market conditions of pesticides, we visited Xinghua industry, a manufacturing plant dedicated to producing agricultural fertilizer, pesticides and some other industrial chemicals.
As is widely acknowledged that glyphosate is the most common-used pesticides at present in China, which is recognized as a product with good effect, low cost and less harm. But contaminant such as ammonia will be created in productive process. Also, glyphosate has a strong pungent odor which is still strong after being diluted 30 times. And when it contacts with skin, it can easily cause skin allergic redness and swelling during the spraying.
We also consulted the agricultural service bureau in Wugong and"

Collaborations
We believe that our experience in iGEM should go beyond our own projects to learn more from others and disseminate our ideas. Having received some generous help from other iGEM teams, we figured that we should also try our best to give a helping hand to those teams in need. Here in the Collaborations page, you will see the highlights of our interactions with other teams.
With Worldshaper-XSHS/Worldshaper-Wuhan/ASTWS-China
We were very lucky to work with these amazing teams to spread our ideas and engage with public in Zhejiang Science&Technology Museums. We successfully induced attention from public and evoked children’s interest in biology and biochemistry by performing some eye catching experiments in front of them. Our efforts were even on some local magazines after the successful event.
To learn more about the event, visit our Human Practice page.
With Team Worldshaper-XSHS
During our interlab study, we encountered difficulty attempting to extract enough DNA from the distribution kit plates to transform our competent cells. We have tried to optimize the standard transformation protocols by pipetting more diluted DNA into the competent cell culture and centrifuging the plate in order to promote further dilution, but still transformed cell colonies can hardly be obtained. Consequently, we suspected that the DNA plate could be contaminated or corrupted.
Under this circumstance, we reached out to several other iGEM 2017 teams nearby for help with the transformation. Eventually we got in touch Worldshaper-XSHS  which was willing to help us by providing transformed cells and hoped to use the plate reader in our lab for data collection.

FAU_Erlangen,2016,Team:FAU Erlangen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," first showed a few scenes from the “Jurassic World” movie trailer. To give this frightening side a counterpart, we presented the real methods and applications of contemporary genetic engineering. We divided the lecture into four parts: green (agriculture), red (medicine), gray (environment) genetic engineering and last but not least, information about the iGEM competition, both in general and regarding specific projects, including our own “Coli-voltaic”.
Filip started by showing the audience how “near” we are to cloning dinosaurs by introducing Dolly, the cloned sheep. Continuing with the green part, he explained, among other things, the difference between traditional breeding and modern genetic procedures and described the impact the latter had on agriculture at the moment, exemplified by the Golden Rice issue.
In the next part of the lecture, Hedda talked about genetic methods in modern medicine, telling the listeners about the different fields of application like tissue engineering and production of medicines, illustrated by the development of insulin production.
On gray genetic engineering, Vladyslav presented some positive developments in environment protection achieved by utilizing genetic methods. For example, he mentioned removing petroleum from the sea after oil spills and cleaning the wastewater of medicine residues. To lead over to the last part, he described the iGEM project of Bielefeld in 2012 that aimed at removing synthetic estrogen from wastewater.
Before the end, Ariane explained what iGEM is and what competing in iGEM means, trying to demonstrate how it combines all three previously covered parts of genetic engineering by introducing three successful former iGEM projects who founded startups afterwards.
For the grand finale, we showed our home-made Coli-voltaic cartoon to the audience, presenting our own project and goals for this year.
Subsequently, the attendees had the opportunity to ask all they wanted to know about our presentation and the topics addressed as well as talk to us individually. This resulted in a short discussion about genetic engineering in agriculture with some of the school’s teachers. Moreover, we even found some candidates for our team next year.
As a token of gratitude, we were kindly given a bottle of tasty Spanish red wine by the school’s representatives. Interestingly, the wine was biologically produced, mirroring the teachers’ main opinion about genetic engineering in farming.
What we learned from this evening while talking about synthetic biology to a curious audience, is that there is, indeed, a great demand for clear and objective information about genetic engineering, its methods and how it affects the individual and the environment. Also, there are many more concerns about green biotechnology than about any other, regarding not only ecological"

ONE BELT AND ROAD Microbiome International Forum
From April 14th to 16th, 2017, we attended the ONE BELT AND ROAD microbiome International Forum held in Lanzhou University. During the intermission of the forum, we communicated with Researcher Li Xiangzhen and Professor Shen Xihui. Both of them spoke highly of our novel project design, meanwhile they recommended us try to improve the stress-resistance of engineered bacteria, because E.coli are not suitable in living in drought environment. We took this into consideration in our later experiment design.

Nonetheless, when Hill’s coefficient (n) is adjusted to a value smaller than 2 and ‘a’ is set to be smaller than 1, the three stable points disappear and reduce to a single intersection, which indicates that under the above condition, the system no longer exhibits tristability. We therefore conclude that for the Tristable Switch to attain tristability, the following constraints must be satisfied:"

Once the process was completed the DNA was transferred to the -20°C freezer for storage.
Promoter Library Sub-Project
Introduction
So far, the work involved in this sub-project has seen pGFP-rrnB plasmid DNA digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and NheI. The resulting 8kb DNA fragment was then extracted by firstly running the digested DNA through agarose gel in electrophoresis and then by excising the heavies band formed. The fragment DNA was then extracted from this removed piece of agarose by gel extraction kit and the 50ul of resulting DNA was stored in the -20C freezer.
When running the digested pGFP-rrnB plasmid DNA though the gel to extract the 8Kb fragment, we did not see the bands expected to be seen. Therefore another restriction enzyme digestion of the pGFP-rrnB DNA with EcoRI and NheI was attempted (with different concentrations of the enzymes and DNA). In addition more pGFP-rrnB DNA was digested but with EcoRI and NheI separately. All of the resulting digests were stored in the -20C freezer.
In today's experiments we hope to run 10ul of pGFP-rrnB treated with EcoRI and 10ul of pGFP-rrnB + NheI on some agarose gel for analysis. Additionally, 5ul of the 8Kb pGFP-rrnB digest fragment should be run on the gel.
DNA gel Electrophoresis of samples
0.8% agarose gel was prepared and poured in the manner exhibited in the DNA gel electrophoresis protocol . Once this step had been carried out, the DNA samples (once dye had been added) were loaded in the wells as follows:
Lane 1 - blank
Lane 2 - 8ul HindIII DNA ladder
Lane 3 - 10ul of pGFP-rrnB + EcoRI
Lane 4 - 10ul of pGFP-rrnB + NheI
Lane 5 - 5ul of the pGFP-rrnB 8Kb fragment
Lane 6 - 8ul HindIII DNA ladder
The gel electrophoresis was run for 20-30 minutes under 70mv; once stopped the gel was taken to the dark room for analysis.

We determined that only colony 1 of the phasin-HlyA tag had successfully received a plasmid with our part, as seen in Figure 1 below. Our other parts were not successfully transformed into our cells, which indicates that our ligation or transformation of SP1 and SP2 into E. coli DH5α had failed.
Figure 1: Screening results of colony 1 of DH5α transformed with pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA Tag. Plasmid from the colony was digested with EcoRI-HF and SpeI (DD) then run on a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 30 minutes. The molecular ladder (L) is visible on the far left and the expected band sizes, obtained from Benchling Virtual Digest, are visible on the right. Undigested plasmid (U) was used as a control and the digests from colony 1 (which had successfully received our part) are visible in lanes 3-4.
Week 11 (July 10- July 14, 2017)
Colony 1 Phasin-HlyA Tag was sequenced and confirmed that these cells do in fact contain pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA Tag. Consequently, we miniprepped DH5α colonies containing our pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA plasmid and transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3), which we will use for protein expression. We also transformed E. coli DH5ɑ with a PHB synthesis biobrick, PhaCAB ( Part:BBa_K934001 ) present in the iGEM 2017 distribution kit. This was done to establish a PHB-producing cell line and we do not have to wait for the Synthesis subgroup to finish their molecular cloning before we can begin testing the secretion of PHB.
On Friday, July 14 Kaitlin and some of the other iGEM team members visited the Grades 7-9 Minds in Motion summer camp at the University of Calgary. With the children, they discussed the potential implications of genetic engineering for the future and performed a strawberry DNA extraction experiment. The plans/"

Studying: Bachelor of Biomedical Science, Specialising in Toxicology Interests: The power of toxics to stun, paralyze and in some cases kill the organisms prey or predators is quite amazing. The smallest drop of toxin is made up of thousands of different drugs all designed to stop and kill the organism to infects. By isolating and manupulating these lethal drugs, we can design new beneficial drugs using the power of millions of years of evolution which has carefully crafted the most effective peptides to bind to and elict either positve or harmful responses. This power is absolutely amazing and is why I jumped at the chance to get some real world labatory experience from this competition. My others interests are in fishing, rock climbing and I´m a complete sports nut.

Interlab Study
Strain Construction
Being a part of the measurement track requires participation in the Interlab Study. In the Interlab Study, GFP is used as a reporter protein to measure promoters of the Anderson library. Using standard assembly BioBrick BBa_E0240 was ligated with the 15 promoters from the Anderson promoter library, which had been provided in pSB1C3 with the distribution kit. The plasmids were purified with Zyppy miniprep kit by Zymo and verified by restriction analysis . The verified plasmids were sequenced using EZ-Seq by Macrogen. Strains containing plasmids verified by sequencing were added to our glycerol stock for use in future measurements.
The reason for only applying 15 of the Anderson promoters, was that the remaining 5 was not available in the standard iGEM backbone pSB1C3 with chloramphenicol resistance. To ease future use of the Anderson library we intended to introduce the remaining 5 promoters into the iGEM standard backbone pSB1C3, see parts .
Measurement
Two measurements were performed as part of the Interlab Study:
Culture measurements
Single cell measurements with a flow cytometer
Cultures of the constructed strains, were grown and measured in a BioLector . The BioLector incubates the cultures with shake and temperature control and measures OD600 and fluorescence from each well with defined time intervals.
Measurements at single cell level was performed using flow cytometry . Cultures were made by inoculating fresh LB media with 10 μl overnight culture. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 hours and measurements were made by diluting the culture until approximately 1000 events per second were achieved.
Policy and Practices
Target Group Identification and Strategy
We wanted our public outreach to have a streamlined profile, and therefore we wanted a clear target group and objective. As synthetic biology is a fairly complex field young students are not introduced to the subject until very late in their education. This limits their opportunity to make an informed decision as to whether it should be their chosen career path. We therefore wanted to target younger students in their final years of primary education or in the secondary educational system. At this level of education the students have not yet obtained the necessary biological knowledge to fully understand synthetic biology. We therefore chose to focus our strategy on inspiration. We argued that inspiring the students is an essential step towards getting them interested in the field of synthetic biology.

Outside the lab we are putting the finishing touches on our Project Description, which we must send to the people at iGEM by Monday. We also spent a bit of time discussing what we would like to put on the poster we have to make for the jamboree. All in all a great week, here's hoping that next week will be as successful as this one!

Spaghetti and restrictions
A lot of stuff got done in the lab today as well. It feels like we are really on the right track now. My group, the Repressor group, did some restrictions that we will hopefully be able to transform tomorrow. The Antiterminator group did ligations, ligating parts to the pSB1C3 backbone plasmid, which is the plasmid you use to submit parts to the Parts registry. The ligations were also transformed and we'll see tomorrow if they were successful.
Today we also started our ”spaghetti” meetings. That included some nice spaghetti bolognese that Thomas and Annemi prepared for us. It was so good, and it was much easier to stay awake and focused during the late meeting with some food in your stomach.

Back in the lab!
When we started designing our approach to constructing our switch back at the beginning of June, I don't think anyone imagined how hectic the next 3 months would be. Highlights include redoing our approach twice, multiple tries at inserting FPs into plasmids, insane amounts of colony PCRs and lots of frustrations with the poor performance of our restriction enzymes. However, that is all in the past now. After realising that constructing our whole switch would be unrealistic, we designed our third and final plan, focusing on good characterization of our biobricks, as well as a couple of new standards for measuring other biobricks that will hopefully net us a gold medal at the jamboree! The plan included splitting ourselves into two groups, Repressor group and the Antiterminator group, enabling us to work on two very different parts of our switch. The repressor group will funnily enough be working with the repressors GogR and GtgR and their interactions with the Gifsy1 and 2 promoters and antirepressors. The Antiterminator group will be"

Background
Subtilin
Subtilin is a small antimicrobial peptide (AMP) which belongs to the class of lanthionine-containing antibiotics (lantibiotics). These are heat-stable, ribosomally synthesized molecules with a molecular weight below 4 kDa. Their main characteristic is the high proportion of unusual amino acids, synthesized by post-translational side-chain modifications of precursor peptides. Most prominent examples are the polycyclic thioether amino acids, lanthionine and β–methyllanthionine and a number of dehydrated amino acids such as dehydroalanine (Dha) and dehydrobutyrine (Dhb). Lantibiotics are promising candidates for future antimicrobials, as they inhibit the growth of many clinically relevant pathogens comprising even multidrug-resistant bacteria. Moreover, lantibiotics have only low tendency to generate resistance. Both features make them highly attractive for medical applications. [1 ] [2 ]
Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the structure of the lantibiotic subtilin. Dha represents a dehydroalanine residue, Dhb represents a dehydrobutirine residue, and Abu represents a dehydrobutirine residue that has formed a thioether β-methyl-lanthionine bridge with a cysteine residue. [3 ]
The spaBTCSIFEGRK gene cluster
Fig. 2. Organisation of the subtilin biosynthetic gene cluster. [3 ]
As true for many other lantibiotics, the genes for the subtilin biosynthesis are clustered. For subtilin, there is even a reasonable arrangement within the cluster. The genes spaBTC play a role for the posttranslational modifications and the transport of subtilin. They are regulated by their own promotor PspaB and polycistronically transcribed. spaS encodes the propeptide, which is derived from a short monocistronic mRNA. The next transcription entity, spaIFEG, is coding for the immunity, whereas spaRK encodes a two-component-system that plays an important role for the regulation. What is missing in comparison to other lantibiotic gene clusters is a specific protease (encoded by lanP) that cleaves off the leader sequence. In Bacillus subtilis, this task is accomplished by unspecific extracellular proteases.

I got colonies in all the tubes except the GFP(E0040). So the colony scooped from the plate was not proper. So must be re-cultured. And stupid me, I labeled TetR (C0040) and cl (C0051) containing culture tubes as TetR. So I need to re-culture them from plates and oomph plates are getting overgrown colonies so was transferred fridge after covering with parafilm.

Collaborate with ZJU-China
Last year, team ZJU-China constructed a kind of reverse promoter which we designed to add to our biobricks this year. So they generously provide us with these biobricks. We appreciated ZJU-China very much and we are looking forward to further cooperation in the future.
They constructed two main circuits, first one expresses a serine integrase. This intergrase can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP, the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome. This recombination results in the reverse of the sequence between attB and attP, changing the two sites to attL and attR at the meantime. This inversion can be reversible by appropriately controlling the conditional expression of integrase and an excisionase in Bxb1 named gp47 at certain ratio. They change start codon ATG to GTG for a appropriate expression quantity.
Fig. 2.1 Gene circuit of serine integrase
The second one contains a switch, two reporters, two RBS and terminators. At first, the plasmid expresses GFP, when gp35 is expressed, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#CRISPR_-_-_TEXT.html," cut our Ferrochelatase PCR product target amplified in earlier weeks. This digestion was confirmed against the negative control without Cas9, and the commercial Cas9, as the Ferrochelatase was seen to be accurately cleaved into a 1000bp fragment and a 200bp fragment. Due to our efforts we have proven their mutant Cas9 is functional within E. coli , which helps to achieve their main goal of characterising their mutant Cas9 within bacterial systems.
Fig 24. Shown here is the result to test the effect of Cas9 on E. coli. It can seen here by the graph that the more cas9 there is within our cells the more toxic it becomes and the less they survive.
Cas9 electorporation procedure: Cas9-RNP complex was mixed with the electrocompetent cells, and electroporated as described in the protocols page. After recovering for 2 hours in SOC media, the cells were serially diluted (10-2, 10-4, 10-6) and plated out on M9-glucose and M9-glycerol plates for incubation at 37oC. The viable colony count was conducted, and colonies from the M9-glucose plates were patched plated onto another set of M9-glucose and M9-glycerol plates. Accumulation of PPIX was then measured for each colony to detect for possible hemH mutants."

Social Media Report
""I hate social media. I have Twitter, just so I can tell people what to buy.”
Louis C. K.
Introduction
As part of our iGEM project we wanted to raise awareness on synthetic biology. As such it seemed beneficial to have a successful social media strategy. The motivation for such a strategy came from the knowledge that social media in general has a large influence on people, especially the younger generation. Opportunities for green marketing: young consumers . Social Media Influencing Green Buying
Our Strategy
The design of our logo consisting of a light font and a picture of a leaf combined with an electrical plug, was determined in the start of April. We sought to make a simple logo that showed the essence of our project, The PowerLeaf, not only in name but in brand as well.
During spring we narrowed down the relevant hashtags of our Twitter and Instagram to #science, #igem, #sdu, #gmo, and #forsksdu. These hashtags were used at relevant occasions and generally helped expanding our reach on social media. A few times we even used a couple of silly hashtags like #adventuretime and #lifechoices when we found it appropriate.
A complete relaunch of our social media platforms was made in the start of April. One of the changes we made was the setup of the Facebook page and Twitter account, that we changed to resemble an enterprise.
Results
Looking at Figure 1 we see the number of followers on our Facebook page throughout the year. There is a sharp increase around the start of April, this correlate nicely with the relaunch of our social media. Since we started using the Facebook page on March 1st, we have seen an increase of followers on 44%.
Figure 2 shows the number of unique interactions with our Facebook posts each day. Some posts gained around 200 interactions per day, while the highest amount of interactions per day was seen at end of April. This high amount of interactions correlates with us being at the Danish Science Festival, where we inoculated bacteria from the fingers of the attendants on agar plates. The photo gallery of these plates was widely shared on our Facebook page, and it probably was the reason for the rise in amounts of interactions.
During the summer, we realised that an increasing fraction of our followers on Facebook were non-Danish speakers. Therefore, we set out to analyse the distribution of first languages among our followers seen in Figure 3, which showed that one in three of our followers were not speaking Danish as their first language.

Safety Questions
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
First of all, the safety of the researchers is guaranteed. In the molecular laboratory, many chemicals such as EB pose a threat to human beings, so we use chemicals with higher safety coefficients instead. For example, EB can be replaced by Gel Green and Gel Red. At the same time, we place and deal with the toxic chemicals in an isolated area in case we pollute other chemicals or laboratory items. Besides, we assign one person to do safety-checks every morning (before 8:00a.m.), every afternoon (12:00a.m.~1:30p.m.) and every night(after10:00p.m.) to reduce the possibility of safety problems.
Secondly, we insure public safety when we do experiments. Because many chemicals are toxic and many bacteria are resistant to antibiotics, chemicals and bacteria are taken in and out of the laboratory carefully. Apart from garbage or necessary things, everything taken into laboratory can’t be taken out in order to prevent toxic substances and transgenic bacteria from coming out of the laboratory.
Lastly, environmental safety is also considered. Before being discarded, all transgenic bacteria grown on the culture mediums is sterilized by autoclave so that transgenic bacteria won’t spread. Toxic garbage is dealt with carefully. All garbage is placed individually and recycled by a special department. There is someone who is responsible for storing and using antibiotics when they are needed and making sure that antibiotics aren’t taken out of the laboratory.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
All the frameworks of plasmids we use in iGEM are from MIT parts registry. Because there are antibiotic resistance genes on the plasmids, bacteria carrying the plasmids may recombine genes"

[note: the difference between ""top TS2"" and ""bottom TS2"" is that the gel had two bands for TS2]   The Gibson mix arrived and we followed the Gibson protocol to assemble the basic plasmid. We assembled two different plasmids. One with TS2u and one with TS2b. The difference is from the gel electroforesis. One band was slightly further down than the other.We did not know which was the right one, so we collected both.

Experiment: Extraction of amilCP from distribution kit
A liquid O/N culture were prepared from the plated amilCP transformants. Addionally, replating from the leftover media  from 7/8 were performed, as well as a clean streaking of a sucessfull transformant (from the LB Cam plates), as there were a low number of transformanants on the plates.

Only one of the Mix 2 plates had colonies. We will continue to grow these plates. One colony was cleanstreaked and one was incubated in an overnight culture. We will retry the Gibson assembly. This time we will start with 70 ng backbone and work from there.
We increased the incubation time to ~4 hours to maximize our chances of a successful assembly

Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Society#Questionnaire#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," shows that participants can not only learn about the field, but also contribute actively in the science.
These alumni also often went on to contribute further in the iGEM community, contributing to the sustainability of the organisation in the long-term.
There are some aspects of iGEM that we believe have been key to its success -
The focus on creating machines that solve problems or create innovations with applications in the real world seems to be really inspirational to students, creating a really memorable experience.
The freedom given to undergraduate students to participate in ‘PhD-style’ research gives them a valuable opportunity to find out whether or not they wish to work in academia, and also gives the students a chance to pursue the areas which interest them most within synthetic biology. This is arguably the best way to allow students to enjoy the experience as much as possible.
The encouragement to create novel projects pushes students to the edge of current research, allowing students to feel a real sense of pride for their achievements, and inspires work that is genuinely significant in the wider scientific community.
The target for outreach, undergraduate students, seems to be pitched to the right level. Within interdisciplinary teams, the students have a wide knowledge base, and are capable of both learning and understanding the challenging material without having to ‘dumb-down’ the science. However, the students are also at a stage in their career that is early enough for them to later specialise straightforwardly in synthetic biology before leaving education (for example, by undertaking a PhD in the subject).
The jamboree has been cited by many alumni as the best aspect of the competition - it is an international scientific conference on a very large scale, and the enthusiasm of the thousands of students present make it quite unique. It has been cited by some alumni as the one key event that really made them want to return in the future, and networking opportunities are well-utilised.
In addition, however, we believe some improvements could be made to really maximise the success of iGEM as an outreach programme for synthetic biology:
The importance of iGEM projects in the wider scientific community should be publicised by the organisation, with papers and conferences in which references have been made to iGEM projects highlighted. This is likely to inspire several other teams that have been successful in the iGEM competition to prepare similar publications, which could also be successful.
The opportunities for further involvement by iGEM alumni in other aspects of the iGEM community should be made clear, and alumni should be encouraged to participate. This is likely to be popular, since almost all the students appeared to have enjoyed their first experience.
Students from all backgrounds should be"

Guanajuato Mexico (GTO_Mexico)
This year, we collaborated with the Guanajuato Mexico team in developing a curriculum as an introduction to synthetic biology for university students. This curriculum covered the basics of biology, synthetic biology, and its applications. We specifically designed a lesson plan on the ethics of synthetic biology followed by a debate on the justification of using synthetic biology in a real case study. This helped to expose the students to different viewpoints on the applications of synthetic biology and what we should be aware of as scientists in designing these biological systems. We were able to present this curriculum, including our lesson plan, to a group of Biotechnology students from the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education Campus Quéretaro over Skype.
Not everyone in the class shared the same perspective on synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms. From this collaboration, we gained a better understanding of the perception the general public held on the usage of synthetic biology. We learned that a large amount of concern is is due to fear related to the safety and contamination of existing infrastructure. This influenced our project by allowing us to reevaluate some of our project requirements that we initially established. It also helped us find a way to better communicate our research to the general public. Many of the students expressed interest in participating in future iGEM competitions after we shared the applications of synthetic biology with them.

We contributed to the Rice University team's Humans of Syn Bio Project by adding stories from members of our team about how they became involved with iGEM. Through this collaboration, we were able to help create a network community among iGEMers by sharing our stories. We were able to discover the different stories of iGEMers across the world and the reasons why they became involved, giving us a better sense of connection and creating a stronger network amongst teams.

The Coliguard - Differentiation
Introduction
Cell differentiation process can be defined as a “Progressive restriction of the developmental potential and increasing specialization of function that leads to the formation of specialized cells, tissues, and organs”, according to NCBI’s MeSH Database(1). Generally, it is a process by which a cell acquires a new morphological/functional type, capable of performing different and brand new tasks. In most multicellular organism, however, we might find a kind of differentiation that results in a type of cell providing support for another one(2). The differentiation mechanism chosen for our project relies on this perspective, and the first attempt at its implementation as a synthetic biology tool was made by the Paris 2007 iGEM team(3).
The differentiation system adopted for our project was designed focusing the need of creating two subpopulations with distinct characteristics and, mainly, the need of controlling the proportions between both subpopulations. Therefore, we need a differentiation system whose rate could be controlled.
Accordingly to our project objectives, the final results of this differentiation system must be:
• A Worker subpopulation This lineage is the one responsible for producing the valuable products, being unable to recognize and destroy contaminants present in the culture medium. In an attempt to maximize productivity, it would be interesting to keep the largest proportion of this subpopulation in the culture media.
• A Killer subpopulation This lineage is the one responsible for recognizing and destroying contaminants present in the culture media. This subpopulation is also able to produce the compound of interest, but since its metabolism must be relocated for maintaining the recognition and destruction systems, it should produce the compound in a much lower concentration. To guarantee maximum efficiency of our system, this subpopulation must remain in a basal low proportion, which would be greatly increased in the presence of contaminants. Once they are fully eliminated, our basal proportions must be automatically restored.
The mechanism
In order to design the suggested differentiation system, we will need to modify the expression pattern of several genes, introduce new constructions, and associate two different systems previously proposed by iGEM teams: the Slippage random mechanism by team Caltech 2008(4"

And although there were activities scheduled for the next day, this was the activity that closed the meet up, since the attending teams had organized to return to their cities after this tour.
Conclusion
It was an event that few people could attend, due to the conditions explained above, but from which the attendees took much advantage. Holding such an event in September could be much more crowded if it was announced from the beginning of the summer and allowed the rest of the teams to organize around it. As it provides a series of very useful tools for the presentation of Boston."

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Run gel of gBlock stock on 1% agarose with SYBR safe DNA Gel Stain in LAB buffer - no bands i.e. the working stock possibly has no DNA!
Nanodrop of gBlock stock: A = 7.9 ng/μl, C = 7.7 ng/μl (i.e. there is DNA)
N.B. A, B, I and F are our 4 largest gBlocks which we cannot amplify.
Driscoll's work: A, B, I and F attempted on a MgCl2 gradient of 0.5mM, 1mM, 2.5mM and 5mM. Ran PCR but was told that there was no DNA in the solutions so didn’t run gel, the PCR products currently sit in freezer but don’t think it’s worth it to run a gel as there is clearly nothing or not enough in the G-block stocks. The plan was to also to run a single PCR with A,B, F and I with 1% Triton X 100 and with double primer concentration but didn’t get around to doing it after hearing the results of the straight G block gel.
Helen: A# attempted with 10% DMSO. B# attempted with 10% glycerol. F# attempted with 5% formamide. I# attempted with 10% formamide. Ran a gel of these PCRs, and none showed any bands.

Educating the public
Synthetic biology and the use of GMO (particularly in agriculture) have a highly criticized reputation in the eye of the general public. We decided to target our outreach to the youth – the future, in hope to enlighten them on the applications and possibilities of synthetic biology.
We arranged to give a presentation and debate the current use and possibilities of synthetic biology to pupils attending the Biotech Summer Camp arranged by the Danish Youth Association of Science (UNF in Danish) (visit their website here! ). These are kids who have chosen to spend a week of their summer vacation dedicated to biotechnology – that is; they have an out-of-the-ordinary interest in biotechnology. In spite of this they turned out to have a general negative attitude towards GMOs.
Figure 1: Setting up the presentation on Synthetic biology
However their knowledge of synthetic biology and GMOs were very limited. Their negative view on GMOs arose from the use of genetically modified plants in agriculture, which allowed farmers to use more pesticides. Most of them haven’t even considered the possibilities and applications of GMOs in healthcare and medicine development.
The presentation was designed to engage the pupils by"

Cadmium Detector
     Prompted by reports of the adverse health effects of heavy metal contamination in water, our 2012 iGEM team began working on the first of several heavy metal detectors. We wanted to help both local farmers and farmers in other countries, especially third-world ones, who have found their crops tainted by heavy metals such as cadmium, arsenic, and lead. In 2013, we read reports showing that areas surrounding Duke Energy's Buck Steam Station are affected by coal ash containing cadmium, in a region fairly close to home for our team. We decided to focus primarily on our cadmium detector, especially after learning that water affected by the cadmium containing coal ash becomes hazardous and can potentially cause health issues ranging from kidney damage to death. Our detector creates green fluorescence while in the presence of cadmium. After building the first version of our detector, we worked to increase its sensitivity, allowing it to respond to much lower levels of cadmium, at an amount where the knowledge could be useful and not redundant due to the deaths already caused by the cadmium. Last year, we added the 2007 Cambridge team's sensitivity tuners to the detector. After seeing indications of a peak at lower levels of cadmium than we had previously, we began to use test points that were closer together and discovered a peak of fluorescence. This year we built and tested an alternate version of our previous detector. The new detector uses a phi-delta activator instead of an Ogr activator, and we discovered promising differences between the detector and the control. According to the 2007 Cambridge team's website, they saw differing results for the efficacy of the phi-d"

Meet-up with USTC-CHINA & USTC-Software
We invited iGEMers from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) to have a discussion about Synthetic Biology and the iGEM experience. The two teams USTC-CHINA and USTC-Software firstly presented their work and then we introduced our projects. Through the presentation, we shared ideas and experience with each other. The USTC-CHINA team shared their experience of designing their biobrick, which enhanced our knowledge of synthetic biology. The USTC-Software team shared their idea of how software can assist SynBio researchers. Our team discussed our thoughts of which function synthetic biology researchers might need. More importantly, we both proposed some useful suggestions for each other’s project. With those suggestions, we both can improve our project, and also, we enjoyed the fun of being an iGEMer.
Attend the Conference of China iGEMer Committee(CCiC)
We attended Conference of China iGEMer Committee(CCiC) hold by Peking University. This conference includes more than 30 participants. In this conference, all teams share their projects and exchange ideas. We also make a presentation to show our project, BioDesigner. Lots of teams provides valuable suggestions for our project. Also, OUC-China propose to have a collaboration with us due to their demand of a automative Biology reaction simulator. Other teams also willing to use BioDesigner due to its amazing features. By attending this conference, we got communications with lots of teams. Here we express our sincere thanks for them.
Hold seminar in the HeFei University of Technology
We specially made a chance to share iGEM with our schoolmate and present them the work we do. They showed great interest in solving the problems in Synthetic Biology with computer science technology. This is indeed what we expect, to share iGEM spirit. We made a comprehensive introduction to the students from the background and practical application of synthetic biology. Then, team members show last year gold medal works.
Evaluation of Parts
iGEM competition has hold for lots of years, and there are lots stander parts accumulated. But there parts that have some problems in real biology experiments. So in order to provide SynBio researchers have a rough view of a part, we give parts a evaluation. By using DNA alignment tool BLAST provided by NCBI, we align parts"

Making a Controlled T7 Expression Vector
The RMIT2010 team is interested in producing a protein expression vector for producing peptides fused with Taq. Arguably the best protein expression systems are the pET vectors. These vector systems use a T7 promoter regulated by the Lac Operon elements. This means that:
The LacO/LacI binding site is a repressor site, inhibiting the RNA polymerase to transcribe the mRNA. By adding Lactose or its analog IPTG, the structure of the LacI repressor is changes, thus not being able to bind to the LacO site. this allows transcription to occur.
Another regulatory element in the Lac system is the CAP binding site, which is located just upstream of the promoter region. Its role is to enhance transcription of the operon. The CAP protein is found throughout the cell in its inactive form - being activated by the molecule cAMP. When the levels of cAMP are high, there is more active CAP protein in the cell. Interestingly enough, the levels of cAMP are inversely proportional to the levels of glucose in the cell, so by depriving the cell from this carbon source the levels of transcription will thrive.
The T7 sequence is very small and though several designs of Lac/T7 systems have been designed in the parts registry, none have been made available in the distribution. When cloning T7 components, the small sequence means that there is large difficulty in gel electrophoresis detection and there is ambiguity as to whether a T7 promoter will work in the context of some promoter designs. Our T7 part is based on the iGEM known part BBa_J04500 which is a functional Lac operon promoter (plus RBS) that has been benchmarked and tested in several iGEM projects, therefore providing a strong controllable and usable part for future iGEM distributions.
This part - as previously stated - was made from the part BBa_J04500. The first challenge that we encountered was to remove the current promoter elements found in the part: -35 and -10 elements. This was overcome using Quikchange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis to introduce unique restriction sites to allow the removal of the promoter region. The -35 element was mutated to include an AflII restriction site and the -10 element was mutated to a ClaI site. The T7 promoter was inserted via primers with ends to match the restriction sites"

We contacted him for advice on copper transport systems and he advised us during an E Mail exchange to use OprC (BBa_K2638200) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa if we want to import copper ions from the surrounding media. As shown on our copper accumulation . Moreover he sent us important literature and models that we could implement into our modeling .
Walter Thomas
Walter Thomas is an expert on mine drainage working for the environmental department of the saarland. We talked at the telephone about the problems of mine drainage and the bad public attention about this topic. In his opinion either the coverage is not existent or it is too sensational. Moreover he supplied us with data sheets about metal ion concentrations in pits throughout the Saarland region here in Germany.
Using the information provided by Mr. Thomas we learned that 160 mg/kg copper is the upper limit for surface water stated in the environmental quality standard (Umweltqualitätsnorm / UQN) and that multiple mines located in the Saarland exceed these limits for example in 2017 amounts of 652,50 mg/kg copper where measured in the mine drainage of the mine Reden.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Model award , you must fill out this page.
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Here are a few examples from previous teams:

SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT#HP#Magazine#HP-MAGAZINE-3_-_-_TEXT.html," his Alma Mater and start to introduced iGEM to every students as well as recruit 2013 iGEM team member. After several week’s hard working, he established the first iGEM team. Last summer vacation, he and his team members worded in the lab, without holiday, lad, air conditioner, Internet, even worse the limitation of equipment and material. So, they had to borrow other students lab and at the last detection of the experiment he stayed up for two nights. Finally, the team achieve the satisfactory results and won the silver medal in iGEM Asia division in October. From then on , iGEM started to have a significant influence on SCUT.
三、 The anecdotes
Actually, iGEMer’s life is full of fun, we will introduce two funny stories about our group leader Zhang Junjie.
n the normal time, he is a generous and casual person. He often watches movies, plays the card games, and plays the badminton. He is easygoing and willing to help the juniors. And his nickname is ‘sis pili’.
Speaking of the origin of his nickname, it’s a dark history, but related to our design of experiment. First, ’junjie’ is the pinyin of his name but when you type in the computer ‘sis bacteria’ shows in the bar that’s why we all call it sis bacteria. But why changed it into ‘sis pili’, there are two versions. The first one is related to project which we designed to reform pili and after the permit of our professor Li Shuang and Junjie we start to call it sis pili. As the second, we kept it as a secret.
What’s more, junjie fell into love with one of our team member yaoyao.
This winter vacation, iGEMer returned to school very early, and started to design our project. Life seemed simple and boring, every member sat together discussing the projects and papers. Because we lack of the profound knowledge of biology and the limitation of English level, we took long to finish reading one paper.
During this time, we needed to report every three days and shared ideas with others or ask junjie for help. Among these people, yaoyao is the most hard-working one, after the project design and training of experiment technique, yaoyao cooperate very well with junjie all the time and that makes them good partners. Finally, in a May night, leader showed his love, and they start a stable relationship.
Nowadays, our team encounters a intensive situation, and this couple guide the team to achieve our"

Brightfield microscopy with the Coomassie stain showed that only isolate 60 had rod-shaped cells, but when I checked the streaked plate again, the plate turned out to be contaminated.

I performed the isolation protocol and prepared up to plate 107. Plates 64, 68, 69, 71, 75, 81, 82, 87, 88, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 101, 103, 104, 105, 106 and 107 showed colonies; each of the colonies were streaked (2 to 3 per plate). Figure 9 shows the streaked plates.
Figure 9. Streaked colonies which were isolated from dead Varroa destructor.
Week 15
I checked all of Week 14's isolates with brightfield microscopy. Instead of the toxic Coomassie Brilliant Blue R stain, I tried to stain with a premade BioRad Coomassie stain. This has the advantage of being far less toxic. However, the quality of the images was worse as is shown in Figure 10. I also grew cultures for protein extraction on Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis tenebrionisand HD350, as well as isolates 46, 47, 60, 81, 82, 88 and 106.

Week 16
Last week's cultures had very few spores, so I streaked them and grew them for 2 days to promote sporulation before doing microscopy (Figure 11).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for"

With this growing interest in diy bio and at home labs, we sought to follow this approach on a larger scale. We have spoken to many members in the community and gotten feedback on how to make this a feasible goal. We have set in place the necessary plans to create an open and sustainably funded Hackerspace. We believe this idea fulfilled our goals of being inclusive, validated by bilateral communication within the community, and would leave a lasting impact as a result of the work done by this year’s iGEM team.

Activity 8: Global Empowerment Summit
Global Empowerment Summit
People: This particular activity actually spun out of our Integrated Human Practices. After realizing the vast potential of our liquid biopsy test and its impact as a tool in social innovation, we were invited to present our vision for improving cancer diagnostics at the Global Empowerment Summit at UC San Diego. We were able to impact a demographic that we hadn’t even considered: namely social innovators and entrepreneurs.
Design and Dialogue: After talking to Ms. Naila Chowdhury, it became apparent that our project had potential to make a positive difference for at-risk populations with limited access to medical care, and therefore was of significant interest to social entrepreneurs. We also realized that although these individuals had a reason to be interested in our project (and in synthetic biology as a whole), they also had an extremely diverse set of knowledge bases that did not necessarily overlap with the basic science behind our project. In preparing for the Global Empowerment Summit, we learned that many of the guest lecturers and attendees had significant education and experience in business, communications, and management; very few had much exposure to biology beyond college, and none would be fully apprised of the recent developments in synthetic biology.
In preparation for the summit, we kept our audience in mind. We knew that it was important to explain our project step-by-step, to use frequent comparisons to real-world products, and to tie each step back to the element of our project that was of the most interest; its potential for social good. We designed a poster and slideshow presentation that was accurate but simplified to this end. Unlike our other projects for EPE, we were targeting an older audience, and therefore kept in mind to explain our project at the level of most basic biological elements; well-known and easily recognizable terms like “DNA”, “genetic code”, and “proteins” were used to"

<ref name=""Bezeichner"">Blablablub</ref> Controlling gene expression in a condition and tissue specific manner is a desirable tool for a wide variety of applications ranging from fundamental bioscience research to gene therapy. Having this idea in mind, it is inevitable to consider the starting point of gene expression: the promoter. Most efforts of obtaining any promoter focus on cloning them from nature. In eukaryotes, this approach leads to several problems. The one major issue is the complexity of eukaryotic systems resulting in cross-talk between pathways. In particular, promoters tend to respond to several transcription factors and are thus activated by more than one pathway. That way, one cannot determine which signal originally induced the promoter. Alongside this specificity, induction under a desired combination of conditions and at defined strengths would be valuable implementations.
Therefore, efforts have emerged to synthetically construct promoters. Two concepts of synthetic promoters in mammalian cells co-exist independently from each other. One is the concept of ""genetic switches"" (see [2] for a recent review) - promoters which can specifically be induced by a stimulus mammalian cells and are usually insensitive to, e.g. tetracycline [3] . Much fewer efforts have been put into developing promoters sensitive to endogenous signals (referred to as ""synthetic promoters"" in the rest of this article). Such promoters are of very high value for a broad variety of applications. Three examples should demonstrate this: First, in virotherapy for cancer and other diseases, it has become a desire to express toxic genes only in affected cells (reviewed in [4] ). For example, breast cancer cells are characterized by high levels of estrogen receptor. Constructing a promoter which is active only at high estrogen receptor levels (preferable only in cells which are irradiated, as ER can be very active in other tissues of the female reproductive tract [17] ) might therefore help developing novel breast cancer therapies. Second, biologists studying pathway interactions are in need for transcriptional assays, that"

GliA (Z0277) + pRS306**
Note: (are we missing nullA + LexA rpt?)  Other than this one potential part, we seem to have enough transformations to run several activator tests next week.  Hooray!
Triple (all in W3031a):
pRS304* + pRS305 + pRS306
ZifR (Z0421) + pRS305 + ZifA rpt (Z0637)** (a couple small colonies)
GliR (Z0415) + pRS305 + GliA rpt (Z0739)
LexR (Z0412) + pRS305 + LexA rpt (DD25)** (several colonies)
LexR (Z0412) + LexA no flo + LexA rpt (DD25)** (one colony, somewhat small)
Note: will have to redo a few of these, but this will now be a single transformation seeing as all of our activator transformations were successful.
Next week:
1) Calculate estimate of transformation efficiency
2) Calibration of nanodrop respective to yeast (and E. Coli) OD measurements <== important for activator tests
3) Activator and competitive binding plates
4) Replate transformations if possible, especially those that were contaminated (for those without contamination, attempt to reuse plates)
5) Verification of transformations (massive amount of colony PCRs and subsequent gels)
-must verify the expected lengths of each band
6) Activator tests

Teaching Synthetic Biology to the General Public
Usually the general public relates “synthetic biology” (or more commonly, “Biotechnology”) with “Genetically Modified Organism,” a current ethically-charged term concerning genetic engineering of the food that we consume every day. The 2013 UCSF iGEM team thought it was of paramount importance to begin by educating citizens on the basics of molecular biology and synthetic biology before delving into the intricacies of genetic and synthetic modifications. We wanted to change the perspective many have toward synthetic biology by introducing the basic ideas of Synthetic Biology in a special evening event at the San Francisco Exploratorium.
The Exploratorium ( www.exploratorium.edu ) is a museum dedicated to various science-related exhibits aimed at teaching science and its practical applications as well as inspiring learning by self-discovery in its guests.  The night event is an 18-and-older event that approximately four to five thousand people attend the first Thursday of each month. Each event revolves around a unique theme, and we presented our work on synthetic biology under the theme of Transformations.   The transformations exhibited ranged from origami folding to metamorphosis to ice cutting, and our focus was on micro-transformations in cells.  In accordance with the theme, our team presented information involving genetic transformation in order to show the benefits of synthetic biology and the many applications it can have in the future.

All experiments were performed by the students. None of the advisors performed any experiments but they did explain and guide us through the experiments we were unfamiliar with. All parts were created and submitted by the undergraduates of Team Nevada iGEM. Dr. Tang and Dr. Howard helped a lot with troubleshooting and guiding the students in figuring out how to fix any problems that arose. They did not give us the answer to solving a problem but helped us figure out an answer to solving our own problems. Dr. Shintani kindly sat in on some of our meetings and provided additional direction.
Information regarding genetically modified rice was all provided by plant manager George Graham of Calrose rice. Information regarding regulations of genetically modified rice and information about the milling/processing of rice were also provided by George. He also gave us feedback regarding our iRICE. Other people that helped are Olivia John who helped by preparing stock solutions and reagents. Dr. Patricia Ellison helped by providing us with the best method to express our starch binding proteins. Dr. Alexander Van der Linden and Dr. Jeff Harper provided a fluorescent microscopes that helped with imaging of the construct model. We also would like to acknowledge the Associated Students of University of Nevada and Charles River in helping fund a major portion our trip to the iGEM Regional Jamboree. A big thanks goes out to NEVADA INBRE for annually helping fund our research and our trip to Stanford, CA for the America West Jamboree and the World Championship Jamboree in Cambridge, MA. Lastly, a big shout out to our advisors: Dr. Howard, Dr. Shintani, and Dr. Tang. Without them, none of this would have ever been possible and we are forever grateful that they have given us this opportunity.

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Detect_-_-_TEXT.html," coli could be efficiently transformed with one or both plasmids, as determined by selective plating. However, KanR E. coli could not be efficiently transformed with both. We attribute this to Cas9-induced cleavage of the chromosome specifically at the KanR casette, with about 99% efficiency.
Characterization of the reporter
  To characterize the pRecA –LacZ construct, we induced double strand breaks with Mytomycin C (MMC) and analyzed the resulting LacZ expression levels with the Miller assay. The same time, we wanted to characterize our final system: our target strain with the kanamycin resistance gene that also carries the reporter and the Cas9. The gRNA is delivered by a phage. As positive control, we used MG1655, which has a constitutive expression of LacZ, as negative control the parental strain of the target strain, which doesn’t have a kanamycin resistance cassette but also has the reporter and Cas9. As it can be seen in Figure 7, we didn’t get any expression of LacZ beside in the positive control, the MG1655 strain.
  
Figure 7: Miller assay Using the Miller assay to quantify LacZ expression levels in different strains: MG1655 which has a constitutive expression, the target strain + KAN, the control strain -KAN, with and without phages as well as the target strain only with the reporter, induced with Mitomycin C.
   As we worry, that our reporter might be not functional, we started to characterize a reporter constructed by Ariel Lindner. This reporter is YFP under the control of pREC. We analyzed its expression rates by inducing double strand breaks with Mitomycin C and  Niprofloxacin. The data generated by FACS analysis of the MMC induced strain over time can be seen in Figure 8. We can see an induction of the pREC promoter due to induction with MMC in the left figure. The shift to the right of the induced strain shows that we can see higher expression levels of our reporter YFP due to double strand breaks with MMC. Unfortunately this shift was not visible in an second experiment (right Figure). But we can see, that more cells show higher expression levels in comparison to the unindexed strain. As we have a high leakiness of the YFP reporter and due to time constraints, we were not able to successfully adapt our system to use this pREC-YFP reporter in our target strain and to test it. But, in previous iGEM years, there is already a pREC-LacZ Biob"

However, a major difference is that the decay rate for the infected cells is dependent on the latency time of the virus and thus we introduce $\delta$. The function $\delta$ is defined as follows,
$ \delta =  \left\{   \begin{array}{l l} &N(\tau)X_i , \ \ during \ lysis\\ & 0, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  otherwise   \end{array} \right. $
Here, $N(\tau)$ is a normal distribution over some time $\tau$, in other words, it is expected that the infected population will lyse according to a normal distribution over the domain $(-\tau, \tau)$.
Viral Growth
It is now necessary to consider the phage population $V$ as it directly affects the amount of bacteria that are infected at any given time. To describe the phage population it is necessary to consider how many phage are released per cell lysis. This number is referred to as the burst size $(\beta)$.  \begin{align} V = V_0 + X_i \beta ^{\frac{t}{LT}} \end{align} Where $V_0$ is the initial phage populations and $LT$ is the latency time (they time between infection and lysis). However, since it is difficult to measure the exact phage at various time points, as well as the exact amount of infected bacteria, it is desired to simplify the model. It is reasonable to use a stepwise function that describes the amount of free phage present. Also, since the burst size is large, on the order of $100$ [3], we see that the loss of current phage due to infection of cells is small (roughly 1%), thus to simplify computations we consider this to be negligible. With these deductions we arrive at the following:  \begin{align} V = V_0 + E(X_i)\beta^{\big[\frac{t}{LT}\big]} \end{align} Where $E(X_i)$ is the expected infected population and $\big[\frac{t}{LT}\big]$ is the largest integer equal or less than $\frac{t}{LT}$. To find the expected infected population, the Poisson distribution is used based"
UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,"1). We found greater strength in this argument when we were shown data from research undertaken at Imperial University showing oxidative stress to have a detrimental impact upon protein stability. The consequence of this is in turn reflected in protein activity and hence ageing. A description of these results is included below.
We have been researching the link between protein aggregation and oxidative stress. By using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), we were able to see that the size of a protein (monoclonal antibody) changed in the presence of oxidative stress. Under oxidative stress the protein becomes unstable and either undergoes a conformational change forming an unstable intermediate with a radius of a bit more than 1nm (as seen in image 2), or it aggregates (seen as the 2nd peak (at ~100-1000nm of the 2nd picture). 5mM of Hydrogen Peroxide was used to induce oxidative stress.
Particle Size Distribution without Oxidative Stress
 
Particle Size Distribution with Oxidative Stress
 
We also did some experimentation using Self-Interaction Chromatography (SIC) (data not shown). Without oxidative stress we get a nice peak and the area under the peak can be used to calculate the 2nd Osmotic Virial Coefficient (B2). B2 is a dimensionless no. that indicates protein stability. A positive B2 means that the proteins particles repel each other and will tend not to aggregate, but a negative B2 means that the protein is unstable, as its particles have a net attractive interaction and will aggregate. Without oxidative stress, the protein is stable with a B2 of 0.66.
However,  when the same protein is exposed to oxidative stress we have a negative B2 value of -21 meaning that the protein is very unstable. This is because oxidative stress causes particle-particle interaction to become very high and very attractive. This means that the  particles begin to take more and more time interacting with each other and the column attracts the mAb and heavily disrupts the flow of it.
In conclusion, oxidative stress has a very significant impact on protein stability. As you age and there is more oxidative stress in the body, the proteins in our cells which are essential to healthy functioning become unstable/aggregate, thereby leading to a loss of activity. This loss of activity of the essential proteins leads to the deterioration of health, so targeting oxidative stress to promote healthy ageing can be an effective strategy.
Clearly the impact of oxidative stress upon protein structure is significant and since structure and function are inexplicably, linked the functionality of the proteins are likely to be hinder"
Lanzhou,2017,Team:Lanzhou#Questionnaire_-_-_TEXT.html," for long. As those farmers lacked professional training, most farmers do farming based on the experience from their parents or relatives.
3. The area of the agriculture land in your home is __ acre.
Most answers were between 2 to 5 acres, while only few answers were from 7 to 8 acres. The average lands farmers owned are not so big, while some of them still possessed a large amount of farming lands. Considering the population density in the certain area, the yearly needs of herbicides were really big.
4. What kind of crops do you spray pesticide on and apply fertilizers to?
Most of the fertilizers were applied to wheat, corns and fruit trees. Large amount of herbicides were sprayed on wheat, corns and potatoes. The pesticides were primarily sprayed on wheat and corns.
The herbicide and pesticide at this region were mainly sprayed on two kinds of crops – wheat and corns. Thus, we must select the target genes which could not be found in corns and wheat, if we want to apply our bio-herbicides to this region.
5. What kinds of fertilizers do you usually use?
Most farmers chose to use nitrogen fertilizers and self-produced fertilizer, while some of them chose to use phosphate fertilizers, potash fertilizers and mixed fertilizers. Most farmers tend to use self-produced fertilizers because of their low cost.
6. What is your most commonly-used herbicide?
An overwhelming amount of respondents selected glysphosate as their answers. Combined with the current situation of herbicide market, we could know that glysphosate still accounted for the major portion of the market.
7. Where do you get these chemical fertilizers and pesticides?
Most farmers bought these chemical fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural cooperatives in the village. In agricultural cooperatives, farmers could buy a various kinds of tools, chemicals or seeds, in other words, there were no actually a certain shop or stores especially for the sales of herbicides.
8. How much is your annual cost on herbicides?
The answer to this question depended on different situations. The average amount of money they spend on this is not so much, because of the low price of glysphosate. If the weather is rather dry, it doesn’t need a large amount of herbicides to kill weeds. But whenever the weather is really rainy, farmers always needs many herbicides because weeds can prosperously grow after heavy rain. Before farmers decide to plant something new on the farming lands, they will spray herbicides for one time in advance.

BIT-China,2014,Team:BIT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," other to form a MinCD division inhibitor. The inhibitor can prevent cell division process. After some time, the number of cells that are still able to make binary fission will decrease. Eventually all the cells lose the ability to multiply themselves. So the cell density should not come to the maximum. What’s more, in the first model (the classical one), the cells grows with limited resources and space. But at the beginning of E.coli’s growth, the cell density is not high, and there are ample supply of food and living space. Therefore, we change the equation for cell density and give the following equations to construct the model for E.colis’ population:
The simulation result goes as figure 3.2 shows:
We also changed the initial value of AHL in our model. The results is given by figure 3.3:
E.co-Lock Model (in single cell)
We combined the MIN system model (in single cell) with the model for layered AND gates so that we can simulate the whole process of our E.co-Lock. We add the equations in MIN system into the layered AND gates model:
We use the whole equations to give simulations to E.co-Lock. When combined, the dynamic change of AND gates will affect the MinC proteins concentration, and finally make a difference on cell division. The results shows as figure 4.1:
Then we also wrote equations for wrong order, for example: 3 2 1 (first: aTc, second: IPTG, last: Ara).
All the parameters’ value are the same as the equations for 1 2 3. And if we use the equations for 3 2 1 to simulate, the result goes as figure4.2. You can see the huge difference.
Also we simulate the situation if you add the inducers by order 2 3 1 (IPTG, aTc, Ara). The result goes as figure4.3 (The equations for 2 3 1 are not written down here).
From the above figures, the model tells us that if you put the inducers in wrong order, you cannot unlock the AND gates and make the E.coli recover to the normal condition.
Besides, we developed a program in matlab. You can enter the kind of inducers as well as their concentration, the order you want to add the inducers, and the time interval between two inducers to see the results.

Team KU Leuven (Belgium)-Worldwide Collaboration Project
We were honorably invited by KU Leuven to participate in a worldwide iGEM translation project, which is comprised of several teams worldwide to reach the consensus of making the spread of synthetic biology knowledge without the language barrier. We were responsible for Traditional Chinese translation in this project, and our team project was translated into different languages, including Russian, German, French, etc.
Team Tokyo Tech (Japan) and Team KAIT Japan-Project Inspirement
This August, we held a modeled presentation with both Tokyo Tech and KAIT Japan, and they gave us some constructive suggestions in our presentation. We also paid a visit to KAIT Japan’s lab so that we can have a deeper understanding of each other’s project. Most important of all, in 2009, Team Tokyo Tech made Melanin possible to express in Escherichia coli. As a result, they gave us lots of useful experiment advice of how to produce Melanin in Escherichia. coli, which inspired us the idea to express black pigment in our microalgae.
Team Peshawar (Pakistan)-Experimental Help
This September, we submitted the NrtA part to Team Peshawar for examination of protein electrophoresis. Their results remind us of modifying our design by taking signal peptide under consideration, so the capability of NrtA-transformant may be enhanced significantly.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ellular biosensor systems constructed according to our paradigm would be able to produce responses to target molecules which were comparable to traditional whole cell sensors. Therefore, a 3D, spatially explicit, stochastic model was constructed, in which each cell was modelled as a separate agent containing kinetic equations specific to the biosensor components present in that cell type. To enable the application of experimentally derived rate constants, an IPTG sensor was designed according to our platform and modelled. This design was later used as our proof-of- concept in vitro system. Additionally, in traditionally engineered biosensor systems, biosensor components are often present in equal amounts, mostly one detection device to one processing device to one reporter device. However, other than ease of production, there is no evidence that a component ratio of 1:1:1 is optimum for all systems. An unexpected side effect of splitting biosensor components into different cells was the production of a new design space in which biosensor behaviour could be altered by varying the ratios of cell types, and therefore biosensor components, in a multicellular system. We wanted to harness this new method of fine-tuning biosensor circuits through the in silico exploration of cell type ratios and subsequent in vitro confirmation of optimum component ratios.
Background Information
Simbiotics is a novel 3D multicellular simulation tool developed by Jonny Naylor at Newcastle University (Naylor et al. 2017). This tool uses stochastic agent-based modelling to simulation interactions between different cell types within a defined 3-dimensional space. Each cell type defined in the model can run its own deterministic SBML model, which gives each cell its own behaviour. The simbiotics tool can give certain molecules defined within the SBML models (e.g. quorum sensing molecules) the ability to pass through the cell membrane, diffuse across the defined space, and enter another cell type. This enables the simulation of communication between members of a multicellular community.
Visual Simulation of Simbiotics Model: Red dot shows a detector cell, blue dot shows a processor cell. Black dots show reporter cells, green dots show reporter cells expressing sfGFP. Orange circles show the diffusion of C12-AHL, and pink circles show diffusion of C4-AHL.
Simbiotics was an obvious choice for modelling the Sensynova development framework , as it is a multicellular community with three defined cell types which communicate via quorum sensing molecules.
Deterministic SBML Models
A model for each cell type in the Sensynova framework (the detector, the processor, and the reporter) was initially made using SBML (Hucka et al.,"

Overview
Quantification of reporter expression is a crucial component in synthetic biology, with measurement tools such as plate readers present in laboratories across the world. However, these devices are often difficult to incorporate into settings beyond well-equipped laboratories, such as infield settings, creating a need for novel portable systems for reporter quantification. Within Captivate, this necessity is manifested in the form of reporter quantification from the cholera biosensors to distinguish between positive and negative tests. Within the LacZ model, the distinction between blue and white, including even slight variances, requires a suitable device for quantification. Lambert iGEM’s QSystem addresses this need through a low-cost illumination chamber for standardized image capture of samples called Chrome-Q and subsequent analysis of samples using RGB color theory through an app called Color Q.
Measurements
Figure 1: The above results were obtained from the Color Q app's analysis process. The graph is indicative of the darker values produced by the toehold having a higher relative percentage value as compared to the positive and negative control measurements. As the relative value decreases, the lower in color intensity the experimental samples are.
Threshold
Our app, Color Q, generates a relative percentage value, which is calculated from the color variance from a control sample. However, we need to determine what relative percentage value, or threshold, constitutes as a positive test result because a water sample could have a very low concentration, which would not make those who drink it at risk for contraction.
The infectivity rate for Cholera varies from 104 to 1011 bacterium ingested, depending on the strain and conditions of the host [3]. In order to be health protective, we want a negative result to mean that there is less"
