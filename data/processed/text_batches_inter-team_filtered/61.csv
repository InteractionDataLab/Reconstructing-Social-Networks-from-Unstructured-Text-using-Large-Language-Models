Liu Runze, is a junior in Physics, USTC. He has a lot of interests like reading, listening music and watching movies as well. Besides, he has a great interest in computer programming and team management. In USTC-Software team, he is the vice  captain and he is responsible for  Human Practice and Collaboration with USTC team. He is an out-goning guy and he's willing to make friends with others.
Steven is from Nanjing and his major is physics.He has great desire to explore a new field and iGEM enables him to meet different people. He likes playing handball and table tennis. With strong desire to do interdisciplinary study, he is willing to discuss with every iGEMer!
Zhi Li, or Nate, is currently a junior student from School for the Gifted Young (SCGY), USTC.  He has many hobbies，especially music and reading, and sports like soccer as well. In this summer,  he spent a lot time playing chess with others in the intervals of iGEM project. Besides, he is open-minded,  helpful and considered to be interesting when the team members work together. The persistence and optimism  are quite the shining points on him.
CHEN XINAN, or Nancy Chan, is manager of our team as well as a junior majoring Mathematics. She loves Sciences but unfortunately understanding them has always been a tough problem for her. She can undoubtedly be described as an interesting and humorous girl. You just never get bored with her around. Anyone can tell that she ‘hates’ our captain because, as she said, they are not in the same dimensionality. LOL! Nancy develops a lot of hobbies such as swimming, badminton, travelling, skiing, photographing, etc. But not table tennis! You will regret playing with her.

Wednesday, August 10th
The team went to the Foothills machine shop yesterday at around 2pm to consult with Peter Byrne. He was the person Dr. Nygren had referred during our last meeting. We had set the mould specifications for him to follow. He had also given us suggestions to further improve our mould. The mould will be ready for about a week. ($50 per hour of labour by the way ladies and gentlemen).
The mould will be made with aluminum and brass that may stick to our layers.He then recommended us to get a Teflon coating spray or something the same.
Nelly finished adding her Powerpoint slides for the presentation on Monday. She also picked up a Dupont Non-stick Lubricant (with Teflon) from Canadian Tire.
David and Nelly made more adhesive layers before leaving the lab. Some had thicker adhesives applied, some had thinner layers. They will see how this quality would affect adhesion or if it has any effect at all.
Nelly tried one of the adhesive layer on her wrist. It took her a while to completely stick the layer on because it had thin adhesive coating. It also required applied pressure for it stick better. She had the layer on for 4 hours.
Result: The layer was somehow painful to remove because some of her hair were stuck on the adhesive. She said the pain felt like a degree lower than a wax sheet slowly being peeled off your skin. There was no redness or irritation that happened on her skin, but itchiness was felt when the layer was on.
Recommendations: Disinfect the skin area before patch application.

The government of the United States of America is the federal government of the republic of fifty states that constitute the United States, as well as one capital district, and several other territories. The federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the President, and the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.

Fig.1: Graphic presenting para-nitrophenol’s absorbance at 405 nm at different incubation’s times with a 4 µM ComS..
Tests were also made to assess the optimal ComS concentration.
The peptide must be chemically synthetized and is therefore valuable. As such, decreasing the amount used would be economically interesting.
The ComS optimal concentration in the medium seems to be at 4 µM. Multiple experiences shows that higher concentrations even reduces the signal.
Fig.2: Graphic showing para-nitrophenol’s absorbance at 405 nm after 1 hour incubation with different ComS concentrations..
Still in order to obtain a practical product, the signal has to be clearly visible and easy to interpret.        A first possibility that we tested is to grow our strains containing pcMMCD 105 on a medium with X-Gluc         (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-glucuronic acid, cyclohexylammonium salt).
X-Gluc is a glucoronidase’s substrate that produces a blue precipitate when cleaved (like X-Gal).        Results showed again an optimal concentration at 4 µM of ComS 5
Fig.3: E. coli GUS- pcMMCD105 culture spread on LB medium with erythromycin 100 µg/ml, X-Gluc 1.2µg/ml and 0-2-4-6-8 µM ComS.
This system could be optimized by replacing the glucuronidase by a RFP. This would allow us to obtain a direct signal and avoid the use of expensive substrates.
Lastly, to make our system fully functional and UV sensitive, we synthetized the ComS peptide with a photocaged tyrosine (ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine).        The photocaged tyrosine was purchased and verified by NMR.        The whole peptide synthesis couldn’t be achieved. We suppose that during the synthetizing, the ortho-nitrobenzyl group moved from the phenol function to the carboxylic function.        This would prevent any further amino acid addition.        To overcome this problem, the use of ComR/S from Streptococcus vestibularis has been considered.        Indeed this ComS version ends with a double tyrosine, getting around our current problems.

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.

Once in vivo studies in different model organisms have been performed, clinical research would be the final step to execute before final assessment of the recombinant LBP. Clinical trials must be extremely well structured and regulated and the profiles of the individuals taking part in the trials should be well assessed and documented.
The drug part of the product would need to follow the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) standards of quality, safety, efficacy and multidisciplinary through preclinical studies and clinical trials. Inside the preclinical studies, the drug would have to go through preclinical Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, safety, pharmacological and toxicological studies. With all these results from preclinical trials, information about the drug substance and product, purity, risk/benefit ratio in other species, there would be enough information for us to prove safety in animals and initiate a Clinical Trial Application (CTA, EU) or Investigational New Drug (IND, US) before starting clinical trials.
During the different phases of the clinical trials, the efficacy, dosage and commercial claims of the drug will be tested. After clinical trials, all the data from preclinical and clinical, would comprise a  common technical document for a market access application (MAA, EU) or a New Drug Application (NDA, US). After the market access has been granted, the drug would need to go through Post Market Surveillance, proving safety and effectiveness in a larger scale 47 48
Throughout the process, Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Laboratory Practices should be assured, for further description visit the ethics part of this wiki.
Our strategy to obtain regulatory approval would be to focus on the use of the drug for the treatment of one specific disease, cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is considered an orphan disease, as it affects less than 0,075% of the population in the US and 0,05% in the rest of the world, a requirement for a disease to be considered as an orphan one. To gain orphan drug designation, a drug needs to have a significant benefit for an orphan disease without a satisfactory current treatment. The designation as an orphan drug would help in the expenses before market approval of the product 49. For European regulation, there would not be a need to pay protocolar assistance fee, nor the application fee for market authorization application, and our product would gain 10 years of market exclusivity, that could be extended for two more years of market exclusivity if it is approved for pediatric use. After that, we would go for market approval for the"

Using synthetic biology principles, we have created a self-diagnostic device to detect several Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), starting with  two major health threats, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), as an alternative to sampling and laboratory testing.
During our journey, we added 7 new BioBrick parts to the iGEM registry. Check out our parts page .
We have successfully demonstrated that all our parts are functional. For example, our data shows that our chimeric protein, composed of  Cellulose-Binding Domains (CBDs) covalently linked to a protein such as streptavidin, could be fixed  on a cellulose support. See our results .
We have established and maintained dialogue throughout the entire project with potential end users. We have fruitfully investigated for advices and expectations from physicians, nurses and potential users of our device. Their suggestions and concerns influenced our design and the evolution of our project from the beginning. Take a look at our ethical reflexion and public engagement ethical reflexion
We have used models to advance from the proof of concept to the real diagnosis. In silico prediction allowed us to conduct  the experimental work more efficiently.
We have created a software able to compute the most probable 3D structures of single-strand nucleic acids from scratch. This automated tool could help, we hope, future iGEM teams for easier 3D modeling of DNA or RNA.
We have designed an elegant and convenient device which is user-friendly and eco-friendly able to fulfil current societal expectations.

DIYbio, iGEM and the Registry of Parts
As we started working on the ""Public BioBrick"" we became increasingly interested in the relationship between DIYbio and the Registry of Parts. Currently, only licensed academic labs that host an iGEM team have access to the Registry. We define ""access"" as the ability to get and contribute physical DNA and add experience data.
In 2009, iGEM briefly allowed DIYbio groups to register for the competition, but this was quickly stopped after two months. Meagan Lizaro explained to us that this was due to safety concerns with non-regulated groups and because it was explicitly forbidden by MIT.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#NUS_-_-_TEXT.html," chemical kinetics which assumes that the system is spatially homogenous i.e. diffusion of all molecules are neglected.
This class of modelling approach simplifies the analysis, which is capable of capturing most of the properties of our system accurately. Nonetheless, the formulation approach, that considers diffusion processes as negligible may give rise to the loss of certain amount of information, which associated with molecular diffusion, can be critical to some special dynamic of the system.
To tackle this, NUS helped us in developing a diffusion framework by applying their RIOT modelling system. Grounded on our original chemical-kinetics-based ODE model, NUS modeler incorporated modules, which describe the diffusion of the repressors, fluorescent proteins, and both intracellular and extracellular inducers.
Thanks to their work, we have a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of our system on molecular level.
Construct Characterisation
In order to assist NUS to verify their characterisation data, we were characterising four of their constructs with different strengths processing a lactate responsive promoter and a sfGFP reporter gene on our end. Assay method was provided by NUS.
But it seemed to us that the bacteria culture did not grow well after transformation, and the blank solution also showed very high fluorescence signals, which were not compatible with the data obtained in NUS, making the results incomparable.

Collaborations
We definitely enjoy working with other iGEM teams and learning about their projects, ideas and people.  We have done multiple surveys as well as sent or exchanged BioBrick parts with other teams.  This includes:
Team Northwestern
Northwestern approached us early in the iGEM season inquiring about our magnetic nanoparticle project .  We sent them our Mms6 expression construct in hopes that we could work together on the project.  The expression of the protein is toxic to the cell and neither team has successfully expressed this protein at a sufficient concentration to date.
Team Calgary
Calgary is a team we have communicated with extensively throughout the season.  In an attempt to pinpoint the expression of the Mms6 protein we have sent them the coding sequence for the protein and they have sent us their expression-test construct, which is their project this season.  This was an attempt to both determine our Mms6 expression issue as well as test their construct.
Team METU Turkey Software
We filled out the METU Turkey Software survey that was based upon creating a standard for parts entry on the Registry of Standard Parts .
Team Hong Kong CUHK
The survey from Hong Kong CUHK was based on information security and inquirers about the public's awareness of information protection and the development of bacteria-based encryption.
Team Mexico UNAM CINVESTAV
The survey from Mexico UNAM CINVESTAV asked about the teams as well as questions about our knowledge of patents and our feelings towards them.  The survey results can be found here .

Formal Lab Session - 2nd September 2009
Overview
Metal Sensor Team - analysed PCR fragments through DNA gel electrophoresis - sac and sspb successful but others not. Genomic DNA for B. subtilis was prepared for a second attempt at PCR reactions involving ara and czrA
Promoter Library Sub-Project - carried out two DNA gel electrophoresis attempts in analysing the 3 variant sets of sigA promoters - both gel photographs show negative results
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team - attempted to PCR up the sleB and cwlJ genes from the B. subtilis genome
Stochastic Switch Team - digested the sspb PCR product (once cleaned up) with restriction enzymes and also froze down E. coli cells containing the transformed BioBricks.
Metal Sensor Team
Introduction
Before anything else is carried out, the Metal Sensing team will analyse the PCR products from yesterday's PCR reactions by DNA gel electrophoresis - this includes the czrA, sac, ara and sspb genes. The results from this will then decide where we go from here.
If our PCR reactions do not go to plan then today, we will prepare genomic DNA from B.subtilis 168 using the Genomic DNA kit by Sigma-Aldrich as we will need some more to be able to PCR up required genes for all 3 teams potentially.
Practical Outline
These tasks should be carried out by the Metal Sensing team for today:
Analyse the PCR products from yesterday's PCR reaction by DNA gel electrophoresis
If PCR reactions have failed:
Prepare genomic DNA (for Bacillus subtilis) using Sigma-Aldrich's kit

Lethbridge,2012,Team:Lethbridge#team_-_-_TEXT.html," Lethbridge. I have just finished up my second year at the University of Lethbridge currently majoring in Neuroscience. This is my second year participating in the iGEM collegiate division, as well as my first year as an advisor for the 2012 Lethbridge High School Division team. I plan on pursuing a career as a Veterinarian after finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Lethbridge. I look forward to working with all the other team members and any other labs we have the opportunity to collaborate with.  In my spare time I find myself enjoying badminton, basketball and exercising.
Boris Lam
Lambo is back once again!
This will be the second time in all of iGEM history! Returning from the great iGEM experience I had in 2011.  This will be my fourth year of university where I am currently majoring in neuroscience.  When I am not sweating over a bunsen burner or mass murdering bacteria in lab, you can find me on the battlefield wearing shiny sneakers and protecting the entire human race from supernatural beings with just a mere xbox controller. On my days off, I enjoy jamming/dancing to music (not in public of course ^_^), playing hockey, golfing and any kind of sport in general.  I look forward in meeting everyone at the Jamboree this year!

This young cowboy has lived for several years on canned beans and buffalo jerky whilst on the pursuit of fortune along the rivers of southern Alberta. Armed with only his quick wit and his two “hand gunz” (see picture) has he been able to survive day to day in the rolling coulees he calls home. Some say that his smile has the power to scare packs of coyotes away while still able to lure deer into his striking range.

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," you need is just clicking the button on the mobile phone. Besides, it's worth mentioning that it can execute the whole series detection processes automatically. We used SSH to make a connection between RPi and IP address, and programmed in RPi. We called Picamera Function by Python to achieve imaging-capture, and called Wringpi by C-language. We made Speed-controlling come to realize by PID speed mode.
Figure 6. Circuit Diagram of Raspberry Pi Operating System.
Figure 7. The physical map of the Raspberry Pi Operating System.
The speed acquisition is realized by the encoder and the call interrupt-function. The RPi detects the waveform (square wave) returned by the encoder through the pin. It generates an external trigger when electrical level changes, and then it enters the interrupt function so as to realize counting and come to null. It could convert to the current motor's speed by a pulse count for a fixed time. The maximum output voltage of PWM is only 3.3 V. But the voltage will be applied to the signal input through 12 V battery resistance transformer mode, which can realize 12-0 V voltage regulation, that is, speed regulation in the range of 500-0 rpm. NodeJS calls the corresponding file and executes the corresponding program by receiving signals and parameters, which makes RPi's corresponding to mobile phone's command be realized. More details about the principle of the Raspberry Pi, please switch to our code on our GitHub page.
From our experimental results, the time required for the sample flowing from the Sample Well to Incubation Room is 15-20 seconds, while the corresponding threshold rotation speed is 280 rpm. After the sample competed for 30 minutes in Incubation Room, we increased the speed to 320 rpm, allowing the sample to flow from Incubation Room to Detection Room, which takes around 30 seconds. (Our experimental speed design is calculated in  our Fluid Dynamics Model page. . Under the guidance of the results, we also consider other practical conditions obtained from experiments)
Application
In order to conveniently control our hardware for users, we have designed our own App which can be used with Fang. It is worth mentioning that our App gathers AIT (Artificial Intelligence Technology) and blocks chain technology, equipped with functions providing excellent user experience. According to the navigation bar, we can easily find that App consists of four function modules: Control, Analysis, Interaction and About.

The alternative pathways to produce butyrate can be seen below;
Why FimH?
Last year, Team Harvard 2015 developed a way for E. coli to bind to cancerous cells in the colon. They used pathogenic E. coli. It has a structure called “Type 1 pilli”, the hairlike appendages on the surface of the bacteria which is expressed from “Fim” gene system. (Harvard BioDesign, 2015) At the end of the pili there’s a protein called “FimH” from Fim family which binds naturally to sugar mannose on the epithelial cells. (Sauer et al., 2016) As we want to make our bacteria to bind  colon tumor cells, we had to choose a tumor specific binding peptide. We decided to work on “RPMrel”, a colon tumor specific binding peptide, likewise Harvard Bio Design 2015 iGEM team. (Kelly & Jones, 2003)
This year, we will take their project to the next level; treatment. Our E. coli will bind to the cancerous cell and after binding create a microenvironment and it will start producing butyrate, which will induce apoptosis in the cancerous cell.
How will our project work?
Our main goal in this project is to eliminate colon cancer by using our genetically engineered E. coli (nonpathogenic laboratory strain) to bind to cell surfaces with the help of site directed mutated FimH with RPMrel to bind specifically to cancer cells. After binding phase, our bacteria will secrete butyrate which induces apoptosis.

Berkeley,2012,Team:Berkeley#Project#Zippers_-_-_TEXT.html," assay we created two MiCodes- one for the known strong binding pair (20+2) and one for the know weak binding pair (20+13). MiCode 1 was programmed to have a green nucleus, blue plasma membrane and strong leucine zipper binding. Micode 2 was programmed to have a blue nucleus, green plasma membrane and weak leucine zipper binding.  Below are the resulting images from this proof of concept demonstration. Please click on the images for full resolution.

Leucine zipper interaction
In order to generate a rich library of zippers to screen for orthogonality, we sought a collaboration with the lab of Amy Keating at MIT. The Keating Lab has developed powerful software for predicting leucine zipper interaction pairs de novo (SYNZIPs) . We hope that by combining our assay with these computational techniques, we can generate and characterize a large set of orthogonal binding partners that can be used by the broader synthetic biology community.
Based on computational predictions from the Keating Lab, we synthesized 20 pairs of zippers (40 total), which we named 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, etc. Zipper 1A was predicted to specifically bind to zipper 1B and not bind itself or any other members of the library. The affinities of predicted binders were calculated to be 1-10nM, and that of all other interactions to be greater than 1µM.
We are working on testing all 40 zippers as both bait and prey to generate a 1600-member orthogonality matrix. We have synthesized the zippers, and are currently finishing the final cloning steps - detailed on our construction page .

As the digestions of the transcriptional unit (TU) of EaDAcT were incorrect, we repeated the process from the ligation step.
We transformed the same TU in a E. coli competent strain (DH5α). Then, the transformants were cultured in LB media and Spm and stored at 37°C overnight.
Finally, in order to obtain the FAO1 gene, we want to extract the Candida tropicalis genome, so we have picked a colony of C. tropicalis. To check the extraction protocol, we used a yeast previously tested, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have cultured C. tropicalis in YPD media and S. cerevisiae in YPDA media at 28 °C (5 mL).
07/23/2014
Candida genome extraction
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used as a control in order to see if we followed the protocol correctly. We aren't really sure if this protocol is going to work in Candida.
Cultures measured at 600 nm:
S. cerevisiae Abs = 1.07
C. tropicalis Abs = 0.39
S. cerevisiae is recultured with new media (1:2) because the previous media was saturated. 2.25 mL of YPD media were mixed with 2.25 mL of S. cerevisiae culture. The mix has to grow at 28 °C until the exponential phase is reached.
The absorbance was measured again:
S. cerevisiae Abs = 0.52
C. tropicalis Abs = 0.40
Buffers needed for the genome extraction were prepared freshly.The genome of both strains of yeast were extracted following the protocol:
Grow yeast in 2 or 5 mL YPD to exponential phase.

A proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

PROBLEM
Climate Change
Global warming is a socioeconomic problem that has received a great deal of attention in the past decade. Despite the attention, global leaders have not laid out a clear solution or set of solutions to combat this problem. Between 1905 and 2005 the global average surface temperature increased by 0.74 ± 0.18 °C (1). Global warming is undisputable and data implicates the role of greenhouse gasses in this process.
Greenhouse gases
The increased production of greenhouse gases (GHG) since the mid 20th century—due to industrialization—is the primary factor that has contributed to the rise in global temperature (2). There are several different GHGs that are released from anthropogenic emissions, including: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) (3). The United States releases approximately 2 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere annually, making us the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases (4). This consequence requires the United States to shoulder the environmental burden of leading a global effort in reducing carbon emissions. The United States is not the only culprit; projections of current data suggest that China will surpass the United States in carbon emissions before 2025 (Figure 1.1.2).
Transportation
In an increasingly industrialized world, the shipping of goods and personal transportation is becoming more important for economic progress. The benefits of these forms of transportation are too valuable to society to be given up. However, there is a price we pay for this luxury. Fourteen percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from the combustion of transportation fuels (5). The United States annually consumes 140 billion gallons of gasoline as transportation fuel (6). Fossil fuel recovery also accounts for 11.3% of greenhouse gas emissions (Figure 1.1.3). Purification and refining of fuels results in additional carbon emission. Transportation contributes a large fraction to greenhouse gas production and the associated issue of climate"

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a"

Cesar Rodriguez started the iGEM team with support from the Provost. At the beginning of the 2017 Spring semester, he recruited iGEM members and advisors. After forming this team, he helped generate the team structure and workflow with the elected leaders, and continued showing support throughout the summer with candid feedback and supporting the fundraising effort. As we began to develop a solution to Celiac Disease, he performed a talk at one of FSU iGEM’s first public engagement activity with Moonshot Night. Now, as we are wrapping up our research, he has still been supporting the team by adding the parts to the registry, shipping out parts, and developing the skeleton of our wiki so that we can more easily learn and interact with the HTML code. Overall, he gave us candid feedback to better develop our deliverables and our workflow throughout this project.

Questionnaire
In order to know the expectations of current mosquito repellent products in the market, we designed a questionnaire, and put it online and offline. Our questionnaire covered task-oriented questions from the often-used mosquito treatment methods, the subjective evaluation of the effectiveness, the concern about toxic substances, to the acceptance level of biosynthesized products. More aspects were considered through the design of our questionnaire. A questionnaire must cooperate with people. In the real-life scenario, we shortened the question down to 10 to ensure the effectiveness of the research. In China and oversea*, 807* peoples have answered the questionnaire. This questionnaire served as a lighthouse, providing information to potentially improve our project overall as well as guiding us to shape our project well. The results showed that most of the people are annoyed with the disgusting mosquitoes. From people’s feedback of our questionnaire, we also knew that toxin free and high effectiveness are considered as the most significant features of mosquito repellents by the public.
Fig 1 Purpose of using anti-mosquito products
Q9 Your Age/ Q4 The Main purpose of using mosquito repellents (Multiple Choice)
Avoid the mosquito borne diseases（e.g malaria）
Among the people aged 16 or older who polled , only 39% of them claimed that they are aware of the danger of mosquito-borne disease.
Fig. 2  Comments on effectiveness of products
Towards the current mosquito repellent products, only about half of the participators feel satisfied.
Fig. 3 Worry towards mosquito repellent product
Most participators have considered the negative effect of anti-mosquito products on humans, this means that potential consumers care about whether the product is poisonous.
Field Trip to CDC
In order to get some professional knowledge about taxonomy and ecophysiology of mosquitoes, the disease they transfers,  and the specialized method people use to prevent mosquito-caused diseases, we went to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and consulted  with the experts on July the 28th.

Village health service is the lowest level. Usually each village has two health workers who received short training before starting. Dispensary services supervise all the village health posts in its ward. Health Centre Services provide care for about 50,000 people. Each district then has a district hospital. Regional hospitals are similar to district hospitals, but they offer additional services and have specialists in certain fields. Referral/Consultant Hospitals represent the highest level in the country. There also are private health facilities that are often owned by government health care workers which creates a conflict of interest. In Ethiopia, on the other hand, the core of the health policy is accessibility of healthcare for all parts of the population, and encouraging private and non government organization participation in the health sector. Some of the priorities of the health policy include health information, education, communication, development of health service management systems, and provision of essential medicines, medical supplies, and equipment.  We also found a paper on National Drug Policy of The Transitional Government of Ethiopia (Nov. 1993). The following is the summary of the relevant sections: 1. Selection of Drugs This section states that National Drug list will be formulated considering safety, efficiency, quality and cost and based on health problems in the country, infrastructure, and fundings. National Drugs Advisory Committee will be established to evaluate and decide upon drugs and to create lists of drugs used in the country.  2. Drug Supply The country plans to establish drug manufacturing facilities with the possible help from private investments. Pharmacists would be responsible for compounding drugs in hospitals, pharmacies and drugs while  maintaining required standards. The government will also establish an enterprise to distribute the drugs on the national and regional levels. Both public and private sectors will be involved in the production of drugs. 3. Stock Management and Distribution Storage facilities will be created to ensure proper conditions for drug storage.  4. Drug Administration and Control The National Drug Advisory Committee will be responsible to evaluating drugs based on safety, quality, price, and other criterias. Drugs that satisfy the requirements will be issued certificated and existing drugs will go through regular evaluations. Information about harmful and beneficial effects of drugs will be collected.  5. Manpower Training and Utilization All professionals and biotechnologists will receive proper training."

We chose the parts BBa_K2114001 , BBa_K2114002 and BBa_K2114011 as our favorite parts. They belong to the first fusion genes we could assemble. Also they were overall easy to handle regarding their construction compared to other fusion genes like the ones containg the spore coat gene cotB (which by the way proved to be quite a challenge).
We used them to generate functional Nanocillus displaying the anti-GFP nanobody that could bind its target or display an active glutathione-S‑transferase. Overall, those parts played a central role in our project ensuring that we pursue a promising approach for targeted drug delivery.
2. Improved Biobricks
pelB_anti-GFP nanobody
We submitted an improved anti-GFP nanobody containing the pelB leader sequence for the export of the protein in the periplasmatic space resulting in an increased yield of the over-expressed protein.
PCotYZ-RBS
The B. subtilis promoter PCotYZ regulates the expression of the late stage spore coat proteins CotY and CotZ. We included a ribosome binding site which simplifies the assembly of devices and the expression of subsequent genes.

Calculations
MathJax example
To support our predictions for the chamber size, we made simple approximations for how the cells could bind to the membrane. The outcome of different membrane sizes, cell secretion rates and the needed size for specific proteins can then be evaluated. Previously experiments with the secretion of a SipA protein has been conducted. Here a secretion rate of in the magnitude 60 molecules per cell per second was found.[1] The resulting production rate is then found. Here we assume a membrane size of 4 square centimeter, a E. coli attachment surface of 2 μm^2 and we know the molecular weight of SipA is 74 kDa  $$N_{cells} = {0.0004m^2 \over 2*10^{-12}m^2}R_{bind}$$ $${dN_{produced} \over dt} = N_{cells}*SecRate$$ $$ProdRate = {dN_{produced} \over dt}*74kDa=1.47 {ng \over s}$$ Which is for 4 square centimeter. The production rate per square centimeter is then  \(ProdRate = 0.368 {ng \over s}\)  We can then calculate the membrane size needed to produce the amount of insulin needed to maintain the health of an astronaut suffering of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, which is 0.5 to 1 U per kg per day.[2] The molecule that is used as an example is Novorapid Insulin Aspart, with a weight of 100/3.5mg,[3] on a person of 70 kg $$ M_{Aspart,daily} = {70 {U  \over day}"

Note: The transformation protocol is according to Gietz and Schiestl, Nature Protocols (2007) Vol 2 No. 1.
Continued with yeast transformations.  Had optical density readings of 0.259 for W303_1alpha and 0.188 for W303_1a from the overnight cultures.  This corresponds roughly to cell concentrations on the order of 10^7 cells per mL (Note that our Nanodrop seems to report OD values one order of magnitude lower than they actually are, so that ).  One possible reason for this low density was the lack of adenine in the media, which requires the cells to produce their own.  Decided to put all 5 mL of W303_1a into the pre-warmed 50 mL of YPD.  This addition made for roughly 1.3 x 10^8 cells by our estimates, which should account for about half the required cells in the protocol.  This should not matter too greatly seeing as we will be growing them up again during the 4 hour incubation period.  However, low cell count may indicate low transformation efficiency.  The flask used was an Erlenmeyer flask covered with tin foil.  The incubator was set to 210 rpm.
The OD of the
Resuspended in 0.4 mL at the final step.  Decided to limit the transformations to four sets of parts, each being a double transformation:
Gli1 activator + Gli1 activable reporter (Z0277 + Z0739),
Gli1 repressor + Gli1 repressor reporter (Z0415 + Z0510),
null repressor + Gli1 repressor reporter (Z0411 + Z0510)
Zif268-HIV activator + Zif268-HIV activable reporter (Z0267 + Z0637).
The reason for choosing the first three parts is because they serve as a good point of comparison between parts with the same binding"

Considerations
There might roughly two methods to help protect intellectual property rights
1. When we re-design the work done by others, we should appropriately cite the work and take note of what changes have been done to the genetic design.
2. We can deploy the CORE on a semi-public server, so that their data and genetic design can be saved in a local database.
Inspirations
Intellectual property is to protect the intellectual achievement of the authors. As a software for genetic design and idea communication, it's necessary for us to do something about it. We stand on the author's point of view and set some corresponding rules. For example, all ideas rose by other users will be site with the names of the author. In addition, users can deploy CORE in their laboratory privately, and construct genetic circuits together with the help of CORE, online (though it is highly recommended to deploy CORE on a public server like world-wide-web).
2. Laws and regulations
Motivation
In scientific research or industrial production, we all require to obey the laws and regulations. Synthetic biology is a field booming in the 21st century, so inevitably, there might not be enough laws and regulations on synthetic biology to regulate the practices in synbio. In China, synthetic biology is new and full of challenges; whether scientists get prepared for it?
Practices

Xiao Feng, Weilin Xu, Shengkun Dai and Jiaming Hui.
Team members of SYSU-Software come from mostly sciences and engineering, so a talk with students of humanity background is interesting and exciting.
In early September, we were pleased to have a talk with a student of humanity, Jiaming Hui, on the topic of how genetic engineering and synbio have an impact on Chinese, and what do China do to regulate the practices in genetic engineering and synbio.
We were pleased to know that in China, there are already laws that regulate many aspects of the scientific research and production of products of genetic engineering. After we introduced to Jiaming about what is synthetic biology, Jiaming told us that in China there are laws relevant to synbio; however, because synbio is a discipline with rapid development and a wide field of research interest, more regulations on synbio are needed.
We learned from Humanistic thought.
We also discussed with Jiaming about the video made by Yongyuan Cui, a celebrity who does not support genetic engineering. Jiaming had no remark on this video, believing that every one should have the"

After the initial brainstorming and design phase, team MIT presented our project to Dr. Ron Weiss and the SBC, in             order to gain feedback about the scientific validity of our work so far. There were some interesting questions raised             in these sessions, many of which concerned our mode of delivery, which was quite ""hand-wavy"" and seemed impractical.             Our initial mode of delivery was stem cell therapy and we, as a team had decided to go for this ""envisioned"" output method             without giving it much thought. Our conversation with synthetic biologists in the SBC made us realize that we needed to             have a concrete mode of delivery, that had previously worked in similar syn-bio applications. At this point, the idea of             cell encapsulation as our mode of delivery was born. One of the members of the SBC explained to us this particular technology             and showed us successful implemented models such as Viacyte. With this feedback in mind, we dedicated a new sub-team just to             research on this more practical mode of delivery, which was not the focus of our research but was important to be included             in our presentation as a viable future prospect.

Our project idea was based on a research paper by Kobi Benenson, who had successfully transplanted a bacterial TCS into a mammalian         cell. We wanted to replicate his transplantation but essentially, with a different TCS system and a different application in mind.         We reached out to him in order to gain some expert knowledge on the experimentation that we would need to carry out but unfortunately,         we were informed that because his research work was in the patenting process he could not share a lot of information. In order to         better understand this predicament and the IP process, we decided to talk to an expert.

Bob Mulder
One of the first steps we took apart from scientific work, was approaching the university’s communication strategy expert Bob Mulder. As our project aims at developing a product that is applied outside of the lab and that is crucial for saving honey bees and therefore affecting the whole world, we wanted to make sure there is no miscommunication and no room for misinterpretations in our project. Bob Mulder advised us on how to best approach sensitive topics such as GMOs. We used his advice and constantly kept in touch with him about our public appearance. His advice was also needed when talking to the Dutch beekeepers’ association.
Dutch Beekeeper’s Association
For a successful design of our project, the input of real beekeepers was crucial. Yet, as a lot of beekeepers are hobbyists and non scientific, approaching them was rather challenging. Like a lot of people, the beekeepers showed to be wary when hearing about our plan to design a product to be applied inside of hives containing GMOs. Nevertheless, using Bob Mulders' strategic advice, we got the beekeepers to listen to us and give us advice on our project.
Summary
To wrap it up, here is in short who and what influenced us and the process during our project and how we implemented this.
Synenergene gave us the opportunity to explore the impact our project might have on society. They also assisted us in thinking about responsibility in science.
The RIVM made us think about the importance of safety in synbio. This led to a change in our mindset. From “safety is demanded”  to “safety is important”.
Bob Mulder, strategic communication adviser pointed out how we and our statements can be perceived by the public. This helped us adapt our communication strategies based on our partners.
Students from the DAE had a crucial role in sharing their thoughts on synbio with us. They inspired us to think about our project in a broader sense than just scientific.
The Dutch Beekeeper’s Association did not like our project in the beginning, due to fear of ecological changes. This led us to work on the way we present and explain our project.

Metagenomic Library and Isolation
The fecal samples contained ton's of bacteria, and we wanted a quick and easy way to ensure there were some cellulose degrading bacteria. We plated these samples of cellulose only media to see if this was true. The metagenomic library is our future goal for this project, which will enable us to screen for useful enzymes in biofuel production from our fecal sample bacteria. We did not get to the metagenomic library this year, but a quick description of it is given here.
Isolation:
Cellulose-degrading bacteria were isolated on cellulose medium (see protocol page for medium recipe) which contained ground Whatman paper acting as the cellulose source. The medium was used by a research group in India who were conducting very similar experiments, and they had had great success in isolating cellulose-degrading bacteria. After receiving fecal samples from Shubenacadie Wildlife Park, the team plated the samples on the cellulose medium. For the initial round of porcupine fecal samples, we made duplicates of every plate so that we could incubate in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Following a 24-hour incubation, we observed various colony morphologies. Bacteria displaying three prominent colony morphologies were chosen to pursue more closely. These colonies appeared as white, yellow, and bulls-eye colonies on cellulose medium. These colonies were then streak purified on LB medium.
16S rRNA Gene Sequencing
We managed to isolate bacteria capable of growing on the cellulose medium. This was done as a quick and dirty identification of some of the cellulose degrading bacteria as a starting place for our project. A discrete portion of the 16S rRNA gene from each of the three microbes was amplified using pcr. These amplicons were sent away for DNA sequence analysis. The resulting sequences were used to identify the bacterial colonies to the Genus level.
The 16S rRNA gene, as mentioned in the Microbiome Survey section and here in Isolation, is a perfect gene for taxonomy identification in bacteria. This is for three reasons.
DNA provides better taxonomic identification than traditional bacteriological assays like Gram stains.
It is conserved only in prokaryotes, thus excluding eukaryotes from our identification procedures
It is a short sequence, which makes it ideal for cheap Sanger DNA equencing and for high-throughput technologies like those used in the Microbiome Survey section
The 16S rRNA gene contains nine variable regions, some of which are flanked with constant regions that can"

Principle
Our decoder aims to distinguish between the most common indoor and outdoor lightsources. These include for example sunlight (with UV), outdoor shade, room light and darkness. All of them have a unique footprint of both intensity and the ratio of blue to red light. This might facilitate the reliable detection of sunlight with UV by combining only two inputs, the light receptors LovTAP and Cph8 .
Boolean logic
The input (red and blue light) is converted into TetR and LacI using a NOT-gate. The truth table demonstrate our aim of the decoder.

This can be simplified to the following logics:
pABA and Violet = NOR(LacI, TetR) = NOT(LacI) AND NOT(TetR) = Blue AND Red
Note that simultaneously to the production of pABA and the violet pigment also cI, a third repressor, is produced. cI is integrated in the other gates.
Red pigment = NOT(PABA and Violet) AND NOT(TetR) = NOR(cI, TetR) = NOT(cI) AND NOT(TetR) = LacI AND NOT(TetR) = NOT(Blue) AND Red
Green pigment = NOT(PABA and Violet) AND NOT(LacI) = NOR(cI, LacI) = NOT(cI)"

London Meetup
iGEM Westminster, UCL and Warwick hosted other UK teams for a ‘Mini-Jamboree’ where we were able to attend poster sessions, watch a few teams give mock presentations and participate in debates. All of the teams were able to exchange ideas and help answer any queries the other may have had, as well as discuss the content of the posters presented and the presentations. Through the use of post it notes, all the teams were able to collaboratively answer questions and solve dilemmas any of the other UK teams may have had. We were fortunately able to experience what the Giant Jamboree would be like before Boston at a smaller scale, with the addition of pizza and snacks of course! Thank you to UCL, Westminster and Warwick for hosting all of us!
Judd High School
This year, three members of our team: Laulwa Al Salloum, Laurens Heling and Dan Brunkow, were able to work alongside Team Judd_UK in the InterLab study. They were able to use our lab and equipment to obtain the necessary readings for their InterLab while we mentored two of their members; Nikita Shukan and Mateo Hoare through the process, as well as aiding them in their managing of the different aspects of the study, such as: using the Gilson pipettes, using the plate reader, incubating the samples, etc. In return, they generously donated their InterLab DNA from Distribution kit plate 6 for us to transform as we were unsuccessful in transforming the DNA from our own kit into the E.coli DH5 alpha cells.
Being able to work alongside another iGEM team was incredibly useful in viewing the study from a different point of view as Judd_UK were experiencing all the lab work for the first time as they are a High School team. Being able to mentor them allowed us to work through the study step by step until it became second nature to perform all the readings.

Safe project design
    In addition to uncontrollable factor in science, the public and government also have their concern， due to limited application scenarios and biosafety concern, it’s often difficult to put these genetically engineered bacteria into practical use.     The mazEF is a toxin-antitoxin module located on the Escherichia coli chromosome and some of other bacteria, including pathogens. mazF specifies for a stable toxin protein, and mazE specifies for a labile antitoxin, which antagonizes toxin protein[1]. mazF is a toxic nuclease arresting cell growth through the mechanism of RNA cleavage and mazE inhibits the RNase activity of mazF by forming a complex[2]. In our project We used mazF toxin protein as our killer to ensure biosafety.

AraC repressor inhibits transcription from the PBAD promoter. When transcription by the PBAD promoter is induced arabinose addition, expression of toxin protein （mazF） is promoted and the expression of 2-PE under the PLtetO1 promoter is inhibited by the TetR repressor.

Therefore, in order to to make this curve Dρ(h) decreasing sharply near the threshold, it followed a prediction that we can get a multiple-ring pattern by making an auto-activate genetic  circuit which the combination of LuxR and AHL can activate the expression level  of itself.

Furthermore, we did some  two-spot patterns which initially have two points of E.coli cell, so as to compare with the experiments culture ( Results Section3 ).
[Back to Top]
 
Results
We tried different parameters  in the model, to see how they influenced the pattern.
Generally, we can vary the  parameters of cell growth and cell motility which, in experiments, are easy to  change, although there are lots of parameters in our model. So we list the  results of varying several parameters in the cell growth part and cell motility  part.
1. Cell Growth
In the cell growth term, we  considered the growth rate was related to nutrient concentration. When the  nutrient was consumed by the cell, the grow rate of the cell would decrease  ( Fig. 7 ). There was a maximum growth rate γ0,  when the nutrient was rich. The parameter κ described the sharp of this curve( Fig. 7 ). The larger κ gave us more smooth increasing curve. And we made an assumption  that one unit of nutrient would change to cell number with a ratio α. Also in  the initial condition, the nutrient concentration ni can influence  the patterns. Therefore, the effects of all the four parameters were studied in  our model.
Above reuslts indicated that, the  faster cell growth (larger γ0 and  smaller doubling time) formed a smaller and a little more unclear ring pattern.  And the inner ring diameter would become a litter more large when the growth  rate increased.
From  above figures, it was found that the initial nutrient concentration ni had  little influence to the pattern, especially when it was large. The only effect  we observed was that smaller initial nutrient concentration ni  made the ring slightly wider and more clear.
Here,  the value of κ was related to the  initial nutrient concentration ni. When initial nutrient  concentration ni was fixed, a smaller κ parameter gave us the similar results with that of faster cell  growth.
When  we increased the value of k, the  patterns did not change a lot, but only became a little more clearly.
In conclusion, the simulation  results showed that the parameters of maximum growth rate γ0 and κ had a more important role on the ring"

The aggregation of d-AuNPs due to increasing salt concentration starts at 500 mM of NaCl. When a ssDNAp is added, the aggregation is extended to a NaCl concentration of 600 mM. However, presence of dsDNA target with a ssDNAp that can specifically bind to the target dsDNA does not influence the aggregation behavior drastically compared to the aggregation when dsDNA target is absent. Presence of only dsDNA target does decrease the stabilization of the d-AuNPs as they already aggregate at a NaCl added of 250 mM.

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. The ssDNAp concentration is decreased to avoid to much stabilization of d-AuNPs by the ssDNAp. Prior, the ssDNAp is heated up to let the ssDNAp anneal to EPO target DNA and create the secondary structure. The ssDNAp, EPO target DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA, 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 1 (1nM) and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate. Again, the primer 051 was used as off-target ssDNAp. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes.

Example of a species: pLacI*:LacI4 and its tree structure of binding.
Here is another example of template species with more complicated structure.(see Figure 2) In biology, LacI tetramer (or LacI4) can bind with promoter pLacI as a repressor. When bond with LacI4, pLacI is repressed and its transcription speed will decrease significantly. In order to express this alteration, as mentioned above, we use another part of pLacI* with decreased transcription speed instead of pLacI in the species.
The structure of binding sites is shown in figure (see Figure 3). The graph indicates that LacI monomers first bind together to form LacI dimer, then LacI dimers forms LacI tetramer, and finally LacI4 binds with pLacI* to form pLacI*:LacI4.

Modeling with Templates
Manual modeling of biological system is widely used in synthetic biology. However, it requires an overall understanding of the biological network and large amount of data, making it difficult even for professionals. Actually, the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur with a same mechanism. Based on this idea, we introduce the concept of Template, which is the minimal data set for describing biological reaction networks, as a feasible way to implement automatic modeling. The term “automatic” does not mean modeling without providing any information. Instead, we aim at providing minimal amount of data. Similar to C++ programming language, templates allow generic description of species of a certain structural pattern or reactions of a certain reaction mechanism.
Substituent and Template
There are two kinds of templates: Template Species and Template Reactions. They are designed to represent a family of species with similar structure and a family of reactions with similar mechanism respectively. In order to realize this idea, we add the container of Substituent into MoDeL. There are currently six objects in this container, ANY, ANYUB, ONE, ONEUB, NZ and NZUB. Though defined differently, they actually serve the same purpose: representing other parts. Let’s take ANY as an example (see Figure 4). ANY, represents parts on ONE chain and the number of represented parts can range from zero to infinity. For example, a DNA species"

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Killing I_-_-_TEXT.html,", because they cannot be killed by ordinary antibiotics and can give their plasmids to other pathogens, which then become resistant themselves.
Nevertheless, there are some alternatives to antibiotics, which are currently being investigated: bacterial toxins, probiotic bacteria and bacteriophages. Our project consisted in engineering a probiotic bacterium which uses either toxins or bacteriophages as a killing device.
Our sub-team is concerned with the strategy based on phages. Bacteriophages are a group of viruses whose natural hosts are bacteria, which can be human pathogens. There are two types of phages: virulent and temperate ones. Virulent phages infect a host cell and multiply by using the host resources and lyse the host to set themselves free. Temperate phages also can multiply inside a host cell and lyse it to get themselves free (lytic phase), but alternatively they can integrate into the host chromosome (lysogenic phase), remaining dormant until the host conditions get worse. Virulent, non-lysogenic phages are used for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacteria since the 1930s. Phage therapy was intensely used until the first antibiotics were discovered in the 1940s. Later, this technique was extensively investigated and used especially in the Soviet Union [2] .  Since there are more and more multiresistant bacterial strains, phage therapy becomes interesting again [3] .
The special quality of our approach is that we use bacteria as vectors for the phages. This will avoid the consequences of a systemic application of bacteriophages, because they are only released at the site of infection. Smaller amounts of phages are needed, because they are not spreading through the whole body.
We have decided to use lambda phage for our project since it is an extensively investigated phage which should therefore be easier to handle than less studied ones. Lambda phages are a class of temperate bacteriophages with a 48,502 bp genome consisting of linear double stranded DNA. The genome has a highly mosaic, modular structure. Like for all viruses, there are distinct steps for lambda phage infection. The first step is adsorption. Lambda phages have receptors at their tail fibres, which bind specifically to mannose transporters of Escherichia coli. These receptors are not able to bind stably to structures on other bacteria strains and are therefore responsible for the host specificity of the lambda phage. After adsorption, the lambda phage injects its genome into the host cell. In the environment of the host, the linear DNA circularizes at the so called cos sites"

researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at our institution?
What does our local biosafety group think about our project?
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that we made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes, did we document these issues in the Registry?
Our answers to these four questions:
For iGEM 2009 project, our goal is to design and engineer bacteria (called ""ViroCatcher"") to bind and remove many kinds of viruses. However, due to potential safety issues of using viral particles in our experiments, we only used viral proteins in our experiments to prove the concept. Although these viral proteins we used are viral capsid proteins for binding to huamn cellular receptors, they are neither toxic nor pathogenic by themselves. These viral capsid proteins or even viral paticles are not able to replicate in the bacterial chassis we used for making ViroCatcher. Therefore, they should not raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety.
At NYMU, we do have a biosafety committee to review all biosafety and biosecurity issues at our university.
We had presented our ViroCatcher project to many of our school professors including many of the members of our biosafety committee. Since we were not using viral particles or viral vectors in any of our experiments, they did not think the use of viral capsid proteins in our project would raise any biosafety issues.
None of the new BioBrick parts that we made this year raise any safety issues. Since we are not authorized to give out those gene clones of viral capsid proteins, all those clones are not shipped as new BioBrick parts at this time.
We also documented all our answers to these safety questions in our presentation, wiki presentation, and poster.

This technology has completely changed the way we view the world, revealing microbes in just about any possible environment on earth. For example, the human body is a complex super-organism that contains more bacteria than human cells, and about ten times more viruses! Most of those viruses infect the abundant bacteria, but we have very little idea how this ecosystem works, how it stays stable, and what happens if the stability is lost. In my group, we develop innovative bioinformatic tools to study metagenomes, and apply them to big datasets to investigate microbes in all natural habitats, including the human body, the global oceans, soils, etc. We collaborate with many international researchers on fascinating questions that we hope to answer with our computational techniques.

For example, cancer cells can signal to the immune system to leave them alone by changing the sugar molecules on their surface. If we could change the ‘sugar code’ of these cells, it would allow the immune system to clear the tumour. The way these molecules interact with protein receptors means that they often bind very weakly, and so it can be very difficult to find drug leads that act on them. In my group we are applying a technology for small cyclic peptide discovery to try and find drug leads that target the enzymes that build up and remodel these glycans, as well as the receptors that recognise them.

Musical Intermezzo
In order to appeal a greater audience for the conference, we invited a pianist who studies at Utrecht University to play during the musical intermezzo.
Mark de Blecourt is a computer science student at Utrecht University. At an early age he already had a gift for music, and he  started playing the piano 8 years ago. He played the following songs for us:
Ludovico Einaudi - Nuvole Bianche
Ludovico Einaudi - I Giorni
Yann Tiersen - Comptine D'un Autre Été

The colonies that had grown were then grown in liquid culture and mini-prepped in order to extract the DNA; the extracted DNA was then sent for sequencing, and the returned sequenced matched the expected sequence. The DNA was then sent to the parts registry as the Bacterial-Mammalian Hybrid Promoter and the Mammalian-Bacterial Hybrid Promoter . The BioBricks for B-M and M-B were then used for further experiments, including ligation with a fluorescent protein reporter and growth studies.
From weeks one through to five the team worked on producing the first BioBricks of the hybrid promoter. Despite this proving difficult due to various reasons such as low amounts of DNA being produced from early mini-preps and ligation strategies not working, E. coli transformed by the BioBrick DNA was successfully grown and proven to have the relevant antibiotic resistance by the beginning of week six .
Studies into the effect of the hybrid promoter on growth of E. coli competent cells
Figure 4.A calibration curve produced using E. coli alpha cells grown over time. The inoculations were run through a spectrophotometer at OD 600 nm every hour and then a sample was plated in order to calculate CFU/ml over time.
As part of the characterisation of the hybrid promoters, as well as PyeaR alone ( Part BBa_K216005 , studies were conducted to see if the growth of the E. coli was affected by transformation of the promoters.
To being untransformed E. coli were inoculated into liquid culture and left to grow overnight at 37 ºC before being diluted down. The diluted liquid cultures were run through a spectrophotometer at OD 600 nm and their absorbance noted, before each culture was plated and once again left overnight at 37 ºC; the next morning the colonies on the plates were counted, allowing a calibration curve of absorbance at OD 600 nm against colony-forming units per ml (CFU/ml) to be set up (Figure 4.)
Following establishment of the calibration curve liquid cultures were made up of E. coli that was:
. Untransformed (otherwise referred to as alpha cells)
. Transformed by B-M
. Transformed by M-B
. Transformed by PyeaR
These cultures were then diluted down to the same starting level (an OD 600 nm absorbance of 0.2 +/- 0.1) and cuvettes filled with LB media were inoculated. The cuvettes were then placed in a spectrophotometer every hour and the absorbance at 600 nm was established; in between readings"

DNA-Based System Models
Introduction
We created a kinetic model to simulate the dynamics of our cell free DNA-based system and to inform the design process. Using this model, we made changes to our original design, most notably the addition of an amplification step to increase anticoagulant production. We modelled the system mechanistically to make it as accurate as possible, using mass action kinetics and Michaelis-Menten kinetics to model the reactions. The goal of this model was to answer the following questions:
How fast is hirudin produced?
How leaky is the TetR promoter? What is the foldchange between a negative and positive test?
Difference between producing hirudin directly and producing TEV to cleave inactivated hirudin?
Methodology
To model the biochemical reactions, we formulated a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are solved in MATLAB.
The Cell-free DNA system is modelled mechanistically by using dissociation constants found in literature for TetR-TetO binding and RNAP-pTet binding. TetR dimerisation is modelled to introduce TetR monomers that may act to competitively inhibit Cruzipain in cleaving the TetR dimer. Furthermore, ribosomes are modelled to decay over time in the cell-free extract to saturate protein expression at around 2-3h. Because only dissociation constants are obtained, certain rate constants are estimated from the equilibrium constants.
The following parameters were used:

Citrobacter freundii Characterisation:
Sugar use
An ideal chassis should be able to use various sugars as carbon sources. In order to show that C. freundii is capable of using a variety of carbon sources, we have tested its growth on M9 minimal media plates containing different types of sugars. In addition to plates, we have also assessed its growth in liquid media containing these and other sugars.
While it has not yet been tested by our team, others in the C. French lab has shown that C. freundii grows well on media that contain cellobiose as the sole carbon source, whereas E. coli cannot use cellobiose. Cellobiose is a major component of biomass, so C. freundii can be used well for biomass degradation experiments.
Method (expand)
Small wells were cut in the middle of the plates and 150 μl of 20% sugar solution (glucose, sucrose, lactose, or glycerol) was added to each well. To some plates, powdered sucrose or glucose was added instead. The plates were then streaked with four strains ( E. coli, E. coli + sucrose hydrolase gene, C. freundii NCIMB and C. freundii"

Safety labs
We had the key to the laboratory kept strictly. Any duplication without permission is prohibited. The last person who left the lab should make sure that electricity, air conditioners, water have been turned off.
Equipment
We have well-designed fume hood, explosion-proof equipment and eyewashers to deal with different unexpected situation. We also had a cabinet for Hazardous reagents whose key is kept only by our PI.
Procotols
We have protocols for every experiment which mainly followed by biochemical company or adopted by many researchers.
Disposal
There are different bins for chemical pollutant and normal waste separately. Furthermore, our school carried out a regulation which is having specialists to treat the waste uniformly.
Biological hazard
All reagents and cultures are kept in a sealed containers. Plates containing E.coli are sealed with parafilm before storage at 4℃. Once plates and wells are not required, we destroyed them by autoclaving.
HP SAFETY
We Fudan-CHINA also care much about safety during human practice.
In our public engagement, we did several interesting experiments with kindergarten kids. ( See More ) To avoid cultured bacteria from the environment making threats to those children’s health, we seal the plates with parafilm and sterilize with ethyl alcohol before handing out. We also urge them to wash hands after class.
We helped a high school build a team to attend next year’s IGEM. ( See More ) We spent several days teaching them lab safety and how to deal with unexpected situation.
To get a further understanding and discussion about safety, we also made a phone interview with Health planning Commission about laws and regulations related to safety. ( See More )
Shipment safety
Our DNA parts are absolutely safe because they contain safe expression control units and express harmless protein like GFP. All of our parts are safely kept in PCR tubes as Parts registry requires.

In the very beginning just after coming up with the idea of losing weight, we tried to figure out people’s attitudes towards being fat. Thanks to the software designed by
SYSU-Software, we successfully recorded the emojis netizens are using when they talk about body weight, obesity or slimming on microblog through the technique of web crawling. By the end of February, a great amount of information had been accurately recorded and specifically analyzed. We found that people tended to use negative emojis when mentioning about their growing weight, while positive emojis when expressing the wishes of regaining slimness. By investigating people’s attitudes in this way, we felt the strong urge and necessity to help people with weight control, and then came our complete project.
Figure 1 emojis people use when mentioning of being fat
The top 3 emojis people use are tears, heart and smile; and the frequency of use is 17%, 10% and 7%. Other emojis seem much less popular than them.
Since the emoji “smile” often means that I am not pleasant with what happened (coomon in Chinese netizens’ usage habits), we can infer that two of the top 3 emoji represent sad and unhappy moods towards increased weight, which indicates the emotional keynote.
Moreover, we classified these emojis according to the feelings they represent:
Figure 2 feelings of people when mentioning of being fat
Compared to the positive emotions, the negative emotions make up 53% and are more diverse. Overall, the emotions netizens expressed towards being fat reveal that they are eager to get rid of obesity and become slim. However, the actual circumstances they face in the process of losing weight somehow make them hold negative emotions.
II
To better understand people’s expectation of weight-losing therapies, we carried out a questionnaire survey among ordinary people. According to the feedback, 60.85% of our respondents had trouble with controlling weight and longed for slimming down, implying that our project did cater to the need of a large number of people. Moreover, despite the difficulty of persisting, going on a diet and taking exercise were still the best choices to most people, which revealed that there is still plenty room for the improvement of"

The absorption of TagCFP has its maximum at a wavelength of 457.4 nm and the emission maximum lays at a wavelength of 478.1 nm. The overlap of absorption and emission can be seen in the area around 470 nm.
We further plotted the measured values of the excitation wavelength and the emission wavelength of TagCFP to obtain a height profile given in the diagram below (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Excitation wavelength and emission wavelength of TagCFP.
The diagram displays the distribution of the different wavelengths. The red colored area reveals the overlap of excitation and emission at its uppermost distinctness.
Further characterization of EGFP
We further characterized the “EGFP Protein Production Construct” (Part:BBa_K1123005) of the group iGEM13_TU-Eindhoven to supply a broader understanding of the properties of this fluorescent protein. We therefore measured the absorption and emission of EGFP. The regarding graph is given below (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Fluorescence spectrum of EGFP showing absorption and emission at variant wavelengths.
The results show a difference in the wavelength of the absorption and the emission. The absorption of EGFP has its maximum at a wavelength of 487.5 nm and the emission maximum lays at a wavelength of 508.3 nm. The overlap of absorption and emission can be seen in the area around 500 nm.
We further plotted the measured values of the excitation wavelength and the emission wavelength of EGFP to obtain a height profile given in the diagram below (Figure 2).

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Limiter#network_-_-_TEXT.html," a constitutive promoter by putting a repressor under the control of each (alpha and tau, respectively) and setting them in mutual inhibition.
Where A induces a level of expression below that of the constitutive promoter, tau represses alpha, is expressed at a stable level, and represses R as well.  In this manner, the activity of R is switched off when G's expression is below the defined threshold.  Where high levels of A cause G to be overexpressed, it induces alpha as well, repressing tau and allowing R to bring the expression of G back down to a normal level.
In a possible end-use of this limiter network, the gene we wish to limit ""G"" and its activating transcription factor ""A"" are endogenous to the organism we wish to regulate.  We introduce the transcription factor ""R"" to repress G, as well as the bistable pair alpha and tau that serve to regulate R's repression.  As natural transcriptional control systems lack the modular specificity that our network requires, to implement our network we turn to a rationally-designed synthetic system of transcription factors.

Content: eight gene circuits’ construction
Construction details:
1.Construction of gene circuit one: we used standard method of biobrick connection to put the coding sequence of cI protein behind PLlacI promoter. But we failed to construct it because of some unknown reasons. The sequence results showed that there is either a pretty long and unknown segment which insert into the coding sequence of cI protein or deficiency of the sequence of PLlacI promoter(as shown in the Figure 3). So, we had an assumption that there were little LacI proteins in DH-5α, and it was not much enough to repress PLlacI promoter, resulting in the overexpression of cI protein which may restrain the growth of host.
Figure 3. diagram of sequence results
2.Construction of gene circuit three: Firstly, we used standard method of biobrick connection to put the coding sequence of LacI protein behind lox66 because the length of lox66 was 34bp and it was too small to purify from the enzyme-digested product and then put it in front of LacI protein. Due to the same reason, we put the product of previous step behind PLtet01 promoter to finish this gene circuit. Compared to construction of other gene circuits, it seemed that this gene circuit was the simplest job we’ve made since that we only tried once and took almost eight days to finish this work.
3.Construction of gene circuit two: we constructed this gene circuit by following the method we’ve mentioned above. The only difference from the construction of gene circuit three is that we put the coding sequence of TetR protein behind lox71. By the way, lox66 and lox71 are two recombination sites which are recognized specifically by Cre protein. To our surprise, when we did double-digest to this circuit for verification, we found that the length of product of enzyme-digested was not right and there was an extra stripe that we didn’t know what it was. Results are shown in the Figure 4. According to the results, we had another assumption to explain the phenomenon: there were some recombination systems in DH-5α, resulting in homologous recombination of two strains which had synclastic lox71 site. Definitely, We’ve done a lot of work to verify our assumption which will be explained in the part of"

This was then autoclaved for sterility.
Day two
Measure A600 of overnight cultures (diluted to 1/10). Us an appropriate volume to inoculate 5mL of LB + 5μL Ampicillin at an initial A600 of 0.007, plus any other added solutions such as KNO3 and IPTG. Incubate (shaken) at 37°C until A600 is 0.3 - 0.5 (usually approx. 3 hours, depending on strain). Remove (and discard) 1mL aliquots to monitor A600 during growth. It is important that all cultures are harvested at a similar cell density. When the culture reaches the desired cell density place on ice immediately and record the A600.
At this point it is a good idea to prepare the two remaining solutions of ONPG and SDS (required later in the assay) and to add the β-mercaptoethanol to the Z buffer.
0.1% SDS solution made up from 10% stock - need 60μL per culture being assayed
4mg/mL solution of ONPG in Z buffer - need 400μL per culture being assayed
From this point on there is no need to worry about aseptic technique! For each culture being assayed set up two small test tubes containing 0.9mL of Z buffer. Also set up a control containing 1mL of Z buffer.
Mix the culture by gentle vortexing, then transfer 100μL to each of the test tubes containing Z buffer. Add 30μL of 0.1% SDS and 30μL of chloroform and the vortex for exactly 10 seconds to lyse the cells. Place the lysates on ice until all samples are ready to assay. Also add SDS and chloroform to the ""no lysate"" control.
Place samples in a 30°C water-bath and allow temperature to equilibrate.
Start reactions by adding 200μL of 4mg/mL ONPG in Z buffer and vortexing for approx. 5 seconds. Note the time at which each reaction was started and stagger the reactions at 30 second intervals. Also add ONPG to the ""no lysate"" control.
When the reaction mixtures have turned pale yellow (or after 60 minutes, whichever is the sooner) stop the reaction by adding 0.5mL of 1M Na2CO3 and vortexing briefly. Note the time at which each"

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

1 Background
2 Objectives
2.1 Improve awareness and understanding of Hearing loss
2.2 Investigate social reality of Hearing loss
2.3 Increase our own social reach and personal values
3 Lab Project
4 References
This year, we designed an audiogenetics system to explore the secret of sound sensing inspired by the status of hearing loss issues all over the world. Our human practice naturally focused on the combination of our lab works and prompting global concern about hearing-impaired people.
We educated people with synthetic biology concepts in a multi-dimensional manner. We also designed and distributed questionnaires and booklets for investigation, propagation, science popularization and call on awareness, which addressed the importance of our project. Through a series of interviews , we harvested many information about hearing loss including policies, medication, research and philanthropy. The knowledge about hearing formation also helped us promote our project.
More importantly, we tried to organize commonwealth activities and cooperate with accessibility App developers to further extend our social impact.
Human practices made us to rethink the relationship between we researchers and the public. Countless people has given us tons of new ideas about our project during our campaigns. We are truly thankful to all the people who supported us with their words and gestures. Without them, this project would have never been what it is like now.
Background
Hearing loss, also known as hearing impairment, is a worldwide problem. There are about 360 million hearing-impaired people around the world, accounting for 5% of the world’s total population. [1] In China, people with hearing impairment take more than 1.67%, ranking at top of the whole disabled groups.
Fig.1 Worldwide hearing loss status Asian hearing-impaired population accounts for a large part of the overall group with hearing loss. The number of people with hearing loss increases by year. [2]
However, after communicating with relatives or friends that suffer or have ever suffered hearing impairment, we found that, although the concerns by the international community are rising, there is still few efficient way to cure such problems.
Though many contributing causes of hearing problems [3]"
