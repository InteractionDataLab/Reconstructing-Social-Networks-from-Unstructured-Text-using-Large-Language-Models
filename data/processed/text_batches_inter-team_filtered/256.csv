Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#OSCAR#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html," needed to be mutagenized.  This part is now being ligated into pSB1C3.  We are currently in the process of constructing all three parts under control of a tetR promoter and ribosomal binding site ( BBa_J13002 ), and then constructing these composite parts together as outlined below.
Final testing constructs
Final testing constructs are nearly complete.  These are illustrated in Figure 7 and will allow us to compare the three different approaches.  Unfortunately, Washington only sent us the PetroBrick and not the two individual components, we will have to compare a combination of the PetroBrick and car/npt to the PetroBrick alone and to oleT.
Figure 7: Final constructs required for validating and comparing different decarboxylation approaches
Testing OleT
One major stumbling block in testing out oleT is that it has been very difficult to ligate it into a vector, which has prevented us from submitting it as a BioBrick. As such, we chose to try some assays on the host organism: Jeotgalicoccus sp. ATCC 8456.  This way we could at least validate that this gene was functional before we had our BioBricks.  We started by trying to verify the results by Rude et al., 2011, namely that OleT could convert fatty acids into alkenes.  We grew up cultures based on this protocol and used GC-MS to analyze any alkene production (Figure 8 and 9).

Figure 9. Mass spectrum of the peak in Figure 8 at retention time 14.7 min.  Demonstrating that this peak is an olefin, which is known to be produced in Jeotgalicoccus.  This verifies our proof-of-concept that the Jeotgalicoccus species can degrade fatty acids into olefins.
Based on the additional peak we saw in the gas chromatograph, we could show that our E. coli can produce alkenes with the oleT.  This is may be an improvement over the PetroBrick since OleT is only one enzyme instead of two; however, future testing is still needed. Now that we have validated the function of OleT in producing"

During the summer vacation ,6 members of our team went to Zhejiang University for a minitype communication.In the meeting we discussed the project and teams of each other. We got some useful feedback for our project ideas , and also some valuable advice about how to successfully plan and execute an iGEM project in general. It was a really inspiring communication that properly kicked off our thinking into human practices.
Our stakeholders participated in our significant decisions by listening to our reports and regular meeting weekly, we adjust our projects by their suggestions and feedback."

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," whose expression is affected by glyphosate is related to zinc deprivation responses (60). Unexpectedly, we could not detect any effect of glyphosate on the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in shikimate metabolism and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. This finding could indicate that the inhibition of the EPSP synthase and the changes of the cellular EPSP concentration does not influence the expression of the genes that are involved in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in B. subtilis.   The promoters involved in the regulation of the yciA-yciB-yczL-yciC operon were identified as PyciAB and PyciC (61).
3. A reporter-based glyphosate detection system
3.1 Utilising PyciAB and PyciC to build a reporter-based glyphosate detection system
Our RNA-Seq analysis revealed that the expression of the operon containing the yciA-yciB-yczL-yciCgenes was severely affected when B. subtilis was cultivated in the presence of glyphosate. The promoters involved in the regulation of these genes were identified as PyciAB and PyciC. Based on our RNA-Seq data, we aimed to construct a reporter-based glyphosate detection system. For this purpose, we fused the identified promoters to the xylR gene, which is a transcriptional repressor of the xylA-xylB and xynP-xynB operons in B. subtilis (Figure 14A). A B. subtilis mutant strain lacking the xylR gene was transformed with the plasmid pAC7 containing our promoter-gene constructs. We expect that upon contact of the constructed strains glyphosate, the expression of the xylR gene will be lower, which will lead to the expression of the xylA reporter gene. The expression of the xylA reporter gene can be monitored by performing a β-xylosidase assay using the colourimetric substrate 4-Nitrophenyl-β-D-xylopyranoside (PNPX). The measured β-xylosidase activity can be directly linked to the expression of the xylR gene, which controlled by the glyphosate-dependent promotor (Figure 14B). The β-xylosidase activity should be directly proportional to the glyphosate that is present in the growth medium.

Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes and then heat inactivate at 80ºC for 20 minutes.
Transform 2 μL of the ligation product into 50 μL of competent E. coli cells. Select using the antibiotic corresponding to the destination plasmid backbone.
If the input parts are good, almost all colonies will be correct.
Miniprep clones that generated a band of the appropriate size and sequence.
Troubleshooting
In our experience, most problems with 3A Assembly come from the transformation process. Because 3A Assembly uses a triple ligation, the concentration of assembled DNA is about 10% of that produced by a double ligation process. Particularly, if your lab makes its own competent cells (and particularly chemically competent cells) it is important to test the competency. If you are having trouble obtaining colonies, we suggest that you try commercial competent cells. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. Do not add more ligation product than specified and be careful when resuspending the competent cells.
The second most common problems are caused by defects in the DNA entering the ligation. We find ligation to be a very reliable process. However, the sticky ends of the cut parts can be destroyed by enzymes. Always ligate immediately after digestion (do not store digestion products in the freezer and then ligate later). Also, the original DNA may be incorrect or defective.
Another common mechanism for failure involves a piece of genomic DNA being cloned into the construction plasmid.  This result typically occurs when the assembly is somehow unfavorable to the cell.  This issue can be partially checked via the colony PCR step in the protocol though if the genomic DNA is of the same size as your assembly, then the single colony PCR screen is ineffective.  A careful purification of the construction plasmid can help to avoid this result as can phosphatase treatment of the linear construction plasmid .
Analysis
File:Ccdb Mixture A.gif
Since the transformed cells are plated on plates supplemented with the antibiotic corresponding to the construction plasmid, only cells containing the construction plasmid backbone should survive.
Since the construction plasmid itself has been reduced in quantity by PCR and digestion by DpnI, few colonies will contain the original construction plasmid.

The simulation of the membrane current of the axone we developed previously is used as the input of the nerve model.
2. Medium transfer function
J. H. Meier and al. developed a nonhomogeneous and anisotropic model of a nerve [6]. We consider a cylindrical nerve of radius a and an axon at a distance r from the axis of the nerve (figure 6). The nodes of Ranvier are separated by a distance lmy. The point M, where the extracellular potential will be calculated, is located at a distance d = ρ - a from the surface of the nerve and at a distance ρ0 from the axon considered. The angle θ is the angle constructed from the radial position of the axon and the observation point M. The conductivity inside the nerve is different (σz and σρ) depending on the direction, longitudinal or radial. We consider two media other than the interior of the nerve: the perineural sheath that surrounds the nerve, of conductivity σs, and the outside of the nerve of conductivity σe.
Figure 6: Model of the nerve fascicle, with perineural sheath labeled “s” and external surroundings labeled “e”.[6]
The active fiber is simulated as an array of active point current sources along the fiber bundle. Each source represents a node of Ranvier. A nodal distance λ of 1000 μm is chosen. Current values correspond to the nodal currents of an active fiber of 10 μm diameter at one instant of time.
Figure 7: The line represents the nodal current and the bars represent the currents of the active nodes. Each bar corresponds to one node.[6]
From this model, the calculation of the extracellular potential is based on the calculation of the electric field in a cylindrical medium. J. H. MEIER and al. established an analytic expression of the extracellular action potential using the medium transfer function in the spatio-frequency domain [6]. With the simplifications we have chosen, this transfer function is the sum of the series presented below by separating, for each term, a factor depending on the respective positions of the axon and the point of observation, and two factors dependent on the physical characteristics of the nerve considered.
From this expression, it is possible to determine the ""spatial"" transfer function h2(z). To do this, it suffices to calculate the inverse Fourier transform of"

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation"

STIMULI PROTOCOLS
Prelude
We looked at the effect of various stimuli on the polysaccharides, proteins, and structures  involved in the various stages of a biofilm. In particular, we looked at varying concentrations of  nutrients, physical environments, and media.
For nutrients, we chose three levels of stimulation – zero stimulation, medium stimulation, and  maximum stimulation. Their effects on the biofilm response were then observed and analysed  through a battery of assays looking at the levels of biofilm components.

Lecture Series: A Primer in Biological Research at Tufts
Fall 2014
Biology and the life sciences have experienced extensive innovations over the last half        century. Researchers at Tufts have been consistent contributors to these major advancements        making their work pertinent teaching material for students interested in pursuing research        opportunities. In this course, undergraduates will not only be able to explore the landscape of        biological research performed at Tufts, but engage in discussions with the faculty behind it.        Over the course of the semester, the students will become acquainted with various research        publications by creating presentations, drafting proposals, and discussing the research with        faculty and peers. The course will culminate in group proposals in which the students develop       a potential research endeavor based on the principles examined throughout the course.        Students will have the opportunity to have these proposals funded with the help of the Tufts        Synthetic Biology team.       The goal of the Tufts Synthetic Biology team has been to establish an undergraduate team of        researchers who will work closely with select faculty to take part in an annual competition,        learn about research on campus, discuss bioethics, and learn how to write a research proposal.       We believe the best way to intellectually prime and train undergraduates who want to take        part in this highly independent research project is through a class which exposes them not       only to the technical aspects of the molecular biology techniques involved but also to the       administrative necessities of running an independent lab. Students taking this course will be        prepared to pursue undergraduate research in a professor’s lab or as a member of the Tufts       Synthetic Biology team.

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#project#hydrogel_-_-_TEXT.html," alternating (1-4)-D-galactose and (1-3)-3,6-anhydro-L-galactose repeating units and forms reversible gels even with a low concentration because of the formation of hydrogen bonds [2] [10] . It is soluble in hot water and forms a gel during cooling. The polymer is biodegradable, low-cost, environmentally friendly and easy to extract. It is already used in pharmaceutical industry as a gelling, stabilizing and encapsulating agent [11] . It forms a stable, elastic gel which allows easy handling.
The shown hydrogel contains 1 % chitosan, 1 % acetic acid and 1 % agar. It is a very promising gel. It is a little bit adhesive to generate hermetically sealed, moist conditions for wound healing. Furthermore, it is more elastic than a gel with agarose.
Outlook
During the work with chitosan hydrogels various compositions were tested and promising hydrogels were produced. Hydrogels were manufactured with pure chitosan or chitosan in combination with agarose, agar or alginate. Depending on the concentration of chitosan and the respective gelling agent (agarose, agar, alginate), the gels were more or less solid. We manufactured stable and elastic gels which allow easy handling. According to the field of application a solid or smooth hydrogel is advisable.
The pH-level of the hydrogels is easy to regulate by rinsing it with a solution with the properly defined pH-level or using a higher or lower acetic acid concentration to dissolve the chitosan in an aqueous solution. This is beneficial for an adjustment to the respective wound and its pH-level.
Another advantage is the application for moist wound healing, as well as the factor that our hydrogels will seal the wounds airtightly. Here, the hydrogel prevents the formation of crusts and provides moisture. Both are important wound healing factors. The nutrient transport and release of signaling molecules is improved and scarring is massivly reduced with chitosan as wound toping layer. Our hydrogels can additionally deliver a monitoring bandage for affected patients without the need to disrupt the healing process and thus lighten the burden for the patients. The hydrogel should help to prevent or treat wound infections for example at any degree of burns. We thank the iGEM Team diagnost-X from Berlin for their provided expertise and informations regarding these medical problems.
The chitosan in itself or in combination other natural polymers is an ideal scaffold material to manufacture different types of hydrog"
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2016,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Human Practices#Medical Service_-_-_TEXT.html,"4. Scatter Graph of Crowding Level of Non-public Hospitals and the Public (Census of China, 2010)
Figure 5. Scatter Graph of Crowding Level of Non-public Hospitals and Economy (Statistic Yearbook of Medical and Health, 2012)
Conclusion
Both public hospitals and non-public hospitals face a lot of difficulties in China. The more developed and wealthy the area is, the more and better the hospitals are. Consequently, many areas, especially backward and remote villages, have only very small clinics or even no doctors, and people there surely cannot get timely and properly treatment. So it’s cruel to build a cheap, convenient detecting instrument which can help them detect the disease. Although it cannot solve the problem radically, it can help more people to detect certain diseases.
Current Situation of people’s hospitalizing in China
China owns for 1.4 billion people, but the medical and health expenses are much fewer than what it ought to be. From 1999 to 2014, the average cost for the public to go to see a doctor had multiplied by 19.75, which is much beyond the increasing speed of income [5]. It not only brought heavy economic burden to enterprises and country, but also made serious economic and social troubles. In China, about 48.9% of the public do not go to the hospital when they are ill, and the proportion of people who refuse to be in hospital as they need is 29.6% [5].
Simultaneously, it has become harder to tolerant the unfair treatment in medical and health field. According to the assessment list made by WHO in 2000 about medical and health of 191 countries, China only ranked No.144 of the list. In the assessment of funding and distribution justice, China only listed No.188, the last but three [5].
All the data show that the backward of medical and health has become a threshold to China’s striding forward. This situation goes far beyond the economic development and China’s nature. How to decrease the cost, together with how to make it more convenient for people to get medical treatment, remains a big challenge.
Current Situation of Medical Appliances in China
We are happy to announce that medical appliances enhance a brighter environment than we think of. Up to 2013, China already has 15961 medical appliance institutions in total. Every province owns some institutions and they are all approved by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) except for those in Hainan Province [6].
However, like hospitals in China, medical institutions also rely much on the economy development. As the analysis"

USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," that there is a huge decrease of fluorescence intensity when temperature increases from 30 ℃ to 34 ℃ while no obvious changes occur when temperature varies from 34 ℃ to 42 ℃. That is not fully in line with expectation. The possible explanation is that heat shock indeed causes the aggregation of Sup35 and relatively higher temperature can enhance the aggregation effect. But there is another important factor you have to notice, which is that when Sup35 is in prion state (non-prion state of Sup35 nearly don’t form aggregation), it can propagate and transform the normal Sup35 protein into its prion state. And 2 hours is so long for the cells to finish the form changing process and aggregation of all the Sup35, regardless of the little differences in the temperature of heat shock. In conclusion, the latter three points in diagram 2 have similar values because the aggregation of Sup35 had come to saturation. Now you might want to ask why group 1 doesn’t show this contradiction. The reason might be that 1 hour is not sufficient for process of injection and aggregation to finish and during that time temperature has a dominant effect on the aggregation of Sup35.
In a word, from the temperature experiments above, we provide valid evidence which showed that our system could work effectively!
(2) Testing the effect of GdnHCl
We measured fluorescence intensity of S. cerevisiae cultivated at 42 ℃ in 0.25 mM, 0.50 mM, 3 mM, 5 mM GdnHCl for 4 hours.
By using Image Processing method described in the appendix, we got this diagram.
According to statistics analysis, with the increase of concentration of GdnHCl, fluorescence intensity increase in the first stage, and then decrease. In the first stage, fluorescence became brighter because Sup35 disaggregated and our kill switch turned on again. In the latter stage, the fluorescence intensity decreases which was opposite to our modeling results. We assumed that GdnHCl, which possesses high electric charge, may lead to the misfolding of split sfGFP. It is likely to disturb the two fragments assembling and reconstituting. Thus, GdnHCl is a suitable curing reagent for Sup35 in S. cerevisiae within limited concentration range.

The iGEM Team Cologne-Düsseldorf invited us and other iGEM Teams to the SynBioDay 2017 in Düsseldorf. Once again we crossed Germany improving our driving and navigating skills and were welcomed by a highly motivated team that organized this open day for the public and for experts. We can’t explain how happy we were to participate at this day. We go a whole bunch of knowledge from other iGEM Teams that introduced their projects, but also heard many interesting talks from experts that introduced different topics of Synthetic Biology.  After a very informative day, a filled stomach and fully loaded brain we ended the day with a very interesting discussion about the ethics of genetic engineering and Synthetic Biology. Here experts and non-experts could explain and exchange their point of views. Thank you iGEM Team Köln/Düsseldorf – it was a blast!
Article: Labexchange supports young scientists
12th september 2017
The Labexchange Foundation supports students in the development of an ecofriendly tube cleaner. In the name of the Labexchange Foundation, Dr. Wolfgang Kuster handed out a Stratagene Robocycler 96 as a donation to the iGEM-project team at the University of Stuttgart. “If Labexchange would sponsor this device to us, it would be pretty awesome and a huge relief to our team!”, Georg Singer (iGEM) in his message to Labexchange. Georg is one of a group of ten people at the University of Stuttgart asking for support in the participation in the biggest international competition of biotechnology for students.  The “international genetically engineered machine”-competition (iGEM) unites and facilitates interdisciplinary areas of synthetic biology, bioinformatics and system’s biology and was set up at the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in 2004.  This year a team of the University of Stuttgart is participating for the first time. To work on their project “LIGHT UP THE PIPE” the Labexchange Foundation sponsored a PCR cycler (Stratagene Robocycler 96) amounting to 1.250,00 €.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," establishing a customized metabolism specifically tailored for the user's application.
Introduction
In order to achieve a fully controllable artificial compartment, the first step was to design a completely orthogonal import system. Next was the knockout of endogenous import systems. However, a few proteins are imported neither by the Pex5 nor the Pex7 import machinery. Therefore, specific genome engineering designs, such as knockouts, deleting or redirecting the protein localization could be utilized for the ultimate goal of creating a synthetic organelle.
Additionally, knockouts or genome integrations enable customization of the peroxisomal properties, such as membrane permeability, size/number, decoupling of peroxisomes from cytoskeleton and the peroxisomal metabolism.
All these strategies allow a rational design of an artificial compartment, which is fully engineerable regarding  the proteome, metabolome and the entire peroxisomal environment.
Design of yeast multi -knockout strains
The Crispr Cas9 System
The demands on yeast engineering have significantly increased with the design of more complex systems and extensive metabolic pathways. Genetic techniques that have historically relied on marker recycling are unable to keep up with the ambitions of synthetic biologists. In recent years the Crispr Cas9 system has been used for several strain-engineering purposes, including:
Markerless integration of multiple genetic cassettes into selected genomic loci
Multiplexed and iterative gene knockouts without the need to recycle a marker
Precise genome editing – nucleotide substitutions, etc.
We utilized the Cas9 system as a tool for peroxisomal engineering and have adopted the existing toolbox from (Lee et al. 2015) and the complete cloning system which also provides the possibilities for genome integration and gene editing by Cas9. For this, two oligonucleotides have to be designed for targeting the Cas protein to the gene of interest.
Figure 1: Plasmid construction for the gRNA expression plasmid
Two oligos, containing the targeting sequence of the gRNA, have to be annealed and can then be integrated in the gRNA entry Vector by a Golden Gate reaction. Adapted from ( Lee et al. 2015 )
Several gRNA vectors can subsequently be assembled into one vector with a Cas9 expression cassette and then be transformed into yeast. The expression of Cas9 together with gene specific gRNA´s leads to double strand breakage followed by non-homologous end joining repair or homologous recombination, in case of added repair DNA (figure 3).

WITS-CSIR_SA,2011,Team:WITS-CSIR SA#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," results in the RBS being exposed. This allows for the translation of the adjoining gene. In this case, the gene which will be expressed is CheZ - a fundamental protein in the signalling cascade of bacterial chemotaxis.
This theophylline riboswitch 2- CheZ fusion BioBrick activates the expression of the CheZ gene in a theophylline-dependent fashion. It consists of a newly improved theophylline riboswitch clone 12.1 (Lynch and Gallivan NAR 2009) that is detached from its associated translation unit (coding region) and fused to a CheZ gene which has a N-fusion prefix and lacks a stop codon (although a TAG stop codon is provided by the RFC 25 suffix). The riboswitch regulated N-terminal part can be fused to a reporter or other CDS.
CheZ is the chief regulator of the molecular events that lead the counter clockwise rotation of the flagella motor during the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of E.coli. This counter clockwise flagella motor rotation results in bacterial swimming (instead of tumbling) in the presence of a chemoattractant (in this case, theophylline).
Back to Top
When no atrazine is present, the RBS within the riboswitch sequence is not exposed to translation machinery. When atrazine is present, it binds to the riboswitch and causes a conformational change which results in the RBS being exposed. This allows for the translation of the adjoining gene. In this case, the gene which will be expressed is CheZ - a fundamental protein in the signalling cascade of bacterial chemotaxis. This riboswitch-CheZ fusion BioBrick regulates the expression of the CheZ gene in an atrazine-dependent fashion. It is composed of an atrazine-sensitive riboswitch, developed by Sinha et al (2010), which is detached from its associated translation unit (coding region) and fused to a CheZ gene which has the Freiburg N-fusion prefix and lacks a stop codon. While it is possible to fuse the riboswitch to the CheZ coding region by standard BioBrick assembly techniques, this approach was not used as it would increase the distance between the RBS and the ATG start codon and potentially decrease the efficiency of the riboswitch. This was shown in the work of the Taipei 2010 team who used this approach for a theophylline riboswitch. The riboswitch and the adjacent CheZ coding region are considered together and should be cloned together. Che"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Manufacturing_-_-_TEXT.html," accommodate the production of bulk numbers of cartridges in the hundreds (involving daily operations) with the intent of increasing this production to accommodate thousands of cartridges to be produced. This will be done through further partnerships to diverse manufacturing groups outside of Canada as we begin to move our production to a more global audience.  Our first major goal in our marketing strategy is to reach 30% of the government regulation market with our product.  This would require the capacity to produce approximately 15,000 cartridges per year. As the biological components for this volume of cartridges would still be small, FREDsense could feasibly produce the components necessary for this volume.
Timeframe - We plan to reach full capacity, supplying approximately 30% of the government regulation market (15,000 cartridges and 150 detectors yearly) by year three of active production as dictated in our budget and milestones section.  This means we will be required to begin negotiating new contracts with larger manufacturers and distribution providers by year 2 to ensure our company continues to grow.
Manufacturing Advantages
Our technology platform provides clear manufacturing advantages compared to similar products:
Versatility -  All products we hope to generate, the general toxin sensor and other second generation products, will use the same detector system. The only change in component is in the bacterial strain used in the cartridges.  This provides versatile product lines to be developed with minimal additional costs in manufacturing incurred.
Multiple Strategies - Our group has identified multiple types of prototype designs to accommodate changes in cost associated with the cuvette style cartridge system (i.e. using microfluidics as an alternative to cuvettes).  This will ensure that we can implement the best, most cost-effective, solution in our manufacturing.
Retaining Control - The province of Alberta has numerous government programs which allow for manufacturing contacts to be made more easily and at a discounted rate.  We hope to use these types of contacts to establish relationships with key industry manufacturing players.  By out-sourcing all of the non-biological components of our systems to these manufacturers, we have the ability to retain control of the sensing organism we are using while maintaining the benefits of allowing other contractors to build our detectors and partially our cartridges.

Our model
In our model , we use Gillespie algorithm to simulate the process of inversion. Here we use   Markov chain to describe the process of inversion. We assume that the state ‘A’ , ‘B’ , ‘C’ , ‘D’ , is the original state , the state after inversion , the  Intermediate state when A forms holiday junction, the Intermediate state when B forms holiday  junction respectively.
(VAN DUYNE G D, 2001)[3]
(VAN DUYNE G D, 2001)[3]
The following are the reactions which are related to the process of inversion.
Then we get the following Markov chain.
Here,
are the probabilities of the reaction in an  Infinitesimal time. According to the property of the Markov chain , we can get:
In the model,
is proportional to the concentration of Cre-Loxp and
are much larger than
Here we see 1000 genes which are in state ‘A’ as a whole and we get the following results. The concentration of Cre-Loxp ：
The number of the genes which are in the original state and in the state after inversion:
From the above two figures, we can see that the rate of the inversion is proportional to the concentration of Cre-Loxp. And about 50% of the genes keep the original state and the other 50% change to the state we want. The result is exactly what we expected, which clearly demonstrates our system can truly be controlled by adding in external signal molecules (arabinose).

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html," replacing the MotA and MotB proteins which make up E. Coli’s rotor (they form a H+ channel) with proteins PotB59 and PomA from V. Alginolyticus(they form a Na+ channel).
Background
HNS/HNST108I
Many species of bacteria have flagellar motility that is achieved by rotating surface-exposed organelles The rotation of the flagella is controlled by a motor complex embedded in the inner membrane (reviewed in Refs. 2 and 3 The motor region of E. Coli’s flagella is composed of several parts. The stator complex, made up of the proteins MotA-MotB, has a transmembrane characteristic and ensures the generation of a proton channel (4-6).  The rotor complex involves the interaction of three other proteins, FliG, FliM, and FliN(7,8). All three rotor proteins are involved in the processes of flagellar assembly, switching, and rotation (9,10). However, FliG is predominately involved in torque generation (8, 10, 11), whereas FliM mainly functions in switching rotor direction (12). The precise role of FliN is the least well defined, but it may participate in flagella protein-specific export and assembly (13,14)
HNS is a transcription factor that plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in E. Coli. It plays an activator role at the level of protein synthesis for many genes involved in bacterial motility.  . . In many studies it was shown that HNS is essential for the synthesis of proteins that make up the rotor and stator. The flhCD operon is a positive regulator of HNS which is responsible for the synthesis of many proteins that composes the structure of the bacterial flagella. Studies show that knock-out of the gene that codes the HNS protein results in non-motile E. Coli.
Above, we mentioned three proteins that make up the stator portion of the bacterial flagella.. These proteins are FliG, FliM and FliN and these three proteins have different activities. FliM is a regulator protein that is responsible for determining in which direction the bacterial flagella will be oriented. Although the role of FliN is not precisely known, it is thought that it acts as a guide for the assembly of the flagella’s membrane/for attachment of flagella to the membrane. As for FliG, this protein is responsible for the rotation speed and torque power of the bacterial flag"

Results
In the minimal M9 media, all possible combinations of parameters listed above were tested.                                 None of the concentrations of glucose had any aﬀect on the growth of E. coli. It was expected that as the concentration of glucose increased, the growth of E. coli also increased. However, the variation between the concentrations of glucose may have been too small for a noticeable increase in E. coli growth as the concentration of glucose increased. Also, even the maximum concentration of glucose tested, 100mM, may have been too low to aﬀect the growth of E. coli to an observable extent. Eventually, 10mM was determined to be the optimal glucose concentration for the purpose of least interference possible in solution.                                 NH4Cl as minimal nitrogen source was proven to be not suitable for E. coli growth at any concentration as the OD600 testing results showed that cell density didn’t change throughout the time. It was probably due to the permeability of cell membrane was limited for NH4+ and Cl- ions. Eventually Glutamate at concentration of 10mM supported cell growth the best and thus chosen as part of optimal environment condition.                                  With CASAmino solution’s buffering utility, the pH was controlled little bit below 7 but close to 7.                                  To protect the iron core of the nitrogenase, temperature of 30°C and Anaerobic were both determined not for cell growth but for nitrogenase activity testing, which is the next phase.

Week 10 5.09-9.09
Ligated HyaA and HyaB N-terminus did not yield any colonies. Stocks of DNA were made by inoculating and mini-prepping more samples of the HydABC.
The triparental conjugation was continued from last week, however there were no S. oneidensis colonies containing the plasmid. Attempted electroporation to deliver the plasmid with HydABC into S. oneidensis. The first attempt did not yield any results, but the second attempt gave colonies of S.oneidensis MR-1 and ∆HydABC,HyaABCstrains S. oneidensis with both 8A5 and 9A5.
We grew∆HydABC,HyaABC and wildtype MR-1 strains for 24 hours in anaerobic conditions. We then used an electrochemical cell setup to analyse the activation of the hydrogenase enzymes, and the difference between the two strains. This would then serve as a control for later experiments.
Week 11 12.09-16.09
Attempted to start again with NiFe catalytic subunit cloning. PCR amplified with new primers and digested with a new source of EcoR1 and Pst1 as digests with our enzymes showed high amounts of smearing. Digested gel showed a band for HyaB N-terminus but not for HyaB C-terminus. Ligations, at ratios of 1:3, 1:5 and 1:7, were set up to be transformed the following week. Alongside HyaB N- and C-terminus, it was decided to excise HydABC out of the pBAD vector and ligate that into pSB1C3.
Mini-prepped colonies of the electroporation were sent off for sequencing. Results showed that only wild type S. oneidensis MR-1 has successfully taken up the HydABC C-terminally tagged i.e. 8A5, construct. Triparental conjugation and electroporation was continued with other strains but did not yield results. Protein expression trials (induced with 0mM, 1mM and 10mM arabinose) of the WT with 8A5, E.coli with 8A5 and 9A5 were performed using SDS-PAGE and western blot techniques"
NYU,2010,Team:NYU#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"Fv has yielded a lot of great information and previous studies similar to the functional aspect of our system. Previous studies, however, do not use the split ubiquitin system nor encourage transcription of nutritional markers for directed evolution toward antibody binding (rather, they merely mutate via error-prone PCR and scan for binding antibodies through a system more like the two-hybrid). John is writing to researchers requesting scFv intrabodies and antigens, as well as a library of scFvs mutagenized from the original intrabody scaffold. Hopefully these requests will result in useful materials and advice!

Ran gel for pTEF-RBS and Aga2Linker-ECFPTerminator, and found that pTEF-RBS isn’t correct, probably only RBS was cut out. Innoculated pTEF-RBS from plate from last week, where the ligation was performed from a Miniprepped digest, rather than from a PCR (from which the current minipreps of pTEF-RBS are). Aga2Linker-ECFPTerm had a band at the correct size (1.3 kb) but also had a smaller band around 400-500 bp, need to think about this and make sure the insert is correct.

Today I transformed biobricks necessary for the second half of our system construction. Over the weekend I've been brainstorming ways to construct the response system circuits and have decided that we'll be using the LexA and LacI DNA binding proteins. The Initial Distribution this year came with most of the parts we'll need including some very useful composite reporter devices. For a time I also organized our growing collection of liquid and glycerol biobricks to maintain smaller stocks, something that will probably be an ongoing battle in the war against disorganization.
We are having some trouble assembling very small parts onto larger ones, case in point: the RBS onto a large promoter. Harris believes that the dichotomy of sizes of these parts makes it hard to relatively represent each in reaction solutions. We thought that the PCR product assembly method would work for this but have been disappointed thus far. For the sake of time I am going to order oligos and PCR-ligate the RBS onto pGAL and pTEF, as well as the RBS onto Lac"

With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to solve our differential equations. We tried them by hand but were not able to solve them analytically. We had to solve numerically and chose the Euler method.

We’ve recreated this model so it’s actually running in the browser - try dragging the sliders above the graph to modify the rate constants.
Mass action kinetics model with transcription and translation
The first simple model neglected transcription and translation completely, which meant it was an excessive simplification and consequently was not that useful. To address these shortcomings, we created a second model, derived from parts of Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD, with many more species. [5]
This model was very slow to run (so slow we’re not going to try run it in the browser), as there were many species and thus more calculations needed to be done per loop. However, it primarily was slow as we needed a small dt value to keep the model accurate so there were more loops in total.
We had to use a very small dt value or errors could easily add up with so many species. It ended up taking about a minute to run each simulation which wasn’t acceptable for us, as we wanted to be able to quickly change parameters and ideally test a range of parameters. Speeding up the model would make it more useful to the wetlab team. They then could vary each of our parameters and see how they affected GFP output, for example seeing the effects of different switch designs and experimental setups.
Having lots of species also made it harder to find accurate rate constants for all the steps in the reaction. Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD was very useful for this, although many of his values weren’t that applicable to us as we used a different cell-free system leading to inaccuracies -  which were amplified when dt was increased.
It was also difficult to get useful data from the model as there were so many parameters that changing just one was unlikely to have a significant effect on the final result. This made it harder to draw conclusions from the model. For similar reasons it would also have made it hard to adjust the parameters to fit to our lab data when we had it. More parameters also increased the total uncertainty, decreasing the precision of our model.

This morning, we took out our digestion reactions from the thermocycler, containing all 18 practice plate target oligos mixed together. The tube containing the overnight reaction was a bit crushed by the machine, and it looks like we lost a bit of volume.
Regardless, we performed a PCR purification on the product, and got a concentration of ~17 ng/ul.
Then, we performed a ligation with the Oligo Pool and the CB Bottom backbone using the typical protocol. We performed a chemical transformation with the ligation product, plating at two densities using 50 ul of transformed bacteria and 450 ul.  We shall see tomorrow whether any colonies grew.
Yogurt Plate
Yesterday we plated 10 ul of Stonyfield Super Smoothie from lunch, which contains six varieties of active yogurt bacteria .  Today it grew colonies.  It smelled like yogurt this morning.  This evening it smelled like rotting yogurt.  Yuck.
(UPDATE: According to Dan it smells like Swiss cheese.  Now it smells slightly better).
Prepping for western blot tomorrow
We inoculated cultures (4 ml each) in preparation for western blotting tomorrow to verify that the zinc fingers are indeed being expressed by IPTG.  Here is the setup:
Kan - pze22g with GFP as a complete negative control (there should be no zinc fingers in there... hoping there's also no proteins with flag tags in there)
Spec - Zif268 whole with 0 uM IPTG
Spec - Zif268 whole with 2 uM IPTG
Spec - Zif268 whole with 10 uM IPTG
Spec - Zif268 whole with 100 uM IPTG
We expect to see zinc finger expression to varying degrees in the cultures with IPTG, depending on the level of IPTG.  Hopefully we'll have enough protein and FLAG tag antibody to work with tomorrow.

There appears to be a significant difference between the KN and KS strands, but only at high SDS levels i.e. 2% (lag of about 5 hours). At lower levels, there appears to be no significant lag, but a difference in the slope of the log phase.
Even at 0 IPTG, there is expression of the ZF plasmid, suggesting leakiness (constitutively 'ON' promoter for the ZFP)
WS and WN strands show lack of growth in the presence of SDS at any concentration (except 0) and PCR shows odd results (no band to 800bp bands for the product using tolC"

Design
Our team intends to use Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) to produce adrenaline. We designed a two-plasmid system which harbors synthetic human cDNAs encoding the adrenaline enzymatic pathway. We explored how the insertion of this plasmid system into a strain of S. cerevisiae engineered to overproduce L-tyrosine1 can be used for the biosynthesis of adrenaline. As dopamine and noradrenaline, two of the three metabolic intermediates of the adrenaline enzymatic pathway2 as shown in Figure 1, are also of biomedical interest3, we intend to create three strains of S. cerevisiae producing dopamine, noradrenaline or adrenaline based on plasmid combination.
Figure 1. The adrenaline enzymatic pathway2.
In order to achieve that we will create three plasmids. The first plasmid, pRS31N-TH-LDDC, will carry the genes coding for the first two enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway, tyrosine hydroxylase and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, and will hence allow for the production of dopamine when transformed into the optimised strain of S. cerevisiae. The second plasmid, pRS31H-DBH, will contain the gene coding for dopamine β-hydroxylase in order to produce noradrenaline when combined with the first plasmid. The last construct, pRS31H-DBH-PNMT, will carry both the genes coding for dopamine β-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase. As shown in Figure 2, the combination of the first and the last plasmid will therefore allow for the production of adrenaline. To assure that both plasmids can be maintained within the yeast cells simultaneously, they will be engineered to harbour different resistance genes. The plasmid pRS31N-TH-LDDC will possess a nourseotricin (NatR) resistance gene, while the plasmids pRS31H-DBH and pRS31H-DBH-PNMT will harbour a hygromycin (hPhR) resistance gene.
Finally, all the products will be purified by HPLC using the reverse-phase analytical  column Primesep"
Glasgow,2015,Team:Glasgow#AzureA_-_-_TEXT.html,"500ml of 1x. 10g of Azure A chloride will produce 25L of 1x stain, or 50 500ml batches. This calculates to an estimated 1,400 gels per 10g of Azure A; or £0.026/$0.042 per gel. At face value this is more expensive per gel than EtBr, but Azure A does not require specialist disposal services, the lightbox which is helpful for visualising bands for gel extraction can vary in price but will not likely reach the price of a UV transilluminator, with a Top of the Range professional white light box for photography purposes costing ~£282/$440 (Calumet: https://www.calphoto.co.uk/product/Calumet-Light-Box-A3-/710-407X) with cheaper alternatives available. Imaging an Azure A gel can be done on any lab or office scanner, if the gel is placed between two sheets of acetate, rather than requiring specialist UV illumination and capture equipment.
Figure 3: Sequential destains of one Azure A stained 1% Agarose gel, following the protocol provided below, imaged between two sheets of Acetate on a office scanner. Click for full size.
Protocol for producing a 2x stock solution of Azure A stain
We maintained a 2x stock solution in line with the recommendation of the NCBE guidance from which we first learned of Azure A staining (NCBE, 2003b). To produce 1L of 2x Azure A (0.08% Azure A/40% Ethanol):
Dissolve 0.8g Azure A chloride solid in 1L 40% Ethanol
Store in a glass screw capped bottle out of direct sunlight, or alternatively wrap the bottle in aluminium foil. Azure A will bleach over time in sunlight and lose effectiveness.
Prior to use, a 1x (0.04% Azure A/20% Ethanol) solution should be prepared by diluting the 2x stock 1:1 with distilled or deionised water to a desired final volume.
1x stock should also be stored in a glass screw capped bottle out of direct sunlight.
Approximately 500ml of 1x stain was found to be suitable for staining of gels used in our experiments, however this may vary depending on gel and staining tray size.
Protocol for staining with 1x Azure A
In this protocol Azure A is used as a post-electrophoresis gel stain. The effect of putting it in the running buffer is unknown, other than it"

This is one of the reasons why biotechnology in Indonesia is far behind the other Asian countries. In fact, the total funding per gross domestic product for Indonesia is around 0.07%. This value is smaller than those of Ethiopia (0.17%) and Colombia (0.16%). Even with the lack of government funding, some institutes and universities have the urge to develop biotechnology. There are around 30 institutes and some universities in Indonesia that join the development of  biotechnology industry so far.
Perception of Synthetic Biology
Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) iGEM 2013 team conducted interviews with 5 random citizens in Indonesia. The interviewees came from different background. The interviews reveal that all of the interviewees did not know what synthetic biology meant. (R.N, 2013). The term synthetic biology did appear in newspapers and blogs, but no formal studies have been conducted to measure the perception of synthetic biology in Indonesia. Considering that not many people fully understand the term biotechnology, it seems like the concept synthetic biology, a relatively new field, is even less prevalent.
Research, People & Organizations
Research
Scientists in Indonesia are actively conducting researches related to biology and biotechnology. For example, Indonesian Institute of Sciences Biotechnology Research Center (LIPI) has been conducting numerous researches related to biotechnology. It is probably these kinds of research institutes that will adopt synthetic biology techniques once it becomes more prevalent in Indonesia.
The following table summarizes some of the researches of LIPI

II Peristaltic pump
2.1Design:
  The injection and the flow of liquid in the chip is achieved through the negative pressure produced by the peristaltic pump.Peristaltic pump suck the air inside the chip, so that the air pressure inside the chip will be less than atmospheric pressure.That’s how the negative pressure is produced.Under the negative pressure,the liquid will flows into the chip.What’s more,the flow rate can be determined by controlling the pumping speed of the peristaltic pump, and the liquid inflow volume can be controlled by controlling the pumping time.Through the experiment we found that the best speed of liquid flow is 37uL/min(Experiment can be found in 'Demonstrate').And the pumping time can be set on the serial screen.
   
2.2Materials:
 This year we choose peristaltic pump of model S100-2B + TH10B.This type of peristaltic pump has long service life and is small in size and cheap in price.
   
III Confocal detection of optical path
3.1Design:
 In order to detect the intensity of GFP and RFP that produced by E.coli, we designed a dual optical path confocal fluorescence detection device.This is our optical path diagram, we used two high-power LED, four filters, five convergence lens, three long-shaped two-color lens and two photoelectric sensor OPT101.
   
   
3.2Materials:
 This year we chose GFPmut3b,its excitation peak is 501nm, and emission peak is 511nm. And we also choose mRFP1, its excitation peak is 584nm, and emission peak is 607nm.Based on their information and the experimental data we obtained, we chose light sources and other optical components. Such as light source’s excitation peaks are 490nm and 585nm.For further details on other optical components, you can see  at the 'Component Information Table'.
3.3Working Process:
 First, the LED emits a laser with a peak of 490nm.Through the reflection of the dichroic mirror and the focus of the converging lens, the laser will forces on chamber II.The GFP in E. coli will be stimulated to produce green fluorescence with a peak of 511 nm.Fluorescence will eventually focus on OPT101.S"

Note: The minimum period after which the second button must be clicked is 2 days, so that the yeast reaches the stationary phase of its life cycle where the production of the secondary metabolites like Felinine would be at their maximum.
Steps to use TOMCAT+:
BIOREACTOR - For large-scale production of Felinine
“The only way to turn a project into a product is to industrialize it!”
Since we wanted to create an impact on as many stakeholders as possible, we had to extend our Product Design so that it may smoothly be integrated in the organizational framework of the Large Storehouse, where the chief method for avoiding rat infestation was to fumigate the grains with chemical sprays.
The sprays used by the big corporations are toxic nature, but if we were to mass produce a naturally occurring pheromone, it would not only ensure complete eradication of the “RAT MENACE” from the Large Granaries, but will also ensure absolutely no deterioration of the grain quality.
Since, the method of deployment is the same as the one employed by Food Corporation of India (FCI) workers, our Product Design can be smoothly integrated with the present strategies without any demand for new resources.
The BIOREACTOR uses a regular supply of nutrients and works in a Batch-cum-Continuous manner to produce Felinine in large quantities. This can be deployed in High-Pressure Sprays and also be stored in hydrogels, which would allow for the slow release of FearOmone from the hydrogel, making sure that FearOmone stays in the environment for a long time.
We knew we had the wheels rolling and were heading for an economically, socially, and environmentally responsible product, but we wanted to understand what our final product represented to our stakeholders. We were always in constant touch with our stakeholders but since we had one idea deployed in 3 smart ways catering to all our stakeholders, any real understanding about how our product would impact lives would have to come from the discussion and deliberation of all our stakeholders and that is exactly what we did!
STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN POST-HARVEST LOSSES MEETUP:
The Stakeholders' meetup allowed the fusion and intermixing of opinions ranging from the farmer, to the General Manager of the Punjab Mandi Board, to the Regional Head of the FCI. We understood that there was a genuine demand for a solution like ours and therefore it possessed the potential to create an impact in our everyday lives. We were made to understand that there exists cases where there is a surplus"

Reasoning:
The concentrations being tested are 0.3 M and 0.5 M. NaCl is being tested for its effect as an osmolite in medium.  Park et al. (2012) found NaCl-free to increase attachment and the capacity of biofilm formation  under salt (0.1-0.3 M) was similar to that of the control. Zogaj et al. (2001) says that the bcs genes were expressed under 0.5 M - it is unclear whether that is similar to the levels found in the  wild type strain.

ABSTRACT
In a parallel galaxy, there are two brothers named T1R2 and T1R3, they living in a galaxy that is under the threaten of sweet monsters who want to rule the galaxy. Though the brothers were born with the ability to eat these monsters, they are too weak to fight with so many enemies. So they ask battle masters who lives in planet JB486 for help, they send their gene to a battle king SC84117 in the meantime. After gene adoption, SC84117 got brothers’ ability and transforms into a spaceship which not only a battle king but can also eat sweet monsters, known as the Sugar Hunter. Since then, he travels all around the galaxy to fight sweet monsters and measure them, the galaxy stays peacefully ever after.

One of the requirements for a working GPCR is that the receptor should be localized into the outside membrane of yeast cell. By replacing the N-terminal part of Your Favorite Receptor by the N-terminal ends of a receptor that is known to be localized into the outside membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (R17), Your Favorite Receptor (YFR) will also be localized into the membrane.  The C-terminal part of a GPCR is the alpha subunit binding region. If this is replaced by the RI7 regions a higher affinity with the alpha subunit can be reached [1].
How?
With this step-by-step protocol we guide you trough all the in silico designing steps. After this the DNA can be transformed in yeast and you have your own olfactory yeast!
In silico protocol
What: Get your receptor protein sequence code
Why: To introduce a new receptor chimera in yeast you should start with a GPCR with at least a known sequence and preferably a known ligand.
How: By using earlier research on GPCRs. For example a nice GPCR database is http://senselab.med.yale.edu/OdorDB/. Copy the DNA sequence and the protein sequence in a text file.
What: look for the transmembrane regions
Why: Normally GPCRs have seven transmembrane regions. The N-terminal loop is important for the localization in the membrane and should be replaced by the RI7 N-terminal sequence. The C-terminal region directly after the last transmembrane part codes for the alpha-subunit binding region. If this region is replaced by the RI7 region a higher affinity with the alpha subunit can be reached.
How: Go to http://elm.eu.org/, enter the protein sequence code and find protein motifs for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the original species. Compare the Global domain table. Ideally it finds seven transmembrane regions that all have approximately the same length (quite a conserved domains are found[2] ).  When this is not the case, investigate the hydrophobicity by a hydrophobicity index (analysis can be done by Matlab Bioinformatics tool, but this less conclusive due to multiple hydrophobicity indexes).
What: Remove protein sequences that code for the N-terminal and C-terminal regions
Why: The sequence that code for the N-terminal loop should be replaced by the RI7 sequence for better membrane localization. The C-terminal region should be replaced for a higher affinity with the alpha subunit.
How: Delete the sequence at the N-terminal end directly after the first transmembrane part (when read"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html," when both crRNA and target RNA is added to the solution. Values reported here are the measured values of which the blank (only RNase alert) is subtracted.
From this figure we can conclude that Cas13a indeed gets activated by finding its target and shows collateral cleavage. There is relatively more fluorescence when Cas13a is present with crRNA and target, than without them.
Production and testing of different crRNAs
We employed our crRNA design to design 5 crRNAs that have been successfully synthesized following the crRNA synthesis protocol . The synthesis of crRNA is achieved by annealing two complementary DNA oligos ( oligos IG0057 - IG0063 ) that serve as templates. In vitro transcription was conducted on these DNA oligos. As indicated in Figure 9, we observe bands of the expected length on a gel, confirming crRNA production.
To test the functioning of these crRNAs, similar fluorescent assays as for testing the functioning of Cas13a were repeated for different crRNAs. The results in Figure 10 show that all tested crRNAs result in Cas13a activation as expected. However, the efficiency of binding the target differs between the crRNAs, with crRNA 3 exhibiting the best target binding.
Figure 9: crRNA production. Electrophoresis of 10% PAGE stained with SYBR Gold. A Low Range ssRNA Ladder (LRL) is used. This gel contains the different designed crRNAs synthesized by in vitro transcription with (1-5) and without hairpin (1H-5H). The presence of bands of the expected length in all lanes indicates successful crRNA production.
Figure 10: Testing the crRNAs. This graph shows the activity of Cas13a in combination with different crRNAs for the same target designed with the crRNA model. The difference in activity demonstrates the difference in efficiency of the different crRNAs.
Conclusions
Although we did not manage to create our own composite BioBrick part containing Cas13a and the spacer sequence, we were still able to to construct a BioBrick composite part comprising the spacer sequence and a constitutive promoter that can be used in combination with other BioBricks encoding for Cas13a.
Furthermore, the Cas13a obtained from Gootenberg et al. 2017 was successfully expressed and purified following the Cas13a protein purification protocol . We confirmed presence of the protein by running on SDS-PAGE . An RNase alert fluorescence assay from Gootenberg et al. 2017 was used to show the functionality of Cas13a. Additionally"

Colony PCR is used  to identify and select cell colonies that have the correct plasmid insert. This  procedure is a way to do several PCR operations on cell colonies in parallel,  to evaluate the results and select the corresponding good cell colonies. After an  overnight growth of E.coli, we can pick up some colonies from the plate and do  a colony PCR verification. Besides, the colonies we choose and should also be  stored, we can incubate these colonies in one plate after every colony has been  marked.

The 2014 Carnegie Mellon iGEM Team is right next door to us and made for an instinctive collaboration opportunity. With the Carnegie Mellon iGEM Team, we are hosting a Pittsburgh iGEM meet-up on September 6, 2014. The meet-up will consist of practice presentations and information sessions on creating a poster, public speaking, and constructing a wiki.
Also with the Carnegie Mellon team, we presented an overview of iGEM and our 2014 projects to a group of undergraduates conducting computational biology research at the University of Pittsburgh on July 11, 2014. The presentation covered the biological, modeling, and outreach components of our iGEM projects. We specifically focused on our logical model and its relation to computational biology. Overall, our presentation was well-received and incited the spark in several undergraduates to start iGEM teams at their own universities.

So if the inventors choose to commercialize their technology independently, they would have 2/3s of the company share. The most likely progression of dNANO would be first to patent the technology. Once we own the exclusive rights, TEC would then suggest connecting with industry partners who we would licence our toolkit to. Alternatively, TEC also suggested an option to a be likely route, where we would give the company exclusive rights to our technology for 1-2 years. In this time, logistical aspects would be dealt with the company such as scaling up production or further developing the technology in house. We would then licence out the technology to company once the option expires. TEC has also given insights into how other factors can play a role in whether startup is successful or not. For example, does the technology in question address a market need? If not, then demand for such a technology will not exist and the startup will fail. Other pitfalls, are that start-ups fail to recognize how long it takes for technology to become commercialized and end up bleeding themselves out financially. At the moment, the market share for nanotechnology has been slow, however most efforts are focussed on drug delivery. Perhaps, future innovations in DNA origami should be directed at novel drug delivery methods?
As a project that originated from the university, share of the venture would be divided in a way where a third is assigned to the university, a third is assigned to the inventors and the last third is assigned to the party that is responsible for commercialization. So if the inventors choose to commercialize their technology independently, they would have 2/3s of the company share."

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#GB_-_-_TEXT.html," using classical Golden Gate. This option has been tested in our team and it works fine. See the result section for more results on the use of GoldenBrick vectors with the construction of the IaaH-Pep2A-IaaM fusion protein.
GoldenBrick also assemble PCR products and shorten the assembly time
Someone that want to create a construct not having the time or the need of cloning his gene into a vector first can still assemble them using GoldenBrick. Although this practice wouldn't be encouraged for standards parts, it can become really useful when trying libraries of different genes in order to find a working one. GoldenBricked parts in plasmid and PCR GoldenBricked parts can be mixed together and assembled the very same way. The user will just have to take care to submit his working parts afterwards. We recommend to amplify new parts flanked by its GoldenBricks prefix and suffix, mix them with the GoldenGate assembly mix in one hand, and digest them in EcoRI and PstI on the other hand and ligate them in pSB1C3 for submitting the GoldenBricked part to the registry.
Classical GoldenGate can be carried out in the mean time than GoldenBrick assembly to create fusion proteins within the construct
GoldenGate in general and GoldenBricks in particular are very efficient to assemble fusion proteins. This is because one can design every overhang it wants and therefore fuse protein domains without leaving any scar. New fusion proteins can be created in the meantime they are assembled in the cassette, using an aditional scar designed by the experimentalist. We also recommand to submit the new fusion protein part separately to contribute to the registry.
Finally, GoldenBricks works for eukaryotes chassis as well as with prokaryotes
As we have seen all along this article, this design of GoldenBricks have been designed for procaryotes, but it can work very well for eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, promoters can include or not a 5'UTR in their sequence to enhance the protein expression. In the case there is no 5'UTR, we can use the same prefix and suffix than the prokaryote promoters and include the 5'UTR with the prokaryotes prefix and suffix of a prokaryotic RBS.
In order to make polycistrons, we can use an Intermediate Ribosome Entry Site (IRES), cloned between an prokaryote RBS prefix and suffix.

BNU-CHINA,2015,Team:BNU-CHINA#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," an effective emergency plan when the plague outbreaks. Furthermore, we can’t ensure the yield of the farmers through economic crops.
The science popularization of the details about the agricultural disasters face lots of adverse conditions. Many farmers can’t have a clear identification of the nematodes because they are too small for farmers to have a right categorization. So the protection of the crops is not perfect enough. It will be quite difficult to control the disaster if it bursts suddenly.
Based on the problems above, we brought up the following suggestions.
The government sectors should strengthen the communication with the local farmers and understand what the real demand of the common people. And the service items should be set to satisfy the real need of the farmers.
We should encourage more technicians to work in the field and support the farmers and help them know their field well. In addition, we should provide them with more details of the solutions to agricultural disasters.
We need to establish a complete system of preventing the damage of the nematodes before it happens.
These are the conclusions and suggestions of this project above. We hope the related government departments could adopt our advice. And we also hope we can build a complete database for the precaution of the agricultural disasters from now on. More details will be shown at the following website. ( Know more about our database, please click here. ) We believe we will help the government as well as the farmers to solve more problems.

Scientific propaganda in rural schools
China has quite vast land as well as the complexed terrain. Due to the intricate geographical environment and the poor traffic condition, the education levels of some countrysides are comparatively low. The rural population are lack of the basic knowledge of agriculture. Whereas our project combines with the current agricultural production closely , besides we are members of the best normal universities in China, so it is our responsibilities that prompt us to come into rural schools to propagandize the agricultural pests damage, especially for the nematodes. Aiming at this, we did  volunteering public science education for a week.

Breveter une réelle invention, un concept ou une marque a-t-il de réelles conséquences sur le progrès au quotidien ? C’est ce à quoi nous avons invités les étudiants de Sup’Biotech à répondre.
32 % pensent que les brevets constitueraient un frein à l’innovation, tandis que 43 % pensent le contraire. L’avis semble assez partagé, ce qui est assez surprenant étant donné qu’en théorie le brevet est un outil d’incitation à l’innovation.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," FRET (Förster Energy Transfer System) system. GFPs emission energy is thereby taken up by REACh1 and released as thermal energy instead of visible light. This eliminates the GFP fluorescence and allows the release of a strong fluorescence signal, if a TEV protease is expressed and the linker is cut. The cutting separates GFP and REACh1 cancelling the FRET interaction and providing a GFP fluorescence response.
Characterization
In order to characterize K1319001 it was expressed as a fusion protein together with GFP to show its quenching ability. This fusion protein, produced by K1319013, was located on the plasmid backbone pSB3K3. To show that the reduced fluorescence was due to the quenching ability of K1319001 and not based on a faulty expression, K1319008 was also introduced into the cells on a pSB1C3 backbone to create a double plasmid system. Both constructs were put into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and compared to I20260 and B0015 . B0015 was used as a negative control and I20260 was chosen as a positive control due to the expressed GFP being identical to the GFP being expressed in the fusion protein of K1319013 and having the same promoter, RBS, Terminator and plasmid backbone.
The double plasmid system, B0015 and I20260 were measured in biological triplicates and after 2 h one set of triplicates of each of the three systems were induced with 50 µl 100mM IPTG in their 50 ml culture (500 ml shake flasks). Fluorescence measurement was performed with the Synergy Mx from BioTek with an excitation wavelength of 496 ± 9 nm and emission wavelength of 516 ± 9 nm. The following graph shows the resulting fluorescence adjusted for the measured optical density to account for difference in growth of the cultures and to only show the fluorescence per cell.
Comparison of the fluorescence adjusted for OD of I20260, B0015 and the double plasmid system K1319013 + K1319008
After induction with IPTG after 2 h the double plasmid system produced a fast fluorescence response with an over 9-fold increase compared to the non induced state. I20260 served as positive control and B0015 as negative control.
The strong fluorescence response (9-fold increase) after induction with IPTG shows the functionality of GFP inside the fusion protein. After the induction a TEV protease is produced which is specifically cutting the recognition sequence build"

ProtoCat 3.0 - Human Practices
Protocol Model Development
Prior to beginning the development of ProtoCat 3.0, we did research on currently used protocol models. We began by     brainstorming with members of our team who had lab experience to get a foundation upon which we could improve. We tested the robustness of this initial model by trying to represent the protocols uploaded to ProtoCat 2.0 with our new model, tweaking and updating it along the way. Once we felt our model could adequately handle the protocols we anticipated in ProtoCat 3.0, we met with our adviser, Dr. Santiago Schnell, and ran our protocol model by him. Taking his feedback, we went back and further refined our model to the one that we use in our current implementation of ProtoCat 3.0.
Standard Protocol Format
Standardization in synthetic biology has gained a lot of traction, such as the BioBrick and Registry of Standardized Biological Parts. However, the procedures used to generate them tend to be diverse in nature, with a bacterial transformation protocol likely requiring different information than a ligation protocol. Online protocol repositories must account for such differences when creating their data models, which will usually require either a simplified model (such as solely text-based) or a more arduous upload process. These different models become a problem when trying to share protocols between the repositories, because the formats that the protocols are stored in are not compatible and require an external conversion tool to get from one format to the other. In order to begin working towards a standardized protocol format format, we reached out to OpenWetWare and Protocols.io, two well known protocol repositories. We have began discussing how we will reconcile our respective protocol models in order to get the best protocol model. The first steps have been taken to build a cooperative relationship and create a standard protocol that will help make protocols even easier to use, test, review, and design."

Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan
We attended International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference held by National Chiao Tung University from July 31st to August 4th 2017. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 6 members of our team was sent to Taiwan.
During the conference, the iGEMers communicated, changed ideas and learned from one another. The conference is not only a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, but an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology as well. All the teams made a project presentation and introduced their projects. In this way, we received useful feedbacks and technology-improvement suggestions from students and professors of other teams.

Software Promotion
Since our software is an open and fantastic platform with practical functions for synthetic biologists, it’s of great importance to promote our software to synthetic biology related users.
To find out whether our improvement above is useful or not, We packed up an alpha version distributing to schoolmates whose major is biology in September. And in October we packed a more advanced version to some igem teams worldwide. We introduced them to Biohub and its basic usage. After they had used this software for a while, most of them reported that it was quite useful. And then we have packed our completed version to the real synthetic biologists by now.

Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," (GMOs) and what were the positives and negatives of them. Once that was through we started the first event.   The first event we had was to talk about our very own Canadian genetically enhanced Yorkshire pig called the EnviroPig™. It has the capability to digest plant phosphate more efficiently than traditional Yorkshire pigs, which do not contain the enzyme to break it down, phytase. This gene can be found in E.coli which had been inserted into a pig embryo to allow it to produce phytase in its salivary glands. This is a real technology in Canada and is currently a very hot topic of debate among many citizens, so we thought it would be ideal to introduce students to the world of biotechnology right in their very own backyards. Once students had been exposed to the information, we had given them a package which we had compiled giving the positives and negatives of societal, technological, ethical, environmental and economical issues.
Of course, it did not end there! Students were then put into groups of 5 and as mentioned above, one of the key goals of UW iGEM Outreach is to allow members of our community to make informed decisions based on facts. Supplied with markers and paper students were to give a 1-2 minute presentation on why they did/did not believe that the EnviroPig™ should continue receiving funding from the government of Canada. The best and most convincing presentation won- we had great discussions from the negative aspects to positive aspects to even a compiled rap song about the EnviroPig™!
After the first event we continued on with our presentation. Here we discussed current industries that had been affected by synthetic biology. This incorporated the pharmaceutical and biofuels industries specifically. We discussed how pharmaceuticals had incorporated an aspect known as biosynthesis where they could customize and fine-tune certain pathways using standardized parts in order to provide efficient and precise drug delivery systems. In biofuels we talked about first and second generation biofuels and how the use of synthetic biology has the ability to create a ‘superbug’ to look for corresponding metabolic pathways for yielding ideal results. After this we did the second activity.
The second event that had been implemented was to incorporate what we do in our labs, outside of the lab. Essentially, we wanted to introduce the idea of synthetic biology to students and how it was an extension of what we knew as genetic engineering and consisted of students not just from science but from math, engineering and computer science. The activity called, ‘Design Your Own Pathway’ gave a series of scenarios we had given students with a library of BioBr"

Bordeaux,2013,Team:Bordeaux#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," from nature to create a new yogourt with all the benefits of natural compounds. Here are two examples : Betanine, one of the major compounds of the beet, is commonly used as a food additive (E162), is a natural antioxidant and is well assimilated by the organism. Moreover, the colour of this pigment varies with the pH, an important fact to get different colours. The idea of designing a kit, with modified lactobacillus which produce betanine is interesting, for a use at home.
From the knowledge of the pathway of Lactobacillus delbrukei subsp. Bulgaricus, we have seen that leucodopachrome is produced by the bacteria. Moreover two enzymes: cyclo-DOPA 5-O-glucosyltransferase and betanidin 6-O-glucosyltransferase can produce betanine from leucodopachrome. The strategy of the team was to insert a plasmid with one of these two enzymes in Lactobacillus, to make it produce betanine.

Raspberry ketone
Raspberry ketone is the second compound we would like to make bacteria produce. It is the most expensive natural dye in the food industry. The advantage here is to have a cheaper dye, less difficult to extract and produce directly in the yoghourt.
(Source: iGEM project of Munich 2012)
From the first product who is the 4-coumaroyl-CoA, two enzymes are necessary to obtain the Raspberry ketone. The first one is the p-hydroxyphenylbut-3-ene-2-one synthase from Rubus idaeus or Rheum palmatum. The second one is p-hydroxyphenylbut-3-ene-2-one reductase. After getting the genes coding for these enzymes, two plasmids are created and inserted in Lactobacillus in order to get this new pathway.

In bio analysis, photon emission chemistries including fluorescence and bioluminescence are popular due to their inherently high sensitivity and simplicity. [22] Fluorescence relies on photons as the energy source whereas in bioluminescence, the photon emission is based on natural biochemistry.
Fluorescence is brighter due to the high rates of photon excitation. However, this high influx of photon raises the background levels. The number of photons introduced is much more important than the number produced by the reporter gene and photodetectors could not be able to discriminate between excitation and emission photons. Others fluorophores can be present within the samples. [22] As no photons are introduced into the sample, background levels in bioluminescence assay are much lower. [22][21]
As a results, bioluminescent chemistries present 10- to 1,000-fold higher sensitivity than fluorescence assays [23] Bioluminescence can be measured to zeptomole levels (few molecules per cell) and linearity extended over six to eight logs. [22]
Moreover, as bioluminescence naturally evolved within a biological context, it is more compatible with bioluminescence systems. [22]
To conclude, bioluminescence is greatly used in assay methodologies and these assays are known for their quantitative precision, low inherent backgrounds, and low sample interference. [22] For all these reasons, we decided to base our biosensor on the use of bioluminescence as the reporter gene.
Potential Applications
The different parameters that must to be taken in account when speaking of atmospheric pollutants (local and regional pollutant emissions, meteorological conditions, transport as well as pollutant transformation) can be modeled. That’s why a 3D model of pollutant concentration can be a valuable tool for air quality monitoring.
A biological system embedded in a drone would enable more precise pollution mapping, and thus a monitoring of pollution in the atmosphere.
The applications of this new monitoring tool are numerous, including defining polluted areas, identifying pollutant emitting industries, monitoring pollutant concentration throughout the year, or localizing a chemical leakage along a pipeline. The ever-increasing number of laws concerning pollutant concentration in urban areas is also a good occasion for us to develop a product able to efficiently map the air quality around a public building, such as a school.
A precise and local detection of pollutants will trigger effective action to be taken as well as local environmental damage to be determined. Data obtained using Quantifly can serve as a basis for defining a new framework for future industrial and"

Mathematical Modeling
Having a kinematic model that mimics the behavior of the ceiling tile manufacturing plant's process water is a valuable design and analysis tool to investigate potential solution strategies such as the proposed synthetic biology solution of engineered yeast. As a first step towards this goal of a simulated design and testing environment, basic mathematical models are developed here to characterize both the kinetics of yeast cell growth and the enzymatic reaction of starch degradation by alpha-amylase. Such a kinetic model for microbial growth and product formation must account for the different phases of growth, most importantly an exponential growth phase during cell seeding,a stationary phase relating to steady-state operation, and a death or cell decline phase associated with conditions of nutrient deficiency or toxic products.
Model Formulation
Several models can be found in the literature [1-4] to describe cell growth, substrate utilization, and product formation. The most widely used models are simpler unstructured models that incorporate the Monod equation to represent the logistic growth characteristics typical of microbials. This model is mathematically derived for cell growth with the following differential equations.
Cell Growth
The rate of cell growth is dependent on cell concentration \(X\). Expressed as
\[ \dfrac{dX}{dt} = \mu_g X \]
the specific growth rate \(\mu_g\), having units of hr -1, is defined as
\[\mu_g = \dfrac{1}{X} \dfrac{dX}{dt}\]
If the rate of cell loss from cell death and endogenous metabolism is \(K_d\), the cell death rate \(R_d\) and the net cell growth can be written as
\[R_d = K_d X\]
\[\dfrac{dX}{dt} = \mu_g X - K_d X\]
Rearranging terms, the net specific growth \(\mu\) is
\[\mu = \mu_g - K_d = \dfrac{1}{X} \dfrac{dX}{dt}\]
Taking integrals on both sides
\[ \int_0^t \mu \,dt = \int\dfrac{1}{"

Safety
When working in any laboratory, even if it is only your school`s chemistry lab, safety should  undoubtedly be your main concern.  Work safety includes everything from proper  equipment such as protective gloves, glasses, lab coat etc., to adequate preparations and  proper disposal of chemicals and organisms.
Our experience with lab safety
Prior to this project we had already worked in a laboratory, either at school, in a research  facility or in some other way. This way we had acquired a lot of experience in this field and  were fully aware the importance of lab safety. It is a responsibility you have towards yourself  and others working with you.
That is why before even stepping into a laboratory we had a mandatory work and laboratory  safety lecture at the National Institute of Chemistry. We revised and upgraded our previous  knowledge on this topic and after passing the exam we were fully prepared and educated on  the topic of safe laboratory work. Prof. dr. Marko Dolinar, a member of the Slovene Scientific  committee for work with GMOs in contained use, gave us a lecture on genetically modified  organism and concerns regarding their use and safety. Additionally, we also watched two  educational videos, which were provided to us by iGEM and gave us further information on  how to work with living microorganism and how to handle GMOs.
Chemicals
We mostly dealt with chemicals which are in general safe, for example agarose and peptone,  but in case of chemicals such as butyric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and  ethidium bromide, special caution was required. When handling with ethidium bromide,  which is considered mutagen, carcinogen and teratogen, we were especially careful. We  consistently used the stronger (purple) nitrile gloves and were cautious not to touch  unnecessary objects when using them to prevent contamination of surfaces and equipment  with ethidium bromide and maintain the required level of safety. In any case, ethidium  bromide can only be used in the so-called 'electrophoresis lab'. No equipement or  consumables used for work with ethidium brom"
