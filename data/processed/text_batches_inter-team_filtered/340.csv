InterLab
Our team chose to participate in the Fifth International InterLab Measurement Study in synthetic biology.
The goal of the iGEM InterLab Study is to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements, so that eventually, measurements that are taken in different labs will be no more variable than measurements taken within the same lab.
In this study we want to reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing it to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD.
The fluorescence in the bacteria in our experiments occurs due to the presence of a gene that encodes a green fluorescent protein: GFP.
In cell and molecular biology, the GFP gene is frequently used as an expression reporter protein. Reporter genes are often used as an indication that a certain gene has been internalized or expressed in cells or organisms.
Equipment
All our measurements were taken in a plate reader that can read both absorbance and fluorescence (Neoteck-Tecan-INFINITE M100) without a pathlength correction. The temperature was set to 25̊C, under shaking with a duration of 3 sec and an amplitude of 2 mm. We went through a tutorial and learned how to operate the machine.
In addition, we used the following reagents (Partially supplied by iGEM):
1.0 ml LUDOX CL-X.
150 μL Silica Bead (microsphere suspension).
Fluorescein (powder, in amber tube)
iGEM Parts Distribution Kit Plates.
1 x PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 - 7.6.
ddH2O
Competent cells (Escherichia coli DH5α).
LB (Luria Bertani) media.
Chloramphenicol
96 well plates, black with clear flat bottom.
Safety procedures
As part of an ongoing work in a biological laboratory, safety gear was used to work with bacteria. The work was done with closed shoes, long pants, gloves and lab coats.
In order to maintain a clean environment, and sterility between the samples the work was performed next to a flame, and all the disposable parts were thrown after a single use into a biological waste bin.

ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," ways to get Annexin V exposed on the surfcae of our E. coli.
Detection of apoptotic cells by our engineered bacteria using autodisplay
Overview
As we could not prove the externalization of Annexin V by INP, we changed the strategy to use an Autodisplay system. Autodisplay consists in a beta-barrel that folds on the cell membrane putting outside of the cell the construct of interest.
Results
Results with Autodisplay were more promising than with INP. The bacteria that contained the Autodisplay system bound to the cells when compared with bacteria containing only RFP. Binding did not seem to be specific to cancer cells. However, we consider that due to the manipulation of the sample (incubation of the cells without a CO2 pressure and at room temperature) could trigger apoptosis in the samples treated and not treated with TRAIL. More experiments will be needed to see if specific bnding to cancer cells can be finally achieved.

WITH FJNU-China
This year, we have also established a long-term cooperation with FJNU-China. Their project is to produce a rose-scented bacteriostat. We think their project is very interesting, so we helped them to test the smell of the antibacterial agent. And did some promotion.In return, they investigated the opinions of teachers and students of fujian normal university on our product hyaluronic acid micro-needle patch.
Reference can be seen in the site of collaboration site of FJNU-China .
Project Feedback
This year we attended the 1st Eurasian Meet-up and the 5th CCiC Meet-up in China. We were very grateful to teams TU Delft and Shanghai_tech for their constructive advice, especially in poster design and presentation improvement (See Judging Feedback below). Thanks for their help.
Mentorship
Last year, we had the first ever iGEM team from our school, and managed to complete the project successfully with the help of Dr. Chen Weizhan, who is the PI of SZU-iGEM and acted as a mentor to our team. Our team member Miyo, who participates in both last year and this year’s competitions, became an official mentor to iGEM teams via the Mentorship program (See below). As a fourth year student from information technology, Miyo shared his extensive experience in wiki construction, helped other teams solving problems and making their Wiki pages better. Since July this year, Miyo has helped a number of teams and individuals with Wiki issues, i.e. Jiangnan_China and DLUT_China_B.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html,"100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

In this figure, an unexprected peak present in the leaf infiltrated with TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos (black) can be observed. Comparing its spectrum with the one provided from the database seems to be (z)-11-hexadecenal, a desired pheromone,  which is being produced by the plant itself using an endogenous alcohol oxidase. Nevertheless as it is produced with a low yield, the FAO1 of C. tropicalis search is still in progress.
The rest of the samples were prepared for the GC-MS analysis.
The samples were weighted, introduced in the vial and added with EDTA and CaCl2.
94,0 mg of P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf (replica 2)
102,4 mg of TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf (replica 1)
92,0 mg of TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf(replica 2)
Results of the replicae analysis are shown below:
In this replica, the sample with the TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos construction shows a huge production of (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol.
In this replica, the sample with the TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos shows a higher abundance of (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and z-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate.
In order to verify that the analysed compounds are the desired pheromones, we acquired standards for (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate and (z)-11-hexadecenal, and indeed, the analysed compunds were the right ones.
08/14/2014
We had problems to amplify the FAO1 gene, so in order to obtain it we performed a colony PCR. Using this method, it is possible to amplify a fragment directly from a colony rather than a DNA sample.
We made two different PCRs, one of them as a positive control and the other one to amplify our disered DNA fragment"

We performed reversion assays to investigate our mutagenic constructs. In the first step , we confirmed that we obtain functional     revertants by sanger sequencing. Afterwards we quantified mutation rate of our Error Prone Polymerase I and our Genome Wide Mutator . At last we try to integrate the mutation feature into our complete system by assessing the mutation while continuous cultivation.
Introduction
To quantify mutagenesis rate exactly is a very tedious task, because a multitude of factors affect the mutation rate. The most important are:
the experimental setup
the exact used method
Classical approaches to measure mutation rate are distinguished in reversion or forward assays, respectively. The mutation reverts a stop     from a reporter (reversion assay) or mutates a protein in such a way that it gains a function e.g. the organism becomes resistant to     antibiotics (mostly rifampicin forward assay). Since the rise of high-throughput sequencing, this technique starts to replace reversion     assays as prime method for assessing the mutation rate due to higher sensitivity, resolution and additional information.
As the error prone polymerase I is mostly specific for ColE1 plasmids we used a"
SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour54_-_-_TEXT.html," biological triplets and technical triplicates was made for each promoter. Each construct has been sequenced and verified with colony PCR. For the complete protocol click here .
Each construct were sequenced; two of the constructs were correctly assembled, the third had the correct promoter, but the remaining did not match gfp.
For the measurements conducted in this project we used a FACSAriaII. The used method of the FACS were flow cytometry which functions through singling out droplets containing one cell each. By exciting the proteins with light on the absorption frequency of the protein the cells will be fluorescent and emission intensity can be measured.
We used E. coli Top10 without inserted plasmids as our negative control and one of our own biobricks; pSB1C3-T18-LinkerGFP for the positive control. Top10 was used to calibrate the FACS and the arbitrary units (a.u.) was measured by gating. Arbitrary units are relative to the measurements, it describes how strong one reading is compared to a defined reference. Reference:Kate B. Bechtol, David K. Hanzel, and Bee Choo Liang, Amersham Biosciences, Inc. - Understanding Fluorescence. [GelifeSciences]
The three promoters are part of a promoter family originally from a combinatorial library made by John Anderson in 2006. WT J23119 was made from synthetic oligonucleotides using overlap extension, and is the strongest of all the promoters in the familyREFERENCE WORD. Reference:iGEM Parts Registry - BBa_J23119:Design.

J23106 and J23117, like J23101, are derivatives of J23119, and are also constitutive promoters and modified in the same manner. J23106 have three mutations one in the -10 region and two in the -35 region, 8- and -9 plus -33 and -32, respectively. J23117 have two mutations in its -10 region, at position -8 and -12.

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz"

We need to decide whether we want the enzymes to degrade or synthesis and focus on one application to start with.
Possible enzymes/applications: nitrilases, university waste water/water works/ environmental, contaminated soils, TNT degrading, rubber degrading, Vitamin     production from intermediates (can be easily proven if it works), bacterial indigo synthesis/other colours
The easiest is to take a lipase, esterase and/or phosphatase and see if it can degrade different substrates.
Ela emphasized that the labbooks need to be written with particular care in order to keep the overview and find small mistakes.

TRPC5 shares several common features with other members of the TRP superfamily of ion channels, such as membrane topology and high selectivity to cations over anions. [6] [7] The channel core consists of six helical transmembrane (TM1–6) segments linked by extracellular and intracellular segments of variable length and flanked by the cytoplasmic N (Nt, 330 aa)- and C (Ct, 351 aa)-termini(Figure 4). A putative pore region including pore helix between TM5 and TM6 lines the channel pore when a functional channel is formed by assembling four subunits. [8]
Figure 4. Main structure of TRPC5 channel
There are several general mechanisms for mechanical activation of an ion channel. These include 1) direct channel activation by altering bilayer tension/bending/thickness, 2) indirect channel activation via mechanosensitive signaling molecules, and 3) direct channel activation by tethering to cytoskeletal elements that are exposed to mechanical forces. [9] [10] Based on previous study exploring TRP channels gating mechanism, we know that multiple ankyrin repeats in the channel can form a helical structure, which may act as a gating spring. [11] Thus we chose ankyrin repeats as directed mutation region,
Fluorescent component R-GECO (Calcium Indicator)
R-GECO consists of a circularly permuted mApple red FP, which is flanked on one side by the calcium-binding protein calmodulin and on the other side by the calmodulin-binding peptide M13. In the presence of calcium, calmodulin-M13 interactions elicit conformational changes in the fluorophore environment that leads to an increase in the emitted fluorescence. (Fig. 5). [12] They are useful in neuronal activity study and cell imaging for calcium indicator. We could use following methods to induce calcium influx to quantitatively examine the function of R-GECO.
Depolarization
Potassium ion is involved to make a depolarization and lead to the increases in cytosolic free calcium. [13]
Ionomycin
Ionomycin is an ionophore produced by the bacterium Streptomyces conglobatus. It is used in research to raise the intracellular level of calcium (Ca2+) by stimulating store-regulated cation entry. [14]

Overview
This article presents information compiled from different online sources such as universities’ websites, newspaper, articles, and organizations’ websites. The information was searched both in English and Bahasa Indonesia. Information in Bahasa Indonesia was translated into English by Indonesian teammates. The general trend that we have notice from research is that information about synthetic biology in Indonesia is very limited. This might be due to the fact that not many people in Indonesia know about this field. Information of biotechnology, however, was more abundant. Many companies and universities are participating in biotechnology development. Most of the research related to biotechnology focus on agriculture. In the future, following this trend in biotechnology, synthetic biology may also be used to improve agriculture in Indonesia.
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Out of 3100 universities in Indonesia, only three universities in Indonesia joined the iGEM competition. This reflects that very few people know about the iGEM competition and synthetic biology. The first Indonesian university that joined the iGEM competition is Bogor Agricultural University (BAU). This university joined the iGEM 2012 competition, but did not manage to get any awards. Two universities from Indonesia, Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) and University of Indonesia (UI), have registered for the iGEM 2013 competition
Funding of Biotechnology
In 2012, Indonesian Institute of Science (LIPI) received around US$ 14 million from the Indonesian government (""Dana 2012,"" 2013). This amount of money is only around 0.1% from national income. This year, in 2013, the government proposed that they would decrease the funding to LIPI by 9% from the total amount of 2012 funding (“Riset bioteknologi: Ter"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Altering the composition of our sensor system components, to maximize color reaction.
We discovered that about one third of color intensity is lost on membranes in comparison to fluid environments. Reactions on membranes thus require to double the amount of sensor molecule added to the reaction
Stabilizing the cell-free system for storage by lyophilisation
We succeeded in freeze-drying the cell-free expression system onto cellulose membrane and were furthermore able to trigger an active color change after resuspension.
Optimizing the Screening Pipeline
Goal:Establishing the PureExpress® cell free protein expression kits (PureExpress®, NEB) as our main tool for RNA detection and assess its capabilities.
DescriptionThe PureExpress®-System is composition of completely recombinant molecules to effectively transcribe any form of DNA into mRNA and then translate this into a protein. To use this system for field diagnostics, it has to meet the following requirements:
Heat stability up to a temperature of 50°C
High efficiency even with low volumes of reagents and/or low concentrations
Stability towards changes in electrolyte concentration/ addition of foreign molecules
Long-term storability.
We verified this by evaluating the kinetics of sensor reactions in different experimental conditions, including different temperatures, different reactant concentrations, changes in buffer as well as re-measurements after storage.
We could show that the system meets all these requirements. Especially noteworthy, we were able to create significant color change in a volume of 2,5 uL which is only 10% of the volume recommended by the manufacturer. Furthermore, we could show that the system is still highly active in concentrations of 40-50%. This makes it possible to use the system with patient samples of only estimated concentration without risking reduced functionality. Last but not least, the system is not vulnerable to possibly interfering molecules, as for example the chlor-phenol-red used  as a reporter dye.
We concluded that the PureExpress® - System is most suitable for our essay; also due to the fact, that it composed of recombinant parts instead of cell lysate and so has very few variability
Other Experiments
Preparation of nucleic acids
For our experiments, a large set of different DNAs and RNAs - primers, templates, targets and controls – are required in varied concetrations. Thus, a set of standardized but easily adaptable protocols to extract and purify nucleic acids was established.

TU Braunschweig & Dr. Hust
Once our project was designed, we sought advice from specialists in the field. We reached out to Dr. Hust von Technische Universität Braunschweig (Department of Biotechnology). Dr. Hust specializes in building antibody gene libraries and purifying antibody scFvs in E.coli. Through a skype conference, he reviewed our project, advised us on our experimental design, and helped us build a story around antibody scFv secretion in E.coli. After this discussion, we focused our project on Salmonella detection and Dr. Hust sent us antibody scFvs targeting Salmonella proteins. These scFv were produced by Dr. Hust through antibody phage display. We wish to thank our collaborator for receiving us with attention and for such strong contribution to our work
Conference at Carnegie Mellon University
On September 6, our team travelled to Pittsburgh to participate in a conference at Carnegie Mellon University, along with other iGEM teams from the University of Pittsburgh, Montgomery High School, and Pennsylvania State University. During this conference, all teams presented their projects and then gave and received feedback about the content and delivery of these presentations. We also participated in a wiki and presentation workshop in which we received advice from other advisers. Finally, there was a panel with past iGEM participants and current advisers, which gave us the opportunity to ask questions about what new participants could expect from the competition in November. Ultimately, this conference gave our team the opportunity to interact with other iGEM members and forge relationships with other teams, which helped us start a collaboration with the Montgomery High School team. This conference also allowed us to practice our presentation and identify how we could improve before heading off to Boston.

Bob: Well I did have a scientist who got really complicated, and I said, could we try that again, could you express it in lay terms? And he said, I don’t know how to explain it in lay terms. And that interview never ended up on the air, we threw it away. We didn’t do it. We have 2 criteria. A good story, and a good storyteller. And before an interview gets to air, my producer who does all the research and all the hard work finds the story and we go find the scientist. We always go for the first author on the paper, the top name. And they call them up on the phone to first, learn about the story, and also to listen, how well they speak. And very often they can’t get it out, and you can tell from the phone that it won’t be a good interview, and almost half of the stories that we produce, that we chase do not make it to air, because people do not communicate well. And so, it’s good storytelling. And on the other side, we have people who have, their story isn’t really that big, it’s not really that exciting, but they are such good talkers, they are so enthusiastic that we put them on the air because it’s just good to listen to. There might be some little study about the sex life of some insects. We are like ok, this insect is somewhere off in Bonial, but their reproductive element is really really interesting and they tell the story really well, so yeah, we put them on the air. Angela: Do you think there is any difference promoting science over the radio as opposed to using the social media, the internet? Do you think there’s a difference a more traditional means than using the popular platforms? Bob: Right, so I can speak from my program. Ok, to start a program, we are communicating science. One thing that we do is that, we let the science speak for itself. That’s what we report on. Here’s what happened this week in science, here are some important issue in science, and here are the scientists who did the actual work we are speaking. We don’t talk to people with opinions. And in social media there are a lot of people with opinions. Here is what I think about this, well, who are you? Why should I care about your opinion? And there are a lot of people who are saying a lot but they don’t have any credibility, or people saying, oh I don’t believe this, so whatever, whether"

4. The transformation of bacteria with the biobrick plasmid was redone on four plates because of the lack of growth on the plates (see 16.07.18).
Results:
There were more colonies on the four new plates, and they were light red as well (About 20 colonies). The new negative control plates had colonies as well.

RFP biobrick fluorescens measurement (test)
Goal:
1. To get a descriptive curve for the rise in fluorescens (transformed DH5α)
2. Find out how often the measurements need to be done.
Procedure:
The second batch of plates from transformation and the negative control:
1. Colonypicking and exchange to liquid medium
Measurements of the first batch (Tecan):
1. Measured the OD of the blank (LB and CM), and measured the OD of the two cultures.
2. For the next measurements we diluted the cultures by 1:100 in separate tubes.
3. Incubation of the tubes
4. The first measurement was done in the Tecan, and repeated for every 30 minutes and then 1 hour (because of minor changes in values)
5. The measurements was set overnight as well using the following script: FluorescenceLong. The data was set to 588 nm absorbance, 584 nm excitation, 607 nm emission, 37°C, 40 gain, 150 kinetic cycles, 300s shaking (orbital 3 mm amplitude).
Results:
The second batch from transformation has turned red. From the measurements of the test batch we have an idea of the increase in fluorescence intensity and the change in absorbance over time. This can be used to determine the timing of the second batch with the negative control as well.

After repeated freezing and thawing for 4 times, the cell membrane of the cell became thin and rough, and some intracellular substances overflowed. In comparison, the cell structure of the recombinant strain remains more intact, and the damage of the cell membrane is alleviated, thereby effectively reducing the damage caused by freezing stress on the cells.

Transforming with B. subtilis spores
Now that we had stored spores with xylose added in the first inoculation step and xylose added with the SG media (different time points during the sporulation protocol), we were ready to activate and transform them mimicking device conditions. We pelleted the spores and put them in a vacufuge to ensure they were dry since the spores in the device will be in the dried form. For the final device, we were planning on activating spores with water so we added water to the experimental spores after they were out of the vacufuge. Then we added 500 ng of linear thrC DNA (since 200 ng was insufficient) and left the tubes out at room temperature for a day and then spread them on spectinomycin plates. Colonies grew for both conditions (xylose added to bacteria in initial inoculation, xylose added to SG media"

However, we wanted to participate in this year’s InterLab                                     study, which should use LUDOX as materials. Thus, we sought help in the Wechat group                                     of “iSWU”; thankfully, team “SiCAU-China” provided us with LUDOX in their                                     measurement kit immediately, which is vital for us to finish our InterLab study.
      We really enjoyed ourselves communicating with so many other iGEMers and developed a                                     lot of new ideas about our project. The iSWU provide a communication platform and                                     collaboration opportunities for iGEMers in Southwest union,which is good for                                     improving the iGEM project and giving a new sight. At the same time, the union is                                     propitious to the development of iGEM in southwest China.We are looking forward to                                     the coming of more new friends.
02.  2017 Conference of China                                     iGEMer Community (CCiC)
      To communicate with other iGEM teams and get                                         more reliable resources, we attended 2017 Conference of China iGEMer Community                                         (CCiC) hosted by team “FAFU-China” in Fuzhou. During the meeting, we got much                                         help from others and solved some problems we had met.
Fig.1
      CCiC is a large conference for Chinese                                         iGEMers which is aimed at dealing with the conflict between the longing for                                         doing something great in synthetic biology and the lack of                                         technology research resources. Each year, many iGEM teams from different                                         provinces of China will get together in CCiC to communicate with each other and                                         get more basic knowledge, innovative ideas, useful experiences, leading– edge                                         technology, scientific supports, bacterial species and other available                                         resources.

      2017 CCiC contained keynote speaks, project                                         introductions, panel sessions, poster sessions, special talks, Hq face to face                                         and salons. Some young scientists gave us keynote speaks about synthetic                                         biology, which broadened our horizon and let us know more about advanced                                         biological technology. Each iGEM team was asked to provide a speech introducing                                         their projects. And after the speeches there would be a panel session, where                                         audiences could ask questions about the projects which they were interested in.                                         From these communications, we knew what others had focused on, what they had                                         done and what they could do to help us. On the other hand, we"

Collaboration with Arizona State University
Our team was having difficulty assembling the two transcriptional units (VCP and PCP) into a multigene assembly. We contacted the ASU iGEM team to see if they could help with our problem. Stefan from the ASU iGEM team developed a cloning strategy to help our team assemble our multigene sensing plasmid within a few days of sharing the plasmid maps. This included designing primers for each of our transcriptional units in order to do digests and ligations using Type 1 enzymes (double digest + ligation). The ASU team also sent us an aliquot of their lab’s pET28 to use as the backbone for the multigene sensing assembly. ASU also helped troubleshoot minor problems that came up while trying to assemble and clone the sensing assembly, including suggesting a colony PCR, explaining protocols for assembling the multigene, and giving other advices/tips.  In return, our team helped out the ASU team by reading over their wiki and presentation.  As a result of this collaboration, our team was able to clone the sensing construct. We are very grateful to have received this tremendous help from ASU!

Collaboration with University of Washington
The University of Washington iGEM team gave us general advice concerning our project and proofread and gave us feedback on our wiki pages. The UoWashington team also helped us with our presentation; we held a skype session where we presented our presentation to them over skype and they critiqued it and gave us advice.  In return, our team helped them out with their survey on GMOs and bioethics.   Also, at the Giant Jamboree, the UoWashington team sat down with us to go through the presentation, and gave us many recommendations and feedbacks. We were able to make edits to make our presentation better--thanks to the UoWashington team!

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#hk_-_-_TEXT.html," (9%). The respondents’ overall impression about all the newly developed technologies and the focused biological technologies were both more likely to be positive, but close to neutral. This probably showed a general conservative attitude towards synthetic biology among the general public in Hong Kong (""Synthetic biology survey,"" 2011).
Reference: The target of this question was the respondent’s major concern or worry about synthetic biology.
This survey, however, might be biased. The team used the internet to conduct the survey, and therefore the respondents were only the people who use the internet regularly. Reference: The target of this question was the respondent’s major concern or worry about synthetic biology
Scientists
Based on the interview with Professor Albert Yu that our team has conducted, field of synthetic biology is not widely known even among scientist. Only scientists with deeper knowledge in related fields such as systems biology and genetics know about it. This may be due to the fact the synthetic biology is a relatively young field and require understanding and knowledge in multiple disciplines.

Biotechnology research and development capabilities in Hong Kong
Hong Kong has a large capability for biotechnology development. Its biomedical research is already internationally competitive. According to a study conducted by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park Corporation in 2004, the total number of basic medical publications per year was doubled to about 700 between 1997 and 2002. Around 250 biomedical study of high impact is conducted every year at present. Also, in recent years Hong Kong made great scientific contribution in genomic projects, and in identification of infectious diseases such as SARS and avian flu virus.
This kind of development in biotechnology was probably possible in Hong Kong because universities in Hong Kong are actively participating in biotechnology related research. With excellence in scientific innovation and research breakthroughs, Hong Kong’s universities are considered to be some of the best universities in Asia- Pacific region. In fact, out of 9 tertiary institutions, 6 of them are participating in biotechnology related research and have related undergraduate and graduate courses.
Biotechnology infrastructure
A bioinformatics centre and other buildings with shared equipment facilities are now operating in the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks. They are there to support the development of biotechnology in Hong Kong. These facilities can be utilized by biotechnology companies for research and development purpose. At present, there are around 50 biotechnology-related occupants in the Science Park and other industrial estates.

Freiburg,2013,Team:Freiburg#HumanPractice#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," This reminded us of the dual-use debates following a moratorium of several scientists who were working with so called superviruses in 2012. During this debate Global Health Security Policy Board additionaly to the NSABB was recommended by several scientists and scholars.
Hence, a debate about Do-it-yourself biology and so called biohackers was initiated. Thus, the defintions of biosafety and biosecurity were elaborated referring to Kelle:
""While biosafety measures aim to prevent the unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release, biosecurity measures focus on the prevention of theft, misuse, or intentional release of pathogens and toxins [4] .""
The participants of the seminar submitted that biohackers as amateur biologists wouldn't represent any prior hazard to biosecurity since the access to laboratory devices is still expensive and difficult and the know-how not assesable enough. Further, it was considered that biohackers would risk their own health while working in inappropriate locations as private appartments and with low-budget or self-made devices [compare to 5] . Thus, biohackers were categorized to biosafety affairs.  However, bioweapons, bioterrorism and other criminal organizations came in the focus of the talks.
iGEM was also mentioned several times during the whole seminar. It was described as a competition for young scientists where they can make their first experiences with the synthesis of systems and tools that shall facilitate the daily lab routine of synthetic biologists [compare to 6] . As our team participated on this seminar, we took the chance and presented our project in a poster session. Philosophers, theologists, bioethicists and scientists were interested in our presentation and asked completely different questions to our project. Interestingly, most of them knew CRISPR/Cas and other systems for gene regulation. Their questions were e.g.
if we were able to regulate endogenous genes ,
if we had implemented our uniCas-toolkit into a stable cell line or into a model organism as mus musculus,
if we had any idea to increase biosafety or biosecurity concerning our project?
Here, we could indicate on our safety forms and explain our thoughts about risks and chances of a standardized uniCAS toolkit.
The seminar has clarified that synthetic biology as a young science causes lots of discussion and connects great hopes but still some fear in regard to biohackers and bioweapons.  On one side the attitude of society to preserve the natural and on the other hand societal expectations to create something synthetic to protect the natural are forming a tension. This causes us to rethink. Thus, the mutual exchange expanded the"

Conclusions
Introducton
As we began to build the first prototype of CAT-Seq system, we have quickly realised, that the best way to measure system’s performance is to have a well working Substrate Nucleotide and a catalytic biomolecule pair that predictably catalyzes chemical conversion from a Substrate to a Product Nucleotide. Initially, having a predetermined system output allowed us to track CAT-Seq performance and its early issues instead of performance of substrates and catalytic biomolecules.
For this reason we have chosen a Substrate Nucleotide (N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate) and then screened a library of esterases using standard methods to find an esterase that would successfully convert the Substrate Nucleotide into Product Nucleotide (2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate).
After finding the efficient substrate and biomolecule pair, we wanted to see how CAT-Seq system discriminates between different activities of the catalytic biomolecules. For that reason wanted to mutate our already well-working Esterase to create its mutants, which would have slightly different activities then the original Esterase. Then, we would measure the mutants using standard low-throughput methods to determine their relative. Lastly, after using the mutant library in CAT-Seq, we would compare our high-throughput system results with the results of standard methods. In this way, we can assess the accuracy and precision of CAT-Seq system.
Yet, the addition of the mutations is not an easy task, as even a single amino acid change can inactivate the catalytic biomolecule completely. Therefore, we have decided to determine the mutants of the Esterase by in-silico computational modelling.

This meant that the iGEM team got the opportunity to explain their project to people from small to large in more detail. This was a great chance to bring the Synthetic Biology more closely to the general public. The project got positive response by the residents of Darmstadt and pushed and inspired even more the young scientists.

Blog #21 - iGEM Meetup Last Weekend -  a great success!
by Nina 09:27, 16 September 2014 (CDT)
Last weekend, six iGEM teams from all over Germany – namely Braunschweig, Darmstadt, Bielefeld, Tübingen, Freiburg and Munich – met with our team in Aachen.
Welcome teams!
All teams were welcomed by our three beautiful receptionists.
The weekend started with a welcome ceremony for all iGEM teams in the Couven hall on our RWTH campus. This a game of “Synthetic Biology Jeopardy”, developed and programmed by our team member Michael. The game was divided into three rounds: two preliminary rounds and one final. In the first round, Munich alias “Bier”, Tübingen alias “Most” and Bielefeld alias “Bielefeld” challenged each other in the categories Abbreviations, Amino Acids, Bad Science Movies, Part Categories and Sponsor Logos. With 2400 and 800 points teams Most and team Bier, respectively, advanced to the final round. Though the team Bielefeld came in last, they got another chance to proceed to the final round by substituting for Freiburg’s team which didn’t make it on time due to traffic problems.
First round
Teams battled each other in the five categories Abbreviations, Amino Acids, Bad Science Movies, Part Categories and Sponsor Logos.
Team Darmstadt alias “Darmstadt” lead the second round by finding most questions to the answers in the categories Deadlines, DNA, Molecular Masses, Picture Puzzles and Sounds of Science. However, in the second last question"

Description
Cyanobacteria represent one of the most ecophysiologically diverse phyla, inhabiting a range of environments and exhibiting an array of biogeochemical specific processes. Cyanobacteria are unique in that they are the only prokaryotes that are able to use sunlight as energy, water as an electron donor, and air as a carbon source. Furthermore, some strains are even capable of fixing nitrogen, making them extremely important for converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, which can be used by organisms. In addition, cyanobacteria also produce a number of tetrapyrrolic dye molecules such as heme, chlorophyll, and phycocyanobilin (PCB).
BODIPY is an organic dye that is a dipyrrin-containing derivative. This tetrapyrrolic dye and its derivatives are used in many applications;  either for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications or towards the design of fluorescent molecules as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the synthesis of these organic dyes can be time consuming and expensive. Molecules such as heme, chlorophyll, and PCB are very similar to dyes such as BODIPY. As such, the tetrapyrrolic dyes produced by cyanobacteria could be extremely useful for photovoltaic applications as these organisms use enzymes and molecules found in their environment rather than expensive catalysts. The ability to genetically direct the bacterial synthetic machinery would be significantly beneficial to carbon dioxide sequestration, nitrogen fixation, as well as the production of low-cost dyes. The biosynthesis of heme and its subsequent product PCB represent an attractive pathway to develop novel dyes. Therefore, by combining genomics, bioinformatics, as well as synthetic biology, the Ryerson team aims to genetically engineer cyanobacteria to efficiently produce novel dyes.
Thus far, the Ryerson iGEM team has been working on developing its project and finding the appropriate resources. By the end of the summer, iGEM Ryerson aims to have created novel biobricks that can be added to the registry while also obtaining the target molecule in our model organism."

First we determine the number of genes transcribed in our model. We start with 2 genes (pchBA operon and bsmt1). They are not on the same plasmid but both carry a pMB1 origin of replication. This ORI has a copy number of 100 to 300 plasmids per cell. Therefore we assume an average of 200 gene copies per cell.

Introductory Lab Session: 1st July 2009
Today's introductory lab session saw the team progress with the next steps in the making competent cells procedure (i.e. steps 2 and 3 in the 'Pre-culture section). The team also looked at the future steps involved in the protocol and prepared solutions and equipment accordingly. This lab session (as well as the previous one) taught the team the importance of planning, organisation and time management.
Things needed for today's session
Jess streaking some agar plates
Jane applying aseptic technique
Things we need for today include:
LB
Containers

Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," regarding the modelling of the Dronpa activation with Team Valencia. Team Valencia attempted to implement the systems equations of their biological circuit with ‘pure/vanilla’ matlab. Our own project however required probabilistic elements due to the discrete nature of the population encoded sensor information. From our discussion with Team Valencia, we concluded that SimBiology was not the optimal tool for our task however team Valencia might profit from it. We profited insofar as our understanding of certain modelling elements was improved as well as mutually reviewed our implementations.
This exchange of ideas particularly improved the mathematical formulations, because the peer review process provided a necessary sanity check, and we could train how we should present the theoretic part to people that are unfamiliar with our projects.
Team UCSF kindly provided us with their Cadherin-construct from 2011, sent us the plasmid as well as sequencing it. Unfortunately we did not get to include this into our project. Nevertheless they did us a great favor and it was fun to collaborate with them!"

Queens_Canada,2012,Team:Queens Canada#ChimeriQ_-_-_TEXT.html," without affecting the tertiary structure of the flagella. Thus, the search for feasible pathways was limited to reactions with steps that involved the use of a single enzyme and were sufficiently small. A potential parts in the biobrick registry that fit this criteria was XylE (catechol 2,3-dioxygenase). This enzyme converts catechol into 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde, which conveniently provides a bright yellow product.
We also researched various pathways outside of the BioBrick registry for useful pathways and eventually settled on the enzyme Haloalkane dehalogenase. This enzyme is found in several organisms and refers to an enzyme the dehalogenates haloalkanes into alcohol and halides. Given that haloalkanes such as 1,2-dibromoethane are quite dangerous (Rated a 3 in the health section on the NFPA 704 scale [1]), this enzyme provides a useful means of cleaving these toxic products into safer products. We contacted various professors around the world, and were able to obtain the linB and the Rv2579 gene, which both encode the protein, but in Sphingomonas paucimobilis UT26 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, respectively.
These enzymes were incorporated into E. coli in a similar manner to the fluorescent proteins. Using PCR overlap extension, we were able to create the plasmid for LinB, Rv2579, and XylE from an RFP plasmid template. The PCR overlap extension products were digested using DpnI and transformed into E. coli. The colonies were plated. As expected there were several colonies on each plate, and using the fluorescence of the E. coli we were able to isolate which colonies potentially contained the plasmid by picking the colonies without fluorescence.
The Cohesin-Dockerin System
An exciting extension of our project included incorporating the cohesion/dockerin complex into our flagella scaffold. Normally found in the cellulosome complex in the Clostridium bacteria, these proteins interact with each other through a scaffoldin protein consisting of cohesins connected to dockerins containing functional units such as the enzymes and carbohydrate binding modules. By incorporating the cohesin protein in place of the D3 domain, we could have flagella that would be able to bind any dockerins present. These dockerins would genetically modified to fuse with any enzymes or protein of interest. The result would be a very flexible flagella scaffolding system that could bind enzymes not natively expressed within its own flagellin sequence or genome. In"

Modify genes to ""jack up"" fatty acid production.
Synthesize biodiesel efficiently using the fatty acids produced by the fungus.
Integrate the fungus into a self-contained bio-reactor for industrial and home use.
The team anticipates the major challenge will be working with the genome of the fungus. The fungus' unusual genome makes it difficult to transform, and over 70 proteins are involved in growing on cellulose, making the insertion and extraction of genes a highly elaborate task.
Tour of Dr. Peter Facchini's Lab
There were several sections to Peter's lab, and we started off in the main research area, shown below. Here we learned about degradation pathways in plants and how Dr. Facchini was elucidating their genetic origins. We also got to see a mass-spectronomer and the grad student opened it up to explain exactly how it worked for us. Lastly, we went to the greenhouse where Dr. Facchini grows the poppies he uses in his research. This is the only place that is allowed to grow opium poppies legally in Canada and they are used exclusively for research. The tour guide showed our team how to harvest the opium poppies and explained how the process differs in different regions around the world. After this we regrouped with the other teams for the guest speakers.
The Guest Speakers
We had five guest speakers: Samantha Sutton, Michael Mader, Peter Facchini, Lori Sheremeta, and Anne-Marie Downey.  The first four guest speakers took preliminary questions as a panel, and then separately led a workshop for each team.  Michael and Lori talked about the legal, ethical, and political implications of our project, and Peter did the technical parts; Samantha gave us some guidance in becoming a stronger team, working well together, and communicating important details. Lastly, we spent an entire day in Ann's public speaking workshop, where we attempted to improve our public speaking skills.  Two members, Robert and Stephen, were recorded on video while presenting a summary of our project.

Team: Dan, Eloise, Hannah, Jack, Pablo
Our first day in the lab working on our project began by resuspending KillerRed part from the iGEM distribution kit in 10μl of MQ water and left for 5 mins.  The T5 promoter (BBa_K592008), Double terminator (BBa_B0015), RBS (BBa_B0034), non codon optimized KillerRed (BBa_K1184000),  Strong, Medium and Weak Constitutive Promoters (BBa_J23101,BBa_J23110,BBa_J23103) 1μl of resuspended DNA was then transformed.   We plated on the corresponding antibiotic and LB plates and left the plates overnight in the non-shaking 37℃ incubator.
14/07/16
Team: Alice, Dan, Eloise, Pablo
The transformation of resuspended parts from the previous day were not completely successful.  We did have growth of 1-2 colonies from the constitutive and T5 promoters,  as a result we decided to overnight these colonies but also re-transform the DNA to produce more colonies  for the remaining parts. We believe the transformation was unsuccessful due to the concentration of the resuspended  DNA being too low so we transformed a higher volume of 5μl.
15/07/16
Team: Dan, Eloise, Emily, Jack, Pablo
The transformations were successful with the higher volume of DNA,  consequently made overnights of these colonies at the end of the day.  We were able to Mini prep  the promoters from the first transformations which had been overnighted the day before.  The strength of the promoter produced a significant colour difference between each overnight culture;   the strong promoter was red, medium was orange and the weak promoter formed a yellow culture.  Today we blunted our KillerOrange G-block into pJet using an empty backbone as our control.   Resuspension: 20μl elution buffer to give 50mg/μl (pJet). Working with 3:1 ratio, use 3μl of insert to 1μl of backbone  Composition of KillerOrange solutions detailed in table below.
Solution A ("
BostonU,2015,Team:BostonU#App 2#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," is that the Zhang group used the 3D structure of the saCas9 protein to target flexible linker regions that would serve as potential split sites. Out of the three split sites that they chose, the one that worked best was almost identical (one amino acid away) to one of the split sites that we identified using our model. Furthermore, another split sites that they chose happened to be fairly close to one that we chose. Finally, the third split that they created was intended to be a negative control - we did not pick any split sites near this split, and it happened to be located in a region with secondary structural elements.
This important result gave us some experimental validation that our model could offer scientists insights into choosing promising viable split sites for proteins, without only relying on 3D structures of proteins. We also predict that our two split saCas9 constructs chosen near the Zhang lab sites would likely be viable, though we would need to experimentally confirm this.

Riboregulator Future Work
Catalog Page
Since the number of regulatory RNAs in part registry have been increasing over the years and they have not been well curated, our team wishes to solve this problem by creating a list of category tags and guidelines so that one can search these parts efficiently. Therefore, we will be continuing our work in testing and characterizing the regulatory RNAs for the ease of the synthetic biology community's use in the future.
Please visit our prototype of the catalog page and stay tuned with our updates.
Re-characterization of Riboregulator under different genetic context
The characterization result of riboregulators were out of our expectation - the taRNAs were unable to efficiently unlock their cognate crRNAs. We now realized that our genetic context used was different from how riboregulators were characterized initially. Expression of TAs were supposed to be driven from high copy plasmids while CRs were supposed to be driven from low copy vectors. Thus, we will progressively change the conditions used to characterize the constructs into a new genetic context. We hope that we can replicate others' results soon.
Characterization of Arabinose inducible pBad/araC promoter ( BBa_I0500 ) in high copy plasmid
We observed a transfer function with an all-or-none response in the pBad/araC promoter on a low copy plasmid during measurement, which matched the experimental result from that of iGEM 2011 Cambridge team, who also used the same genetic context. We are now speculating that the discrepancy between results from iGEM 2011 Cambridge and Groningen was a result due to different copy number plasmids used in carrying the promoter. However, due to lack of sufficient time and manpower, we were unable to test that out in time. Our future work will involve resumption of this characterization, and hopefully, we can"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," mission. Another important aspect was to get to know the people we were going to work together with for nearly one year. After a few weeks of paper-reading, internet research and browsing through books, the date and destination of our final decision weekend was set and everybody was excited to finally determine our topic. With a lot of input from previous discussions and meetings, we arrived in Aachen with two really well prepared and quite different projects on which we decided shortly after arrival. This is how the peroxisome turned out to be our fellow team member and test subject for the rest of the year.
The youth hostel in Aachen offered the opportunity to work in a conference room, and so everybody worked on the goal with growing enthusiasm to fully build our project. We discussed possibilities on how to share potential sub projects between Cologne and Duesseldorf since we wouldn’t work together in the same lab. Our instructors gave presentations on basic methods in the lab as well as on several iGEM standards we would use during our work. In the evening we visited Aachen’s inner city, a pub and had a night walk in the forest.
All in all the weekend was a definite success: we set our project topic, the motivation was pushed to the limit and we were ready to get started with the practical work united as a team.
Meeting other teams
European Meetup in Delft
On the 7th of July we were luckily invited to join the European iGEM meetup in Delft. Of course we did not want to miss the chance to listen to interesting talks by the european iGEM teams and speakers from many different research areas! So we took our pens and college blocks and drove to Rotterdam on thursday evening, in order to be fit for the first official day of the meetup.
In the morning we drove to Delft. As soon as we arrived we got in touch with several other iGEM teams like Graz , Bielefeld and Munich and talked about our projects and possible collaborations.
As the doors opened we were really excited to listen to the first presentation by Prof. Dr. Cees Dekker from the TU Delft, who gave a talk about developing a synthetic cell with molecular components using biophysical approaches. The second speaker, Prof. Dr. Denis J Murphy from the University of South Wales, informed us about using bioinformatic approaches for big Data analysis. Furthermore, he pointed out the importance of computational biology in order to gain biological knowledge that can be used to improve efficiency of agriculture.

Hello, my name is Haroon Ahmed and I currently attend Chinook High School. This is my first year of iGEM. I joined to learn more about the fascinating field of synthetic biology and how it can be used to solve many important real-world problems. Out of all aspects of iGEM, I most enjoy human practices and public outreach. I also enjoy playing sports, and when my high school education is over, I plan to eventually move into the field of medicine to become a physician.
Stefanie Dang
Hello, my name is Stefanie Dang and I’m currently a grade 12 student at Winston Churchill High School. I joined iGEM because it is an excellent opportunity to meet new people and experience how synthetic biology can be applied to everyday situations. Although there are multiple intriguing areas, I gravitate towards coding, graphics, and design. In the future after high school, although it is unclear, I hope to pursue a career in anthropology, graphic design, or creative writing. I have mastered the art of making puns so well, I die a little crying at my own jokes each time.
Chaeli Cowan
Hello! My name is Chaeli Cowan, I am a grade 12 student at Chinook Highschool. I am 17 years old and this is my first year in iGEM. I joined iGEM because I am interested in the sciences and wanted to gain more knowledge as to what a science program might entail. In my spare time I work as a lifeguard, I enjoy playing rugby and love to travel!
Allison Leam
Hello! My name is Allison Leam and I am currently finishing up my final year of high school at Lethbridge Collegiate Institute through the french immersion program. I was excited to join iGEM for the first time this year as I’ve always had a passion for science and joining the team would give me the opportunities to explore it in ways different from your common classroom methods. Though I believe it important to explore all aspects of the project, I enjoy getting down and dirty (in safe ways) working in the lab and also simply working alongside all the lovely people on the team. After high school, I hope to pursue post-secondary studies in the science field.

Enzymes
Three different glycosidases were used during our project. All three enzymes target galactose and its derivatives like N-acetylgalactosamine in oligosaccharides and are therefore suitable for modification of the ABO-antigens on the surface of erythrocytes. The described enzymes are capable of cleaving off selectively the characteristic structures of the A and B antigen, thereby generating the H antigen and structures similar to this oligosaccharide, which is characteristic for blood type O.
The α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (NAGA) from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is an enzyme which is capable of cleaving off the N-acetylgalactosamine residue of the A antigen. This enzyme consists of 448 amino acids and weights about 50.5 kDa. The structure is determined and can be found in the RCSB Protein Data Base .
Figure 1: α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (2IXA) from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica
The NAGA uses an unusual mechanism to achieve its reaction. A catalytic NAD+ accepts a hydride ion from C3 of the N-acetylgalactosamine which leads to formation of an carbonyl group at this position. The carbonyl group at C3 enables the abstraction of a proton at C2 by stabilizing the temporary negative charge. The negative charge leads to the possibility to release the residual carbohydrates as an alcoholate and replacing them with an hydroxide ion. The catalytic cycle is finished by the regeneration of the NAD+ through reduction of"
BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Components_-_-_TEXT.html," the fabrication of these devices ranges from one to two hours for milling, depending on the complexity of the design, and another hour for assembly.
Since these microfluidic devices are made from polycarbonate and PDMS, both of which are affordable and widely available, and require only a desktop CNC mill to fabricate, scientists are able to rapidly prototype low-cost microfluidic chips without sinking time and money into conventional manufacturing methods.
TERRA Adapter
The TERRA Adapter serves to increase the number of and types of microfluidic chips that are compatible with our system. This makes the system more user-friendly, as scientists then don’t need to design a chip that both suits the experiment and is capable of selecting for the proper output to be dispensed.
The TERRA Adapter is a scalable, predesigned chip capable of selectively dispensing the output of the microfluidic chip into the intended lab vessel. For droplet based experiments, for every output, the TERRA Adapter has two valves and a set of four pressure regulator. For continuous flow experiments, there are two valves for every output and an extra output that serves as a flush mechanism for cleaning the nozzle between outputs.
Click here to learn more about the TERRA Adapter:
TERRA Adapter
To ensure TERRA is low-cost and accessible to synthetic biologists, we have designed a hardware system consisting primarily of 3D-printed parts and inexpensive components. All of the CAD and STL files are available to the public through GitHub.
XY-Translational Stage
In order to dispense the output of microfluidic chips into specific locations, we decided to incorporate a low-cost, DIY XY-translational stage. The XY-stage enables translational motion along the X and Y axes, allowing the system to move a vessel, such as a 96-well plate, to a predetermined location.
The XY-stage consists of 3D-printed supports, stepper motors, timing belts, pulleys, bearings, and stainless steel rods. The stepper motors are connected to a timing belt and pulley system, which converts the rotational motion of the motor shaft to translational motion of the timing belt. The timing belts are then attached to supports that travel linearly along steel rods using ball bearings.  This enables the main support for a 96-well plate to move in both the X- and Y-direction.

In order to bring the progress of our project to the public, we created a Twitter account for KIT-Kyoto team. This allows us to connect with other iGEM teams around the world. The knowledge about other teams' projects, their progress and their passion is the greatest motivator for us. It also helps us improve the quality of our projects. This gives opportunities to those who didn't know about iGEM or who is not biology major to be interested in iGEM and in synthetic biology in general.
Media Coverage
September 3, 2014
KTV, a major TV station in Japan, visited BioArt Club at KIT to cover the club's activities. BioArt Club is an alumni group of KIT-Kyoto iGEM team. The current KIT-Kyoto iGEM team members also assisted the shooting. The report covered two of the artworks. One was drawings with GFP expressing E. coli. E. coli was used as an ink, so drawings glow mystically in UV light. The other was accessory making. The club members walked through the campus to collect locust wings, coated them with resin and colored them with nail colors to turn them into funky earrings and the like. These accessories were once on sale. The report about the club was aired on Anchor, an evening news program. The viewership was 12.2%, which is quite high.
At KIT, iGEM doesn't end at Giant Jamboree. It evolves into long running activities and keep disseminating the message about synthetic biology to the broader public.

Dr. Mark Styczynski
Dr. Mark Styczynski uses experimental and computational techniques to study the connections between the different layers of regulation in cells and the cells' ultimate phenotypic outcomes. Of most interest to his lab are metabolites, the small molecule building blocks necessary for all cellular functions both as source materials and as cues that prompt regulation and other cellular responses. He studies metabolism in a variety of systems ranging from yeast to human cancer cell lines. Dr. Styczynski received his PhD from MIT in 2007, was a postdoctoral associate at the Broad Institute from 2007 to 2009, and joined the School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Tech in 2009 as an Assistant Professor.

Antibody Screening
To see which antibodies in our diverse population are binding the antigen, we put our population through a modified yeast two-hybrid screen. As you see below, the LexBD domain binds lexO just upstream of the Ura3 CDS, anchoring the bait antigen to the DNA at that point. If the antibody binds the antigen, it localizes the fused VP16 domain to that site as well. This causes an increase of transcription of Ura3 which allows the cells with positive binding antibodies to survive in media without Uracil while those with antibodies that do not bind the antigen die off and are cleared from the population.
Because iGEM is such a
short competition and biology takes time to engineer we decided to simulate this two-hybrid screen and ensure that a uracil selection system such as this would actually work. To do this, we physically joined the antibody and antigen constructs together by replacing those parts with a flexible (Gly3Ser)4 linker and nuclear localization sequences. The translated protein then becomes LexBD:NLS:linker:NLS:VP16. Because VP16 is now physically linked to the Lex DNA binding domain, as long as this construct is localized in the nucleus then VP16 will be anchored to the lex operator, increasing transcription through any promoter system that is in lexO's proximity. Because the screening no longer relies on antibody:antigen interactions, expression of this construct can serve as a positive control for the screen.  We linked this construct to the pGAL promoter so it would only be expressed in galactose-containing media. To actually test if the system is working or not, we plate these cells on multiple -ura plates, some containing galactose and others containing only glucose. If the screening functions properly, the cells on the galactose plate should grow while the cells on the glucose plate die.
CRE Recombination
To test for functionality of our Cre recombination constructs we built a reporter plasmid that can function as a positive control.
Because our system is all about the protein localization, secretion and surface display of proteins of interest we decided that our control plasmid should involve the same parts. We built a plasmid nearly identical to"

Started on PCR’in the genes out of the genomic DNA. Both gambiense and rhodesiense species of Trypanosoma brucei were used in the PCR reactions, to see the specificity of the primers. Primers annealed for both species. Only the gambiense gene was used for further construct building. It was gel purified and digested with both KpnI and SacI. The backbone, pET52b, was obtained by miniprepping and was also digested with KpnI and SacI, present in the multiple cloning site of the plasmid. The digestion products were cleaned-up, and used for T4 ligation.  Digestion of the plasmid could be confirmed on gel, however the ligation product could not be visualised on gel. Moreover, after transformation by heatshock to DH5alpha, no colonies formed.  This week also, chemically competent E. coli Rosetta were made for future experiments.
Week 4 (7th of August - 13th of August)
The construct building was repeated, since it failed in week 3. First, the ligation was repeated using higher DNA concentrations. Once again, no colonies formed on the plates after transformation and the ligation could not be visualized on gel.  Because of this, the construct building was done from scratch. Starting with PCR of the genomic DNA and continuing to the transformation. This time, DNA concentrations measured with Nanodrop were much better looking. Ligation was performed with 3:1 insert to vector, and could be visualised on gel, where both ligated product, excess insert and excess backbone (empty) were seen.  Colonies on the plates after transformation were checked with cPCR. Most colonies seemed to contain the insert.
Week 5 (14th of August - 20th of August)
The colonies with the highest band intensities of week 4 were picked, grown overnight, miniprepped and sent for sequencing. Of 6 samples, 3 showed an empty backbone. The other three have the insert and are in-frame. However, some mismatches were observed comparing the sequencing data with the reference sequence obtained from online databases. Moreover, none of the pET52b-ISG75 constructs showed the insert inside the plasmid.  More colonies of the transformation of week 4 were checked for the presence of the insert, but none were found.

After performing LaMotte nutrient tests, several issues were discovered:
- Some nutrients produced very small quantities, too little to fill cuvette.
- Due to subjectivity in the perception of colored results, it was difficult to read precise amounts for each nutrient. Several tests, like the one involving a black line and shade of grey, exacerbated this problem.
A handful of team members took augers home to get samples from their yards. Next week we will hear feedback from those that used the augers and begin drafting protocol and assembling a kit for sample taking: including recording of gps/time/temp, etc. Environmental limitations: nearby buildings, trees, dog pee, rain within 48 hours.

Week 5
DRY LAB 5:
Victor talks about the acquisition of his samples, the type of soil, the process, and his reflection upon the experience of extraction:
- Need the address or geotag location of every collected sample for verification purposes.
- Between each sampling of soil, it is important to clean the auger with DISTILLED WATER, as tap water has trace elements and minerals that may get absorbed into the soil of the next sample, providing false or altered readings.
- When not in use soil should be stored in dark spaces with the bag open, to prevent photobleaching and allow aeration.
- Sebastian blows everyone's mind with science when he casually mentions the ""dew"" that forms in the plastic bags of soil when they are sealed is not caused by humidity, but by BACTERIA!
- A scientist and a photographer try to agree on how to standardize and optimize the process of photographing the samples and results.
- The Universal Extraction Buffer (used in many of these nutrient tests) is essentially vinegar. It NEUTRALIZES the alkalinity of the sample to even out the pH. This process leads to an opaque reaction that forms a PRECIPITATE that will not dissolve. Because of this, the color will remain. Just keep refrigerated.
- The sample requires a relative reading. I.e. any lighting can be used, so long as the sample and the control are read (or photographed) at the same time.
- The white flakes from a fresh fire are called Pot Ash. It's another name for Potassium.

Discussion
Our result of the relative transcription initiation strength of the three promoters is consistent with the result characterized by RFP fluorescence intensity provided by iGEM headquarter. Three problems, however, can be observed in our results. First, the cell growth of device 1 was slower than all other four groups. This phenomenon could be explained as the growth of device 1 cells was hindered by the translation of GFP most severely. In addition, the FI/Abs600 data of device 1 is not as stable as other groups represent. We first suspected that this was due to the deviation during sampling. However, we also noticed that, according to Table 5, the vibration patterns of the two replicates of device 1 at selected times were almost identical, thus this possibility could be excluded. Before further evidences are collected, we could only hypothesize that this phenomenon might be caused by unique biochemistry process of device 1 cells. Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of device 3 was too weak as to fail to show significant difference from negative control. One possible explanation is that the promoter of device 3 is too weak under our culture condition. Another explanation could be that the observed fluorescence intensity of negative control cells is higher than real situation due to the sample layout pattern in the 96-well plate while measuring the fluorescence. Considering that the samples of negative control are placed between positive control and device 1 and that the 96-well plate that we use is transparent, the fluorescence leakage of positive control and device 1 might enhance the measured fluorescence intensity of negative control. Thus we suggest that the protocol for plate reader relating to the usage of 96-well plate should be adjusted, allowing teams to use black 96-well plate when measuring fluorescence while use transparent 96-well plate for Abs600 measuring.

Encapsulation
M2 is the encapsulation phase.  Upon detection of lowered glucose concentrations, the cells that have already produced the protein of interest will now be triggered to produce Colanic acid and Trehalose.
We have looked at 3 parts of the M2 phase:
Using characteristics of the CRP promoter,
Modelling how glucose consumption is linked to cell growth and using the drop in glucose concentration for indirect timing of encapsulation (via the CRP promoter)
Modelling how the CRP promoter activity varies with different secondary carbon sources
Protein production,
Modelling Colanic acid and Trehalose production

Setting up a collaboration between iGEM Toulouse and the Network of French High Schools
Figure 1: Cathy Metge and Aurélien Despierris meeting the iGEM Toulouse Team
Very early during our project, we met Cathy Metge and Aurélien Despierris at an Escape Game convention. They are teachers in STL high school, a specialized training focused on Science and Technology in the Laboratory. Like us, they were here to find new educational ways to transmit their passion for sciences. On their advice, we met Philippe Garnier, an academic inspector, and we soon agreed that we had common ambitions to create fun ways to study biotechnology. We were therefore very interested in working together. Indeed, many problematics of the STL program were parts of our project for the iGEM competition, like :
Checking the identity of a bacterial strain of interest
Development of a culture medium
Search for optimal conditions for growth and production.
Growth monitoring
Extraction of products from the culture medium
Qualitative / quantitative analysis
Molecular biology: notions of cloning / extraction of DNA-RNA / restriction enzymes / PCR / etc
Lab safety and bioethics issues.
They were also very interested in our student trajectories and experiences. The way we handled our Human practices part also raised their interest. This is how we decided to start a collaboration with the network of French high schools. Mr Garnier indicated that this could influence not only the STL sections but also the following BTS (higher technician studies) and preparatory classes to higher education institutions :
BTS ABM
BTS Biotech
BTS QIAB
BTS Bioanalysis and Control
Prepa ATS Bio
Prepa (CPGE) TB
Actions
Face-to-face exchanges
We first organized a meeting with not one but many high schools. In order to do that, we have scheduled a Visio conference with the help of Aurélien Despierris for after the Giant Jamboree. This will gather four high schools (Stéphane Hessel High school and high schools from Castres, Montauban and Albi (3 cities of our region). This intervention will be in two parts. The first one will be about iGEM, our project and all the problems that we have been challenged with. In the second part, we are going to talk about our academic study paths, how we deal with this project and being students but also about ethical aspects of synthetic biology.

Amazonas_Brazil,2017,Team:Amazonas Brazil#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," realize the value of “foundational advances”, that contribute so much to improve the technique, regarding its efficiency, off-target effects and to comprehend CRISPR utilization, that over time might be applied to more complexes organisms, as humans and other animals. Until then, CRISPR needs to be even better fundamented.
The encouragement of this kind of research cannot cease since the improvement is continuous. By optimizing (and improving) a specific element of CRISPR, as we did with CRISPeasy toolbox, doesn’t represent the end, but the beginning or continuity to collaborations and related projects. We consider this an important implication of our project.
One of the implications of the development, simplification and free-to-use access, the Foundational Technologies, it’s our exposure to dangers, which can be natural or artificial, caused unexpectedly by bioengineering. However, the analysis of these risks cannot be direct – What? Drew Endy addresses this question in his article “Foundations for Engineering Biology”, and cites as an example the advent of DNA synthesis, that made possible for the Spanish influenza pandemic virus to be “resurrected”. With the article of Trumpey T. M., called “Characterization of the reconstructed 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic virus”, it was possible to understand details about its virulence.
Now, it is possible to make Smallpox genome, with easily accessible DNA sequences. The free-to-use access of these informations allows to construct variants of this vírus, and many others as well. However, the emerging of DNA synthesis could quickly and efficiently come with solutions to these risks, as occurs when we deal with natural biological risks, Through high capacity of response to risks, vaccines and its precursors could be synthetized and about the analysis of these risks, for example, ORF codons of pathogens synthetized and optimized to express recombinant proteins.
Even with this high capacity of analyzing and responding to risks, researchers are not exempted from taking necessary actions to ensure biosafety. It is fundamental to consider carefully the safety implications before and during the research fulfillment. As Andrea Ventura, a researcher at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York,  tells Nature in interview with Heidi Ledford, it is important to foresee even remote risks and that, when working with lung cancer model in mouses using CRISPR, he had carefully designed guide RNAs that don’t cleave human DNA, highlighting  that “It’s not very likely, but still needs to be considered”.
The risk analysis for Foundational Technologies, depend on its applications, that can impact positively or negatively."
Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," GFP reporter plasmid was created and assayed in E. coli where it gave the highest expression of any promoter tested including the positive control used in the iGEM InterLab studies. This result was consistent in our laboratory as well as that of our two collaborating teams representing Imperial College London and University of Warwick. The Clostridial promoter P¬Cac_thl has been routinely used in Clostridial research and outperforms every other promoter in E. coli, therefore it can be hypothesised that P¬Cac_thl would exhibit the strongest levels of expression in the GusA promoter assay in C. difficile, had this plasmid been constructed. As such PCac_thl and PCsp_fdx were chosen as the two strong promoters from which to express our asRNA parts.
When choosing the length of the antisense RNA we consulted the scientific literature. There is some contradicting advice on this topic with E. coli asRNA parts seeming to be significantly shorter than those used in the few asRNA studies we found performed in clostridia. There are important design considerations here since there is a compromise to be made. Longer asRNA parts seem to generally give a greater degree of suppression but are also more likely to give unwanted off-target effects. This is probably because they can bind the target mRNA more tightly but are also more likely to have regions of short similarity with other non-target mRNAs within the cell. With this in mind we chose to try two different lengths of asRNA binding to the coding region of the target gene as well as the entire region upstream of the gene expected to include the ribosome binding site. ‘Construct One’ has a binding region of 24bp, this is the length suggested by a recent review paper on this topic (Hoynes-O’Connor & Moon, 2016). ‘Construct Two’ has a  binding region of 50bp, this is much longer though still significantly shorter than the hundreds of base pairs previously used in clostridial studies (Desai & Papoutsakis, 1999; Fagan & Fairweather, 2011). Both of these constructs target both of the toxin genes we are interested in.

Our aim is to create a variation of the original Biobrick completely compatible with all iGEM assembly standards without resulting in loss of function.
The optimised biobrick BBa_K2330002 was initially tested by ligation into plasmid backbone pSB1C3 assembled through the RFC10 standard. Successful ligation was determined through colony PCR. Previous work on the origional LovTAP part indicated that LovTAP under a lacl operator was highly expressed even without IPTG induction. To test experimental activity, the optimised Biobrick was assembled into a low copy number plasmid pSB3K5 in an attempt to control overexpression and reduce the impact the 'leakyness' of the lacl operator had on the system.
The system was tested in the composite part under the lacl promotor BBa_K2330001 with the same composite reporter N.o 2 both described by iGEM09 EPF Lausanne team BBa_K191005 , an inverted RFP reporter induced by the double repression of the TrpR and TetR promotors. Under this system LovTAP activity can be directly associated with RFP expression. The reporter construct was ligated into a higher copy number plasmid pSB1C3 and a double transformation was carried out in DH5a cells. Successful transformants were screened using Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol antibiotics. Previous work shows that when colonies containing the reporter construct are grown in LB medium there is very little response to the addition of tryptophan, suggesting the reporter is already saturated with tryptophan from the medium. In an attempt to combat this cells were grown initially in LB, pelleted by centrifucation and resuspended in amino acid supplemented M9 minimal media and incubated for an hour prior to testing. To aid cell growth glucose was used for the mediums carbon source in lieu of glycerol.
Cell cultures were tested for the effect exposure to 470 nm light in addition to the effect exposure to IPTG and tryptophan had on RFP expression and LovTAP activity. The following test conditions were carried out in quadruplicate analysed over a 16 hour period using an orbital shaking plate reader incubated at 37 Celsius.

1.Introduction
Economics is basically called the ""QUEEN SUBJECT "" of all subjects of social sciences. Economics is one of the most useful of all sciences, because it make us aware of how things are exchanged, flourished, and survived within multiple markets. Not even that, it makes us aware of lots of facts which we knew earlier, but have not.
 
“Economics places a key role in all aspects of  life and is an important subject worth knowing more about”
 
This  year we participated in the following activities.
•Poster Session at the University of Tokyo
•Interview with the Science Magazine ""Newton""
•MUSE TALK
•Visit to Elementary School
•Annual Meeting of the Genetics Society of Japan
•Our approaches to the questions we encountered
We aimed at letting a broad range of people know synthetic biology. The people involved in our activities includes elementary students to elderly, as well as people without any scientific background to people who majored in Computer Science. During these activities, we did a poster session and presentation using interactive visuals and understandable texts. We explained our projects, what genetic manipulation is, and what benefits synthetic biology can bring to us. The audience gave us many feedbacks about our projects, and opinions about how they think about synthetic biology. We appreciate all the people involved in our activities.

With our primers in the post, we've been mass producing growth media and agar plates. We've resuspended and transformed a selection of the biobricks we plan on using, including YFP, GFP, INP, and some terminators.
The wiki team have been locked in the basement and they're not allowed out till it looks beautiful.
2nd July
Today we've been writing out scripts for our tutorial videos, they'll be a series aimed at younger students with an introduction to Synthetic Biology, and a series aimed at Synthetic Biologists on things like Goldengate and Gibson assembly.
Then we locked our token nanotechnologist into a lab with a couple of thousand pounds worth of microfluidics chips and we're hoping for the best (and a minimal number of perforations)
3rd July
Been a busy day; plasmid preps, glycerol stocks and further transformations of quorum sensing biobricks (pLux and LuxR), promoters and cyan fluorescent proteins.
We then had a skype conference with Cyrille Pauthenier, the advisor for the Evry iGEM team.
Went into great detail on Goldengate and Goldenbrick assembly methods and their pros and cons.
We ended our day doing soundtests for our educational videos; watch for the remix.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"i-Q was added, left for 5 min before extracting. It was transformed in Top10 component cells and plated on a LB-KAN plate. Top10 Component cells were used as a negative control and plated on a LB plate. The plates had 100 and 400 µL of the cultures, and were left overnight at 37°C. One 50 mL tube with 5mL of pSB1C3_j23101 culture was also left overnight in at 37°C at 200 rpm.

Plasmid isolation of J23101_pSBIC3 was done for IDT genes backbones. This was done by using 4,5mL overnight culture for isolation of plasmids, to increase the yield. The yield was determined by using the nanodrop, and the concentration was 75,13 ng/ µL.
A restriction was done of pSB4K5 & J23101_pSBIC3 with EcoRI-HF & PstI-HF. The volume was 9x normal to create large stock with a total volume of 450µL. 90 µL 6x loading dye was added to bring the final volume to 540 µL. The restriction was carried out for 3 hours at 37°C.  The restrictions were loaded on a large gel. Slots 12-20 were filled with J23101_pSBIC3 with 60µL in each slot.
The results of the plates of 13/07/2015 were as followed. The cells without a plasmid grew significantly, but the 100 plate with plasmid I20270 had only 8 small colonies that were left overnight, at 37°C, again to grow larger.
Fluorescence  was checked of the plates with J23101_I13504.2, J23106_I13504.2, J23117_I13504.2. The conclusion was that J23101 and J23106 were fluorescent in UV light, and J23117 was not. Therefore the ligation of J23117 with I13504 was repeated.

Gel extraction was done on the gel with restricted pSB45K5 and pSB1C3.
Plasmid isolation (4) of the plasmids 101+504 and 106+504 has been performed with 1,5 mL of each culture. The following concentration were measured with the nanodrop measurement: 101 + 504: 109 ng/µl"
