Toulouse,2014,Team:Toulouse#Result#experimental-results_-_-_TEXT.html," scanning microscope. Through the use of a green fluorochrome (Syto9), we highlighted the presence of bacteria on the surface of the beads (individualized by phase-contrast). A first calibration step determined the minimum threshold to remove the background noise and the natural fluorescence.
Results
We can notice the engineered bacterium is well attached to the surface of beads coated with chitin.
Figure 18: Microscopic view of engineered strain associated with beads surfaces coated with chitin
Using ImageJ software, we created 3D pictures and movies of those images.
Figure 19: A short movie of 3D bead surfaces coated with chitin and the engineered strain (emotional sequence for Subtitree: first movie apparition, before Cannes festival…)
We then performed a wash step on the chitin beads. We measured the release of bacteria on the washing solution. When our bacterium has the binding module (Right on Figure 20), there is less release than without the module (Right on Figure 20). Therefore, the engineered bacterium is retained by the beads.
Figure 20: Microscopic view of elution fraction of WT Bacillus subtilis (Left) and engineered bacterium (Right).
To conclude, all the results are consistent with the successfull integration of a functional chitin binding system in B. subtilis. We thus validated the second module.

1. Preliminary experiments
Tests with commercial peptides and controls
The first tests were accomplished with commercial GAFP-1 and D4E1 peptides at different concentrations (12.5 µM, 25 µM, 100 µM). As Ceratocystis Platani is pathogenic, we could not perform tests directly with this fungus. These tests were therefore performed with different non-pathogenic fungal strains from the same phylum as Ceratocystis Platani. After 1 to 6 days at 30°C depending on the fungal strain, the PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) plates covered with fungus and containing a paper disk soaked with a commercial peptides solution were analyzed.
An inhibition halo was noticeable with commercial D4E1 peptide at 100 µM on Aspergillus brasiliensis (Figure 21). Less bright halos were also present with lower concentrations. Concerning commercial GAFP-1, we did not notice any effect in the tested conditions. Copper sulfate, a well-known chemical fungicide was used as a positive control. Inhibition of the fungal growth was complete with 20 mg/ml copper sulfate, and at 10 mg/ml a"

Method to lure insects
In nature, some of organisms which eat insects lure them. Rafflesia attract flies by distinctive smell. Pyrearinus termitilluminans, which makes and lives in tunnel in anthill of termite Cornitermes cumulans, emits light in the first week of rainy season to hunt the termites. Arachnocampa also uses light for hunting flies.
For Carnivorous E.coli, we chose light as the method to lure insects like Pyrearinus termitilluminans, because it is simple and there is an available biobrick which has the function to emit light: BBa_K3225909 created by iGEM 2010 Cambridge Team.
Our works
To probe that Carnivorous E.coli can lure insects. we, group luminescence, intend to do the following things.
Confirmation that drosophila, our model organism, have positive phototaxis in blue light (E.glowli created by 2010 Cambridge Team emits blue light)
Confirmation that drosophila moves to light emitted by E.coli

General Human Practice
Team Tsinghua has always been an active force in the public education of synthetic biology. This year we went to Changsha Yali High School, Hunan, where the 27th China High School Biology Olympiad was being held. Also we prepared synthetic biology lectures for students at the Tsinghua summer school. By introducing iGEM and our project, we hope to attract more young masterminds to the field of synthetic biology.
As we aim to expand our public education program, we held a conference with members in the conjoint Chinese-International teaching assistance programs, discussing how we were going to help communicate the idea of science and biology to those students in economically and educationally underdeveloped area in China.
As an active member of the community, Tsinghua is well engaged in meeting and sharing with other universities and iGEM teams. We attended the annual meetup held at Beijing Normal University at the beginning of this year, sharing our experiences. Our presentation was awarded with the First Prize. In summer, we shared the history of our iGEM projects with students from USTC.
At the end of August, Tsinghua attended the 5th CCiC hosted by Shanghai Tech. CCiC, the biggest iGEMer community in China, provided us with a great opportunity to establish new friendships and renew old ones. We received much help from other teams in many ways. Team Peking, in particular, generously shared a new transformation technique. Also in September, we attended a regional meet up held by UCAS, through which we laid the foundation for further collaborations among iGEM teams in Beijing and Tianjin.
During the Chinese national holiday, Tsinghua and Tsinghua-A team held an exhibition on synthetic biology at Chinese Science and Technology Museum (CSTM). By introducing visitors to microorganisms and microscopes we gave them a basic understanding of microbiology. We provided graphs of bacteria for children and encouraged them to design their own bacteria. We even provided florescent bacteria with GFP, RFP and YFP plasmids for children to draw on LB plates. Later we sent the pictures of their bacterial painting back. We also talked about the mechanism of allergy which is closely related to Tsinghua-A's"

We can also get the conclusion                                 that MC4100 is more sensitive to artificial gastral juicy rather than intestinal juice,                                 probably suggesting its vulnerability to acidic environment. In general, our data shows                                 that the constructed bacteria can survive in an environment mimicking gastrointestinal                                 tract to some extent, though their growth will be affected.
2.2 Coculture with microbiota in mice feces
      Feces of mice were obtained from College of Pharmacy                                 with the help                                 of Qian Jiang (see attribution). 0.25g feces were dissolved in 2mL LB medium with no                                 antibiotic and cultured overnight. Strains mentioned before were cultured with                                 corresponding antibiotics. After incubating for about 14h, Feces cultures were then                                 filtered by normal filter paper (not filters with diameter equaling to 0.2 micron) to                                 get supernatant. OD600 of Supernatant as well as constructed strain cultures were                                 measured later. Based on measurement result, cultures were diluted to OD600 = 0.02                                 according to calculation excel provided on official website. Supernatant and bacteria                                 culture were than mixed in various ratio. Mixtures were cultured in either artificial                                 gastral juice or intestinal juice overnight. Then we did gradient dilution to the                                 culture and spread them on plates with no antibiotic. Plates were incubated under 37                                 degrees centigrade and observed after 2 days.
Figure 4. Coculture in artificial intestinal juice                                     Vertical coordinate shows the ratio of constructed strains to feces microbiota.                                     Horizontal coordinate shows the dilution gradient of culture.                                     Left panel: DH5 alpha, right panel: MC4100
Figure 5. Coculture in artificial intestinal juice                                     Vertical coordinate shows the ratio of constructed strains to feces microbiota.                                     Horizontal coordinate shows the dilution gradient of culture.                                     Left panel: DH5 alpha, right panel: MC4100
      We sadly found that except the                                 positive control (ratio 1:0 in figure 4, 5), none of experimental plate became even                                 reddish, not to say become as red as positive control after incubation for 2 days. Maybe                                 exposure to atmosphere dramatically accelerated the growth of some bacteria which grew                                 worse in gastrointestinal tract with few air. Probably coculture in an anaerobic                                 environment may provide different result.

It was also suggested for our team to focus on the successful production of just one pigment instead of all four, as this is an example of minimum viable product. This means that the minimum is achieved to push customers to purchase our product. As well, the showcasing of our product would be simple. For example, as a pen, or even a finger dipped into the ink. The only purpose is to show that successfulness of our product.
Overall, the interview with Dr. Vilk, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Aiken was successful. Most members of our team do not have a business background, and this discussion opened our eyes into the business realm.

Urease is an extracellular enzyme, produced by H. pylori, which allows the microenvironment surrounding H. pylori to be buffered against the harsh acidity of the mammalian stomach via the cleavage of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide by urease.3  Synthetic peptides have been produced in studies utilizing phage display, which demonstrate a non-competitive interaction with urease by a unique 6mer peptide.  It has been suggested that this particular peptide (YDFYWW) interacts with urease via hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions, causing a spatial modification to the enzyme’s catalytic core, thus inhibiting urea cleavage.4  Given this information, and the requirement of H. pylori to have the ability to buffer its microenvironment via urea cleavage by urease, we hypothesize that an environment physiologically similar to the mammalian stomach and appropriately saturated with this particular 6mer peptide could potentially inhibit the growth of H. pylori, or any other non-acidophile, as the pH of the environment would be sufficient to inhibit growth.
Additionally, studies into the regulation of urease production and acid-tolerance of H. pylori have shown that, in acidic environments, a promoter region directly upstream of the ureA and ureB genes, encoding the ureA and ureB subunits of urease, is regulated by the well-studied ArsR regulatory system, which is present in Escherichia coli.5 The utilization of a pH promoter, PureA, in a biological system designed to minimize antibiotic “noise”, in the form of molecules intended to inhibit microbiological growth, appears to be desirable.
Therefore, it is our intention to design a biological system to regulate production of a 6mer peptide in host organism E. coli, and to produce the 6mer when in an acidic environment, as regulated naturally by PureA in H. pylori as apart of its innate metabolic regulatory machinery.  Additionally, we will couple the 6mer peptide to a Twin-Arginine Translocation tag sequence, in order for the 6mer to be recognized by the innate TAT peptide secretion mechanism in E. coli.  With a construct containing these genetic components, and additional subsets of these components coupled with standard laboratory reporter genes, we will be able to test and quantify the efficacy of this novel, organism-specific, anatomically specific anti-H. pylori biological treatment system.

UCLA iGEM COLLABORATION
On September 23 we met with UCLA’s iGEM team via Skype. During this meeting, we discussed details of our project’s goals, progress, and impact. In particular, we shared what new updates we’ve made to our experiment from last year, discussing what changes worked better. This included updates to our secretion system, and updates to our method of analyzing chitinase gene expression via FLAG-tag. UCLA iGEM gave us advice on how to expand our chitinase project, especially regarding ways to create a chitin medium that would enable us to test whether the chitinase was working. We also shared ideas for human practices, discussing public outreach strategies that have worked and failed for us in the past. We also provided key suggestions to help UCLA iGEM with cell-cell adhesion as well as growth inhibition."

The oligos containing isoguanine or 5‑methyl isocytosine were synthesized by Biolegio , including subsequent purification through polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Mass spectrometry and ultra performance liquid chromatography data (Figure 1) provided by Biolegio indicate that the concentrations of unmodified side products are below detection limits. In general, the manufacturer specifies the purity of PAGE purified oligonuleotides containing modified bases to be greater than 95 %. The oligonucleotides containing exclusively natural bases were ordered from metabion and were purified by desalting.
The existence of the unnatural bases in the oligos from Biolegio and the correct sequence of the oligos containing natural bases exclusively was further confirmed by analysis with our Mutational Analysis Xplorer (M.A.X.) . This orthogonal analysis approach reveals that the purity and sequence identity of the oligos was very high.

Oligonucleotides containing isoguanine or 5‑methyl isocytosine were synthesized and analysed by Biolegio by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS). Shown above are the results from the UPLC (above) and MS (below) analysis for each of the complementary oligos containing either isoguanine (A) or 5‑methyl isocytosine (B).
For each DNA sample, a complementary pair of oligonucleotides was annealed and ligated into a plasmid backbone ( BBa_K1465202 ) previously linearized by XbaI and BmtI. For this purpose, a leading BmtI and a tailing SpeI recognition site were included into the oligonucleotide sequences. After ligation, re-ligated backbone was linearized by digestion with XbaI. After consecutive digestion of double and single stranded linear DNA fragments with lambda exonuclease and E. coli exonuclease I, the DNA samples were linearized through EcoRV digestion and purified for sequencing library preparation.

HKU-HKBU,2009,Team:HKU-HKBU#team_-_-_TEXT.html,". Aspired to be a successful biologist, he decides to choose these two majors to train himself in both analytical reasoning skills and the ability of filtering useful information. He thinks these are the most essential tool for a biologist to explore the profound mystery of life. It is quite challenging to deal with two subjects that are so different in thinking patterns and ways of preparing for the exam, but he manages to cope with ‘oscillating transition between physics and biology’ and attain satisfactory academic results. However, knowledge on the textbook is out-dated. Only will an opportunity of self-motivated scientific DIY suffice to provide him with a somehow more realistic perspective on state-of-the-art research.
When first introduced to the iGEM competition in a departmental seminar, he was totally fascinated by the idea of synthesizing ‘biological machines’ from standardized biological parts. This whole process of building up biological devices from basic functional building blocks will require mathematical modeling and a systematic and logical design that is familiar to engineering student. He thinks it is time to exploit the intricate principles discovered by so many talented scientists after centuries of dutiful research to engineer artificial organisms that can ‘change the world’ and help people. He was thus motivated to join the HKU-HKBU iGEM team. In this team, his responsibility is to generate ideas and design of the project and manufacture Biobricks, namely standardized biological parts. With enthusiasm and diligence, he collaborates with his talented teammates to create a powerful bacteria-powered motor. The argument that our future world will heavily rely on the motors we build may seem ridiculous to some. It may or may not happen, but who knows? Nothing is impossible. iGEM is for people with imagination.
iGEM is an invaluable learning experience for him. Thanks to the competition, he not only masters the necessary research skills in manipulating the genetic materials of bacteria, but more importantly, the spirit of teamwork and the importance of taking up responsibility.

Meanwhile, the variable possibilities in experiments display the fascination of synthetic biology. Another great thing is that I have met lots of like-minded friends in this IGEM competition.

When dispensing into a well, the output specified by the user is selected and all other outputs are directed to waste. Once the dispensing is completed all outputs are directed to waste while the XY Plane moves to the next well; this process is repeated until all wells specified by the user have been hit.
Controlling the XY-Plane
The XY Plane software is responsible for taking the well coordinates given by the user and moving the the plate to each coordinate during dispensing. The software snake loops through all the wells, going through row by row, on the vessel and compares each to the coordinate array given by the user. If there is a match between the a well on the vessel and a well in the coordinate array, XY Plane moves to that well to dispense. This process continues until the software has hit all the wells in the coordinate array.
To accomplish we needed to calculate the number of steps between wells to program the stepper motors. Given either a 24, 96, or 384 well plate, we calculated the steps between wells for each plate by using the distance between wells and the circumference of the pulleys.
In addition to moving the well plate for dispensing, the XY Plane software is also responsible for homing TERRA. Before a run on TERRA, the system needs to be homed in order to start from a known location. The system is homed by moving the well plate so that left-most corner is under the nozzle. Because the well plate can be in any location on the XY Plane, contact switches are used on both the X and Y paths send a signal to to halt the stepper motors once they’ve reached either end.

Fig.15. Liang’s solution
To offer a universal solution for inserting different kinds of inteins into T7 RNAP(which may become the foundation to construct T7 RNAP responses to different signals), we tried to insert inteins with several native residues of exteins[12] into selected locus of T7 RNAP(Fig.16.).
Fig.16. Our solution
These locus must satisfy the following conditions(Fig.17.):
1.  The inserted intein can function.
2.  Before splicing, the inserted intein with residues could inactive T7 RNAP.
3.  After splicing, the remaining residues of intein wouldn’t inactive T7 RNAP.
Fig.17. Conditions for locus
Selected locus
Since it’s difficult to predict intein’s function, and professor Liu told us that chances for inactive protein interrupted by 100~400 residues are pretty high, we concentrated more on condition 3. There are 2 main considerations for locus selection:
1.  Avoid conserved sites and key sites for recognition, initiation and catalyzation.
2.  Avoid α-helix or other important secondary structure, select loop region.
With the help of many papers[13~21,24] and PyMol, we selected 67N, 179K, 366D, 498E, 601N, 715T, 856S(Fig.18. Fig.19.).

We synthesized 3 segs and assemble them with BBa_I10500 , BBa_I716103 using Gibson Assembly. Here are details for each seg:
(1) SEG1: Contains GFP with LVA tag under the control of PT7. (Fig.21.)
T7 expression is high level expression system, to exclude metabolic load[21], we employed GFP with LVA degradation tags, and a low-activity T7 promoter(according to literature, 21% activity[21]).
To avoid interference from upstream coding arac, we set a terminator BBa_B0015 before PT7"

Discussion
We asked some kids to play the game and got some feedback. The names of the following respondents were all anonymous, and the respondents answered questions in Chinese, and we translated them into English.
The most interesting part of this game is the man becomes a worm (or bacteria) and I should control the worm all the time! It is so funny! The background is so simple but not ugly, so I painted a same picture after I finished this game, I think I did it well. By the way, the game is a little difficult in my opinion.
——Carol, 6 years old.
I am jumping around at the platforms because the music is so cool! I like this game, because all the things are very cute especially the green stick I control which looked like a fool. Well, seriously, I like the game because I can learn something from it. If you ask me what I have learned, I’d say I get to know biology is very using in our daily life, also I know how gene line is built.
——John, 9 years old.
The game is very easy until the fifth level in which I died for more than ten times…crazy! But the reason I didn’t give up this game is I felt I know the right way to complete this chapter and I just lose the game for careless. The last two levels are a little difficult, but you won’t lose it"
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2015,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Human Practice#Desalination_-_-_TEXT.html,"2005, Israel opened the world’s largest seawater RO desalination plant, with a production capacity of 330,000m^3/day (Sauvet-Goichon, 2007).
These might not prove that RO method will be the most popular method, but it will certain prove that it will be one of the most popular methods. With this in mind, we thought it may be great to visit a RO membrane research center.
Visit to HWTTDC
Figure  6.3.2 Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center Visit
One of the researchers, Yu Zhang, is presenting the mechanism of RO membrane.
On Aug. 8, 2015, we visit the Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center (HWTTDC). It is the supporting unit of National Engineering and Technological Research Center for Liquid Separation Membrane and a base for the national membrane sector. Their vice director, Hongqiang Li, and several people from the research team received us.
During our visit, the center gave us a detailed presentation of RO method including its current situation, mechanism, whole process, technological and other difficulties. When we explained our project, they showed great interest on this new approaching way. The question they asked most is how efficient this method can be. Unfortunately, that time we were half-way of transformation, so we can’t answer very clearly. Yet, they still inspired us on combing two methods instead of replacing one.
After this visit, we follow the big picture that center gave us and filled in with details below.
The mechanism of RO method
Figure  6.3.3 The mechanism of RO pressure
To understand RO method, the first step is to learn how it works. The mechanism of RO method can be explain through two parts: membranes and pressure.
First, RO membranes are special membranes. Its layered, web-like structure only allows water to pass through by a tortuous pathway. Unlike nano-filtration (NF), ultra-filtration (UF) or micro-filtration (MF), RO membrane reject the smallest contaminants, monovalent ions. This properties allows this kind of membrane to process seawater desalination and even other filtration process requiring removal of monovalent ions.
The other important elements of RO method is osmotic pressure. Figure 6.3.3 shows the simplest figure explanation how it works. In a normal status, water molecules always move from low salinity area to high salinity area. This force we called it osmotic pressure, yet, desalination process is working against osmotic pressure. Therefore,"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," sequenced with ONT sequencing platform. Moreover, we were able to identify 89 sequencing events aligned to the DNA target, and even analyse the possible direction for integration of our fusion protein based on one single DNA read out of over 200 000 reads.
4.4 Data Analysis Software
Design: We developed a software tool for data analysis of sequencing data based on a machine learning algorithm to increase the database for reference alignment in an iterative process.
Results and interpretation: To use this tool, please visit our software tool page .
Conclusion
We demonstrated that our fusion protein and sequencing adapters could be used to replace the first reaction in library preparation for ONT MinION sequencing. More importantly, we proved specific targeted enrichment by our fusion protein for library preparation and ONT MinION sequencing. We obtained preliminary results on the position of adapter integration from sgRNA binding site.

Retrospection of Survey
With a deeper research on treatment methods, the feasibility was verified at experimental level. But it still had a long way to go before it can be applied clinically. With our first survey results and some questions, we went to the hospital again, and conducted another questionnaire survey and interviewed some residents (Figure 9).
Preparation work:
Respondents: patients and doctors with rheumatoid arthritis at inpatient and outpatient of rheumatology department
Sample size: 30 doctors and 80 patients
Procedure:
1. List a questionnaire for patients and doctors (Avoid patients’ and doctors’ personal information).
2. Assign teammates with different tasks.
3. Contact relevant departments of the hospital.
4. Determine the process and the time.
Figure 9. Go to the hospital for in-depth investigation again
According to our plan, we came to Nanjing First Hospital and Nanjing Gulou Hospital for a questionnaire survey. The majority of patients showed great interests in our innovative therapy and explored the specific way of using this therapy after a conversation with them. Some patients were confident in our treatment and encouraged us to make more efforts in getting this therapy into clinical as soon as possible (Video 1). According to the survey, most of them have suffered from RA for more than 5 years. It was gratifying to note that more than half of the patients said they were willing to try Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy while others showed some uncertainty (Figure 10). But we believe this therapy will be more recognized with more future research.
Figure 10. The personal willingness of patients to try syn-Notch CAR-T cell therapy
Video 1. We have a deep conversation with patient
As for our survey with the doctors, most of the them have worked for more than 5 years (Figure 11), and they believed that the current drug treatment had shortcomings like severe side effects, a high recurrence rate and a chronic medication use (Figure 12), while Syn- Notch CAR Treg cell therapy had a more specific target and may show less side effects (Figure 13), which surpassed the existing treatment. Its safety was also further recognized by healthcare professionals. However, there are many problems remaining to be solved before it can actually applied clinically, such as a limitation on large-scale production, quality control standards, etc.

Metals importance throughout history
Platinum in mines
Platinum in industry
Platinum in the environment
Our process
Before and during the conception of our process we investigate many subject in order to design a optimal and relevant process. To do so we pick up the advice of many specialists.
We wished first to investigate the platinum mining issue. To do so we asked the iGEM team of Pretoria to provide us some information about condition and consequences of platinum mining.
iGEM team of Pretoria UP
Mr Henwood at the University of Pretoria
Dr Meyer at the University of Pretoria
Thanks to these data and bibliography we realized what consequences platinum mining can involve in terms of sustainability, ecology, and social issues and that reinforce our determination  find a way to recycle platinum.
Mr. Nicolas Minvielle
Dialogue with an Mr Minvielle historian PhD student showed us how metals issues have always been a central problematic throughout history. This  had strengthen again our feeling that our process was a wise and relevant project to achieve.
As we designed our bio-synthetic project we wonder how our project could be applied for real. We though we could spread our engineered bacteria directly along the roads. But many laws forbid the release of engineered organism in the environment so we decided to change our strategy.  Thanks to bibliography and Mr. Triboit , (an ecologist engineer), we learn that bacteria are able to be in symbiosis with plants roots cells and improve their metals recovery, especially thanks to their siderophore. This technique is actually developed in some laboratory but for the realization of our project this would have been a problem with environmental laws too.
Mr.Triboit enlighten us about the current situation: many process involving plants and phytoremediation are being developed and our process could appear elsewhere to connect with all these solutions. We realized pretty soon that if our process involve bacteria as we planned, there would be a need to confine it.  That's how we decided to design a process performed in a controlled environment that could be plugged to other processes occurring directly in environment. Controlled environment means here a bioreactor, at"

After the first few weeks, we were able to gather mites independently. It was a nice learning process and we learned how to avoid getting stung by bees. They also provided valuable input on honeybee research. Steven Aalvink gave a short instruction on the brightfield microscope. Sjef Boeren operated the Orbitrap for LC-MS/MS and provided instructions on how to prepare samples for proteomics. Kees van der Ark supervised Lisa's work.
Linea made a library of the toxin, she got some help in the lab from her supervisor Franklin, who explained how to work in the ML2 lab. Jaccoline made vesicles with advice from Vera Silva. Jaccoline also worked together with Linea. She learnt about DLS (dynamic light scattering) from RG. Fokkink who also explained how to analyse the data. With this information Jaccoline could analyse her results. Carina made the Varroa sensing system based on sensing mite poop and vitamin B12.
Thomas made a quorum sensing system and a subpopulation system. Thomas was supervised by Franklin during the building of this system and testing it in the lab. Daniel Gerngross made the RBS library with RedLibs algorithm for Thomas. Thomas tested this RBS library in the lab himself. Tjakko Abbee from the  Food Microbiology group at Wageningen UR gave him permission to use the FACS for free. Marcel Tempelaars from this department helped Thomas to do flow cytometry, he explained to Thomas how it worked and did the measurement together with him.

Database Part:
As we know, there are more than 20,000 biobricks in iGEM official standard database                                         and the number of biobrick keeps increasing every year. with the explosive increase of biobricks,                                         it will be harder for synthetic biologists to manually find good biobricks which meets the                                         requirements when they are trying to create new devices with existing parts.                                         This issue will inevitably lead to the birth of softwares and databases especially                                         related to synthetic biology and these intelligent tools will further promote the rapid                                         development of synthetic biology. So we integrated biobricks data from the iGEM official                                         standard database and then created a visual online device-designing system for synthetic biology researchers.
Q/A part:
It is inspired by our experience on the 5th iGEM Asia Pacific Conference,                                          National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. At the communication meeting,                                          we met members of USCT-Software, who also concentrated on developing useful software for biobricks researchers.                                          Through communication and discussion,                                          we realized that some data in biobricks database was inaccurate and these parts should be removed.                                          If not removed, they may cause wrong search results. We doped out a solution to the problem.                                          We planned to build a forum for users to manually select best biobricks.
After interviewing co-founder of Yanyanshe, Mr.Xie, this idea became mature.                                          Yaoyanshe App focus on Pharmaceutical research and developing industry.                                          It is an exclusive internet platform that combines information of drug research and development, clinical database, development tools and industry communication.                                          As its function is similar with our software, we hoped to get effective suggestions from it.                                          Mr.Xie suggested that we could build a platform for users to communicate,                                          thus we added this useful Q/A forum for users.                                          Users can score biobricks on our site and leave a short comment,                                          which enabled researchers to communicate and learn from each other.

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#BeeLab_-_-_TEXT.html," health. We must ensure that bees, both health and unhealthy, do not experience negative health consequences by consuming PPIX.
Achieving these four outcomes individually would provide a set of proof-of-concepts that demonstrate the functionality of APIS, and that our novel strategy of using biosynthesized PPIX as an antifungal therapeutic is effective against N. ceranae infections in vivo.
Materials and Methods
Establishing a Honeybee Hive
In order to perform our in vivo experimentation, we needed a source for Western honeybees (Apis mellifera). Luckily, we were introduced to Jason McKinnon, a friend of one of our supervisors, who had been looking to start a beehive of his own. With his cooperation, we set up a new honeybee hive in south Edmonton, AB, from which we would collect honeybees!
Our team purchased three hive boxes, a few dozen frames, and the basic accessories for starting a hive. With the hive ready to go, Jason and our team travelled to Hove Apiaries, owned by Alvin and Judy Hove, where we got a five frame nuc of Italian honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica) which is a subspecies of the Western honeybee [3]. The nuc included brood frames, honey frames, a mated queen honey bees, and thousands of worker bees. Judy and Alvin were also very generous as they donated nine drawn frames for us to use when our hive grows and expands. After transplanting the nuc into our brand new hive, we let the honeybees get settled for a couple of weeks while Jason helped our team tend to the hive in the meanwhile. Watch our hive building process here!
Figure 1: A picture of Team UAlberta visiting our honeybee hive on Jason McKinnon’s property.
Defining Specimens
Before any experimentation took place, our team defined our sample specimens as honeybee hives have different castes that exhibit different physiology. Thus, the subjects of our experiments were to be worker honeybees, as they are the most abundant caste [3] and would be the major carrier of N. ceranae in hives
However, workers are found in a distribution of ages in hives. So, our team had two options of which workers to collect:
Newly emerged bees which are adult bees that have just finished pupation and have just emerged from their wax-capped cells. These bees ages can be determined and should have a known pathogen load as they would have not been in contact with other bees. Or,
Non-newly emerged bees"

These teams ranged from Pakistan,                          Kenya, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and dozens of other countries. Last year, the competition expanded to Iowa – we                          had the first team to ever compete in this competition from the state. Teams and projects are entirely                          student-initiated and driven, and the tasks that students undertake gives undergraduates the chance to explore                          synthetic biology through independent research. The competition provides students with an opportunity to                          develop academic and organizational skills and promotes the values of integrity, good sportsmanship, respect,                          honesty, celebration, cooperation, effort, and excellence.
About Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is a maturing scientific discipline that combines science and engineering to design and                          build novel biological functions and systems. This includes the design and construction of new biological                          parts, devices, systems, as well as the re-design of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes.                          It is a multidisciplinary field requiring expertise in biology, chemistry, engineering, and mathematics.

The research of his laboratory mainly focuses on the yeast S. cerevisiae which is a paradigm model system for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of basic cellular functions in eukaryotes.
After we found a moderator and an auditorium, we agreed on a program and a schedule. We began on 7 p.m. by presenting the teams, the professors and so on. Then, a student explained what precisely iGEM is and what kind of things it implies. He continued by giving a definition of the synthetic biology: « the design and construction of new biological parts, devices and systems that do not exist in the natural world and also the redesign of existing biological systems to perform specific tasks » (the ETC group, an Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration). After this brief introduction, the K.U.Leuven team presented its project.
The KULeuven team is eagerly working on E.D. Frosti. This is a modified E.coli bacterium that the students will engineer to stimulate and prevent ice formation, depending on the given stimulus. The ice nucleation protein (INP) is responsible for the making of more stable ice. When E.D.Frosti forms this protein, the bacteria cells will turn into a red color. A different stimulus is responsible for the production of the Antifreeze Protein (AFP). To be sure that the right protein is expressed, these cells will turn into a different color. We can use bacteria cells which produce AFP to make roads ice- and snow free during winter. A very important feature of the bacteria is its cell death mechanism, which makes sure that the cells will not overgrow the environment. When E.D. Frosti is exposed to cold temperatures, the bacteria will self-destruct. It is essential that both proteins are not produced at the same time. To avoid this, the KULeuven team engineered E.D. Frosti in a way that the production of one of the two proteins makes the formation of the other protein impossible.
It was afterwards our turn (the ULB-Brussels team) to present our projet, the so-called “Pindel”, coupled with our bioethics project. It was actually difficult to present all our work within five minutes, but we managed to do so. Here is our presentation text:
“The bricks of synthetic biology are fragments of DNA. Just to remind you, DNA contains instructions to construct every molecules of your body. It is as a plan that every organism has inside all of his cells"

In Dr Robert's lab, it goes without saying that Dr Roberts' say is final. Otherwise, Dr Liz's say is final. It is her reputation on the line at the Towson Lab space, and anything the iGEM team does will reflect directly on Dr Liz. Anyone who cannot work under that caveat should bow out now from the Towson Lab space.
On a more upbeat note, the Towson Lab will have results to report soon, we hope!

Summary
Our lab work started in May and after a few first successful transformations we came across our greatest issue: all our experiments with the LOVTAP plasmid from the distribution failed. A long time of troubleshooting followed since LOV is our main component. Finally, we switched to a non-BioBrick LOV with two PstI sites instead of using the distribution. Our work with the other parts could be resumed and we finished"

Miniprep was performed according to the protocol. Cu-promotor         → 250 ng/μl Custom receptor    → 360 ng/μl RFP            → 91.7 ng/μl
Cu-promoter and RFP were placed in pSB1K3, custom receptor was placed in pSB1K3 as well. Cu-promoter DNA was digested with EcoRI and SpeI, RFP DNA was digested with XbaI and PstI. The custom receptor and the target-vector were digested with EcoRI and PstI.
For each of the three samples a mastermix was made. For each digestion the DNA concentration was reduced to 25 ng/ul. 4 ul of DNA sample and target vector sample were transferred to a PCR tube with 4 ul of the according restriction mix. The samples were incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. After 1 hour the samples were taken out of the incubator and enzymes were heat deactivated at 80°C for 20 min. 1ul of target vector (pSB1K3), 2 ul of Cu-promotor restricted DNA, and 2 ul restricted RFP DNA were added to one PCR tube. Furthermore 1ul DNA T4 ligase buffer and 0.5 ul of T4 ligase were added. The total volume was made up to 10 ul with 3.5 ul dH2O. The samples were incubated for one hour (RT). Enzymes were deactivated with heat kill 80°C 20 min.

5. Environmental security.
Any intact project need to be considered the environmental and safety problems, which are related closely to our life and biological system. We have thought about various aspects of safety problems, and got our safety tree. In the future, our goal is increasing the specificity of our system, and achieving quicker and more complete toxins degradation.
6. More trapped injurious insect.
Our project is TERMITE TERMINATOR. Termite is one of the most harmful injurious insects around the world. With the transportation of massive supplies in World War II, these termites’ distribution range has gradually enlarged. At present this kind of termites has caused serious damages in numerous countries and regions, turning into cosmopolitan pest. According to incomplete statistics, all over the world, the annual expenditure of termites control exceeds a billion dollars.
However we need to know that, besides termite, there are more injurious insects damaging and influencing our life. Various kinds of injurious insects, such as locust, mosquito, cockroach and fly, etc also cause some worldwide catastrophes, including grain reduction and human diseases. In the future, we plan to create “The Insecticide Star of Tomorrow”, which is a combination or collaboration of various pesticides and has specificity to other harmful injurious insects. We want to enlarge the range of our objects and help to solve more worldwide pest problems.
7. Practicability and popularity.
We hope in the future our project would acquire stronger practicability and wider popularity. We want to popularize our device and project from rural to urban area, from individual to factory production, and from domestic to international market.

There are several interesting aspects of the Western Blot. Firstly, there was a strong band between 25 and 32 kDa in most lanes. However, it appears in all of the pre-induction controls, suggesting non-specific binding of the anti-HIS antibodies.
Secondly, we observed a band in most of the lanes around 17 kDa (with the exception being the USP protein in SHuffle cells). As these bands were not present in the pre-induction controls, we suspected they were a result of the induction.
Mass spectrometry
In order to assess the identity of the bands, we performed an in-gel tryptic digestion on select bands. We digested bands in the Coomassie stain which corresponded to the HIS-tagged bands in the Western Blot. This was followed by mass spec analysis (LC MS/MS). We focused our analysis on the Magainin 1 Star Peptide bands and the Linear Magainin 1 band. Our USP peptide was, by design, highly rich in basic residues, greatly reducing the likelihood that tryptic fragments would be detected by the mass spec.
We found that the Linear Magainin 1 peptide appeared to be present in the approximately 17 kDa band, with the following detected tryptic fragments in the sequence below (bold; basic residues underlined):
Note that spaces have been added in the sequence to emphasise distinct domains in the protein (in this case, the fusion protein versus the Magainin 1 peptide). Together with the fact that the protein runs close to the expected molecular weight, this seems to provide good evidence that the protein is being expressed.
We then examined the bands corresponding to the Magainin 1 Star Peptide.
Again, we digested bands in the Coomassie stained gel corresponding to the prominent HIS-tagged bands on the Western Blot (near 17 kDa).
The mass spec coverage for the Magainin 1 Star Peptide expressed in SHuffle cells was as follows:
The coverage for the same peptide expressed in BL21(DE3) was found to be:
Again, we can see that tryptic peptides from the expressed protein appear to present in the gel band under analysis.
There is a relatively lower sequence coverage. This could be a limitation of our procedure: for example, improper destaining during the in gel digestion procedure can inhibit tryptic digestion.
However, even if the digestion was complete, the mass spec will only detect fragments which ionize well. The Magainin 1 Star peptide consists of four repeats of the Magainin 1"

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#Human Practices#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," work involved in producing these results is a great deal more tedious and complex then simple LEGO pieces, the fact that these results can be produced is revolutionary.
Moreover, I found out that the U of C iGEM team is not merely concerned with lab work. It was interesting to see how they had members working fulltime in other initiatives such as SecondLife, Marketing and Ethics. I liked the fact that were so many aspects to the project and that there were different things within iGEM to be involved in, whatever your interests. In addition, I really admired the U of C team because it seemed that they had built a strong working relationship and were on track to start building a community. The facilitator of the project, Sonja, allowed freedom within the project that allowed for all kinds of hands-on learning, and it sounds like the team members were able to learn more than they did in any type of biology class. I admired the sense of trust and support that the lab seemed to have, and I am excited to hopefully be a part of iGEM myself in the future!

Nicole Delaloye
This past summer, I had the opportunity to take a tour of University of Calgary’s iGEM lab. And to be honest, before I entered that lab I had no clue whatsoever of what iGEM actually was. However, during my tour I learned all about the iGEM competition and what it entitled; how each team was given identical kits and then set free to go explore the new realm of synthetic biology. I loved the idea of how much independence students received on this research opportunity, never before had I ever heard of such a thing. During my tour I was even given the opportunity to go work in the lab, donning lab coat and latex gloves, I grew my first bacteria culture ever. After spending the afternoon with the University of Calgary’s iGEM team, I have never found myself so excited about biology. This stuff even topped my first dissection. iGEM seems like the best research opportunity a student could ever have. Not only does iGEM offer students a chance to work in the newly emerging field of synthetic biology, but it also gives them an opportunity to work with a team of students who are wholly committed to the competition. After learning that iGEM is an international competition, I found out that Rice University has a"

(C) Fluorescence VS arabinose concentration       VS Time 3-D graph for DH10B. Each point represent triplicate mean. (D) Fluorescence VS arabinose concentration VS Time 3-D graph for DH5α. Each point        represent triplicate mean.
The OD600 value reflects cell concentration. OD600 for both strain in different arabinose concentration increased exponentially. Growth rate for cells without  arabinose induction (0%) was greatest for both DH10B and DH5α. For other concentration of arabinose induction the growth rates were similar for both of the cell strains (Figure  4. A and B). The similar growth rate across the 10 hour period indicates that the cell concentration for samples in different arabinose concentration increased similarly and   therefore the cell concentration at each point of measurement was similar across different arabinose concentration. We can therefore assume that differences in the cell   concentrations have minimal effect on the different fluorescence levels at different arabinose concentration.
Unlike what Groningen 2011 observed in their experiment, ( Experience page. ) we observed all-or-none response for both  of the cell strains. For DH10B and DH5α the fluorescence levelled off at 0.2% arabinose concentration. In the process of subtracting autofluorescence, we got some negative  corrected fluorescence. These region correspond to the blue areas of the 3-D graphs.
Discussion
Groningen 2011 results may not truly represent the gradual induction of PBAD promoter
We believe that it is actually difficult to analyze the promoter’s gradual or all-or-none response looking the 3-dimensional graph that Groningen 2011 team presented. The 3  dimensional graph has three parameters: time, various arabinose concentrations and fluorescence. The graph does not consider the OD600 value which can represent the  concentration of cells. If the growth rate of the cells are different in different arabinose concentration, the final concentration of cells at given point of time can vary.  Groningen 2011 team did not provide with OD600 versus time graphs. Therefore it is hard to tell well there was variation in the cell growth under the context of Groningen  2011’s experiment. Because the fluorimetry measurements, the method that Groningen 2011 used, measures the fluorescence of the entire population of cells, the fluorescence can be   affected by the concentration of cells and hence show a response that is not"

Summary
On July 25th to 29th, the Center for Quantitative Biology in Peking University and Center for System & Synthetic Biology in UCSF co-organized a challenge workshop among undergraduate, graduate, and post-doc students. Our teams (from both the past and present) put up three posters and introduced our projects to other participants and professors. We also discussed with other participants regarding their projects.
PKU-UCSF Workshop
On July 25th to 29th, the Center of Quantitative Biology in Peking University and Center for System & Synthetic Biology in UCSF co-organized a challenge workshop among undergraduate, graduate, and post-doc students. Participants were divided into several teams discussing synthetic biological issues such as optogenetic, micro-fluids, cell stress management, and cell size control. ""The teams went through successive rounds of brainstorming, research and discussion, and then presented their ideas daily to the other teams for further critique and redirection"" ( ""Center Organizes Team Challenge Workshop with Peking University"" ).

On July 25th, Our team participated in the PKU-UCSF Workshop. We put up three posters, and introduced our project in depth with anyone that was interested, and got a lot of interesting and constructive feedback from various people. We also had the opportunity to discuss our project with Director Connie M. Lee from UCSF. Her insight and advice benefited our project greatly.

The DNA products was separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and visualized under a UV light. The results show a successful amplification of GLF.
Future Directions
Each of the gene parts for the assembly of both the AGP KO/inv operon and the ThiE KO/GLF operon have been isolated and confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The primary goal now is to successfully construct each operon by Gibson assembly or SLIC. Once the operons have been confirmed transformation of Synechocystis will be carried out in two successive steps: first with the AGP KO/inv operon and, secondly, with the ThiE KO/GLF operon.

Project Summary
Abstract will go here....
Why is this important?
If we can determine the genes essential to the function of the pathway responsible for catabolizing furfural and HMF toxins, we can in principle engineer any bacterium to have these genes. Engineering E. coli to have the HMF pathway will allow this well-studied, easily manipulated and fast-growing bacterium to live in the presence of toxins released during biomass pretreatment, and even use furfural and HMF toxins as fuel!
Therefore, industry and academic researchers can subject biomass to more intense pretreatment processes – which release more toxins. Engineered bacteria will be able to live in the presence of these toxins and more sugars will be available for hydrolysis and fermentation, increasing biofuel yields from the same initial amount of biomass.
Background
Greenhouse gas emissions and dwindling fossil fuel reserves have pushed developed countries like the United States to explore renewable fuel sources. “Biofuels” are an attractive sustainable energy technology because they can be produced from plant biomass, which includes wood, grasses, and agricultural waste. Bioethanol and biodiesel can be blended or used as automobile fuel, among other uses. One way to produce biofuels from biomass is by using bacteria to ferment the sugars in plant matter"

The homepage of iGEM@home
Website
A central part of was our campaign for iGEM@home is the website www.igemathome.org that is the frontend of our BOINC server and therefore needed to be externally hosted. (To find out more about the software click here). It bundles all important information on the project and explains iGEM in a layman’s way to an idea in what context this project was developed. It also provides a list of FAQ’s that address most important concerns and questions that people have. In addition we also provide a list of other BOINC projects , because the client makes it very easy to support additional projects from different areas of science. Furthermore the website also hosts the “BOINC pages” . These are the pages, where participants can view the server status, manage their account, create a profile and join the discussion in the forums . (For more information on the role of the forum in the outreach you can skip to Forums .)
Video
The second pillar of our promotion is a video that provides the information in an easily digestible way.
Introductory Video to iGEM@home
The video presents iGEM, our project and distributed computing. It explains why we need the support of the users and how to help us.
Flyer
To promote iGEM@home on local level to friends, fellow students and people interested in science and iGEM we created Flyers that are supposed to make people interested in the project and lead them (via QR-code or link)  to our website.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Ferritin Results_-_-_TEXT.html," for differences in the pH values necessary for disassembly of the unmodified ferritin and our modified ferritin we exposed the ferritins to different pH conditions. In the literature the pH threshold for disassembly is 2.10 for the ferritin wild type and 4 for our ferritin variant (Chen H. 2016). Reassembly should occur at a pH of around 7.5.
We therefore exposed the wild type and the mutant ferritin to a pH of below 1 and to roughly 3 using HCL. Afterwards we added purified mRFP or fluorescein in the highest possible concentration so that passive enclosure could take place. After returning the pH back to 8 we characterized the probe via FCS. Initially we wanted to look directly for overlapping fluorescence signals of the BFP tagged ferritin ( BBa_K592100 ) and the mRFP enclosed inside. But the effects of brownian motion and the small size (~29 nm) of our fusion ferritin makes this kind of visualization impractical, which is why we turned to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) as an alternative. FCS uses a laser to excite single fluorescent molecules passing in front of it through a very small volume. A detector then measures the intensity and time of the fluorescent signal which can be used to estimate the mass and number of molecules in front of the laser.  Since free fluorophores are much smaller than ferritin encapsulated fluorophores they move through the small detection volume at a much higher speed. Thus the two populations of small free fluorophores and larger slower ferritin-associated fluorophores should be discernable by FCS.
By measuring the individual times of the passing particles and by taking the average we received a table of times which describe how long the fluorophores spend in front of the laser.  Unfortunately, the measured times did not confirm our assumptions. We attribute this to the contamination with other large proteins who might also interact with our fluorophores changing their average speed despite not being enclosed.
We expected to see very short average times for the fluorescein on its own which could be confirmed by measuring an average time of 0,005 µs.  Measuring the speed of fluorescein after opening and closing the ferritin cage via lowering and raising the pH we saw a significant slow down but we could not definitively say that our engineered ferritin is responsible or if the fluorescein interacts with other impurities in the solution. Since our negative control containing a protein mix which should not enclose any fluorescein we decided to not use the data for the character"

g. Final Shear Stress Calculation
In order to obtain the exact sheer force applied to the cells by the fluid flow. We input the experimentally used flow rate as a boundary condition in our model, which have already been tested before by comparing real-life experimental results with the simulation results (see Calibration ), to calculate the sheer stress on the bottom of the channel where the cells can adhere to.
The inlet circle was given the velocity of 3.1392E-4 m/s and 0.0025113 m/s, which will give us the rate of flow values of 6.25μL/min and 50μL/min, which have been actually used to stimulate the cells in our experiments. And the outlet circle was given the pressure of 0.
The distribution of the sheer stress on the bottom plane is shown below.

Fig. 19 shear Stress Distribution Under Input Flow Rate 50μL/min (log scale)
In order to further show the sheer stress difference under different parameters, we draw a cut line on the bottom plane from (-16, -4) to (-16, -6.45) crossing through three microfluidic channels in the observation zone. and plot the sheer stress on that line.

Models and Algorithms
Overview
   Mathematical modeling is the soul of our magical software ""Computer Aided Synbio Tools"", CAST. In our models, we take into account the intrinsic dynamics of different circuits or systems hierarchically by deterministic, stochastic and time delay models. Here are the highlights of our models and algorithms:
  * We place great emphasis on various kinds of promoters, operons, coding parts, RBSs, terminators and combine regulatory as well as metabolic ODEs and Hill equations in our multi-level modeling;
  * We create a new iteration and optimization algorithm to calculate the fold-change in different cascades and cyclic circuits to evaluate the strength of various regulators;
  * Leakage rate diversity and copy number of different plasmids are considered for better reflection of complex biological systems and experimental results in vivo;
  * What our modeling tries to achieve is to creatively build a bridge between parts and modules in the Registry and widespread experimental data in the papers so that researchers can have a brand new perspective of how these parts, sequences and kinetic parameters are related to each other;
  * Standardized output PoPS, RIPS is generated from our data processing and testing procedures, which represents our goal of establishing sets of standardized data;
  * As the current focus of synthetic biology is readily combining modules into complex synthetic pathways[1], statistical and probability distribution models are also applied to estimate extrinsic variability among synthetic systems.
Intrinsic dynamics

Deterministic models
   The model mainly emphasizes on leakage rate of different promoters, the mRNA degradation term, and the strength of transcription, or called the rate of production. Also, transcription factors, such as repressors and activators, and coregulators are introduced to describe the dynamics of operons. In addition, the target DNA sequence is placed on Copynumber (CN) plasmids and some parameters are defined, for example, TS means the transcription strength of promoters while DeRNA represent the degradation rate of mRNA. Besides, we apply different levels of Hill input functions to model the behaviors of these regulators.[13]

Secondly, we tested the  performance of recommendation. 10 device chains were randomly selected for this  test. Table 3 shows the results, where the recommendation ratio is the ratio of  the number of correctly recommended biobricks over the length of device chains,  and the correctly recommended biobricks means these biobricks are in recommended  lists. The average recommendation ratio is 75.4%. This ratio actually is really  high, since only 24.6% of biobricks are not in the recommended lists.

Exeter,2018,Team:Exeter#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," we met at the iGEM Oxford meet up who had engineering expertise. UCL as an institution has an outstanding reputation for bioreactor innovations and the UCL iGEM team agreed to offer assistance in teaching us bioreactor basics. Subsequently, later in the summer the UCL Team contacted us on social media to help fix a JavaScript site error. They had a problematic js file, which would load a json extension locally, but not when uploaded on their iGEM wiki, giving a MIME error in the console.
Cooperation: The UCL team prepared a presentation on the essentials of bioreactor design to help teach us the basics and were key in reviewing many of our early bioreactor concepts, pointing out key flaws and providing insightful improvements to the designs.Regarding the JavaScript site error, fortunately our CompSci team member Phil had encountered this error before and was happy to share his expertise and troubleshoot their wiki. By using JavaScript within source tags, the problem was solved. Though this was not part of their project, it had a key role in their wiki set-up.
Follow-Up: Everything has been working great since! We wish the entire UCL team that best of luck at the Jamboree, and hope to support them in their presentation. #TeamUCL
University of Copenhagen and Techical University of Denmark
Initial Contact: As soon as we decided upon a project whose focus was on Mars we started to look for other teams interested in the synthetic biology opportunities offered by space. We discovered that both the teams from Technical University of Denmark and Copenhagen were looking at projects based on or relevant to Mars exploration. After several skype calls we determined that a review of ethical and legal issues surrounding going to Mars would be mutually beneficial and began researching.
Cooperation: Throughout the competition we remained in close contact: sharing ideas, expertise and contacts in order to create a comprehensive review of; historical incentives of space missions, the arguments for and against colonization and the ethical implications of colonization and transport of biomaterial to Mars. Much of our contact centred around the need to closely examine our own reasons for wanting to do a space project and exploring the ethical issues surrounding space projects in general. Our review can be read here .
Follow-Up:This review has been mutually beneficial to all of the teams involved and offered a fresh perspective on both the benefits and issues surrounding our projects.   It has been a pleasure working with such committed and insightful teams - best of luck for the Jamboree! #TeamCopenhagen

Cambridge,2010,Team:Cambridge#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Our thoughts on using biological light sources led us to consider the concept of sustainability. Would our lighting be more sustainable and environmentally friendly than conventional devices? Were might it be useful? Bioluminescence is 'cold light' and much more efficient than conventional lighting. Despite this we find it unlikely that bioluminescence would completely replace current lighting and instead considered it's applications in remote off grid areas or complementing existing sources. Our biological systems would require only a chemical fuel source so would not be dependant on the electrical grid. Perhaps this fuel could come from waste products be that human waste or food waste. If a photosynthetic organism such as a suitable alga species was used then additional energy could be harnessed from sunlight. We might imagine a system where a bioreactor in the roof of a house - supplied with leftover foodstuffs - could pipe glowing algae through the rooms of the house during the night and across the roof during the day. We also considered the exciting prospect of bioluminescent trees lighting our roads and produced a 3D model of what this might look like as well as researching the feasibility of such a project.
We also considered the prospect of using our light production in biosensors after a talk from David Grimshaw of Practical Action. Dr. Grimshaw has worked with the issues of contamination of water sources with arsenic in Bangladesh and mercury in Nepal. He informed us that local people wished for a portable device that was easy to use such that testing of wells could be performed by members of the community and a quantitative digital readout would be preferable. Light production as an output of a biological circuit could be detected by a sensor in an electrical system to give a digital readout. Our biobricks could bridge the gap between biological and electrical circuits. Further investigation into the practicalities of this led to the development of the E.glometer
Knowledge Recycling
""He who receives an idea from me receives it without lessening me, as he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me."" – Thomas Jefferson
Sustainability considerations in designing our system also led us to consider the sustainability of the way we conduct our research. The theme of recycling echoed strongly throughout or project due to the desire to recycle luciferin substrate in project firefly and more generally with considerations of minimising the environmental impact of our work. Recycling of physical materials is vital for sustainability but do we treat our intellectual property in the same way? Do we give the ideas we have the maximum chance of being taken forward and used to promote further thought rather than reaching intellectual dead ends? And what can we do to maximise knowledge recycling"

At the end of February, in 2015, we participated in a mentorship weekend with the University of Lethbridge and several other high school teams from Alberta.  We travelled down to the University of Lethbridge in order to improve our laboratory techniques and procedures.  Several of the University of Lethbridge team members worked with all of our team members, teaching us basic lab techniques, and advanced lab techniques.  Our team came away from the weekend much better equipped to use proper methods in our lab.
We also collaborated with the Ted Harrison middle school team during their first year as an iGEM team."

Northeastern,2016,Team:Northeastern#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," cell by preventing oxygen from reaching the cathode to react with hydrogen or from stressing Geobacter, which is an obligate anaerobe. This reduces the time it takes for the MEC to return to full production after the introduction of oxygen, which would periodically be required to prevent the growth of hydrogen consuming species in a wastewater-fed system. Oxygen scavenging also decreases the ability of E. coli partner bacteria to outcompete Geobacter by metabolising oxygen.
Proteorhodopsin
Feng, 2015
The proteorhodopsin used in this project is from marine gamma proteobacterium EBAC31A08, with close homologues found in many marine bacterial species. The protein is composed of seven transmembrane alpha helix domains and bound to the chromophore retinal. The all trans form of retinal undergoes a conformational change to 13-cis in the presence of 520nm light that in turn causes a chain reaction in the structure of proteorhodopsin that shifts a proton from one side of the membrane to the other. Proton export outside the cell drives a transmembrane proton gradient used to power the generation of ATP, a major molecule for energy transfer, by ATP synthase. The energy in entering light is thus used to concentrate hydrogen ions outside the cell. In an MEC, that energy would be diverted from ATP production towards hydrogen generation by the reduction of protons at the cathode.

NADH Oxidase
Our Nox part comes from a large family of NADH oxidases, all of which catalyze the recombination of hydrogen from the cellular energy carrier NADH with diatomic oxygen through redox reactions. This replenishes NAD+, the oxidized form of NADH needed to accept electrons in cellular respiration, and for some species may assist in survival in aerobic conditions by preventing oxidative stress. The protein from Streptococcus sanguinis SK36, identified as an H2O-forming nox,  is rare in that it strictly catalyses the formation of water instead of hydrogen peroxide, which is itself a reactive oxygen species that can damage cellular processes.

The cloning strategy could be the same as was used to make the sucrose hydrolase BioBrick and assessing its effectivity could also be done following the same protocols, but of course, replacing sucrose with xylitol where needed.
This non-antibiotic selectable marker could be coupled up with our levansucrase (sacB counterselectable marker to form a selection-counterselection cassette that depends entirely on the presence of sugars, rather than antibiotics.
Conclusions:
We successfully cloned the sucrose hydrolase gene and inserted it into the BioBrick vector. ( BBa_K917000 )
We extensively characterised the sucrose hydrolase gene on plates and in liquid cultures.
We determined its suitability as a selectable marker.
We have developed a conceptual sugar-based selection system for Citrobacter freundii

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KimberlyChang_-_-_TEXT.html," the Powepoint presentation for our demoes. I got rid of a lot of the history behind synthetic biology and iGEM and instead focused on trying to make the concepts of synthetic biology easily understandable. I also added a section where I went over basic biology with students, by introducing a bacterial cell and going over important parts like the DNA and the plasmid. We have also decided to changed the name of our project to SynFlo, instead of SynFluo.
July 24: Today, we demoed SynFlo with two groups of students. I went through the Powerpoints with both groups and Nicole demonstrated the installation. We unfortunately did not get video footage for the first few students that demoed but we got either video or audio footage from the rest of the students. I tried to reinforce concepts of synthetic biology with the students while they were demoing by asking them questions. The students seemed to find the Sifteo/Surface interaction the most compelling. Some of the students were confused as to why they needed to use the plasmid cube to transfer color but were able to learn the “protocol” fairly easily. The students seemed to enjoy interacting with the E. coli once they were on the surface and liked when they changed color. In the evening, I worked on looking up abstracts from the ACM Digital Library to use as references for our own paper for ITS. I focused on projects that were more “artistic” rather than purely functional. I also started writing the abstract for our SynFlo paper.
July 25: I worked out roughing out the structure of our paper and sketched out a brief introduction. Later Orit went over what we had written and made suggestions about what we should change. She told me that I should work on the abstract last and instead focus on the introduction for now. We are essentially focusing on our paper for ITS for now rather than the poster for the Science Center poster session. Later, I worked on finishing the animations for the traveling E. coli.
July 26: Today, I finished a rough draft of the introduction and uploaded the new E. coli images. I also worked on editing the introduction. In the afternoon, I went to a graduate school panel where Wellesley alumnae talked about their experiences in grad school.
July 27: Wendy and I sat down with Orit, where she went over our drafts for the ITS paper.

KUAS_Korea,2018,Team:KUAS Korea#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," develop synthetic biology can be told it is on an extension of its history so far. The direction of synthetic biology is on the two points; decentralization and convergence. Decentralization is shown through the effort to distribute the authorities of bioscientists. The increases of RSBP(Registry of Standard Biobrick Part), SBOL(Synthetic Biology Open Language) and DIYbio are all the present-progressing consequences. Meanwhile, setting up many synbio communities (such as GENSPACE, bioCURIOUS and LA PAILLASSE) let all the synthetic biological studies collected, integrated and arranged easily. The development of this field is important because biology has a lot of possibilities to be combined with other fields such as space science. However, it is inevitable that the current aggregates of the researches also have some shortages. The basic problem is attributed to the properties of synthetic biology that it uses very sophisticated methods for study. This property causes an incompleteness and uncertainty of all registries. These prospects and challenges are the tasks facing us.
Throughout sessions, participants got an opportunity to encounter a new sector of biology and broaden the knowledge of synthetic biology. Progressing the seminar, they were inspired by this area and showed an interest in iGEM competition and our academy. There were even students from other majors that are not related to biology. Feedback was generally good in that the field was new for them, thus interesting and discussed subjects were somehow related to their lives

Rosetta beginner's guide
Together with iGEM team Technion Israel we have written a beginner's guide to Rosetta meant to help new iGEM teams in their protein design. This guide contains information on how to install and use Rosetta and other useful software for protein design, such as PyMol and Chimera. The guide also contains information on what protocols to use and how to use them, databases to find all the necessary files such as a protein database and chemical compound files, and the use of external sources. Besides all this useful information, the guide contains information on how to process your results and some helpful tips and tricks in general. The guide can be found here .
Secret Message
The iGEM team Groningen contacted us whether we would like to decode a secret message from their bacterial spores. This message is protected by computational encryption, while the secret key can only be accessed from the spores with the right growing conditions. Groningen sent us the spores and after some PCR programs, overnight culturing, and sequencing, we decrypted their message using their software . The message said: “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.”
Interview
On the 4th of August, iGEM EPFL interviewed our team for their iGEM news website. This website is created to bring iGEM teams from all over the world closer together with interviews, teams of the week and photos of the week. During the interview they asked us about the topic of our project, the worst thing that happened in the lab and what our secret is to get a good team spirit. Cur"

iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .

Shanghaitech,2017,Team:Shanghaitech#Meet-Up_-_-_TEXT.html," went to Tongji University for the opening night for iGEMer hosted Fablab workshop.
Fablab originates from a course called ""how to create anything"" by professor Gershenfeld.  Fablab is generally equipped with a 3D printer, a print circuit, the lathes and other instruments for guests to create anything they want in the workshop. The Fablab we went also had some biological elements. It has a series of equipment can be used for biological experiments. Fablab believes that the passion to create new things is most important to gain knowledge . The concept of the Fablab and the spirit of iGEM are so similar in this aspect. The “maker” in Fablab is full of curiosity and has the potential to be an iGEMer.
The main activity of the opening night started with project introductions from iGEM teams of East China University of Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tongji University and our team. Since “the key element” of our project, the robot, is designed for  nonprofessional person, we hope someday “makers” can create something unique using our platform.
August 26, 2017: Central China iGEM Consortium
In August 26, 2017, we visited Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (FAFU) in Fuzhou, where this year's CCIC (Central China iGEM Consortium) meeting venue was held. As a communication platform of iGEMers in China, CCiC is hosted by different schools each year and is organized by students independently.
During this meeting, we communicated extensively with dozens of iGEM teams from all over the country through the poster session and an oral presentation about our MagicBlock project. In addition, our team leader Mingzhe Chen also delivered a special talk to introduce the quorum sensing system. The brief three-day visit was fully filled with project reports from different teams and keynote speeches from invited guests. This is a very rewarding experience for us. Some teams with more experience of participating in the iGEM competition shared their ideas and designs of experiments, which enlightened us a lot. At the same time, we were also glad that we could offer assistance to other teams when they encountered difficulties.
In addition to organize the communication between teams, the organizers of CCIC also invited Dr. Haoqian Zhang, a former senior iGEMer, and Professor Oye from iGEM headquarter to share their insights and experience in iGEM competition. These people have profound understandings and extensive research experience in synthetic biology. We"
