The thought process of our designs
The SmashColi
When we started microfluidic experiments, the experiments required flowing cells in chambers and exposing them to different solutions and so we used the chip that was already available to us : the MITOMI chip .
However for our project, where mechanical pressure will induce our touch sensitive bacteria, we thought of designing a new chip with bigger chambers (to increase the emission of the signal per chamber) and to add ‘huge buttons’ above the chambers to enable us to ‘squish the cells’, thus the SmashColi was designed.
This chip is able to separate the array of chambers in 4, permitting us to flow in different cells and different solutions on one chip. Additionally, an input was designated for every 7 columns of buttons allowing us to put 4 different pressures on each row of cells. One row out of two was deprived of buttons to be used as a negative control.  With all of this in mind, one chip is able to have 4 different cells and for each type of cells 4 pressures can be applied on them giving a total of 16 different experiments on just one chip!
You may wonder why we didn’t just have chambers and press on the chip with a pen or our finger. Well the possibility of the SmashColi is that by applying the pressure through a machine, it is possible to quantify how the cells react towards a specific pressure. Once the cells were ready we would be able to quantify the intensity of the signal based on the pressure applied to them.

Collaborations
An important part of iGEM is collaborations. For us, the collaborations served to demonstrate whether we could feasibly incorporate microfluidics and our system TERRA into the synthetic biology workflows of other lab groups. In return, we provided these other teams with a more automated method of performing some of their necessary tasks. During this iGEM season, we collaborated with the BostonU, Harvard, and MIT iGEM teams.
Harvard Collaboration
Droplet Generation
This chip was designed to encapsulate sodium alginate, calcium chloride, and cells suspended in media in droplets for later use in the Harvard iGEM team’s keratin skin patches. The Harvard team needed to find a way to control pore sizes of alginate, which were used to suspend E. coli and would only allow the desired treatment to be secreted through the pores. Our microfluidics-based system offered a controlled and precise method that would alter the amount of E. coli in each alginate suspension droplet, as well as change the pore size with of the alginate gel with calcium chloride, due to the features of a microfluidic chip. Our teams conducted literature review to design a microfluidic device to provide an solution for the Harvard team’s project.
Version 1
Since this chip passed the proof of concept experiments using colored water, this was the chip used, in combination with the TERRA Adapter during our collaborative meeting with Harvard on August 9, 2018. The chip was tested with biology a total of 4 times, each time eventually leaking before creating a stable stream of droplets. An analysis of the failure concluded that pressure around the chip was ineffective at keeping the requisite area around the channels sealed given that there was too much empty space between the channels and the pressure
applying binder clips. The future chip should either be smaller in overall area or the channel design should be spread out over a larger portion of the chip area. Harvard iGEM left us with the material needed to attempt to encapsulate their droplets on our own for when the new chip is assembled and tested.
Version 2
Following the observations made when testing the initial version of this collaboration chip,"

In this section of our protocol pages you can read more about our methods for cloning and BioBrick assembly.
Genetic engineering is a basic tool of synthetic biology. With the help of standardized DNA building blocks (BioBricks) it is fairly easy to create new and modify existing natural systems. The methods we have used in our project to create BioBricks and to modify, mutate, transform and analyse DNA are presented in this section. Methods used: Electroporation; chemical transformation; Standard, Freiburg, Gibson and 3A BioBrick assembly; restriction analysis; colony PCR; site directed mutagenesis. read more
Production
These are the protocols for the cultivations and the downstream processing.
Before one is able to work with a cell-free system based on biological material, the needed proteins have to be produced and purified first. These methods and the ones we used to characterize our generated BioBricks in vivo are presented in this section. Used methods: Cultivations in shaking flasks and in differnt bioreactor systems with a working volume up to 6L; mechanical lysis of cells, protein clean-up from lysed cells, Ni-NTA- and TALON-columns and chromatography. read more
Analytics
Protocols for the analytical methods we used.
DNA and proteins are very small and cannot be seen by the naked eye. To control the success and the results of your upstream and downstream processes, analytical methods are necessary that give reliable results to make DNA or proteins in any way visible for you. The analytical methods we used in our project can be found in this section. Used methods: Fluorescence measurement; SDS-PAGE; MALDI-TOF; HPLC; LC-ESI-qTOF-MS/MS; molecular beacons"

E. coli OriV
Taken from pSB1C3, having this origin of replication will make it easier to construct the plasmid using E. coli as well as improve cloning efficiency downstream. Chosen because of the high copy number of pSB1C3.
Lac Operator
Consists of the target sequence for the lac repressor protein to contribute to the IPTG induction system.
Multiple Cloning Site
The multiple cloning site of pUS258 and other expression plasmids that we considered using either had too few restriction sites or sites that were incompatible for the efficient cloning with the BB Prefix and Suffix. So we have designed two highly diverse MCS’ that have 27 unique sites amongst them on either side of SF AmylCP-6 to promote simple cloning of parts from the Bio Brick Registry.
SuperFold AmilCP-6
SuperFold AmilCP-6 is a variant of amilCP which was used by the 2016 Sydney IGEM team and originally submitted to the registry by Team Uppsala Sweden in 2011. This variant has undergone site directed mutagenesis to increase the folding rate of the chromoprotein and enhance the blue colour. We are taking advantage of this protein to enable blue-white screening without the need for adding X-gal to the plates. Cloning with the two multiple cloning sites that flank SF AmilCP-6 essentially swaps it with the insert to leave the recombinant bacteria white rather than blue.
Lac Operon Repressor
Codes for the production of the repressor protein that binds to the Lac Operator to prevent expression until induction of the media with IPTG. We have designed pUS270 to have the LacI under the pVeg promoter for strong constitutive expression in Bacillus.

Toronto,2017,Team:Toronto#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the optical density. A statistically significant difference was observed between cells grown in light and in the dark. However, since the activation time was slow, we identified an opportunity to computationally optimize the structure of LacILOV. Using ITASSER, the protein structure of LacILOV was predicted and compared to the PDB files of LacI and LOV. In doing so, an unexpected stabilizing structure in the linker region was identified. Since it could potentially contribute to the slow de-repression of LacILOV, Foldit standalone, a predictive software, was used to iteratively select mutations to de-stabilize the structure of the linker.
Figure 3. Our predicted LacILOV structure
Basic Switch Design:
With LacILOV as a part in our toolbox, we were inspired by the bistable switch design created by Gardner et al. 2000 [3] to develop a light-sensitive switch by coupling two different repressible promoters - LacILOV-repressed Ptrc-2, and BBa_R0051, modulated by the viral repressor, cI. Since cI is a stringent repressor of the switch between the lytic and lysogenic phase in viruses, the reversibility of the switch was a concern. We therefore decided to utilize a version of cI with a LVA degradation tag to improve its turnover. Our cI:LVA is similar to the part BBa_K327018, save the exclusion of a stop codon. In order to assay for the activity of our switch, we positioned fluorescent reporters downstream of our repressible promoters:
YFP was added downstream of BBa_R0051. If cI:LVA is induced and expressed, there will be no transcription of YFP and subsequently no fluorescence emission will be measured at  528nm. mCherry was added downstream of Ptrc-2: LacILOV-mCherry was submitted as BBa_K2469003. In the absence of blue light, LacILOV (which is constitutively expressed) will bind to the Ptrc-2 promoter and inhibit transcription. No fluorescence at 610nm will be observed.

What is your primary source of information about synthetic biology?
As we can see,
How would you rate the quality of this information?
The respondents rated information highly for accuracy (although perhaps this is to be expected as it is unlikely one would continue to read information from a source which regularly got the facts wrong). Relevance also scored highly, showing that people feel synthetic biology has a sufficient impact on their lives that they ought to be kept informed about it. The high score for availability is likely due to the heavy reliance on online information, however it is probable that this reliance also contributes to the relatively low scores for independence and accessibility. The sources accessed by the public online may well not be aimed at laymen but intended to be read by students or professionals and so may contain a high level of technical detail not accessible to the lay public.
How informed about synthetic biology do you feel?
The graph shows that...
How do you feel about the social/ethical implications of synthetic biology?
This graph shows that the majority of people have strong views about the implications of synthetic biology.
How does your level of understanding about synthetic biology affect your concerns about its implications?
This graph shows correlation between .
Is there a correlation between attitude and understanding of synthetic biology?
The graph shows an interesting correlation between perceived level of understanding and attitude - those at the extremes of understanding, i.e. those with very little or very high understanding, generally have positive attitudes, whereas those with a partial but incomplete understanding tend to be more concerned and have a more suspicious approach. This suggests that it is indeed that 'a little learning is a dangerous thing, drink deep or taste not the Pierian Spring'.

Safe project design
A main priority of the team was to not only combat panama disease and protect the banana from extinction, but to also design an environmentally safe solution that would not involve harmful soil treatments such as fumigation. To accomplish this, we created a system that would take advantage of safe, naturally derived antifungals.  If our project was eventually applied to Banana fields, several modifications would be implemented. First, instead of using E.coli as we did for proof of concept, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens would be chosen as the chassis because of its soil compatibility. Moreover, the target of our transgenic bacteria would be the pathogenic F. oxysporum, the perpetrator of panama disease. In terms of our metal sequestration project, which was designed for outreach applications, the University of Maryland’s department for environmental safety was consulted for proper metal (copper, lead and zinc) disposal.
Safe lab work
To commit to the lab safety lifestyle, we enforce strict lab policies and practices ranging from waste disposal to lab techniques. Before the beginning of the summer term, each lab member completed Chemical Hygiene training and Biohazard safety training through UMD’s department of environmental safety and an additional, specific iGEM training session lead by the lab coordinator, Jacob Premo. During this training several important lab protocols were taught such as, transformation, colony picking, bacterial culturing, plasmid DNA extraction, gel electrophoresis, and waste disposal (autoclave). Appropriate lab attire was emphasized, which requires long pants, closed toed shoes, and protective eyewear at all times in the lab.
Although our team is only working with BSL1 organisms, live cultures are frequently used. To reduce the risk of contamination, team members are required to wear nitrile gloves when handling samples, work near a flame when easily contaminated samples are open and autoclave all liquid and solid waste often.

The ligation products are then first transformed into TOP10 for maximum transformation efficiency. The plasmid are extracted and transformed into BL21(DE3) for protein expression.
3A Assembly, First and Second Attempt [❌]
The first attempt of digesting pSB1C3-Def was unsuccessful and the experiment was simply repeated. In the second attempt, the digestion product was used for ligation, where the gel electrophoresis of the ligation product showed one band at the expected size of 2264 bp. Since the ligation was successful, it was further transformed into both TOP10 and BL21(DE3) cells. Only TOP10 cells colonies were present on the plates. Subsequent extraction and PCR analysis of the plasmid showed clear bands at a size of approximately 300 bp, and no bands at the expected size of approximately"

Although our sequence verifications were impressively similar to our desired constructs, it actually took 3 digestion attempts to fully digest the constructs to produce cells with constructs BBa_K2027044 , BBa_K2027037 , and BBa_K2027038 . While it is successful, the number of tries suggests that our Sap1 digestion with Golden Gate Assembly protocol could definitely be improved to increase efficiency.
Figure 5: Gel electrophoresis results of CPCR of colonies transformed with digested constructs. There are 3 replicates picked from S1, S2, and S3 plates.
It is helpful to note that in our project and in the following figures, we denoted constructs that contain elastin cross-linking domains with a C and a number. For instance, heterotrimeric coiled coil domain 1 is C1. For constructs without the elastin cross-linking domains, they are denoted in the similar style using the letter S instead.
The figure to the left displays the results after CPCR of colonies after a transformation. We expect that digested constructs would be around 900 base pairs (bp). We used the gel to filter out picked colonies that did not contain the correct size of the constructs' DNA (such as S1.3). This was necessary, considering the inefficiency of the digestion protocol, so that we would only sequence colonies that were promising.
After induction of our liquid cultures, we extracted the proteins from our constructs. We kept all protein washes to assure that our desired protein product did not get extracted earlier than expected (we expected the protein to be in the final elution buffer washes). After confirming its presence in the final elution washes (shown in Figure 6), we ran the extracts against each other. To verify the size of the protein, we ran our protein extractions in SDS-PAGE gels. We mostly used Ni columns to purify our protein extract. Since our construct has a Lumio-Flag-His tag, we also used Anti-FLAG magnetic beads, with the help of our mentor Kosuke, to examine which protocol was most efficient in extracting protein.

Project
In the beginning of our reflection to choose a project, we had a lot of ideas in health, water treatment, and anti-fouling but for each we always raised the same issue: Can we do whatever with genetically modified organisms? These recurring issues get us to think about deeper ethical questions. In effect, synthetic biologists modify living organisms in order to perform specific functions like a machine, as illustrated in the word ""iGEM."" But we wonder if these modified organisms are really machines. So our main interrogation was to know how synthetic biology blurs the limits of living beings or if synthetic biology can change our definition of natural/artificial life. Would everybody have the same limit or criteria to define if a life is artificial or not? It would definitely depend on the perception that people will have of this unconventional form of life. To rise all our issues, we choose an artistic approach and in particular a Bio-Art approach. As art is accessible to everybody, we believe that this is the best way to reach the general public and allow them to introspect. Our piece will"

Double plasmids system
(CORE EXPERIMENT)
β-glucosidase is used to deglycosylate saponin of notoginseng. Our Lab have a PET-28a plasmid withβ-glucosidase gene and LacI gene. The transcription of β-glucosidase is repressed by LacI protein. But lactose and IPTG can induce the expression of LacI protein. We used a 3L fermentation tank to conduct preliminary experiments, then the enzyme was extracted from bacteria solution using glycine buffer. The result showed us that extracted solution has strong ability to hydrolyze glycosyl. However, there’s no lactose in notoginseng solid medium. In order to reduce costs, another plasmid psb1C3 which contains T7 RNA Polymerase gene and was transformed into E.coli.  Psb1C3 contains T7 RNA Polymerase gene and can be regulated by pBAD. This double-plasmid system is expected to be regulated by pPAD, and expresses a large number of T7RNA polymerase to inhibit the effect of LacI repression, switch on the expression ofβ-glucosidase. It’s been reported in bibliography that the cellwall of notoginseng contains a certain concentration of arabinose. Our ultimate goal is using notoginseng to provide nutrients for E.coli in a solid state fermentation jar, E.coli can deglycosylate saponin of notoginseng as well.
Bi-induction experiments
We used lactose and arabinose as Inducer, PNPG as substrate of the enzyme to conduct bi-induction experiments. When PNPG lose its glucose, the remaining part, p-Nitrophenol would present yellow. Then the A450 of bacteria solution was measured by microplate reader. The value of A450 is proportional to enzyme activity. Contrary to expectation, enzyme activity was inversely proportional to lactose and arabinose concentration, and it’s been proved by repeated trials.We use product inhibition to explain this phenomenon. That is because breakdown products of PNPG contain a lot of monosaccharide which may inhibit hydrolysis reaction of β-glucosidase.

We couldn't really see mycelium at the beginning, and we could not see cells when we attempted to count them, possibly due to our mycelium being too old or having depleted its media. We made a new culture with a blended cell mass and ampicillin. We also made more CYM plates and media, and prepared a plan to test the sensitivity of G. lucidum to antibiotics and antifungals.
Miniprepped PtrpC + T7 polymerase, the PpelA, the Anderson promoter, and the Anderson promoter + T7 polymerase. We are preparing to send pC13BN to sequencing. A Vent PCR was done on pC13CB to verify successful cloning. We began a new transformation attempt, now with fresh solutions to work with. However, this also seemed unsuccessful. We also ran a Vent PCR with the addition of MgSO4 for pC13AF, pC13CV, pC13I and pC13L minipreps--they all failed. Another Vent PCR was run to check inserts in pC13BC, pC13BV, and pC13CE, but resulted in no bands.

We quantified digestions and ligated pC13BQ + pC13BN, pC13Y + pC13BN, pC13BR + pC13BN, and pC13CD + pC13BN. We electroporated the ligations. We miniprepped pC13CK cultures and ran digest screen, which was successful. The construct is correct. We ran a PCR to append cut sites to pSB1C3 for digestion and ligation with holin, which was unsuccessful. The pC13AY, pA13AM, and pA13AW preps were digested with EcoRI and PstI and run on a gel. Results indicate that pC13AY and some of the pA13AW colonies worked. The gel of Vent PCR of pC13CB did not turn out too well. We got a bunch of lanes with smeared rather than distinct bands. We then ligated and transformed T7 promoter with mRFP to obtain pAK13AO and PgpdA with GFP to create pC13CF. We ran a Q5 PCR and gel for pC13AF, pC13CV, pC13I and pC13L.

Thus our total carbon footprint of travelling is roughly 49 tonnes of CO2.
Regarding our wiki, we have received help from our sponsors CO2 Neutral Website in calculating the carbon footprint. They estimated roughly 10,000 views during the next year, but sponsored carbon elimination equivalent to 120,000 views. All in all the sponsorship from CO2 Neutral Website has made our wiki net CO2 negative.
We received a spreadsheet from TU-Dresden to estimate our carbon footprint from our lab Go Green Guide . The carbon footprint calculated from our lab is estimated at a total of 1 tonne of CO2.
Thus our total carbon footprint is roughly 50 tonnes CO2
Our Solution
To reduce our net carbon footprint we have made some local and one global initiative. The local initiatives are planting trees, buying green and travelling green. After thorough systematic research we could conclude that in general planting grass and most trees would increase our net carbon footprint, so we planted a few apple trees Carbon sequestration of trees Global warming and lawns Carbon sequestration in turfgrass .
Acknowledging this is not even cents on the dollar, we had to do more. Therefore some of the team changed their eating habits into a more local, organic and sustainable diet. The main focus of this diet was that a majority of the vegetables had to be local and should be picked up on nearby farms. For this reason one of the teammates signed up for “Odense Food Community” Odense Food Community (translated) .
The last element of the local initiatives was to travel green. In general the team has been travelling by bike or public transport when going to and from the university. For the purpose of travelling to every meetup, we have been driving in vans, leaving very little carbon footprint. Had we been able to go to Boston in a more eco-friendly way, we of course would.
Regarding global initiatives we started a partnership with CO2 Neutral Website, which ended up in a sponsorship from them. What they have done in our name is
Build energy efficient stoves for families in Africa, reducing CO2 emissions as less trees are logged. It also creates local jobs and creates a healthier life. Certified and audited through the Gold Standard.
Build boreholes for clean water instead of families boiling water. This also improves quality of life and reduces CO2 emission. Certified and audited through the Gold Standard.

LambertGA,2016,Team:LambertGA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," protease. Because this pathway is the most common form of proteolysis in prokaryotes, we decided to exploit this pathway to control the overexpression of pigments in biosensors.
ClpXP is classified as an ATP dependent protease (ATPase) that harnesses energy released from ATP hydrolysis to render protein degradation. Moreover, ClpXP is a protein mechanism that is composed of two separate proteins - ClpX and ClpP. ClpX is the protein that unfolds and translocates the tagged protein into a sequestered proteolytic compartment in ClpP; ClpP is the protein that breaks the individual covalent bonds (polypeptide bonds) that exist between the individual amino acids of the primary structure of the protein.
Accordingly, we devised an inducible genetic construct to study how ClpXP degrades SsrA-tagged GFP and chromoproteins. We grew these constructs in DH10 E. coli strains; however, since the DH10 strains have naturally occurring ClpXP, we decided to grow these constructs in Keio Wild knockout strains to accurately quantify the relative strength of degradation. We were able to successfully grow our constructs in the Keio ClpP Knockout strains and one of the constructs in the Keio Wild strain, but due to the time constraints, we were unable to gain any results with the ClpX Knockout strain. We used the fluorescent plate reader at the Styczynski Lab to obtain these results.  Ultimately, the main goal of our project was to measure the relative strength of degradation of a tagged reporter and consequently further characterize a protease mechanism.
Improving Previous Parts
Our 2016 iGEM team used existing Biobrick parts from the Uppsala team (BBa_K1033906) and also the Endy Lab (BBa_M0050-LAA, M0052-DAS). We furthered Edinburgh’s work by expanding upon their experiments with GFP and the degradation tags, replacing GFP with the tsPurple chromoprotein and characterizing the ClpXP system.
We first obtained the tsPurple sequence from the 2013 Uppsala iGEM wiki page. The sequence was ordered online from IDT, hydrated, and assembled with 3A assembly to create our constructs. We obtained the tsPurple with no degradation tag, tsPurple with the LAA degradation tag, and tsPurple with the DAS degradation tag. The degradation tags were obtained from the Endy Lab sequencing and correspond to strong degradation for LAA and moderate for DAS.

Project Abstract
Ionizing radiation and radiation pollution is an important environmental problem that affects many. It affects those working around radiation facilities, as well as, those who are exposed to it due to widespread nuclear disasters such as those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor or the Chernobyl reactor. Penn State’s team project will focus on using a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to develop a robust and reliable biosensor which utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch coupled with a fast-acting reporter capable of producing an easily visible effect. We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters. Our hope is that the basis of our biological dosimeter system will prove to be an effective genetic system capable of detecting harmful levels of radiation and relaying it to those working in the field or an affected area. We envision our system to not only be useful in such applications, but also be capable of further expansion and evolution through the expanding field of synthetic biology.
.
Design
Our project focuses on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor based on a lambda phage bistable switch, and a fast-acting reporter similar to the reporter designed by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team. Additionally a modified version of the RecA protein is introduced into the system in order to provide efficient activation of the sensor circuit. Many of the genes for detecting radiation used in this bacterial system have homologous counter-parts in Eukaryotic cells. For instance the RecA protein used in our system is part of a larger family of strand-exchange proteins involved in homologus recombination and DNA repair. Some other examples of this family include the Eukaryotic proteins Rad51 and Dcm1. For this reason it can be thought that a system similar to ours could one-day be used in self-replicating in vivo biosensors for radiation pollution bioremediation purposes and other important applications.

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

Can-RGX is a nationwide competition wherein four collegiate teams were selected to prototype and test an experiment in micro-gravity through parabolic flight. Through Can-RGX, relationships were formed very early in the year between members of both teams, which continued to pay dividends for the remainder of the summer.  Cooperative planning and troubleshooting was performed throughout various meetings, both in person and over Skype. Topics such as the acquisition of funding, the ordering of complex DNA parts, and opportunities to take advantage of were shared and debated. The Queens Canada team alerted us to a promotion offered by Genscript which provided free DNA fragment synthesis, which proved integral to our project design. They also provided advice on re-designing DNA fragments which were too problematic to synthesize as single strands, aiding us in getting the ball rolling with our wet lab research. It was rewarding and refreshing to have a cooperative team with which we shared a running conversation and friendship, even for the simple ups and downs of undergraduate research. We look forward to connecting with and supporting our friends from Queen's at the Giant Jamboree soon!

Public Engagement
Researchers
Early in the planning stages of our project, we presented a project proposal to faculty members at the University of Calgary. We took this as an opportunity to share our ideas about the project to the professional community and receive feedback on our system. During this meeting, we discussed pertinent issues surrounding our project such as ethics and feasibility. We continued contact with many researchers in attendance, and as a result have received feedback integral to the success of our project.
Students
We engaged students in the community with the creation of a lesson plan outlining simple molecular biology principles such as the central dogma, and simple synthetic biology principles such as restriction digestions and ligations. We created this lesson plan after an attempt to create a “synbio” option for the International Baccalaureate program fell through - however, we have also included these preliminary plans on our wiki to allow for others to build upon our initial ideas.
General Public
Although the general public is a difficult group to engage, we specifically initiated discussion with this group by addressing the Alberta Health Services’ Spiritual Care Advisory Committee, a group of religious thought leaders who specialize in representing the variety of belief systems that exist within our community.

Promoter, Repressor and Inducer Specification
Promoter name: tetp (Tet repressible promoter)
Length: 54 base pairs
Strength with:
Weak RBS (BBa_B0032): 5.6 - 517.5 (+17) RPU
Medium RBS (BBa_B0030): 25.5 - 2323.1 (+259.5) RPU
Strong RBS (BBa_B0034): 39.6 - 4041.5 (+247.8) RPU
(Chen & Wang, 2014)
In gram negative bacteria, TetR represses tetp which regulates tetracycline resistance by driving the expression of TetR and TetA, the latter of which codes for a tetracycline-magnesium complex that pumps tetracycline out of the cell.
Repressor name: TetR (Tet repressor)
Part Length: 685 base pairs
Structure: Homodimer of alpha-helices
Binding affinity: To tetp, very light, 0-1 µl/ml has been shown to cause a 5 order of magnitude change in fluorescent protein production
The TetR repressor exists in 2 states: silent and active. In the absence of inducers, the active state of TetR binds to the TetO1 and TetO2 operator sites of the tetp promoter, thus inhibiting transcription (Lederer, Takahashi, & Hillen, 1995). In the presence of inducers, however, TetR undergoes allosteric rearrangement and switches to its silent state, resulting in its release from the promoter, thus allowing transcription to take place (Aleksandrov, Schuldt, Hinrichs, & Simonson, 2008).
Inducer name: aTc (Anhydrotetracycline)
Binding Affinity: (to TetR) Ka ~ 109 M-1
Effective range: 250 - 25000 ng/ml
In our project, anhydrotetracycline (aTc) was used to induce tetp driven expressions. aTc is a derivative of tetracycline, tetp’s native inducer, which has shown stronger binding affinity to TetR ("

- Reaction: lacI+IPTG $\to$ inactivated lacI
- Property: Since lacI a homotetramer, IPTG can bind to any of the four subunits t inactivate it.
- Concentration of active lacI (presumably at steady state): $I_l(t)=I^*(t)(\frac{K_i}{K_i+IPTG})^4$
- Parameter: $K_i \Rightarrow$ Dissociation constant of lacI-IPTG
Based on all the reactions and events listed above, we are then able to explicitly describe how the concentration of each type of molecules of interest change over time. We will integrate the information we have so far and begin to write out the equations.
The first ODE describes the change of AHL concentration inside a cell. The time scale taken into consideration is relatively short, so we omit the impact of cell division and death. The change of AHL concentrations involves AHL synthesis, degradation, diffusion and binding to LuxR.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Figure 5: The NRPS Designer GUI. A) Peptide monomers can be selected from the NRPSDesigner database. Optional an Indigoidine-Tag can be added to the NRP layout. B) Gibthon interface allows for Gibson primer prediction and download to facilitate cloning strategy development.
Users are able to enter new domains and pathways into the database by providing the coding sequence of their NRPS. After simple validity checks using the BioPython package, a modified version of the antiSMASH pipeline [10] [11], optimized for NRPS domain prediction, is run on the sequence to determine domain types, their positions, and substrate specificity if there is any. Results of the prediction are presented to the user, who is able to manually verify their accuracy and correct possible mistakes. To further improve domain linker definition, a multiple sequence alignment of a domain against all other domains of the same type in the database can be performed using the Clustal Omega software package [22]. The alignment is presented to the user in an interactive dialog via JavaScript extracted from the Kalignvu [23] software package, where he can inspect the conserved residues and set the domain linker positions appropriately.
Discussion
NRPSDesigner Database Compared to other NRPS Databases
While exploring the most commonly used databases for NRPS (Norine [8] , NRPS-PKS [7], Clustermine360
), we realized that most tools were not designed for the needs of the biosynthetic community. The organization of a gene cluster, the relative arrangement of individual genes, possible native promoters or even other genomic elements as available in Clustermine360 can be neglected for the purpose of NRPS design. In contrast, the approach of NRPS-PKS, to include only protein sequences would not be sufficient as synthetic modification starts at the DNA level. Consequently we decided to establish our own database focusing mainly on DNA coding sequences, domain types and substrate specificities. Additional information needed for the customization of the final construct (regulative promoters,"

Firstly, we need to acquire the elements.
We using PCR, Overlap PCR and Gibson to get the elements such as EBFP2, EBFP2N(1-154), EBFP2C(155-238), EBFP2N(1-154):IntN and IntC:EBFP2(155-238).
Secondly, we construct 9 parts.
We combine the elements with the vector and transfer the vector into the competent E. coli cells. After that, we select the positive clones and use colony PCR to identify the recombinants. Culturing the positive clones and sequencing the isolated plasmids to make sure that we have get the needed parts.

Deterministic model
Finding the mean behaviour of the system...
The first step is to develop a deterministic model based on differential equations. Ordinary differential equations allow us to quantitatively describe the system at the molecular level.
Using the law of mass action, it is possible to model most metabolic networks. We express the changes of concentration trough time for every substance in the system. We consider processes related to molecule export and import processes across the cell membrane or peptide production by a given gene or through a chemical reaction. All these terms depend on reaction kinetics that can be expressed as a simple multiplication or a complex expression, like a Hill equation.
Signal transduction →
The receptor CqsS acts as a kinase when there is no auto inducer (CAI). It phosphorylates LuxU, which transfers its phosphate to LuxO. In our case, phosphorylated LuxO activates promoter Pqrr.
Once the inducer is in the medium the receptor changes to phosphatase (CqsSp) mode and the flow is reversed. When LuxU is dephosphorylated, it removes the phosphate from LuxO. In consequence, promoter Pqrr is repressed.
Taking this process into account and given the fact the phosphorylation process can be described as an enzymatic process, we used the Mass Action Law and Michaelis-Menten Kinetics in order to obtain the mathematical expressions that describe signal transduction:
Equations a and b describe the behavior of the receptor acting as a kinase (CqsS) and as a phosphatase (CqsSP). The kinase is produced at a constant rate alpha CS, is involved in Reaction 1, and has a decay rate of Gamma CS. The phosphatase is also involved in Reaction 1 and has its own decay rate.
To describe the phosphorylation cascade, we based our expressions on the model that Liu et al. developed in 2012. LuxU and LuxO are both involved in enzymatic reactions 2"

Achievement
        In 2016, we focused on to control mosquitoes. We cloned various Cry and Cyt toxin genes from LLP29, Bacillus thuringiensis strain. We also constructed Cry and Cyt toxin parts based on option optimization of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Meanwhile, we built toxin groups express device based on 2A peptide system. And we tested their toxicity to the larvae of various genus of mosquitoes under the safe lab environment. Considering the potential problems in the natural environment, BNU-China and ZJU-China helped us to build the growth and toxicity model to estimate the natural conditions. To introduce the practical knowledge about how to prevent and control mosquitoes, we designed a handbook covering this topic and sent it to Zambia to help local people who are trouble in mosquitoes. We are proud of our project!"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"

We did again a yeast genomic extraction (C. tropicalis), but this time we changed the protocol:
Pick 8 colonies of C. tropicalis growth in YPD media and resuspend them with 100 μL of solution (200 mM LiOAc and SDS 1%).
Incubate 15 min at 70°C.
Add 300 μL of ethanol 96%. Then, vortex the solution.
Centrifuge 3 min at 15000 xg.
Discard the superatant and resuspend the pellet (precipitated DNA) with 100 μL TE.
Centrifuge 1 min at 15000 xg.
Recover 1 μL of supernatant.
Using this genomic DNA as a template, we run a PCR (using Taq polimerase) with our primers and another one as a control.

9/20 - sequencing was good, will use with blitzen blue backbone
Get the backbone from Blitzen Blue cells
DAY 1 Pick 2 colonies from the blitzen blue plate. Make cultures - grow overnight in LB-chlor. I made LB-chlor plates with ""blitzen blue 9/2 paba"" on them by the RT shaker - use this plate.

DAY 2 Miniprep Blitzen Blue cultures. Perform PCR using Blitzen Blue backbone primers which haven't been diluted yet. You'll need to dilute the ELIM DNA tubes labeled ""bbbb"" lol.
I think there is a 1.5 mL white tube labeled ""blitzen blue backbone 9/1/16"" -- I forgot what it is. I think its a miniprep I did last week but was really low in concentration. Disregard this tube!

9/20 realized blitzen blue is meant to be grown in LB-amp. Wondering why there are cells in my LB culture and what I miniprepped. We don't have time to figure that out, so I'm using Theresa/Cynthia's blitzen blue synthesized DNA plasmid

Genetic Engineering
In this section of our protocol pages you can read more about our methods for cloning and BioBrick assembly.
Genetic engineering is a basic tool of synthetic biology. With the help of standardized DNA building blocks (BioBricks) it is fairly easy to create new and modify existing natural systems. The methods we have used in our project to create BioBricks and to modify, mutate, transform and analyse DNA are presented in this section.
Whole Genome Isolation
For the isolation we used a Plasmid Miniprep Kit .
Standard Protocol:
Centrifuge 10 mL of over-night liquid culture
Resuspend pellet in 800 µL of resuspension solution
Ribolyse three times for 60 s with 6500 rpm (30 s break between every run, 400 mg beads)
Centrifuge 3 min at 10,000 rpm
Transfer 500 µL of supernatant into new 2 mL tube
Add 500 µL of lysis buffer, invert 4 - 6 times

Déroulement de l’étude
Ne connaissant pas le temps d’expression  du plasmide au sein de la lignée DU-145, nous avons réalisé un suivi cinétique de l’induction de l’apoptose en pratiquant un test à l’annexine V toutes les 6 heures pendant 48h après son électroporation. De ce fait, en couplant les taux d’apoptose  de la population témoin (électroporation à vide) et de la population test (électroporation avec plasmide) avec leur taux de croissance respectifs, nous serons en mesure de déterminer l’impacte de p53wt sur l’induction de l’apoptose.

N’ayant pas eu un accès continu au cytomètre en flux, nous avons regroupé l’ensemble des 48h d’analyse en deux runs de cytométrie. Chaque créneau horaire de l’étude est représenté par une population cellulaire distincte. Ainsi nous avons réalisé 14 électroporations correspondant aux 7 créneaux horaires : +6h, +12h, +18h, +24h, +30h, +36h et +48h (deux"

Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," of the plate, RFP expression is reduced nearly to zero; a consequence of a lack of colonies near the center. This may be due to toxicity of high levels of RFP expression under strong induction leading to a lack of colony formation, or perhaps simply a mechanical effect due to lower cell plating densities on the meniscus formed during well casting. A spatially controlled colour gradient? Yes, but lacking the vibrancy we were hoping for.
                       
Fig 5. IPTG gradient plates were prepared as described and plated with ~106 cells carrying plasmids expressing RFP under weak LacI or strong LacI control, grown overnight, and imaged under white light or UV light.
Despite some success in generating colour, switching it ""on"" and ""off"", and controlling it spatially, we were not satisfied with the absolute level of control of expression. In particular, when LacI was expressed under a weak promoter, expression levels were good in the presence of IPTG, but remained high enough in the absence of IPTG that colour developed in the colonies over a period of a couple of days. Raising LacI levels by placing it under control of a strong promoter resulted in better repression in the absence of IPTG, however repression remained substantial even in the presence of IPTG. Just like in our streaking experiment (Fig. 6), the dynamic range of our LacI switch, defined as high over low, was not very good. Ideally, we wanted a system which was able to express RFP at a high level when turned on, but which could be switched totally off when desired. Figure 6 below summarizes our goal, and what we observed with our standard repressor-operator-inducer system. Clearly we needed a way to increase the range of control.
                       
Figure 6. Cells grown on plates show a limited range of colour development. Plate images are taken from Fig 2D. Upper plates: RFP expression under strong LacI promoter (right -- IPTG+, left --  IPTG-). Lower plates: RFP expression under weak LacI (right -- IPTG+, left -- IPTG-)
Time for a new approach: plasmid copy # control
One way to increase the dynamic range of control is by controlling copy number. If we could increase the plasmid count in high expression regime, and decrease or eliminate plasmid levels when in a low expression regime, the range of control would be increased through gene dosing. While a number of copy number control systems have been in use, such as the traditional addition of chloramphenicol to"

Finally, we are taking measures to get LearnSynBio incorporated into actual classrooms: We have established a          collaboration with the high school team Broad Run iGEM (see Collaborations page) to incorporate our modules into          their advanced science classes and after-school science clubs. Additionally, we are working with some of our former          high school teachers to introduce LearnSynBio to VAST, the Virginia Association of Science Teachers, for incorporation          in classrooms all around the state. Lastly, it is our hope that the presentation of LearnSynBio at the Jamboree          will encourage the spread of LearnSynBio to schools all around the world!
BwB
In addition to LearnSynBio, we also completed several public outreach events. We were awarded a grant from Building            with Biology  to host public outreach events over the course of the iGEM 2016 season.
We held a science workshop          targeted at at local children and their parents which allowed them to get some hands-on experience with the exciting          world of modern biology. We had more than 70 people in attendance and together we extracted DNA from strawberries,          learned about synthetic biology and the benefit of standard biological parts, and discussed our questions and concerns          with GMO food.
We also held a forum on the topic of Genome Editing targeted at the general public. At the forum, we briefly discussed          the implications of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool and explored various ways that it could be applied to real          world problems. Among the topics discussed were: stabilizing the Honeybee population by increasing expression of          ‘hygiene’ genes, engineering yeast for efficient biofuel production, and using CRISPR to decrease human susceptibility          to HIV infection. We had over 30 participants for the forum and we received great feedback from our attendees!

UT-Tokyo,2015,Team:UT-Tokyo#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"We wanted to realize competition exclusion system. We chose the system that utilizes colicin. See the system page for detail. Why colicin? Because colicin does not diffuse less quickly than AHL. Short-range positive feedback and long-range negative feedback are necessary for Turing pattern. Hence, bistability should be achieved locally.
Chao and Levin says that this colicin-using system (no AHL effect on our system) exhibit the bistability[3]. We show this in the mathematics page.
We considered two cases.
Case 1. E. coli that emit AHL(shown u in figure) and E. coli that emit colicin(shown v in figure) are different
formula
$$ \frac{du}{dt} = u({\alpha} - (u + v) - {\kappa}c - \frac{a}{a + K}{\delta}) + du{\nabla}^2u\\ \frac{dv}{dt} = v({\beta} - (u + v)\) + du{\nabla}^2v \\ \frac{da}{dt} = u - {\gamma}a + da{\nabla}^2a \\ \frac{dc}{dt} = v - {\mu}c + dc{\nabla}^2c \\ $$ Here, AHL, E. coli, colicin are all scaled, and unnecessary parameters are deleted.
Case 2. E. coli that emit AHL(shown u in figure) and E. coli that is killed by colicin(shown v in figure) are same.
formula
$$ \frac{du}{dt} = u({\alpha} - (u + v) - \frac{a}{a + K}{\delta}) + du{\nabla}^2u \\ \frac{dv}{dt} = v(\beta - (u + v) - {\kappa} c) + du{\nabla}^2v \\ \frac{da}{dt} = u - {\gamma}a + da{\nabla}^2a \\ \frac{dc}{dt} = u - {\mu}c + dc{\nabla}^2c \\ $$ We first investigated ""which parameter set can lead to form pattern"" by stability analysis.
First, we defined parameter range. See the ""parameter""

We Observed the fluorescent condition of T2 cells, decide wether the selection is finished or not.
The Observation result shows that the fluorescent rate of GB(Cas9+EGFP) is high, and selection is almost finished.
But for GA, cells are still dying, everyday many cells round up, we still have keep selection with antibiotics.
Result

Dicussion
We disscused the our instructor, who give a hypothesis to explain the relative longer selection period of GA compare to GB. Which is the highly correlative transfection two plasmid by Lipofectamine.
So those have not transfected with resistance of puro usually have not resistance of bla, vice versa.  As a result puromycin helps to select cells with resistance of bla.

Safety Questions
1.  Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:
a.  Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
While in cloning steps the most dangerous material that we used is ethidium bromide which is used in  agarose gel electrophoresis. Ethidium bromide is a potential mutagen because it  works by inserting itself between the two strands of double-stranded DNA. Since  the amount of ethidium bromide kept in our lab is relatively small, it does not  pose devastating effects.However it is a toxic chemical, when got in contact,  it causes eye and skin irritation. To prevent the damages that we would be face  with, we wraped it with aluminium and put in brown bottle and wore gloves while  using.
While device training experiments we  planned to use methane gas CH4 and methanol CH3OH. Methane  is  inactive biologically and essentially  nontoxic.Methane is not listed in the IARC, NTP or by OSHA as a carcinogen or  potential carcinogen. When inhaled in high concentrations,  so as to exclude an adequate supply of  oxygen to the lungs causes dizziness, deeper  breathing due to air hunger, possible   nausea and eventual unconsciousness. In case of protection, we adjusted  the progressing the steps for methane in glove boxes in order to provide the  respiratory protection. The ventilation is   supported by hood. However due to methane gas is potent for greenhouse  effect for doing experiments, special hood system is designed that could be"

V) Results
1) E coli strain preparation
E coli K12 did not survive on plate or in liquid culture overnight. So we decided to viability/infection of phage with E coli B, BL21, and W3110 instead.
2) Phage viability/infection test
E coli BL21 supports the growth of bacteriophage T2, T3 30, and T7. On the other hand, E coli B and E coli W3110 support bacteriophage T1, T2 30, T3 30, T4, and T7. Other phage stocks either do not infect the bacteria strains tested or have died during storage in the fridge.
Because E coli B is the strain routinely used for the Large Phage Group's experiments, we decided to base our modeling on E coli B.
3) Spot test to estimate phage titer
T1 formed plaques up to -3; T2 -5; T3 -6; T4 -7; T7 -6.
4) Preliminary titer test
The LB used to dilute x2 top agar was contaminated. Thus, all of the plates were contaminated. Although we were able to see plaques, the results from this round of experiment are not conclusive.

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.

Basic Circuits
Basic Resistance Subsystem Model
Basic circuits contain two subsystems: resistance subsystem and regulation subsystem. Models of these two subsystems were constructed separately.
Main processes include induction of the promoters, transcription and translation of function genes, catalysis of enzymes and acid or alkali production led by enzymes. ODE is used for modeling to describe concentration as function of time. Factors considered are production and degradation, combination and disaggregation and reversible reaction.
Resistance subsystem consists of constitutive promoter J23119, function genes glsA, NhaA and NhaB. J23119 is not influenced by environmental pH, and will lead enzymes production continuously.
Fig. 1 Basic resistance device.
Our model mainly focused on functional genes and enzymes. Assumptions we made are: (1) enzymes will only work in proper pH range and are not activated at other pH level. (2) To prove function of our device, initial intracellular pH is set to ideal value.    For acid resistance device (Fig. 1), description of reaction processes are:
Where description and initial value of variables are :
Fig. 2 Name, initial value and description of variables.
Finally, result showed that with application of acid resistance device, pH could be regulated to a suitable range (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 Intracellular pH is regulated by acid resistance device. To prove the function of circuit, initial pH was set up to 3.0, when glsA was activated. pH can effect the activity of glsA, while glsA conducts gaseous ammonia production. With the enzyme activity changing, pH will be finally stabilized at a suitable level.
For alkali resistance device (Fig.1), NhaB and NhaA genes’ functions were assumed as similar processes to enzyme catalysis. Basing on this assumption, description of the NhaB circuit is:
Consistent with equations above, functions are:
Where description and initial value of variables are:

Contamination, Safety, and Chemical Use
Proper handling and disposal of lab reagents is already well-documented for safety purposes, but with a little extra mindfulness, scientists can go the extra mile for sustainability. The practices documented in this Action Area are designed to maximize efficient use of reagents and minimize contamination of samples.
#1: Reduce!
The most important step in minimizing waste and energy consumption is reducing the amount of reagents and chemicals used, which in turn reduces need for autoclaving glassware and media. Plan your experiments wisely to minimize your use of lab reagents and chemicals . BostonU is using the LPA Light Box from the Tabor Lab to minimize our use of media. In using the LPA Light Box, we are able to test our strains using less than 40 mL of media before running a full experiment with the Khalil Lab's eVOLVER, which requires 3 liters of media per experiment. By minimizing our use of media, we not only reduce energy consumption, but maximize the efficiency with which we generate results.
#2: Consider Green Alternative Reagents
You can use online resources such as MIT's Green Alternatives Wizard to find environmentally-friendly alternatives to common lab reagents.[ 1 ] For example, an alternative to ethidium bromide, SybrSafe, is not carcinogenic and has a better signal-to-noise ratio for agarose gel staining than ethidium bromide. However, as with other green chemicals, SybrSafe is slightly more expensive than ethidium bromide. In Massachusetts, SybrSafe's up-front cost is subsidized and offset by waste disposal. Green reagents are safer and produce yields greater than or equal to those of common reagents .
#3: Aliquot From Large Bottles
Making aliquots from large bottles reduces the need to autoclave media in the case of contamination . If a large bottle of media is contaminated, the entire bottle has to be disposed of and fresh media must be made and autoclaved. Reducing the amount of autoclave cycles cuts down on energy consumption. [ 2 ] Making small aliquots from larger bottles eliminates the need to make fresh media in the event of contamination.

Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," reached [4].
Our system is designed in such a way that EsaR, EsaI and CepR are constitutively expressed under control of the same promoter. As long as the 3OC6-HSL concentration is low enough, EsaR will additionally increase its own transcription, creating a positive feedback loop (Fig. 1). When the 3OC6-HSL threshold is reached, transcription of the PesaRC initiates, while the PesaS-feedback loop is turned off. The activation of the promoter is shown and measured using the expression of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP). In addition to the reporter gene, CepI also  gets expressed, resulting in the time-shifted activation of our second QS-system. When the C8-HSL threshold is reached, CepR can work as an activator of the PaidA promoter that transcribes a monomer of red fluorescent protein (mRFP) as a second reporter gene (Fig. 1).
CFP and mRFP are used to test the system and can afterwards be replaced by genes of a desired pathway. The system is very flexible and can be optimized to get the best results depending on the introduced genes. In this model the system was optimized to regulate the Dopamine/L-DOPA pathway.
The Model
While planning our project we decided to model the system with Matlab to explore the range of conditions in which our system would be functional. Modeling also provided a way to predict if the system actually would work as we planned it.
The quorum sensing system model was done using Matlab and Simbiology. The genetic set-up was modeled graphically and parameters were taken from the literature or estimated. A Simbiology-Model consists of species (e.g. DNA, mRNA, Proteins) that interact in reactions (e.g. DNA-> DNA + mRNA). Each reaction has parameters that affect the velocity of the reaction.
Figure 2 Diagram view of the system in Simbiology
The modeling was started at the DNA level. The DNA is transcribed into mRNA which gets translated into proteins. The DNA can be bound by two proteins (Fig. 2), EsaR or CepRHSL2 (dimer of CepR bound to C8-HSL). Protein binding leads to either a basal or a maximal expression of the three different mRNAs depending if the corresponding promoter is affected by the binding (for more details see the equations). E.g., the expression of EsaR, EsaI and CepR gets induced further by the binding of EsaR, whereas the expression of CFP and"

However, our two aproaches were quite diferent. Sevilla’s team focused on velocity and straight-forwardness with a C script that took the input as text files and displayed the output as another text file, a log of the different concentrations of the different compounds over time. Visualitzation or post-processing of the data was left to the user, which made the program more modular, albeit less user friendly. Our approach, Polyenzime, was a bit widder in scope, incorporating inhibition reactions and source/sink nodes, and consisted on a GUI where the user could intuitively create and run the pathways, obtaining the evolution of the system in handy graphics without further ado.
Comparing the two prespectives on the same problem gave us the opportunity to further develop our approach, strengthing its downsides (implementation of a runge-kuta algorithm to make the integration more robust), and reinforcing the advantages (improving the user experience in a variety of ways). We could also interchange valuable feedback that lead to some bug-fixes and improvements. This would not have been possible without intensive comunication between the teams, and we thank the collegues at Sevilla for the patience and support trough our programming endavours.
With the wide array of topics iGEM comprises, finding another team with a common front to collaborate with may be difficult. We were lucky to have that opportunity, and we belive that the project has improved and gained context as a consequence.
In the image we can see a model of UPO-Sevilla’s team represented in our software.

Plates results were not nice: I15 new showed few colonies (about 20 colonies), I14_4C5 showed 2 colonies, I16_4C5 showed 3 colonies and I18_4C5 1 colony, while for other plates no colony was observed, probably due to the fact that our 4C5 (E-P) plasmid retrieved from freezer was too old and not usable anymore. For this reason, we decided to perform a colony PCR on available colonies of I14_4C5, I16_4C5 and I18-4C5, on 3 colonies of I15new and to repeat wrong ligations and the one including I10-1 and I12-2 (their vector had to be changed with pSB4C5). Colonies were saved in 1ml LB+suitable antibiotic/s. After gel results positive colonies will be glycerol stocked.
Colony PCR of colonies picked from plates
Colony PCR and gel run showed that I15-1, I15-2 and I15-3 have the right insert. Also for I14_4C5-1 and I14_4C5-2 the insert was visible. For these parts we decided to perform a NheI-PstI screening. I16-4C5-1 and I16_4C5-3 showed the insert, so they will be screened as before. No band was observed for I16_4C5-2 and I18_4C5-1 (This ligation will be repeated).
Glycerol stok was prepared for I14_4C5-1, I14_4C5-2, I16_4C5-1, I16_4C5-3, I15new-1, I15new-2 and I15new-3. Falcon tubes containing the remaining culture were re-filled with 5ml LB+antibiotic and tomorrow will be screened.
Other parts (I14 E-P, I16 E-P, I17 E-P, I18E-P, I19 E-P) were available in the freezer, so only 3 parts still had to be digested. Digestion of pSB4C5 (E-P), I12-2(E-P) and I10-1(E-P) was repeated as yesterday, digestions were gel run/cut and bands were visible, so this time gel extraction was performed with the following quantifications:

Aquae sterilisata was used to dissolve the DNA powder in kit.                                 After the certain DNA was dissolved, it was kept in -20 degrees centigrade fridge, as                                 well as the DNA powder. When we prepared transformation experiment, competent cells and                                 the DNA was taken out and defrosted on the ice. Mixture of DNA and competent cells was                                 done out of the biosafety cabinet while adding of liquid LB was in it. Solid LB                                 contained 2% agar and chloramphenicol was added before making plates. Parafilm was used                                 to prevent the fast evaporation of plates in incubator.
Details of Measurement
      When we did the measurement. The cabinet was shined                                 by ultraviolet before start for 30 minutes. One person (name C for convenience) took                                 500μl from each culture tube to a EP tube, then gave it to one person out of the cabinet                                 (name B) to test the original OD600. Then, C prepared enough 50ml tubes with 12ml liquid                                 LB in it (chloramphenicol preadded), and B calculated the dilution way according to the                                 excel provided on official website. When the calculation was done, C piped out certain                                 volume of LB and added bacterial culture, then shook to mix and took 500μl as the sample                                 of 0 hour. After the first sampling, we took out the culture from incubator (220rpm,                                 37℃) every 2 hours, with the first sampling time denoting 0 hour.
      Plates with black frame and transparent, flat bottom                                 were used to do the measurement. Since we did the experiment many times resulting from                                 some accidents, we recycled the plates. Plates were cleaned by distilled water and 75%                                 ethanol. Plate reader and relative software was manipulated by a teacher due to the                                 requirement of the lab.
Details of Preservation and Verification
      After picking up single colonies, the plates were                                 kept in -4 degrees centigrade fridge.                                 Bacterial glycerol stocks were prepared with the final glycerol concentration being 25%.
      When we decided to use them, we first re-activated                                 them by plate streaking, then picked                                 single colonies for subsequent work. Sequencing using prime VF2 and VR was done by                                 sending bacterial culture to Chengdu Tsingke zixi Limited Company. Sequencing results                                 were aligned with sequences in iGEM Registry and all of them were right.

NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," would still strive for an ideal treatment no matter how expensive it might be, as long as it can guarantee efficiency. ‘Side effects’ accounted for the second, as cancer patients suffered a great trauma both physically and mentally. If side effects can be minimized, patients will received an utmost degree of relief.
Good curative effect and little side effect for the gene mutational patients are consistent with the advantages of our molecular target drugs, which is very practical and meets the real demands of patients. The biggest problem of our targeted drugs, currently, is actually about the price, since they cannot be covered in the medical insurance system and there is no policy support. In this way, for some ordinary wage-earning-class families, the medical expenses would be a big problem for them. The cost of the new therapies can be prohibitive, thus the patients shrink back at the sight of the price.
Molecular targeted drugs of our team have little side effects, can be taken orally, and are of good therapeutic effect for specific gene mutational patients. Would you be willing to try it if it was put into clinical practice?
Figure 11.
The reasons would be shown at the next question.
Your main concern with the new drug is …?
Figure 12.
Survey results on attitude towards the new drug showed that, only 14.52% holds absolute negative attitude to new drugs, and most of the patients and their families think it as acceptable, although 43.55% said they will make decisions in specific circumstances, and the cost, the curative effect, genetic testing are all the factors that need to be taken into account.
Consistent with the question 5, we could easily find that, with more than half respondents expressing this concern, the largest concern of patients and their families was that new drugs lack longstanding clinical cases. High charge was also one of the main concerns of patients. This showed that there is still much room for improvement and perfection of medical insurance system in China.
Besides, some patients still had doubts about the specific efficacy of new drugs, worrying they cannot receive fine curative effect even after paying high fee. However, 41.94% patients said they were very willing to try, and believed that the new technology should be well developed and progressed to better fight against cancer--even if the price is expensive, it is still worthy to try.
Summary
Our findings are compatible with our initial assumptions. In addition, after interviewing with the patients face to face, we also learned more of the current status of clinical cancer treatment and patients' actual thoughts and real needs, enabling us more aware of the importance and urgency of developing new"

colony PCR for pRB19 and pRB21
Colony PCR for pRB19 gave a lot of unspecific bands, probably because of less stringent parameters. Oculutated 6 ml of TB+Cm with colony 2 for MP preparation.
Biobricks
The PPTases sfp, svp, entD and delC and the indigoidine synthetase indC will be prepared for submission to the registry. indC contains two RFC10-cutting site, that have been removed during the assembly of pRB22.
pRB21 series
pRB21 is a pSB1C3-plasmid with lacPromotor, BBa_B0034 and indC. After the first assembly, EcoRI and SpeI cutting sites in indC will be removed to yield pRB22. After cutting site removal, the native T-Domain will be exchanged with ccdB to yield pRB22. pRB23 has the same genotype as pRB20 but with two PCR steps less.

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html," from the figure below.
Formally, the mutual information of two discrete random variables X and Y can be defined as:\[I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \sum\limits_{y \in Y} {\sum\limits_{x \in X} {p\left( {x,y} \right)\log \left( {\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}} \right)} } \]
And the formula can also be proofed:\[I\left( {X;Y} \right) = H\left( X \right) - H\left( {X\left| Y \right.} \right) = H\left( Y \right) - H\left( {Y\left| X \right.} \right)\]
From the formula you can easily think that mutual information is the reduction of uncertainty in $X$ when you know $Y$.
And when you understand the mutual information, you can easily understand what the channel capacity is.
In electrical engineering, computer science and information theory, channel capacity is the tight upper bound on the rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a communications channel. And by the noisy-channel coding theorem, the channel capacity of a given channel is the limiting information rate (in units of information per unit time) that can be achieved with arbitrarily small error probability. And you can also see the figure below.
The channel capacity is defined as:\[C = \mathop {\sup }\limits_{{p_X}\left( x \right)} I\left( {X;Y} \right)\]
where the supremum is taken over all possible choices of ${p_X}\left( x \right)$.
After you know about all the concept above, now we are glad to tell you that you can easily follow us and find out many interesting and inspiring things in our project. Congratulations!
miRNA as Potential Biomarkers
Studies have confirmed that miRNA expression is highly concordant cross individuals. And aberrant expression of miRNA may relate to diseases. Some studies have reported that specific miRNAs in tissue and plasma can be discriminatory bio-makers for detecting cancers. However, getting access to tissue of plasma means physical harm to the human body. So we turn to the easily accessible saliva. Since saliva is considered to be a terminal product of blood circulation, components like proteins and RNAs which are present in plasma are also present in saliva. In fact, both coding RNAs and"

Novel sRNA-Based Systems to Tackle Antibiotic Resistance.
Project Description
M
ethicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, has been rated by the World Health Organization as the second HIGH priority pathogen in the world, for which new antibiotics need to be discovered. MRSA causes various skin infections/rashes, flesh-eating disease, sepsis, blood infections, pneumonia, and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). In immunocompromised patients, infection with MRSA is especially concerning, and potentially fatal.
""New antibiotics targeting this priority list of pathogens will help to reduce deaths due to resistant infections around the world,"" says Prof Evelina Tacconelli, Head of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Tübingen and a major contributor to the development of the list. ""Waiting any longer will cause further public health problems and dramatically impact on patient care.""
MRSA is a gram-positive bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. Currently, vancomycin is the most widely used treatment against MRSA infections, however it is an extremely harsh antibiotic; vancomycin therapy has been compared in ferocity of side-effects to chemotherapy. Increasingly, there have been reports of vancomycin failure due to adaptive strains of MRSA becoming resistant to vancomycin.
The most common risk factors for nosocomial acquisition of MRSA are prolonged hospitalization, care in an ICU, prolonged antimicrobial therapy, surgical procedures, and close proximity to a patient in the hospital who is infected/colonized with MRSA. However there has been a rapid increase the incidence of MRSA contracted outside of the hospital. The increase CA-MRSA in non-hospitalized patients is due to the introduction of health care-associated strains into the community. Therefore, effective control of MRSA spread in the community requires effective control of nosocomial MRSA transmission.
The increased spread of MRSA throughout hospitals and into the community is matched with increased concern on how to treat and deal with the bacteria. The regional health authority for Northern British Columbia, Northern Health, indicate the predominate mode of MRSA transmission in healthcare facilities is from one (infected or colonized) patient to another through contaminated hands of healthcare providers. They indicate that"

I have seen the land sundered and drifting away like a mangrove lost across the deep blue sea. I have seen the flux of life, the creatures that come and go, mottled as they were. Scampering across the shrubbery of my beard, sulking across my flowing veins, slumbering in my columnar legs. I have seen those whose blood flows cold and adorned with scales vanished, and those with fur take their stand. I have seen tides of ice conquer my domain, time and time again. I bore witness to when fires erupted from the skies as it did from below, casting shrouds of smoke that obscured my realm. My own death I have known time and time again, left to rot within the cold tombs of the earth, oozing within the ancient abyssal pits. I have seen my own rebirth in time yet again.

Neither treads the spirits of the clouds overhead, my paramour more ancient than I,  and neither treads our progeny the trees of these lands. Neither flies the heralds of the azure skies, neither swims the scaled progenitors of the beasts that stand.

I have seen them come and go, as is the fate of all creatures born into time.
Oh these waterfalls that now dot these lands, nesting creatures invisible to the eyes of man. Like a fountain of life, they breath upon the murky blue, letting shimmer again the deep blue lakes. These creatures I cannot come to understand, with mastery over life that the spirits have command. Like the movement of the clouds, or the shining of the sun, their intentions neither good nor bad. Only to their ends do they serve, to not disturb the cycles that will harbinger their end. And now I can reclaim these lands once again, in unison with my eternal companion, the spirits of"

Overall, the implementation of Finding Diphthy project is considered legal and acceptable for the law aspect. The implementation is allowed with some terms applied, which are: not against the ethic and norms, the used medium is qualified, all parties working hand in hand with law corridor, and is not for commercial matters.
2.2. Religion Perspective of Finding Diphthy Project
Biotechnology as an applied biological science has proven to have helped overcome many problems in human life such as food, agriculture, health and industry, as well as remediation of environmental damage. However, it should also be recognized that the use of biotechnology by humanity can have an unexpected impact. Concerns about the negative impact of using genetically engineered products on social and religious impacts, occur in the application of biotechnology such as cloned misuse.
The most prominent scientist of this century Albert Einstein states ""Religion without science is blind. Science without religion is paralyzed."" Einstein's statement is advice to scientists, and for all of us, that the development of science needs to pay attention to religious values. Indonesia is an archipelago country full of wealth and diversity of natural resources, culture, race, regional languages, and religion. In Indonesia there are several religions such as Islam, Christianity, Catholicism, Hinduism and Buddhism. We conducted a study on the views of religious leaders on our project so that our project does not cross social and religious boundaries and is expected to be accepted by the community, especially the Indonesian people.
Religion View Discussion session with Christian Spiritual Leader, Ps. Raditya Oloan
We have conducted interviews with leaders of Islam, Christianity, Catholicism, Hinduism and Buddhism. From the results of the interview, it can be concluded that genetic engineering and especially Finding Diphthy project is allowed as long as it does not endanger the existence of a living creature and has benefits for many people. These are the two conditions needs to be fulfilled in order to be accepted from religion’s perspective. For this project, it is necessary to use human genes because diphtheria bacteria attack human body cells and then put them into bacteria so that they can be reproduced, this project is acceptable as long as it can fulfill both conditions. Moreover, the human gene that we used is not obtained by taking itself from humans, but through the services of suppliers by creating synthetic genes. Information regarding the supplier’s raw material is still classified, but it is ensured the method does not harm any living being.

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," fused with the \(\omega\) subunit is 4374bp (see BioBrick BBa_K1723000 ), the total number of amino acids composing the protein is 1458. This gives finally a production rate of 0.49-0.86 protein transcript per minute.
In S. cerevisiae, the polypeptide chain elongation rate is estimated to be 5.5-9.3 amino acids per second [9]. Since the DNA coding for dCas9 fused with the VP64 subunit is 4323bp (see BioBrick BBa_K1723021 ), we find an production rate of 0.23-0.39 protein transcript per minute.
However, the chain elongation gives only an initial lag and thus it will be neglected in our model; what is important is the rate of transcription initiation, which can be found in Ref. [12] for E. coli and in Ref. [] for S. cerevisiae.
In order to find GFP production rates, we follow exactly the same procedure we used for dCas9. The GFP used in E. coli is 717bp, while the GFP used in S. cerevisiae is 714bp.
For GFP degradation we consider the GFP(mut3) half-life time (BioNumber 105191) and we computed the degradation rate in the same way we did for mRNAs. Since GFP degradation rate is slow, it will be neglected and we will consider only the dilution rate. Dilution is estimated from the half-life of our organism. For E. coli we have a division every 40 min [14], while for S. cerevisiae we have a division every 1-2 hours (BioNumber 108255).
For dCas9 we weren't able to find a satisfactory degradation rate. However, it turns out that dCas9 degrade slowly [13] and again we decided to neglect this degradation compared to dilution.
Equations
In the following text we will call, for simplicity, dCas9 our dCas9 protein fused with the RNA polymerase recruiting unit. This unit is called \(\omega\) in E. coli and VP64 in S. cerevisiae.
Activation
Our activation model consists of a simple transistor that takes a dCas9-gRNA complex as an input (A) and produces a gRNA (C). The dCas9-gRNA complex enhances the production of the output C, which is otherwise produced basally. In our experimental setup, deigned to asses the functionality of our transistor-like elements, the output C is"

Transeq
It is not difficult to make protein sequence from nucleotide sequence. With codon table, we can make protein sequence manually without any special ability. To translate long nucleotide sequence, however, is not easy. Therefore, we used Transeq to virtually translate given nucleotides sequence. Transeq also do virtual-translation with shifted reading frame or non-transitional translation code tables like mitochondrial translation code table.

Modeller
Modeller is the program to predict the structure of protein with given peptide sequence based on the homology model. When given query sequence, Modeller searches for the similar sequence from database sequence whose structure is known. It assumes that similar sequences have similar structures and predicts the structure of query protein as the combination of known structure with similar sequence. This method is very useful for prediction of single chain antibodies because the structures of many original antibodies are known.

Matt
It is also possible to compare the structures between FGF binding domain of FGFR and single chain antibodies by using Modeller manually, but it is not quantitative and estimated by the rule of thumb. So, the result is not useful for further analysis. We used Matt to compare the structures of FGF binding domain of FGFR and single chain antibodies. Matt uses algorithms to maximize shared structure with small translation and rotations. Matt provides quantitative results to enable estimation of similarity and aligned structures of proteins to visualize the alignment.

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#testing#project#hprac#1_-_-_TEXT.html," conclusion that scientists should focus on four major areas of risk assessment: altered physiology, competition and biodiversity, evolutionary prediction, and gene transfer.
The Woodrow Wilson Center’s Synthetic Biology Project recommended that CEA be applied to more developed projects that were approaching field deployment in order to evaluate it as a risk-assessment approach for synthetic biology at large. This is where we come in: can CEA be successfully used to evaluate the risks of our field-deployable device? What are its limitations?
We began by attempting to apply the Synthetic Biology Project’s modified guidelines for prioritizing research questions to our own project as it currently stands.
Altered Physiology
The current versions of our genetically modified strains have a membrane protein in the Mtr pathway for anaerobic respiration knocked out and complemented on a plasmid. They differ from wild-type Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in that their capacity for anaerobic respiration is upregulated in the presence of analyte (arsenic or naphthalene). This plasmid appears to be producing mtrB in a fully functional form that successfully completes the anaerobic respiration pathway when induced. One important difference is that when uninduced, the bacteria loses much of its anaerobic respiratory activity, and must rely significantly more on aerobic respiration; this is further discussed below.
In addition, our salicylate reporter strain contains the nah operon, which allows the cells to constitutively degrade naphthalene into salicylate. Salicylate, a metabolic intermediate in the Pseudomonas strain from which the nah operon was taken, is less toxic to the environment than naphthalene. P. putida G7 can further degrade salicylate into a catechol, an edible carbon source using the sal operon; this second operon is not present in our cells, so our Shewanella strains are unable to actively degrade salicylate. This means that our cells cannot use naphthalene as a carbon source, a conclusion that is supported by our naphthalene growth assays. The effects of salicylate production on the cells appear to be negligible, but this should be further explored in future characterization work.
One of our future plans is to integrate our constructs into the chromosomes of our strains, in order to ensure that mtrB is not saturating at its uninduced, basal expression levels. This poses new questions: will chromosomal integration alter the expression patterns of this engineered pathway? Will it interfere with other functions of the cells? Functionality can be altered depending on the position of the construct within"
NYMU-Taipei,2016,Team:NYMU-Taipei#HP#Gold test_-_-_TEXT.html," related to difficulty of terminology. In this project, we look into gene tech related terminology which is an important     part in accessing the understandability of a team’s wiki. However, when reading the paragraph above, several vocabularies, such as: glucocorticoids,     cortisol, corticosterone, gnathostome vertebrates, allostatic overload lead to low understandability in their background.
ii. What is the definition of terminology explanation?
At first, we thought the definition of terminology explanation is clear, meaning an article provides deliberation on a technical term. We found the definition is clear and successfully wade through the field of magazines. But we got stranded when we saw 2013 iGEM SDU-Denmark . SDU-Denmark is so thoughtful that they offer clear information when the     mouse hovers a term. As we were astonished at these considerate design, we discovered the information displayed may not be useful for general public:
Technical term
Information displayed when hovered
prenyltransferase
HRT2
IPP
Isopentenyl pyrophosphate
isoprene chain
natural rubber
DMAPP
Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate
We may agree at ‘natural rubber’ is helpful to realize the word ‘isoprene chain’. But it doesn’t look so when it comes to other cases. In real work, since     this design really offer several useful explanations, we consider it as offering more than 3 terminology explanation.
Result and Discussion
We discover that Newspaper shares the highest negative transfer attitude (10%). When we investigate into the contribution of each field. we found that         when it comes to social issue and the field of economics, the negative rate goes higher: 31% in social issue and 23% in economics, market and industry.         It is the technology and development that contribute most to positive rate.

As we used antibiotics and transition metal salts, we had to determine their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) before effectively using them. Fortunately, we worked with experienced researchers who are familiar with antibiotics concentrations commonly used in labs. Then, we were taught that we should use these concentrations :
Ampiciline : 250µg/mL
Kanamycine : 50µg/mL
Vancomycine : 3µg/mL
Concerning our transition metal salts, we conducted experiments to assess the effect of different concentrations of NiCl2 or ZnCl2 in our bacteria growth medium. We tested the following concentrations for both salts : 2mM, 1mM, 0.5mM, 0.25mM and 0.1mM
We selected the highest concentration at which no toxicity could be observed through the experiment, 0.25mM for both salts. We used this concentration for all manipulations onwards.
Control of the basic material :
Plasmids (pIV* and pIV WT)
The pPro30 vector is used for the expression of the wild-type and the mutated pIV porin. The insertion of the gene is performed in the multiclonal site downstream of the PprpB promoter. Selection pressure is provided by the ampicillin resistance gene (AmpR). The propionate operon promoter, PprpB, is regulated by the positive regulator, prpR. This system induces the expression of the porin in the presence of propionate (0,5 mM) and suppresses the expression when adding glucose (1%).
Figure 1: Representation of the pPro30 vector used for the expression of the pIV porin
Analysis of the pIV WT and PIV* constructs
To check the quality of these constructs, we performed a restriction reaction with HindIII. This restriction enzyme is expected to give 2 fragments when cutting the plasmids, one at 3917bp and the other at 2789bp (see figure 1).
As expected, we obtained these two bands for each construct after restriction (see figure 2).

Restriction product purification
For restriction products containing more than one large fragment follow the first 3 steps of the Gel isolation protocol.
When restriction yields only one large fragment, add an equal volume of Membrane Binding Solution to the volume of restriction product.
Pre-warm an aliquot of Nuclease-free water at 50-65ºC.
Insert SV Minicolumn into Collection Tube and label both of them according to the labelling of your samples.
Transfer the dissolved gel mixture to the Minicolumn assembly. Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.
NOTE: When pipetting into the column, aim the pipette to the wall not the membrane to avoid damaging it.
Centrifuge the SV Minicolumn assembly at maximum speed for 1 minute.
Discard the flowthrough and reinsert the SV Minicolumn into the Collection Tube.
Add 700µL of Membrane Wash Solution (if it is the first use, dilute it with 95% ethanol following the bottle’s instructions).
Centrifuge the SV Minicolumn assembly at maximum speed for 1 minute.
Discard the flowthrough and reinsert the SV Minicolumn into the Collection Tube.
Repeat steps 9-11 with 500µL of Membrane Wash Solution and centrifuging for 5 minutes.
Once the Collection Tube is empty, centrifuge the Minicolumn assembly at maximum speed for 1 minute with the microcentrifuge lid open to allow ethanol full evaporation.
Transfer the SV Minicolumn to an empty 1.5mL tube carefully labelled.
Add 500µL of the pre-warmed water (300µL for higher concentrations or when small amounts of DNA are suspected) directly to the centre of the SV Minicolumn, without touching the membrane with the pipette tip.
Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
Discard the SV Minicolumn, cap the tube containing the eluted DNA and keep at 4ºC (for immediate use) or -20ºC (for storage).

Cell frozen stock
Work sterile! If plasmid DNA needs to be purified from the overnight culture, remove the necessary volume from the Falcon tube before the cryostock procedure.
Centrifuge the 50mL tubes at 2000rpm for 10 min.
Decant the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.
Add fresh LB medium, around 1/"
