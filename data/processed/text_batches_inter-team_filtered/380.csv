City Hall of Paris
September 11th, we presented our project to the City of Paris. Mrs. Caroline Daude, Transport Consultant, and Mr. Serge Orru, WWF France Advisor and Former Director welcomed us to discuss our project. They were very interested in our project and in the fact that we are a multidisciplinary team. When we have our prototype, we will have to come back to the City Hall to discuss of their support for the development of our project. Their remarks also helped us to develop our scenario.
Association Respire RESPIRE, National Association for the Preservation and Improvement of Air Quality, is an association of citizens, founded in February 2011, dedicated to the improvement of air quality. She specialized in understanding the issues related to air pollution in France and Europe, be they political, economic, social and health. It builds on existing scientific and public data as well as regulations to inform, communicate, develop technical tools and build advocacy. The 31st July, we met Sébastien Vray, the president of this association to discuss our project and better understand the issues of air pollution in France.
Breath Foundation The Breath Foundation aims to bring together all the actors involved at the national level in the fight against respiratory diseases. Its main mission is to encourage and support the development of research projects in the fight against respiratory diseases and their causes, thanks to funding from patrons and public generosity. We met the president of the foundation on July 5th. This meeting allowed us to receive expertise on pollutants and respiratory diseases. We also validated the relevance of our targets, and our choice to focus on indoor pollution. Finally, we got a feedback on the overall project.
Airparif
AIRPARIF is an organisation responsible for monitoring the air quality in the Paris agglomeration. On August 11th, we met with Thomas Alcaraz, engineer at Airparif, that proposed us to become a member of the Airlab, a broad ecosystem with a network of actors in the fight against air pollution. It wants to position itself to push the structures of Ile-de-France and to develop employment and the economy around the fight against pollution.
Conferences with scientific experts in the field of air pollution

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," structure-based. Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which is featured as the most important part of our program. In addition, process of products generating is not as easy as just creating a new species with specific name, too. Their structures are required to be constructed under rules defined in MoDeL at the same time. The species matching and products generating modules are essential to implement our automatic modeling idea.
To complete the final systemn network from initial conditions, we break up the task to several parts:
Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file;
Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species;
For each template species found matching, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both at the same time;
For each template reaction found possible to occur, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction;
For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied for given constraints, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
Go to step 2 until the end of the species list;
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
Figure 1: Algorithm Flow Chart
Special reactions and volume strategy
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions. The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. It means number of mRNAs per DNA per second for transcriptions and number of proteins per mRNA per second for translations. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminator"

Introduction
In order to test the effectiveness of the recombinases used in our system, we developed two assays -- an “asymmetrical digest” reporter and a fluorescence reporter.  The former is used to directly test the inversion of the target DNA region, while the latter is used to demonstrate inversion induced protein expression.
The Asymmetrical Digest Reporters
The two asymmetrical digest reporters in their unflipped state (invertible by FimE) are shown in figures 2 and 3. These reporters rely on an off-center AgeI restriction site which will yield fragments of varying size depending on the orientation of the inversion region. Table 1 shows the expected sizes of the fragments in each orientation. The differences between the reporters are discussed below.

Table 1. Expected outcomes for the asymmetrical digest assay of the reporters K880001 and K880003.
The Fluorescent Reporters
The fluorescent reporters, show in in figures 3 and 4, have a constitutive tetR promoter within the inversion site, allowing for the expression of GFP in the flipped orientation.

Results
Negative Fluorescent Reporter (BBa_K137058) Data
To initially test the FimE recombinase, we utilized a reporter created by the CalTech ‘08 iGEM team (BBa_K137058) for the same purpose. The K137058 reporter in the vector pSB3C5 was co-transformed in 10-beta E. coli (NEB) with strong, constitutively expressed FimE (K880005-K137007) in the vector pSB1A2.  Despite several co-transformation trials, no fluorescence was observed in contrast to CalTech ‘08’s results.

Project Timeline
Michigan State University does not teach an iGEM course, nor does it teach synthetic biology courses at the undergraduate level. Our team was assembled in mid February, and we immediately begin having weekly one-hour-long meetings to brainstorm ideas for our project. The final topic for our project was decided in the first week of April after presenting three of our best ideas to interested faculty and students at MSU, and receiving their feedback. We chose the topic by voting among the eight team members. Lab work, modeling, human practices, and wiki editing began on May 21st and continued full-time by all eight team members until July 27th. Part-time project work continued until October 24, when our team headed to Boston for the 2018 iGEM Giant Jamboree.
Finally, we'd like to extend a thank you to everyone who helped us along the way!"

roGFP2-Orp1 MICHAELIS EQUATION MODEL
Purpose
In the previous model, we successfully obtained the relationship between intracellular H2O2 concentration and extracellular H2O2 concentration. Therefore, we were going                     to establish the                     relationship between intracellular H2O2 concentration and roGFP2-Orp1 in                     order to evaluate the                     antioxidant function signal output of our entire system.
Model Hypothesis
1. The roGFP2-Orp1 is a fusion protein, and Orp1 is a catalase. Therefore, the reaction process of                     the protein with H2O2 can be considered as a classical enzymatic reaction                     meaning that this                     reaction is a  roGFP2-Orp1 Michaelis equation Model, and the oxidation state of roGFP2 is one of the reaction products.
2. The total intracellular concentration of roGFP2 is constant. And roGFP2 has two states,                     oxidative state and reductive state. And the intracellular protein concentration is depended on the                     transcription rate of promoter.
3. The two absorption peak values of roGFP2 at 405 nm and 488 nm are linear with the protein                     concentration in two states.
Model analysis and construction
According to Hypothesis 1, we consider the reaction process of intracellular hydrogen peroxide with                     roGFP2 as an enzymatic reaction process, which is consistent with the roGFP2-Orp1 Michaelis equation Model.
$$V=\frac{v_{max}[H_{2}O_{2}]}{K_{m}+[H_{2}O_{2}]}$$
Here we define a new parameter OxDroGFP2 to reflect the degree of oxidation of                     roGFP2.                     Meanwhile,"

But that’s not all. Above of all these resources, it is the sense of community that is crucial for the success of these entrepreneurs. The University of Waterloo has proven time and time over in providing a strong sense of community to our entrepreneurs through the programs like Accelerator Centre, Communitech Hub, and VeloCity.
That’s the story of VeloCity Science, and we are just starting to write it.
Safety
All experiments are carried out in a BL2 certified lab. Researcher safety when using E. coli, would not be compromised in safety issues due to use of M13. It poses no threat at all to humans. While, the E. coli strain used was relatively harmless, treatment of possible infections may potentially be affected by the antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, spontaneous mutations which result in increased infectivity may result.  However, measures and precautions suggested by the Canadian biosafety guidelines were taken to minimize even the slight chance of infection. Additionally, the working conditions of the lab is already above the recommended safety level of BL1 for usage of M13 viruses. Every member of the team has been trained with safety modules and went through a week of lab training and continuous oversight from the Advisors and his graduate students in the lab. All lab members, including graduate students or other students that were working in the lab, wore appropriate PPEs and disposed all consumable in appropriate biological waste boxes. All surfaces were wiped down with ethanol after use and all glassware was washed immediately after their usage.
The design of the project does not call for release into the public. Additionally, the project design does not produce any harmful products. Through it is possible that the construct could get released to the general public accidentally. But, the product of the constructs only produce fluorescent proteins and it can only be used in a controlled setting with a certain type of chemical present in the environment, thus making it ineffective when released to the public. Because safety of the public and the lab members is our utmost concern, we have ensured that all wastes are thrown out appropriately and autoclaved so that accidentally release would never occur.
There are no additional risks posed by our projects compared to other general BL1 lab concerns. Our bacteria are not pathogenic and are unable to survive outside of the lab environment, because they are unable to effectively compete with other organisms in nature.

Hey, I'm Vic, an undergraduate senior student majoring in mathematical statistics. Yet my research field is biology statistics, and that is why I'm here.
For IGEM, I'm mainly responsible for human practice and have been giving lectures as well as other promotions on both synthesis biology and IGAM. It is this special experience that has not only made my college life amazing, but also presented me with a broader view of biology. Besides working for IGEM, I've also been researching biology statistics, including bioinformatics and biology networks.
My goal is to be a biostatistician in the future, on which I'm gonna keep putting effort. Now I'm applying for an opportunity to study as a biostatistics PhD. Good luck to me, huh? : )

We discovered that      orcinol with 10% sulfuric acid gives the best visibility,      and the limit of detection was determined to be 0.5      mg/mL. We were also able to distinguish between      mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids through TLC      analysis.
Mosquito Experiments
We met with Professor Fidock who agreed to let us work in      his laboratory. He put us in contact with a mosquito      seller from NYU and a trained epidemiologist with whom we      can discuss the experimental setup. However, the      epidemiologist will not be available until August      1st. Thus, in the meantime, we will communicate via email      regarding the experimental protocol and setup.

Molecular Cloning
We made glycerol stocks of Dr. Jiang's strains and mini      prepped plasmids using lysostaphin. We began the process      of building recombinant plasmids using Gibson assembly. In      addition, we successfully created a BioBrick with a weak      promoter that we transformed into P. putida. We are still      working on removing illegal cut sites in RhlAB operon. We      also began the documentation and characterization process      of our parts.
Transformation
At this point, we have a weak promoter construct working, yet we are still having difficulty transforming a strong      promoter in order to produce a greater degree of      rhamnolipids. We believe that this may be the result of a      metabolic burden. We brainstormed a few possible solutions      to this problem such as using conjugation methods or an      inducible promoter.
Rhamnolipid Quantification
This week we tried to increase the sensitivity of the CTAB      assay by using less CTAB. We discovered that the detection      limit was still too high. It was difficult to tell if the      halos were due to rhamnolipids or GFP already present in      the cell culture. Regular LB also showed halos as well,      reinforcing evidence that this assay should not be used.
TLC was utilized to quantify rhamnolipids first using a      small batch and then a larger batch of P. putida. Using      the smaller quantity of P. putida, there was too little      rhamnolipid to detect. For the larger batch, cell culture      was grown for a longer period of time and purified via      liquid-"

What have we done in the project?
Co-tramsforming Biobricks for creating Customized Detection Platform.
We improve the function of a previously existing BioBrick Lpp-OmpA by adding the changeable scFv with a cut side of restriction enzyme called NcoI.
We built three types of biobrick libraries: scFv , color signal and GBP to display on E.coli’s outer membrane for creating customized detection platform.
With co-transformation, we offered several customized combinations, such as E.Cotector with different scFv of targeted drugs and different color signal or with GBP.
We proved that the binding specificity of E.Cotectors by cell staining experiment. Plus, it showed scFv have successfully displayed on the surface of E.coli.
Our E.Cotector succeeded in displaying GBP on the surface and binding on gold chip.
What have we done more than the project?
We constructed 23 biobricks and conducted a series of experiments to verify their functions.
We designed the mechanism to guarantee the safety on the gene level and the microorganism level.
To make our safety mechanism be more complete, we found out the optimal way to process and the best condition for conserving fluorescence proteins by modeling.
With our modeling, we realized how E.Cotector would grow and the condition of protein displaying.

From Microbe to Biological Sensor
A Revealing Exhibition of Synthesis Biology
As has been done last year by precedent team, we held a three-day exhibition introducing applications of synthesis biology and allergen testing to the public. The exhibition also included direct details about iGEM program, fun interactive activities which provided kids a glimpse of the field of biology.
""How to Diagnose Allergen with Yeasts?"" Theme Exposition
In the exposition, we designed a brief speech in order of ""Approaching Cells"", ""Principles of Allergen"", ""An Overview of Synthesis Biology"" and ""Allergen Testing Master"" to guide kids from basically observing cells to understanding the procedure of allergen and our program's intention and designs. In order to make the exposition more entertaining, we also made an interactive illustration with pictures and videos extracted from prevalent Japanese animation ""Working Cells"".
""Real Cells"" Microscope Observation Experience
Kids involved in this section used microscopes under team members' instructions, viewed the making of mounts and observed structure of plant cell, animal cell and fungi.
""Bacteria DIY"" Colored Card
Being aware of basic knowledge of bacteria, kids were encouraged to tint blank bacteria patterns given to them according to their personal understanding and imagination. They were also asked to write down how they wished the bacteria they ""created"" was able to do. We wish that some of them could really realize those magic abilities via bacteria in the future.
DNA Modeling
After a short superficial lecture about DNA, kids handcrafted DNA helix 3D-model with colored cardboard under team's instructions. While having great fun, kids simultaneously twigged little about fundamental biological facts concerning DNA such as ""A is slicked with T while C is with G"", ""What does a helix structure look like"" and so on.

To analyze the AOX gene expression, we run on a SDS-PAGE gel and observed by Coomassie Blue staining. The overnight-cultured E. coli were centrifuged and lysed with Lysis Buffer (12.5 mM Tris pH 6.8, 4% SDS). The resulting lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 for 2 hours and destained until the protein bands were clear. As the data showed in Figure 2, LO protein was expressed at around the estimated molecular weight of 17 kDa, LO-AOX fusion protein at 91 kDa and AOX protein at 79 kDa. The protein expression level was consistent with the data of GFP in Figure 1, demonstrating the low gene expression level of a LO fusion protein. However, so far we cannot confirm whether LO fusion protein is able to direct AOX or GFP proteins displayed on the cell surface of E. coli. We’re planning to do a subcellular fractionation to separate the outer membrane proteins for analysis in the future.

After AOX gene expression was confirmed, we want to know its enzyme activity.

Lethbridge_HS,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," sands tailings ponds, we propose a solution using multiple cisterns. It would not be feasible to implement our system directly into the tailings ponds, due to the addition of synthetic organisms into nature, and the difficulty of metal extraction at the end. The concentration of heavy metals will decrease as the effluent travels through the cisterns until a certain amount has been removed. From there, the water can be released back into the tailings or moved to a different area to be processed further.
Positive Impacts of Our System
Our system’s self-renewability and efficiency has the potential to improve the removal process of metals in comparison to currently existing systems. Our method would provide a solution to the problems faced in places such as the Athabasca oil sands and the Berkeley Pit, where heavy metal removal is valuable, in addition to extracting toxins out from the oil sands.

He thinks the general idea of a patch system releasing various peptides into the body is very interesting and sees potential for collaboration with his lab
When asked about companies to order from he suggested Dow Corning
He stressed the importance of drafting up a prototype of our design in AutoCAD so he could better understand what our design will look like (not really? We asked him what he used for visual modelling and he said AutoCAD. However, he did stress making a powerpoint presentation to show people we consult to give them a better idea of what we are doing)
Gave us access from his lab to purchase AutoCAD
When asked about fabrication, he volunteered his services or that of the mechanical shop to create a prototype

Meeting with Dan and Dr. Mayi
Contacted Porex for EVA samples - waiting for response
Also discussed with Dan about assays we can perform for both the semi permeable membrane and backing layer
For the semi permeable membrane        
Using a 15 mL falcon tube, we can fill it with overnight cultures and wrap the semi permeable membrane underneath the lid. We then invert it in a larger 50 mL falcon tube with water, salts and at the same pH as the blood and leave it to sit. After hourly intervals, we would take samples of the water and take the OD readings.
Another assay that we can do is to use a brute force method and apply the same setup as the first assay. However we would centrifuge it down and see at the extremes how well our semi permeable membrane works.
For the backing layer
Dr. Mayi suggested creating a small patch with overnight cultures and leave it to sit in conditions similar to those found in the ISS. We take an OD reading initially and then let it sit for eight hours before taking another reading at the end and comparing the growth of our cells. We can also measure the amount of moisture vapour by measuring before and after the mass of the patch.
Dan also suggested something similar to measure how well our cells grow. Using the small plates, we would aliquot some of our overnight cultures into two plates. We would then cover one with parafilm and the other with our backing"

BBa_K1166001
The Fumarate-Nitrate Reductase protein or FNR helps hypoxic promoters to have a more sensitive hypoxic response, it works as an activator and repressor for oxygen-dependant genes. Activity is proven by comparing the expression of GFP (BBa_E0040) by promoters with and without the simultaneous expression of the FNR protein (BAL38390.1).
BBa_K1166002
We assembled this device to save time and ligation reactions for future teams wanting to use the E.coli secretion system. This secretion device includes all the necessary elements (linker-HlyA secretion signal peptide and the expression cassette for HlyB and HlyD) for the secretion of expression cassettes cloned in the 5' terminal of the device.
This secretion device is usable by Silver standard fusion in its 5' end for proteins with no stop codon. Codes for both the proteins HlyB and HlyD (native from uropathogenic strains of E. coli), which, along with the constitutively expressed TolC protein, form a secretion channel. This secretion system recognizes proteins tagged with the C-terminal secretion signal peptide HlyA, and secretes them to the exterior of the bacteria.

An image that shows the process of the removal of lignin and the production of ethanol at large industries.
Bioreactors that produce biofuels, such as ethanol, convert biomass into biofuel in batches; they are a part of a class of bioreactors known as batch-reactors. (Batch-reactors gradually transform reactants, step-by-step, through chemical and biological reactions). There are at least three main steps that must be used to produce biofuels: a pretreatment process, liquefaction process, and fermentation process. To efficiently produce biofuels, bioreactors must separate these processes because each microbe and enzyme have different requirements and conditions that must be met in order for them to produce their desired outcomes. (For example, different optimal pHs and temperatures.)

We constructed the pTlpA-VioABDE-TlpA39, and cultured it under different temperature.
The fig shows that there was leakage of PVA, which was the molecule produced by VioABDE.
Capacity Monitor
We constructed bacteria with either GFP or VioABDE, and with both of them to monitor the capacity of gene expression. The three bacteria strains were cultured for 12 hours with green fluorescence and OD constantly monitored.
From the fig, by comparing the fluorescence of GFP-containing E. coli, the fluorescence intensity rose faster and higher for bacteria without VioABDE expression than E. coli with VioABDE inserted and expressed. It signifies that VioABDE expression consumed notable resources in the host cell and caused expression burden in the cell. The fluorescence of VioABDE shows that VioABDE does not emit green fluorescence thus not significantly influencing the results obtained."

Assessment by Local Bio-safety Group
Laboratory Safety Course
Team SDU-Denmark consists of students from various fields such as biochemistry & molecular biology, chemistry, physics, medicine and philosophy. Not all are used to working in the lab, and so it was necessary to make sure everyone knew about basic safety precautions to be taken when in the lab. Hence our first step in addressing the safety issue, was to have everyone on our team participating in a laboratory safety course (unless already attended) held by Mogens T. Jensen and Marianne Due from the Committee for Students’ Laboratory Safety. This included a small handbook and information on /practice in: good conduct in the lab, use of safety devices, signs used in the lab, emergency cases (fire), elementary first aid, waste, knowledge about the Organisation for Work Environment at SDU and suggestions to further readings.
Safety of our Laboratories
We are using the labs of the Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) and the Centre for Fundamental Living Technology (FLinT). Both are security level 1 laboratories, which is what we need for this project, and the bacteria we are working with, since they are non-pathogenic.
The Group
“Arbejdsmiljøgruppen” (eng. The Working Environment Group) is the local bio-safety group associated with the University of Southern Denmark. During an interview with a representative from this group we explained the project, its scope, parts and procedure. The following is a number of questions concerning the safety and security issues relating to our project, and the essence of their replies.
If they perceived an increased risk due to work being performed by relatively inexperienced students
The project is not considered any more dangerous due to the fact that most of the work in the lab is performed by relatively inexperienced students. As long as the lab's safety protocol is followed, and the fact that the risk-assessment of the work safety group put our project firmly on level 1, they believe that there should be little to no risk to lab personnel or the outside environment. As all students participating in the lab has successfully completed the lab safety course provided by The Working Environment Group, they perceived no increased risk.
If they perceived any danger should the bacteria get out of the lab
They perceived no danger to the environment or the well-being of animals, plants or humans should the bacteria be released into the environment. This is due to the extremely fragile nature of the E. coli strain that we are using in our project. Should it somehow find its way outside of the lab"

Diffusion model
The model about the diffusion of the repressor
The models described on the ‘model-intagrase model’ page simulate the entire recombination procedure in our in vivo system. These models laid the solid theoretic basis for the feasibility of our project. However, our wet lab results are far less satisfying than the expected data from the prediction of these models. The serious leakage of the promoters is the main cause here.
In order to get a better understanding of the problem, we came up with a new model that focuses especially on the concentration of the repressor for the promoter at different site in the cell. The model wants to prove that the diffusion of the repressor results in the lower concentration around the promoter than the one in center of the gene site where the repressor protein  is produced. Therefore, the lower concentration of repressor causes the high probability of separation between the repressor and promoterwhich then explains the extremely high leakage of the promoter.
Figure 3.1 | The green’s function can perfectly describe the diffusion with a delta function source which shows an instantaneous pulse in time and infinite concentration in space. If the time approaches the infinity, the concentration will be uniform distribution ultimately. However, our diffusion model with a sustained pulse can be regarded as an accumulation of a series of the green’s model.
In order to describe the change of the concentration with the distance from the original transcription and translation site in cell, we set up a diffusion model.
Firstly, we use Fick’s first law to define the dynamic process:
The gradient of the concentration is not always constant, so we use Fick’s second law to describe the non-equilibrium state.
Expanding to three dimension, the formula becomes:
We made following assumptions to simplify the formula:
a. The diffusivity D does not change with the position.
b. The diffusion is spherically symmetric.
Then we can get the simplified formula:
In an E.coli cell, we assume that the repressor is produced from a point without volume, which we call it point source. And as we state in chapter III, the protein producing rate will reach a balance with the dilution and degradation rate. In addition, there is a Neumann boundary we should consider"

Best Food and Energy Project
Both Food and Energy define our project. We envision biofuel production moving away from food sources and towards waste products. By-product cellulose biomass is abundant in Alberta through the agricultural and forestry industries. We aimed to utilize this biomass to produce energy; waste, not food, to fuel. The biodiesel created by Team Alberta is economical and viable as a fuel.

Hsinchu Girls Senior High School
Introducing Synthetic biology & BioWatcher at Hsinchu Girls Senior High School
Bringing the innovative projects in lab to the pubic is a step forward to adapting the ideas into reality. On one hand, practicality of the project is examined. On the other hand, it’s extremely exciting to spread the fun and the possibility of solving the unsolved using biology. Hsinchu Girls Senior High School collects top students in this city. With passion, we help the clever youngsters to get a glimpse of the amazement synthetic biology brings and hope to bring enthusiastic new bloods into the field.
On August 14th,we introduced synthetic biology, how it affects the world, how biobricks are built in lab, our project—BioWatcher and iGEM to these brilliant students. Upon the discussion about BioWatcher, the students were so excited and many questions were raised.
Since our project highly concerns health issue, we aim to raise public awareness about the importance of early diagnostics and early treatment. At the end of the session, we gave a quick survey about their blood test frequencies. It turned out that, as expected, only a few of them get blood tests regularly in hospitals and further confirm the necessity of BioWatcher.

Paying our maximum effort to promote synthetic biology, iGEM and the project of our team, we hope to introduce the fun and potential in biology to everyone and bring new enthusiastic blood into the biology field in Taiwan, where bio-industry is less popular than semiconductor industry.
TsingHua Bauhinia Day (campus fair) is the day when high school students from all over the country visit our campus to learn about all departments.
On May 12th, paying our maximum effort to promote synthetic biology, iGEM and the project of our team, we introduce the fun and potential in biology to high school students and hope to bring new enthusiastic blood into the biology field in Taiwan, where bio-industry is less popular than semiconductor industry.
It was quite disappointed at first when very few students showed their interest in biology. However, as we"

Then, we link hypoxia-induced nirB promoter to the plasmid pSB1C3, because we want more iGEMers can use the promoter to do their research.
Then we put plasmids that each has an anaerobic promoter and a luciferase gene into VNP20009 by electroporation. Then we tested the strength and anaerobic sensitivity of our promoters by measuring the fluorescence strength of each VNP strain that has a different promoter after the anaerobic culture.

Measuring principle for OD/F Device
The left image shows the measurement approach for the optical density. The light shines through the sample with a fixed width. The right image shows the fluorescence measurement approach, exciting the fluorescence proteins from below and measuring from the side.
The combined OD/F Device for optical density and fluorescence measurement.
Modus operandi of the OD/F Device
The device is constructed to make it easy-to-handle for the end users. The standard operating procedure to operate and measure optical density or fluorescence is schematically shown in the figure below.

Achievements
When building the OD/F Device, our goal was to develop a system that
easy-to-handle and portable
precise, stable, and reproducible results
easy to build from Open Source parts
combined measurement of optical density and fluorescence
low cost
Commercially available equipment uses lasers and a set of two fine filters, one between laser and sample and one between sample and sensor. To reduce the cost, our OD/F Device uses a simpler measuring principle: it is designed with one low-cost filter, between sample and sensor, and illuminates with an LED instead of a laser. Nevertheless, one main goal was to produce an inexpensive device. Given that, we therefore had to compromise some of the measurement quality, were we still able to produce stable, precise and good data?
Transmission of different cell types at OD-values from 0.001-1
The transmittance data of NIH 3T3 (mouse fibroblasts) cells align with the transmittance of P. putida and S. cerevisiae strains, even though the measured optical densities are lower by 1-2 orders of magnitude.
The answer is: Yes! With the optimal design of our cuvette holder we achieved good-quality results albeit using the cheap filter. The transmission to true OD conversion is stable for all cell types as expected.
Have we been re-inventing the wheel? No! In fact, you can find some DIY posts for turbidity meters such as turbidity sensors . However, a proper assessment of their linearity as well as a calculated OD-value are missing.
Regarding fluorescence, we are also not re-inventing the wheel. The 2010 iGEM Cambridge team actually built a very similar device, the E.glometer . However, there's no data available showing an actual comparison of the data from their device and some proven commercial system to, for example, assess linearity of the measurement.
We made a commercial assessment of the OD/F Device that results in a total cost of $60."

"
Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," at the request of the Trieste team we sent details of an assay that can be used to test for activity of this β-glucosidase. This assay involves 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide, which is cleaved by β-glucosidase to yield a fluorescent product visible under long-wave blue light. We used this assay ourselves for BBa_K523014 .
Wiki Watch
We created a Wiki Watch page that attempted to convey the very basics of what every other team in the competition was doing. Early in the summer, this page was linked from the official iGEM Community page, and we hope it has helped other teams find partners for cooperation.
Updating the Registry
The hub of our community's collective experience is the Parts Registry. During our work, we have discovered some useful information about several parts in the Registry. We have entered this information in the ""experience"" section of the relevant pages.
BBa_K118022
This part by Edinburgh 2008 encodes an exoglucanase, capable of degrading cellulose. We tested its ability to degrade the cellulose analog MUC, and found that it could.
This information has been added to the Registry on the relevant experience page .
BBa_K415151
This part by MIT 2010 is supposed to encode a fusion of the pVIII protein to a GR1 zipper. However, we noticed that the official verification sequencing carried out by the Registry did not match the expected sequence and did not contain a prefix or suffix.
We tried to determine what the sequence actually is, and discovered that it is a fragment of the E. coli main genome. This fragment naturally has EcoRI and PstI sites at its ends. It has evidently been cut with those enzymes and has somehow become inserted into pSB1C3 via those sites. This naturally wipes out the XbaI and SpeI sites, explaining their absence.
This information has been added to the Registry on the relevant experience page .
BBa_K392008
As mentioned above, Trieste and Edinburgh cooperated around the use of this part from Osaka 2010, and came to suspect that the second ATG present in the sequence is the real start codon.
In addition, there are some other discrepancies between the published sequence and the physical K392008 as well.
This information has been added to the Registry on the relevant experience page .
BBa_K265008
This is the synthetic Ice Nucleation Protein from UC Davis 2009. We updated the relevant experience page to mention our successful use of it.

Tuesday
Today was the first day in the wet lab. In the mornig we had the NanoDrop turorial. Alberto, Thomas and Siwat had the meeting with Dr. Sternberg (senior lectures in science communication) who gave helpful advices on how to comunicate complex foundational technology. Wet lab team and dry lab team remained in the Phillips lab. We then headed off to farmer's market for lunch. In the afternoon we prepared the antibiotics aliquot, the LB agar and the solvent solutions.  We also picked up the MG1655 strain lines and Turbocompetent cells. from Tom Ellis -80 freezer.  At 5 pm meeting in the lab with Amrit and Tom.
Wednesday
In the morning we received the parcel with pyocyanin and also the NEB free stuff.  We did everything in the checklist. We make Agar-LB plates. We also resurrected the old plasmid (pBR322) and spreaded the SoxR-containing E. coli strain (MG1655) into plates.  Primers have been shipped.  Dry lab: RBS and promoter strength does not seem to affect the system.  We thought that the general theme of our human practice is communication (exchange of information): Communication between scientists and general public.  Communication between individual cells to form complex patterns Communication between individuals within a team Communication between machines and organisms (computers connected to bacteria)  After lunch, Alberto and Shiv met two artsts from UAL and presented PixCell and proposed the Art exhibition.  We received the confimation e-mail for the jamboree.  At 5pm usual meeting with T.O. and Amrit.
Thursday
One of the hottest day so far (around 35 °C). First failures in the lab: our GFP overnight cultures did not grow. Primers haven't arrived yet and so we could not do much more.  Also  we found out that the sterile loops are not autoclavable... we found them melted in the morning. The modelers are trying to see if they can code the electrochemical model with MATLAB, as COMSOL people did not reply yet.
Friday
We finally received the primers and performed colony PCR to extract SoxR from an old strain, a sample of which was in some freezers in Tom Ellis lab. Shiv, Lidia and Siwat met representatives of KCL, UCL and Westmisnter Uni to oganise a London iGEM Meetup. Alberto, Thomas and Amrit met with Albert Fabregas, a PhD student"

Summary
The aim of our project is to create a device to detect Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). To that end, we have created three series of BioBricks that enabled us to investigate and characterize the function of different pieces of our self-test.
One of the targets: HIV reverse transcriptase
The objective of our project is to detect some Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and especially, HIV with the HIV reverse transcriptase and HBV with its surface antigen HBsAg. In order to test our detection device, we created two composite parts which contain the coding sequences of p51 and p66 subunits of HIV reverse transcriptase respectively.
BBa_K1934060 : p51 subunit  of HIV reverse transcriptase.
This composite part contains the coding sequence of the p51 subunit ( UniProtKB P03366 , PDB 5D3G_B ), which directly comes from the genome of the HIV 1 group M subtype B , under the control of T7 promoter, a RBS and a T7 terminator.
BBa_K1934061 : p66 subunit of HIV reverse transcriptase.
This composite part contains the coding sequence of the p66 subunit ( UniProtKB P03366 , PDB 5D3G_A ), which directly comes from the genome of the HIV 1 group M subtype B ,  under the control of T7 promoter, a RBS and a T7 terminator.
The anchor: streptavidin chimeric protein
As an anchor, we chose to use the streptavidin protein combined with one or two cellulose binding domain(s) in order to be easily fixed onto a cellulose paper.
BBa_K1934020 : Streptavidin with Cellulose Binding Domains (CBDs).
This composite part contains the coding sequence of the streptavidin protein combined with two CBDs, which corresponds to the Stanford-Brown 2014 iGEM team part (BBa_K1499004) ,"
ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Modeling#SPF model_-_-_TEXT.html," above, the SPF is defined as a function of the transmittance at different wavelengths. Therefore we use the absorbance defined by the Lambert-Beer law using extinction coefficients and absorption spectra of PABA and E.coli colonies, the standard irradiation spectrum of the sun and varied the OD of our E.colis and the intracellular steady state PABA concentration. All parameters used can be found on our parameter page .
The figure below shows the absorption spectra of PABA [EC2006] and E.coli [Kiefer2010] , which are used for our SPF computation.
Figure 2: Absorption spectra of PABA and E.coli. The dangerous UVB radiation is filtered efficiently. However, the systems lacks UVA absorption capability.
Results
Figure 3 shows the SPF as function of intracellular pABA concentration and E.coli concentration. The layer of sunscreen is assumed to be 20 μm. This is an approximation of the standard application density (2 mg/cm²) used for the SPF.
Figure 3: Sun protection factor as function of pABA concentration and E.coli concentration.
Figure 4: Weighted irradiation. The data shown is the product of irradiation and erythemal action spectrum. The blue line indicates the radiation striking the layer of sunscreen. The dotted red line shows the remaining radiation after the layer. One can see the reduction of UVB radiation, but the UVA radiation remains hardly changed.
Discussion
The protective effect of our system is achieved by the absorption of PABA and E.coli. Due to the PABA our system efficiently reduces UVB radiation as shown in figure 4. However the lack of absorption in the UVA region poses problems. From the modeling perspective it is hard to achieve high SPF values, since large fractions of the UVA radiation remain hardly changed. In terms of health risk UVA is known to cause DNA damage, i.e. to contribute to and to initiate skin cancer.
Therefore further steps will include the incorporation of an UVA absorbing molecule, which can be produced by E.coli. Alternatively it would be possible to include such a molecule, with peak absorption between 330 and 360, in the medium (sunscreen lotion).

We have formed online collaboration with NEFU since September. We informed each other about our progress and helped each other with experimental puzzles. Some of the problems we tackled together are listed as follows.
♝:We plasmid vector can't be cut.
♗:It may be because of the enzyme had losed potency :
Plasmid was contaminated with protein
The plasmid may be dissolved in a solution that inhibited the activity of the enzyme
♝:What should we do to link three parts efficiently?
♗:Use isocaudamer.
♝: What should we do when we we want to dye the sample by Comassie blue staining and WB.
♗:When you add the samlpe, you should pay attention to the amount of it. Measure the value of OD to get the concentration of the sample you need and then add the sample. When making up polyacrylamide agarose gel, wash and dry the holder. In that way, you can get the gel free of bubble.

We obtained the plasmids from OUC-China at the beginning of October. We used the LiAc/SS carrier DNA/PEG method to transform yeast strain EBY100. The kit we utilized in the transformation is the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation ⅡTM from ZYMO RESEARCH. We used the YPD(G418+) plates and incubated them at 30℃ for 4 days to allow the growth of transformants. We picked several yeast colons and grew them in 10ml YPD(G418+) broth. Then we monitored the growth rate of the recombinant yeast cells to specify the expression of MINI system at a particular living stage. The fluorescence and Abs600 of the four strains were determined by a microplate reader as shown in the picture.
We gave the result to the team,OUC. They are glad to see their results was repeated in our lab environment and revealed an ideal result.

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#test#max#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," rate and passage of fumaric acid from the rumen, which are in vivo factors that do not occur in vitro. In vivo, cattle were fed about twice the amount of fumaric acid (20 g/kg DMI) to cattle as that used in the more recent study (12 g/kg DMI) and, surprisingly, methane production decreased by 23%. However, in that study, only two animals per treatment were used, and methane measurements were made using ventilated hoods, which are known to be problematic. Also note there were differences between basal diets in the studies. This influences the microbiomes and may affect the outcome of the study. The figure below shows the theoretical framework made by iGEM UNL, that demonstrates the diversion of hydrogen away from the methanogens and to the process of fumarate production which in turn produces succinate and propionate. It is known that the higher the propionate to acetate ratio, the less methane the cow produces (Mcginn et al. , 2004).
Figure 3. The theoretical framework of  the effect of fumarate on methane synthesis in the ruminants. The synthesis of succinate out of fumarate competes for H 2 with the synthesis of methane. With a reduced concentration of substrate H 2 for methane synthesis reaction, less methane will be formed. (Adapted from Morgavi et al. (2010))
Strategies to overcome the problem of anaerobic production
Another way to get fumarate into in the microbiome of cattle would be to have bacteria produce fumarate in a bioreactor, and then dry and directly mix them with cattle feed. This way, there is no need to extract fumarate from the cell mixture and we also overcome the problem of anaerobic production. We could try to test different types of microorganisms and see which would be the most efficient and cost-effective at producing fumarate. Once the cells have produced enough fumarate, we, dry them and feed them to the cattle. We could compare the proposed E. Coli mutants, that produce fumaric acid and cyanobacterial cells from iGEM team Amsterdam that produce fumarate and see which one is more efficient at producing and delivering fumarate. As we aim to reduce greenhouse gasses in both our projects, we think it would be sensible to define the most efficient producer as the one that is the most carbon efficient. As calculated by team Amsterdam, this will most likely be the Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria convert CO 2 directly into fumarate"
Peking,2018,Team:Peking#Human Practices#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the area of systems biology. Only in this way can people know better about the system they work on and cooperate better with each other. (张蔚phase视频，网盘上有)    Making low-cost experimental instrument   We find it an essential problem in synthetic biology to fill the gap between foundational research and practical application. We hope our human practice can propose some possible solutions to this problem. Taking our time and energy into consideration, we chose a minor project, the design and usage of low-cost equipment, as the main subject. Most of the results of iGEM research have been achieved in the laboratory, but there’s a big difference between the environment of laboratory and reality use. For example, it’s more than common to use microscope in laboratory, but people rarely get access to microscope in production for the sake of expense and precision. Can differences like this be an impediment of the transformation from laboratory achievements to industrial production? What can we do about these problems? We talked with Professor Xu Luping from Tsinghua University, who designed a low-cost microscope from 3D-printer. We got to know from the interview that most of the parts are easy to get, while it’s also not difficult to assemble. We talked about the possible application of this kind of microscopes and the probability to expand it into fluorescence microscopes. (图2) So far, this kind low-cost microscope is still conceptual productions which is mainly used for popular science or education, but it’s still helpful to the future work. To Professor Xu’s point of view, realizing a possibility in engineering is of great significance in itself. This has enlighten us to summarize some abstract and modularized ‘potential properties’ in our project apart from seeking for practical application of our bioparts. It also came to us that the main difficulty of our subject to build a low-cost fluorescence microscope lies in the cost of equipping fluorescence light source. Fluorescence technology plays a significant part in synthetic biology scientific research, but it’s much too expensive in industry. We talked about the possibility to lower the cost of fluorescence technology and think it probably necessary to try to develop low precision and low cost fluorescence technology, especially when it’s quite usual to combine fluorescence technology with biotechnology now. So we communicated with Dr Zong Yeqing, who showed us his self-made fluorescence stereomicroscope. Fluorescence stereomicroscope is needed in a project but there isn’t one in the institute he works in and it’s not worthwhile to spend millions of RMB yuan to buy one for one single project. So he built one himself. The"

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Biodetoxification_-_-_TEXT.html," with P. putida colonies that have grown in the presence of 5-fluorouracil and add 3 g/L 2-furoic acid. Colonies that show growth and consumption of 2-furoic acid reflect a correct functioning of the HMF pathway.
3) Identify the essential genes in the HMF pathway
After we complete the RFP knockdown, we will begin our combinatorial knockdown of the 19 HMF pathway target genes previously identified by graduate student Iman Farasat. Using double and triple gene knockdowns, we will be able to analyze which gene or combination of genes is responsible for the functioning of the pathway. We will do this using a 2-furoic acid assay, where we will incubate all constructs in 2-furoic acid (approximately 3 g/L) and monitor their growth and consumption of 2-furoic acid over a 24 hour period. Colonies that display reduced 2-furoic acid concentration demonstrate that the pathway is still functioning – we will look for colonies that do not deplete the 2-furoic acid concentration.  The latter colonies reflect that the pathway has failed to function, and we will use these to determine which gene combinations result in this phenotype.
4) Develop a program for automated genome comparisons
5) Engineer the pathway to function in P. fluorescens and E. coli
This is a late-stage goal that will most likely not be completed before the Jamboree. Once we identify the gene(s) that are essential for the functioning of the HMF pathway, we will insert them into the E. coli genome and evaluate the action of the pathway using the 2-furoic acid assay. If this objective is completed, industry and academic researchers will be able to use our E. coli strain to produce biofuels without the toxic effects from furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural killing cell cultures. They will be able to subject biomass to more intense pretreatment procedures, increasing sugar yields and the amount of biofuels that can be fermented from these sugars.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food.

S: Soldier
The year is 2017 - Dr. Davidson is presenting a new technological approach
D: Here you can see the old approach of a former iGEM Team. The team meant to use carbon dioxide and electricity to generate isobutanol. This technology was thought to engage several problems we are still facing. The idea to store the electricity in isobutanol was taken up by my work group for further research. We were able to modify the bacteria strain in a way that it is able to produce significantly higher amounts than before.
P: What do you want to say, Dr. Davidson?
D: Mr. President. We hold the technology in our hands to change the world we know. It will be possible to reduce the emission of industrial facilities, the emission of cars or to store unused regenerative energy.
P: “Mr. Gray. What is your opinion about the project?
G: In first trials we could see the functionality. It will be possible to increase the batch size. The amount of energy stored and isobutanol produced"

As only cells with BBa_K2070026 is shown to fluorescence, it can be suggested that the devices works as expected.
Though we have checked its functionality on agar plate, due to time constraints, we were not able to measure the fluorescence of the Psigma16 GFP (BBa_using the spectrofluorophotometer.
Figure 5. Measurement of ECF sigma16 and Psigma16 GFP promoter activity.
Fluorescence/OD600 of a construct containing both an ECF sigma16 generating device and ECF sigma 16 inducible GFP and construct containing only the sigma 16 generator was measured. Measurement results indicate that there is a extremely significant difference between the two groups. Data taken from the average of 3 samples, with error bars indicating the standard deviation.
Though the fluorescence measurement results indicate that there is a extremely significant difference between the construct BBa_K2070016 and BBa_K2070026, since we were not able to compare the measurement with Psigma 16 GFP, we cannot be sure how much of the fluorescence is due to the activation of the sigma promoter and not the leak from the inducible promoter. Thus, further measurement is necessary to better confirm the activity of the ECF sigma16 and its cognate promoter.
SIGMA 11
ECF sigma 11 ( BBa_K1461005 ) and its orthogonal sigma11 promoter( BBa_K1461002 ) was characterised by Team UT-Tokyo in 2014.

Notice that the parameter for the Bessel functions in both expressions don't need to be the same, moreover, they can be expected to be different since the mechanisms for both are, in general, different.
The final system of equations is the following:

Numerical Analysis
For the numerical analysis, the computational package of MATLAB is used. For the Bessel function we use a routine already built in MATLAB. The evaluation of jv is performed by a numerical method based on Newton-Raphson and for the calculation of the normalization factor α an algorithm of Gauss-Legendre quadrature is used.
For the Malthusian parameter, we performed the logistical regression as specified in {Modern Regression Methods} (Thomas 1997), the data of a healthy culture of Sf9 in the laboratory is used. A logistic behavior is assumed as the following:
(26)
where C(t) is the number of cell in a given moment and P is an expected saturation population. Because of experimental complications, P was estimated as 1.1 times the greatest value obtained of C experimentally.
The resulting model gives the following curve, compared to the original:
For the normalization, we consider different intervals and give several values for the roots of the Bessel function and the corresponding normalization factors for the definition of ψ(t)/Φ = (1/αv)Jv(tjv/(τD-τI)), measuring the time in hours:
Final comments
The average virus production ΦV and average protein production ΦP are still to be calculated experimentally to be included in the model. After estimating this quantities, a numerical derivative can be used to evaluate the derivatives in the system of differential equation with experimental values. A linear regression is to be used to obtain an estimation of K.
After calculating every parameter, the equations from (22) to (25) can be used to predict numerically the development of a given system, from different initial conditions and, from this, find the optimal setting for experimental trials and later escalation.

However, because of the large size (about 80kb) and operative complexity, it’s hard for us to transform this gene fragment into E.coli. As a result, we can just transform three proper-sized fragments to improve the product of avermectins in Streptomyces avermitilis. While we firmly believe that, in the future we can achieve our goals that transforming ivermectin gene into E.coli and substantially producing ivermectin proteins in host cells.
2. New product type.
The development of nanometer new pesticide formulations with nano materials and technology has become one of the international hot research topics in the agricultural field, which has shown a good application prospect in alleviating pesticides abuse caused by food residues and environmental pollution. The so-called ""nano pesticide"" is a kind of products of pesticide preparations using nano materials and preparation technology, with effective and efficient technical, carrier and auxiliary agent compatibility.
Nano pesticide can significantly improve pesticide utilization rate, biological activity, and biological effect, reduce the pesticide applying content and number, decrease the loss of pesticide and accelerate the residue degradation. Our project wants to utilize nano materials and technology to improve pesticide efficacy and safety of basic research. We think the innovative combination of nano science and pesticides is the positive exploration and pioneering attempt in reducing the traditional chemical pesticide pollution.
3. Promotional trap system.
Because of the limitation of time and funds, we couldn’t design a perfect tool to achieve all the goals we expected. In the future, we want to improve the trap system and add new elements and functions, making it safer, lighter, more convenient and portable. We want to improve our device’s termite specificity and make sure that there are just termites which can be trapped into our system.
Furthermore, we have design an application to make a real-time tracking online system. The App is not only for customers, by the statistics of the usage of bite and the frequency of the app used, we will get the information about the condition of termites in our surroundings. This is such an important data that it will be share on the internet.
4. Wider application.
Considering the environmental problems, we need to set our device indoors, which means our trapping objects are limited to the termites which dwell in houses. This is a shortage of our TERMITE TERMINATOR, so we want to improve our project with a wider application. We hope to design a new system which can be utilized outdoors. Based on this idea, we need to do more works in our project’s environmental safety and toxin leak preventation"

I downgraded to Python 2.5, and was able to get all of the modules to install and work properly.  I was finally able to generate a graph via Python in conjunction with Graphviz!!  I also experimented more with Cytoscape, another graphing program that we could use.  However, Cytoscape does not appear to be compatible with Python at the moment.  We probably will not be using Cytoscape.

Spent most of the time downloading different tools in order to get python and additional features to work correctly and looked for a good tool to graphically represent the network.

Team Göttingen 2014
Once a year, an international group of ambitious and enthusiastic master students from the master programs ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" of the Georg-August-University of Göttingen, has teamed up to join the grand iGEM meeting in Boston!
The Göttingen iGEM team from the previous year inspired us so much in their propaganda meeting. They not only presented us the essentials of the competition, gave us pointers as to what we can do differently, but most importantly, they also encouraged us to carry their legacy forward.
Our team is supported by Prof. Dr. Gerhard Braus, Dr. rer. nat. Christoph Sasse (both from the Dept. of Molecular Microbiology and Genetics) and PD Dr. Joachim Uhrig (Department of Plant molecular Biology and Physiology). They not only give advises on the research of our topic, but also support us in how to organise the human project and raise funds.
Let's start a fascinating trip towards the final Giant Jamboree in Boston!
Meet our team and take a journey with us in the university !

Internet Dissemination
As soon as we started our project, we set up a public account on wechat to publish some information and news about iGEM and us. Up to now, there are many followers with many likes about our essays.
Internet gives us a broader window to show our advantages. In terms of public education, a better platform means more receivers. Our public account will run for long time to introduce more highlights to our fans.
In addition, our activities are tracked at the WeChat platform at the student union of the school of life sciences of Tianjin University, for which we are very grateful.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," difficult but critical part of a successful business plan. To make a strategical efficient plan, we have divided the planning in multiple subcomponents.
Development
In the first year we will continue the development of our product. We have to develop the final microlens array and have to test the properties of it. We will among other things do more research into how we can optimize the MLAs. For example, we will analyze in more detail the influence of shape, size etc. After this, we will build our first prototype. To make this possible we will need experts with experience in the field of solar panels. There are multiple research groups within the university that possibly could be interested in a cooperation.  We  would also prefer to  collaborate with an industrial partner. Then this partner would be our first tier and we could develop a strong relationship.
Safety & Certification
The microlens arrays will be produced with the help of genetically modified bacteria. When we want to introduce our product in applications outside the lab, it has to meet very strict and specific safety requirements. In the Netherlands, the RIVM assesses safety applications and it is important to contact them in an early stadium. If we collaborate with foreign industrial partners or if our product will eventually be used in foreign countries, it is important to meet the requirement of those countries as well.
Manufacturing
When the final prototype is built, we can start the construction of the manufacturing facilities. Prior thereto, we have to develop a manufacturing process. In this stadium we also will make, with reservation, agreements with suppliers of production equipment and suppliers of raw materials.
Customers & Partners
To make a company successful, it needs customers. We will start contacting potential customers and partners in an early phase. We strive for a first tier that is involved in the development phase.
Financing
To build the final prototype, implement the product, etc. we have to acquire an estimated budget of €1.2 million. We are planning to acquire this budget with among other things grants from the government, the university, and with loans.
Obtaining intellectual Property
To protect the invention, it has to be patented. We have developed the product in collaboration with the TU Delft. Based on the requirements of the TU Delft, this automatically means that they will partly be the owner of the intellectual property.
Milestones
One of the critical points for the startup will be the construction of a working prototype. Furthermore, the acquisition of funding to construct among other things the manufacturing facilities are very important. Finally it is of the utmost importance that we will find our first customers, the"
Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," has started to become one of the most promising methods to store    information in the upcoming years. This is mainly given by the capacity of    storage that DNA posses; Church, Gao and Kosuri showed that 0.5    exabytes of information can be stored per gram of single-stranded    DNA. [6]
A big breakthrough happened in April 2016, when Microsoft published an extensive    paper in a joint project with the University of Washington [7] in which they explore the    potential application for the use of DNA as storage medium.    According to this work, DNA storage has a higher    durability in comparison with current systems. Within the applications    of storing information in DNA, this group stored in a DNA sequence and    recovered succesfully three images that originally were in JPEG format.    This shows that nowadays, it is not only possible to store text and    information as we did in CryptoGErM; but DNA can be taken to another level    of storage.
If now it is possible to store images in DNA, in the near future we    might be able to store complete movies on DNA
DNA sequence drops to $0.0002 per Megabase
Fourth fictional scenario
CryptoGErM is designed primordially for information that requires to    be stored for a longer period of time and whose accessibility is not    required immediately. However, we are pretty sure that    this would change in the upcoming years due to the fact that DNA    sequencing is becoming faster and cheaper every year. The inclusion of    new and modern techniques, like massively parallel DNA sequencing, [8] have resulted in the    decrease of the price and time needed for the DNA sequencing    parallely to the increasing of the number of megabases that can be    read.
Since 2008, [9] it has    been predicted that DNA sequencing techniques would evolve till the    point that we will be able to obtain the DNA sequence in just a few    hours or minutes, even though many technical challenges have to be    overcome first.
The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), a division of    the National Institutes of Health (NIH), established to take part on    behalf of the NIH within the International Human Genome Project (HGP),    has been tracked the costs associated with the DNA sequencing (These    tack is done within the Centers founded by the National Institute). This    data can be consulted freely on the webpage of the NHGRI, in the    section “DNA Sequencing Costs: Data. [10] The following graph contains the data of    the costs of DNA Sequencing"

Berlin_diagnostX,2017,Team:Berlin diagnostX#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," nested PCR method, we add both extension primers and the template simultaneously to the PCR mastermix. First, the primer P1 will add the individual first half of the toehold loop and the conserved loop region onto the reporter gene sequence. The second extension primer P2 anneals to the conserved loop region that was added through the P1 primer. The P2 primer extends the PCR product by the second half of the individual toehold switch design flanked by at T7 promoter at the 5’ end. This creates a full dsDNA template containing 5’ a T7 promoter for RNA synthesis followed by the toehold switch and its loop structure that is ending into the reporter gene 3’ end.
In our study, we performed first trials of the nested PCR method on two toehold switch designs. The size of the amplified switches of the first PCR was evaluated on an agarose gel (Fig. 1). All the PCR products were of the expected length (aprox. 3.2 kb). Having this auspicious result in mind, we performed a second attempt with 7 other switch designs. This time 5 out of 7 nested attempts showed the desired outcome (data not shown).
Fig. 1: Agarose gel (1%) showing Nested PCR products of switch TSO#898 in lane 1 and TSO#16 in lane 3. Nested PCR was performed on a PCR product of lacZ containing the constant linker of a diagnostX toehold switch. Lane 2 and 4 contain Nested template with P2 primer only. This control aims at excluding unspecific binding of P2 to the template which would lead to false positive results."
