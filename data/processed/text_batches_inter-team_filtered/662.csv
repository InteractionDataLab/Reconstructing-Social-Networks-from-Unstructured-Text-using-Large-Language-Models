We showed him our proposed sketches for the milking shell with various modules, and he indicated that the most useful modules would be the temperature sensor, UV light, iodine spray, and cold shock. Blane said that our app would be more useful for bigger and more technologically advanced farms, and referred us to two more farms we could speak to. Blane also pointed out the importance of cost effectiveness. Farmers want to know that our device works, and whether they are going to get a return on their investment.

Quality Milk Production Services
Ithaca, NY
We went back to speak with Daryl Nydam of Quality Milk Production Services now that our ideas were more fleshed out. Dr. Nydam lent us a field guide for bovine mastitis that gave us a solid foundation of how we should move forward with bacteriocin testing, and agreed to provide us with infected milk samples that we could use as test targets. We asked Dr. Nydam how we would know if our product was successful. He answered that if we could show that bacteriocins work better than antibiotics, then it could be a home run.
For our milking shell, Dr. Nydam liked the iodine spray, UV light, and cold shock modules. He did not think the temperature sensor or the flow sensor were necessary as they were already implemented in farms, or were not good indicators for prevention. He mentioned that the iodine spray module would contaminate the milk if we kept it at the top of the shell. He was particularly interested in the cold shock module for its innovation, but suggested that we talk to more experts to see whether cold shock would be physiologically effective.
We also spoke to Dr. Nydam about our app. He recommended some academic literature that would help us with the economic analysis of treating or culling a cow. He was fascinated by the somatic cell counter and urged us to further pursue that option. While there are tests like the California Mastitis Test that already allow farmers to quickly detect mastitis, this new innovation could change the way the disease is approached and dealt with by farmers.
Dr. Nydam praised us for choosing a project in the dairy industry because of the strong agricultural presence in New York, along with the connections that Cornell has. Overall, Dr. Nydam emphasized something that everyone we have met has said: farmers want ease and effectiveness.

We see this as having two major applications: (1) the production of UV-resistant cyanobacteria which could replace current wild-type cyanobacteria in order to halt the cycle of ozone depletion; and (2) improving the efficiency of cyanobacteria-focused biofuel production. We then created BioBrick-compatible genetic constructs from two of these genes and expressed them in E. coli and cyanobacteria as a proof-of-concept.
The Plan
Our project has several components. The first of these is simply to compare the effectiveness of several genes on the level of UV radiation tolerance in E. coli. The first gene is uvsE, an endonuclease triggered by UV damage, which originates from Deinococcus radiodurans, an extremophile that is known to be one of the most radiation-resistant organisms in existence. This gene has already been characterized by another iGEM team and is easily accessible in a plasmid. Two of the genes are derived from Ramazzottius varieornatus, a species of tardigrade, which are organisms known for their extraordinary resistance to extreme conditions. One of these genes is Dsup, a DNA-binding protein which was recently discovered and has been shown to protect against ionizing radiation; however, no studies have yet been published on its effectiveness in protecting against UV radiation. The other tardigrade gene that will be tested is phrA, a photolyase. The tardigrade photolyase is a homologue of our final gene, the photolyase that exists in the cyanobacteria genus Synechococcus. In addition, we will be experimenting with a UV-induced promoter and plasmids with different copy numbers to see if these constructs are more efficient. After transforming these genes into E. coli, we will be transforming cyanobacteria with our gene constructs with the hope of seeing the intended effect in cyanobacteria. In order to test the efficacy of these genes, we will expose the transformed E. coli and cyanobacteria to UV light through a UV exposure apparatus we developed.
The Results
Throughout our work over the summer we accomplished a number of important tasks towards realizing the goals we set forth in our plan. First, we were able to confirm that the Dsup gene taken from R. varioenatus does in fact protect against UV radiation. Through the testing of our genetic constructs with the Dsup gene, we produced data to support that Dsup protects against UV-B radiation and also illustrated the significant change in UV-B resistance that can be given to E. Coli cells and potentially cyanobacteria"

Measurements of RFP fluorescence (AU) and OD600 were taken every time specified in the time (h) column and AU/OD600 is reported. A public water source and water from a nearby lake were also assayed.
Using the last measured fluoresence/OD600 value plotted against the concentration of arsenite used as inductor, a calibration curve was obtained.
With the use of the newly obtained calibration curve we also measured two samples that we obtained from our neighborhood. We took samples from a nearby lake and from a public water source. Following the same procedure, we grew E.coli cells until .5 OD600 and induced with the samples we obtained (after using a 0.0002 mm syringe microfilter) until 8 hours of induction. After measuring AU/OD600 for 8 hours we obtained the following data:
Taking the latter into account we might be more careful from where do we have contact with water. These results encourage us to inform the responsible authorities in the future about the current status of the water and have the samples analyzed by an already established method.

By the approach described above, quantitative observation of the indigoidine production in a liquid culture over time as well as the indigoidine production in relation to the cell growth can be conducted.   Background correction i. e. the contribution of the culture medium to the OD measurement is achieved by subtracting the mean of pure culture medium replicates from all OD values measured.

One component of the system ,crRNA, which contains a cis-repressing sequence 5’ of the RBS, RBS, and gene of interest. The cis-repressing sequence can form a loop form complementary base pairs with the RBS , blocking the ribosome entry to RBS. crRNA is also commonly described as a “lock” because it “locks” the RBS and prevent translation. The “key” to this system is the taRNA. It can interact (in trans) with the cis-repressing sequence to unlock the RBS and therefore to activate translation (Figure 1.). The benefits of this system, as described in Isaacs et al.’s paper, are leakage minimization, fast response time, tunability, independent regulation of multiple genes etc1.

UFMG_Brazil,2014,Team:UFMG Brazil#Project#Policy_-_-_TEXT.html,"1,2% was invested in Science, representing ≅ 26,952 billion, an amount 94,3%  smaller than what was invested in Science by the USA. Brazil cannot invest the same, but if a higher percentage of the GDP was invested in Science, we could at least begin to lay down the barriers to do research in our country. To do it, Science should be more valued and regarded as a priority. Convincing the government that Science deserves more fundingshould be something claimed by the society.  But is funding Science considered important by the Brazilian population?
To assess whether the low investment in Science by the government is supported by general population, we designed another survey. We asked general population,  on the streets and among our social networks contacts, on a scale from 1 to 10,  how important for them it is to invest in Science in Brazil? In addition to that, we asked what was the first word that came to their minds when they thought about Science.
The results show that people think it is indeed important to invest in Science and more than ¾ rated this importance from 8 to 10 (Fig 9) .
Concerning  the words people relate to Science, most of them revealed positive concepts, in the field of progress,  like KNOWLEDGE,  ADVANCES, INNOVATION, DEVELOPMENT and EVOLUTION. TECHNOLOGY was also greatly remembered (Fig 10). However, something caught our attention: 5,28% of interviewed people could not relate Science to anything. When we analyze only the results from the survey made on the streets, excluding the answers from social networks, this proportion rises to 15%! It’s a substantial amount of people that are not familiar with the universe of Science. This indicated to us that Science popularization is very important in our country, if we want Science to be greater valued.
In addition to the lack of investment in Science by the government, private enterprises also do not invest much in Science in Brazil (Fig.11). The private sector is responsible for less than 50%  of spending in R&D. Other nations which are in the beginning of the development process, like China and India, have a share of more than 70% of the investment being made by the private sector. This may contribute to the fact that Asia is better represented in iGEM: because developing asian countries value Science more. In Latin America, Argentina runs even worse in this field.
Other important problem for research in Latin America addressed in our survey was the importation experience (Figure 12). Many reactants used"

Because PC was in an aqueous mixture, the exact percentage could not be estimated precisely. We therefore dissolved 1,23 grams into 5 ml of incubation buffer.

If all these events happen, we will also cut both the arsR and cadA fragments with BamHI and NheI and attempt overnight ligation.
Practical Outline
Today's lab session will continue straight on from the last lab session and fulfil the following objectives:
Run products of PCR reaction involving the arsR BioBrick (BBa_J33206 in pSB1A2 missing promoter) and cadA promoter region
If successful clean up product, run on agarose gel through electrophoresis, excise band and carry out gel extraction.
Cut cleaned and excised fragment with BamHI and NheI
Carry out ligation (possibly an overnight ligation)
Cut pMUTIN4 and cotC (i.e. PCR product 3) with BamHI and HindIII
Ligate the fragments (possibly overnight)
Procedure
1) Cadmium-sensing logic AND gate
The first step to take was to run the PCR products of reactions involving the arsR BioBrick (BBa_J33206 without it's original promoter) and the cadA promoter region through agarose gel in DNA gel electrophoresis. The initial views of the team was to carry out a test on the samples on some gel before excising the rest of the DNA when in gel. However we decided to place all of the DNA into gel and excise the band immediately, without conducting tests.
All of the DNA from the PCR reactions involving the cadA promoter region and the arsR BioBrick (BBa_J33206 without promoter) was inserted into agarose gel (in two separate wells of course) and DNA gel electrophoresis allowed to commence for 20 minutes under 80 volts.
We also ran ara and pGFP-rrnB DNA on the gel (this is for the Stochastic Switch team).
The bands were then excised and cleaned using Sigma-Aldrich's GenElute Gel Extraction kit (along with the protocol). There was no changes to the protocol but a few important points to note:
The 'Spin Method' was the preferred route in the protocol to follow.
The mass of the gel bands were as follows:
arsR band = 0.285 grams
cadA promoter region band = 0.354 grams
ara band = 0.212 grams
pGFP-rrnB band = 0.233 grams
Therefore the amount of Gel Solublization Solution to be added to each of the"

RESULT
                                                                              Figure 1. Restriction digestion plasmid gel picture
Mdfa is known as 1233 bp.The Mdfa part from double digestion of Mdfa+pSB1C3 is smaller than the promoter+RBS+Mdfa part from double digestion of promoter+Mdfa+pSB1C3.
Figure 2.Growth contrast in high pH picture
      Culture four concentration gradients of E-coli (Mdfa transformed) and E-coli (BBa_K608002 transformed) in high pH conditions. The dilution proportion from left to right respectively is zero, doubling,10-fold,100-fold. The E-coli transformed Mdfa proves to grow more normally than none Mdfa E-coli.
Figure 3. Chart of OD value of Mdfa device and control group in different pH
Using OD values to validate the growth of E-coli (with Mdfa) and E-coli (with a promoter and RBS).
Compared with the E-coli with a promoter, E-coli with Mdfa grow more actively in pH9.0 to pH9.5. In the pH9.75 to pH10, none of them grow
Conclusion
      The result shows Mdfa does work actively in E-coli ,helping tolerate the high pH conditions in a range from pH 9.0 to Ph 9.5.
DISCUSSION
      BBa_K608002 by iGEM11_Freiburg 2011 is a strong Promoter and strong RBS and it is not related to tolerating alkaline stress, so it will be a good no-treatment control group.

Cells were transformed with the pRARE2 plasmid, taken from Rosetta2  competent cells. The pRARE2 plasmid encodes for these rare codon - tRNAs
Growth of Bacteria
Prepare an overnight preculture in 10 ml medium in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer-flask @ 37°C, 250 rpm
inoculated in 1000 ml Terrific Broth in a 2000 ml chicanery-flask at 37°C, 150-180 rpm
cells were grown until reaching OD600 = 0,8
The expression of T7 RNA polymerase then was induced by adding 0.5 ml of 1 M IPTG to the medium
further growth until OD600 = 6.5, then cells were put on ice
cells were pelleted at 6000 g at 4°C for 30 minutes in a fixed-angle rotor
supernatant was decanted and the cells were washed two times in buffer A
Again, the cells were pelleted at 5000 g for 20 min at 4°C and afterwards resuspended in 1.3 ml of buffer B
Using a french press with a 1“ diameter piston, the cells were lysed at 1000 psi (≈ 6.9 MPa)
About 7.5 ml of lysate was obtained after pressing.
Washing and lysis
obtained lysate is pelleted via ultracentrifugation at 30,000 g for 30 min at 4°C
The resulting extract is mixed with the preincubation buffer in a ratio of 10:1 (lysate:buffer)
preincubated lysate is then transferred to a 3.5 kDa dialysis tubing and desalted by dialysing it against buffer C at 4°C for 90 minutes
after renewing the buffer, once more over night at slow stirring
the lysate is ready for use and, after shock-freezing in liquid N2, can be stored in small ali-quots at - 80°C.
Remarks
The Preincubation step takes care of what is called the „run off“ step, a step"

Using design 4 we thought we could get this custom molded to our specification. This means that after we've constructed a mould for this shape, our production volume would be able to keep the cost of this down. As we are unable to find an exact cost for this, an estimate based on the cost of the current tube can be used. We thought we would double the price as it would be a relatively new container.
A detailed analysis of the cost break down of iGEM-Bielefeld-CeBiTec teams custom made cell free kit [6].
Per Container - $0.70 (£0.45)
Total Cost for The Container:
Per container -  £0.72
Overall Cost
Cell free kit per reaction - £12.2
Container per container - £0.72
Total cost per reaction - £12.94
Our cost is currently £12.94 and compared with the £5.90 for the current test it is over double the price. Analysing the cost, you can see that the cell free kit is the most expensive part of the test. To try and fix this we reached out to Bielefeld and due to our previous Skype calls with them we knew they were making their own cell free kit. They later provided us with the cost break down of this, which is attached above. As you can see $0.50 (£0.32)[6] is the cost per reaction for one of their cell free kits. If we extended our collaboration with Bielefeld, they may be able to provide us with this cell free kit and hence significantly reduce our test cost.
Using Bielefeld's cell free kit, our overall cost is reduced by £11.08, leaving a new total of £1.84. This easily beats the current testing cost, meaning that our test can not only perform better than the current test, but it is also more cost effective.

Steps for Usage:
Step 1: Take your own urine (a drop) and drop it onto a glass slide and leave it at room                         temperature for 40 minutes.
Step 2: Rinse the glass slide with water and blow dry with a fan or blower.
Step 3: The glass slide is placed on the liquid crystal cell to complete the assembly of the test                         chip.
Step 4: Insert the test chip into the middle of the kit.
Step 5: Use ordinary light (the light of the mobile phone) to illuminate the polarizer above the                         kit. If you can see the color of the light indicating that there is excessive β2-MG                         in the                         urine, the patient should go to the hospital for further physical examination. Only black images                         or sporadic bright spots can be seen, indicating that the patient is in good health.
Step 6: After taking the observed image with a mobile phone, use our own software to process the                         image, and you can get the grayscale analysis result of the image and the current β2-MG                         content                         in the urine.
Step 7: Just replace the disposable piece of glass when you need to use it again.
Precautions:
After the urine is added, the glass slide should be placed for at least 40 minutes;
When using a hair dryer to dry the glass slide, use a cold wind file, and pay attention that                             the wind cannot be too large.
The Second Generation of Dr. Familict
Structure:
In order to further improve the user-friendliness of the products and enable patients to obtain a                         more convenient product experience, we proposed an improved version of the product design based                         on the first-generation product design. The operation of the second generation of Dr. Familict                         kit is semi-automated and its size is 20 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm. It consists mainly of a                         slide slot, a wash buffer chamber, a waste collector, a liquid crystal cell, a polarizer and an                         analyzer. The antigen-antibody reaction is still carried out on the slide, and the slide is                         moved to the slide position by sliding positioning. Different reaction chambers are used to                         complete the operations of dropping antibody, dropping liquid crystal, rinsing, and image                         observation, etc.
Steps for Usage:
Step 1: Insert the antigen-coated glass slide into the slide slot, and the kit system                         automatically drops a drop of the antibody solution.
Step 2: The user drops a drop of urine in"
NEFU_China,2014,Team:NEFU China#Monthly_-_-_TEXT.html,", we set our case in environment track and decided to do something about the heavy metal contamination. By the end of this month, the structure of our case was clear to see. Learn more about design.
And this month, we invited a special guest to join our conversation. Ph.D. Qian Wang, a Distinguished Professor of University of South Carolina. Fortunately for us, he brought us a wide range of knowledge about latest development in bionanomaterials, which really inspired us a lot. Here we send our best wishes for him and his research group!
Another big event in this month was that we demonstrated our project to the leaders of our school for more attention and additional fund. It was indeed a good opportunity for us to practice in front of an audience. And it turned out to be a success. We appreciated that we got a say through the whole progress. And we were happy  that we won the favor of the leadership.
JULY
Nearly two thirds of our team members were not familiar enough to  bioscience experiment as well as frequently used biotechnologies. So it was a  big job for us to adapt to the wet lab work. We started from  laboratory safety education, including the microbiological risk assessment,  laboratory-biosafety level, laboratory equipment, microbiological techniques  and chemical, fire and electrical safety on the basis of Laboratory  Biosafety Manual and then equipped ourselves with basic experimental routes  and qualified techniques according to Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory  Manual.
AUGUST
For the competition, the result we harvested in this month should be the critical part of the whole project, without which we would be stuck at the very beginning. This was the achievement of getting the reconstructed bacteria we need containing the designed plasmids. See more about Lab Note
Then we began to conduct system testing when the designed plasmids were ready.
On 20th, we attended 2014 International Workshop and  Summer School on ""Biological Big Bytes"", a Satellite Meeting of the  International Workshop/Summer school on Crops, Chips & Computers(C3-B3 for  short). It was combined with the iGEM Meet-Up for three teams in Harbin,  China(HIT-Harbin, NEAU-Harbin and us) and it was organized by Harbin Institute  of Technology. Here we want to express our sincere thanks for them!
This month we also visited Harbin Taiping sewage treatment plant to learn the technological process of sewage treatment and to do some samplings so that we could test our system.
Besides that, this month we designed a questionnaire"

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Beyond Basics_-_-_TEXT.html," On the one hand they can try to industrialize it with the help of already existing enzyme companies. One the other hand their product could be applied in the washing industry and used for washing detergents. That’s the most probable application of their protease. With the help of these already existing companies it is possible to distribute their product. For example it could be sold in local supermarkets and drugstores. Probably it won´t be sold in low budget supermarkets, because of the production and developmental costs. Moreover, the iGEM Team Aachen has to care about the distribution of their light tool. Maybe they can include it as a free give-away to the first bottle of washing detergent and start in this way promoting the use of its product.
Policies of Communication of the New Product
The new product of the iGEM Team Aachen should be communicated as an alternative to already existing washing detergents and there should be a focus on the ecological impacts of boric acid. The product of the iGEM Team Aachen should ban boric acid and make it possible to use the washing detergents with the same quality as before.  Instead of boric acid they want to communicate the use of light to activate the protease. As the iGEM Team wants people to activate the protease with light, they also have to communicate this difference. That’s where I see the biggest problem for the iGEM Team Aachen. They have to convince the people that they should not only invest more time in the washing process, but also to change their customs when it comes to cleaning their clothes. Moreover they would need to convince big companies.  Although the iGEM Team invented a gadget for activating the protease and in a survey the team performed the majority of the people said that they would spend more time for activating the protease, this idea has to be transferred in the daily life of the customers. For that reason this device has to be as user friendly as possible, the application should only differ in a very small way from today’s application and the price should be in the same range like before. If they take care of these purposes and still maintain the ecological part, the products can have a chance on the global market.

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the S-Din database. When searching, related information will be provided based on the network analysis, which would spark a brand new idea unexpectedly.
Interaction analysis
When you use interaction analysis for a Part on the design platform, any other parts or protein that might interact with the chosen part will be displayed and can be added to the platform. We had built an interaction database ourselves, the sources of data were iGEM Registry and STRING Database. Scores for parts come from the STRING Database.
Simulation & Plasmid Design
S-Din allow our innovative users with fascinating idea to combine various genetic parts together to form a brand-new genetic circuits that may never exist before.To help them have a deeper understanding of how the genetic system that they created works, we construct an ODE system to simulate the dynamic behaviors of the genetic system mathematically. The main challenge of simulation is the uncertainty of genetic circuits since the users can construct them arbitrarily. Therefore we built a rather generic model capable of simulating various genetic circuits.
After your Design, you can choose to convert your circuits into Plasmids (Customizable) for further synthesis.
Techniques
As a web application. Django with Python 3 was choosen for back-end which is fast, strong, robust and friendly to developers; MySQL with Django models binding give us fantastic database support; Algorithms including Word2Vec, K-D Tree are also coded in Python 3 with the famous SciPy. For front-end, we build the view with customized Semantic UI, and control the logic behind beautiful widgets using jQuery. Some other open-source JavaScript libraries are also used to build the site, such as Chart.js for chart, jsPlumb for links in the design page, etc.. Advanced TypeScript was used to build the interesting game BioLab Rescue, hope you will enjoy it!

Construction intermediate.
BBa_K1421001: plux R+RBS+LacIM1+2TE
This device is comprised of plux R (BBa_R0062), RBS (BBa_B0034), lacIM1 (BBa_K082005) and 2 TE (BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012). The lux pR is a right promoter in the lux cassette of V. Fischeri, which gives weak constitutive expression while enhanced when binding to the complex of LuxR and AHL (acyl-homoserine lactone ). The LacIM1 is a LacI mutant, which can repress lac promoter. Thanks to the work of Tokyo_Tech 2010, it is confirmed that this mutant protein has a weaker function of repression to the lac promoter, compared to the wild type LacI.
BBa_K1421002: plux R+RBS+cI+2TE
This device is comprised of plux R (BBa_R0062), RBS (BBa_B0034), cI (Part:BBa_C0051) and 2 TE (BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012). The lux pR is a right promoter in the lux cassette of V. Fischeri, which gives weak constitutive expression while enhanced when binding to the complex of LuxR and AHL (acyl-homoserine lactone ). CI is from BBa_C0051 which is designed by Vinay S Mahajan, Brian Chow, Peter Carr, Voichita Marinescu and Alexander D. Wissner-Gross. The cI repressor from E. coli phage lambda is modified with an LVA tail for rapid degradation of the protein. It binds to the cI regulator.

Austin_UTexas,2016,Team:Austin UTexas#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," may be impractical because ethanol must be present for the bacteria in the brew to oxidize it to acetic acid, a major component of the beverage’s tart, distinctive flavor.
Another approach is to increase the rate at which the bacteria convert the ethanol to acetic acid. Two enzymes are responsible for this process: an alcohol dehydrogenase and an aldehyde dehydrogenase.2 Using Golden Gate assembly, we plan to assemble a construct containing the coding sequences for these genes and insert the construct into Gluconacetobacter hansenii, an acetic acid-producing bacterium similar to those found in kombucha. Then, we plan to compare the ethanol content of kombucha cultures fermented with either the modified or unmodified bacteria using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We also plan to determine whether increasing the acetic acid production will lead to a pH change that could affect the flavor of the beverage by testing the pH and observing the cultures for visible differences. If we are able to create a microbial community that results in a lower ethanol content within the kombucha during fermentation, kombucha brewers could use the modified bacterium to help ensure the ethanol content of their product stays below the legal limit for longer. Even though there exists a climate of apprehension surrounding genetically modified organisms in the kombucha industry, using such a bacterium could give a brewer a distinct commercial advantage.
To learn more about how our interaction with the kombucha industry affected our project, see our Human Practices page.

Brazzein
One of the potential methods to create designer kombucha is to add a brazzein gene into the bacterial strains. Brazzein, a protein found in the pulp of the edible fruit of the African plant Pentadiplandra brazzeana Baill, is an extremely sweet substance1. It is 2,000 times sweeter than sucrose by weight. This makes it a healthy and economical alternative to sugar.  Commercial production of brazzein is limited, however, because it comes from a tropical plant. If it could be more easily harvested, it could be used to improve the flavor of various foods and drinks, including kombucha. By genetically engineering the brazzein gene into the bacteria in"
NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," at theInstitute of Biotechnology, School of life science and health in Northeastern University. He is majoring in Wnt signaling pathway. Sheng was 2016 overseas tutor of NEU-CHINA team. Besides, he is an expert on colorectal cancer and has some knowledge of most bowel diseases.
He made the following Suggestions for our project design:
Ⅰ. Looking for the right chassis, E. coli Nissle can be used as chassis
Ⅱ. Select the nitric oxide as inflammatory bowel disease of nonspecific inflammation signal molecules
III. Sustained and stable output is required for anti-inflammatory devices.
2. Doctor Consultations
After choosing interleukin-10 as the output of engineering bacteria and conducting experiments for a period of time, in order to find out the feasibility of our scheme, we went to consult with professor Zheng Changqing, a first-line expert in intestinal diseases. He is the director of the department of internal medicine of Shengjing hospital affiliated to China Medical University and the director of the second department of gastroenterology.
Dr. Zheng Changqing introduced the treatment of IBD from the aspects of patients' disease, current clinical treatment methods, and common drugs.
Ⅰ. Doctors say using bacteria to secrete TNF an immune inhibitor is an effective way.
Ⅱ. Compared to mammalian cells, bacteria are more easy to operate and mass culture. They have more potential. However, the issue of safety should be carefully considered and bioprotective measures should be taken to avoid biological leakage.
III. Common anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used in patients with mild to moderate symptoms, and immunosuppressive agents are more commonly used in patients with Crohn's disease.
Ⅳ. We know that IBD and diet and the changes of intestinal bacteria strains. During the communication, we also learned that the prevalence of IBD in China has skyrocketed in recent years, and currently the number of effective drugs is limited. Expensive biologics are not covered, and patients rely on ordinary anti-inflammatory drugs. It will be very meaningful if our therapy can be applied effectively in clinical practice. Inspired by professor Zheng, in the future, we will combine engineered bacteria to release immunosuppressive and TNF monoclonal antibodies.
3 Mobile Games
Based on our treatment plan for inflammatory bowel disease, our team designed a simple game. In the game, players play engineered bacteria that travel through the fire-filled gut, collecting nitric oxide emitted by inflammation and releasing the drug interleukin 10 to destroy the flame to help the gut recover.

UTP-Panama,2011,Team:UTP-Panama#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," determine procedures, limitations and regulations established to manage LMO, GMO and bioethical issues.
However, in our country there is a commission that determines the biosafety guidelines, was establish in 2002, under the named as: “National Biosafety Committee for Genetically Modified Organisms and Another’s ” [2] .
In this way, the Panamanian Government  organized in 2007,  the ""Development of the National Regulatory Framework on Biosafety for the Republic of Panama"" which establish the  National Center for Biotechnology Information Exchange (BCH). See the draft of this document here [3] .
Actually the information collection, new frameworks and regulations are discussed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Exchange (BCH) of the Republic of Panama [4] .
4- Ideas
Our team is composed with students of engineering degrees,  without biological background formation in their careers, for this reason, we propose tutorials for lab techniques & safety requirements at the beginning of the competition.
We need a database of information (papers, books, etc) that explains the real implications and issues of using DNA recombinant technology to modify organisms and understand the possible ways to analize their release in the environment. The question is: ¿How do we analize the interactions between new organisms and the environment?
Additional Safety Issues
How we addressed these issues in project design and while conducting laboratory work
We review that the biological parts used in our device,  being aware of possible damages on the safety of team members and our environment (the environment, and others). As our project is of very low risk to the safety of our team, using standard security measures avoid any incidents that may arise.
Biosafety Training
We received general instructions on the equipment used in the laboratory, the risks of working in certain areas of it and the precautions we got to have on some materials.

The students then patched and inoculated the plasmid culture. Max and Jonah continued work on performing experiments to discover the effective concentration of cinnamaldehyde on bacteria.  After the lab work was completed on base, the students then headed to UES where they continued working on the human outreaches to companies, the song lyrics, and the mike the microbe collaboration.
Tuesday (07/17/18)
Lab 1
The day was hectic yet again. They checked their overnight cultures and discovered that no gFP had been expressed. For some reason, the bands on the PCR displayed a continuous long band down the middle instead of a clearly defined, horizontal band. The students were dismayed and disappointed, realizing all their work from yesterday was for nothing. However, they retraced their steps back to square one. At the beginning of their project, they had tested Dr. Goodson’s “RhlR” plasmid that clearly worked and decided to go back to the glycerol stocks they had come from and be able to regrow out the cells to work with them. They were able to prep overnight cultures and streaked them out on the plates. Meanwhile, the LabPats also wanted to re-do the PCR once again of the overnight cultures just to make sure that they hadn’t just been things wrong the days prior. They discovered, yet again, that the singular band had not shown up but instead a long band ran down the length of the gel. There was also a team meeting later in the day that the entire team congregated at to discuss project progress as well as possible human outreach “field trips” to the Cleveland Becket Oil and an oil subsidiary of Marathon in Cincinnati.
Lab 2
At the start of the morning, the RX lab students went to lab where they split into the two teams to focus on each side of the destroy aspect of the project. Peter, Travis, and Chris performed a mini-prep, digest, and ran a gel of the KPN1 removed pwPCH055 plasmid.  After viewing the ran gel, 5 colonies were to be good clones with the KPN1 site removed and they were chosen for further culturing and experimentation.

4. Antisense Method
The antisense method consists in inhibiting the production of certain proteins by using an antisense RNA that is perfectly complementary to the target nucleotide sequence, thus preventing its transcription.
In this case we are using the antisense method to prevent the production of the enzymes G6PD and PGI so by representing the binding of the antisense mRNA to the nucleotide sequence by a hill equation we get the following equations .

Question: Does CscB-transformed PCC7942 export sucrose to the surrounding medium when induced by osmotic stress and IPTG? How much sucrose is exported?
Background: Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose that are linked together with alpha- (1,2) glycosidic linker. In photosynthetic organisms like cyanobacteria and plants, sucrose is naturally produced and stored by means of photosynthesis.
BioBrick characterization: The iGEM team from Brown-Stanford 2011 utilized a cscB coding gene inspired from the research of Daniel Ducat and Pamela Silver at Harvard Medical School. This produced the BioBrick Bba_K656011 ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K656011:Experience ). However, they were not able to perform sucrose measurements when their documentation ended, as described in their wiki-pages ( https://2011.igem.org/Team:Brown-Stanford/PowerCell/NutrientSecretion ). We  would therefore like to add sucrose measurements to their BioBrick pages. With the permission from the original authors, we borrowed a cscB-transformed PCC7942 S. elongatus and characterized growth and sucrose accumulation in the extracellular medium during 7 days of induction, at different osmotic pressures.
Experiment:
The S. elongatus PCC7942 was inoculated in 100 mL BG-11 media in a conical flask and incubated at 30 C under 200 rpm shaking and light bulb. After 3 days of growth, 1,5 mM of IPTG was added to induce the expression of sucrose export cscB gene for sucrose transport into the media.
The amount of sucrose secreted in the media was determined using Dionex- High-performance anion exchange chromatography - pulsed ampherometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) by using using CarboPac SA 10 (Thermo Scientific) column for fast separation of sugars.
HPAEC-PAD is an analytical device to detect and characterise simple to complex carbohydrates in the sample based on their electrocatalytic activity at high pH-level using NaOH. 200 µL of inoculated spinned media containing secreted sucrose was"
Warsaw,2009,Team:Warsaw#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," TolC is present in the genome of the lab strain derived from K12 strain. To ensure efficient secretion hlyB and hlyD have to be introduced into the genome and proapoptotic protein has to be fused with 60 amino acid long C-terminal sequence of hemolysin. [5].
Directing bacterial proteins to mammalian mitochondria.
We need to be able to direct to the mammalian mitochondria some of the proteins secrete by bacteria into the cytoplasm of the host cell. It is going to be archived by fusion of mitochondrial leader sequence from human protein Suv3 to the N-terminus of proteins. It has been shown that 40 amino acids long N-terminal sequence is enough for effective transport of Suv3 through the mitochondrial membrane. [21]. First the efficiency of the process will be assessed by detection of Red Fluorescent Protein with confocal microscopy. The red fluorescence should be visible in the mitochondria of the cells invaded by bacteria expressing RFP fused with mitochondrial leader sequence. Then the ability to induce apoptosis by mitochondrially directed p53 will be investigated. Apoptosis induction will be confirmed by flow cytometry [8]. In addition we will use confocal microscopy to monitor the process. In both cases cells will be stained with propidium iodide and annexin V.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated human practices_-_-_TEXT.html," how beneficial early detection of NSCLC is, but we had not explored the clinical implementation of our sensor before talking to him. He suggested offering the test to high risk individuals for whom the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of their cancer could lead to an increase in the rate of survival: in the case of NSCLC, this could be carried out by offering the test to those with a certain smoking history. To determine which individuals had a sufficiently high risk of developing NSCLC, for our sensor to be cost effective, we have designed a cost model - take a look below.
He also proposed that if the concept of our test were to be proven and a variety of miRNAs could be detected as biomarkers for a range of cancers, then our test could be used as a screening tool for anyone over a certain age, due to the increase in cancer prevalence with age. His comments led us to research the required criteria below for our sensor to be used as a screening tool. His advice on the high sensitivity and specificity required fed into our need to create a second series of switches.
Dr Sujal Desai
We discussed the use of our sensor for high risk population screening with Dr Desai, a consultant chest radiologist. He informed us that lung cancer rarely presents before age 40, and to maximize the test’s value it should be offered to those aged 55 and above, with a smoking history - so that we would not waste money offering the test to too many people who were very unlikely to have cancer.
To integrate their advice, we worked with our our modeling team to work out who would we should screen. Tammegami et al.’s probability score is the probability of an individual getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. [2]
Using our model which combined this with the data for our project and standard NSCLC treatment, we worked out for what probabilities it would be cost effective for us to screen. The model showed that our tool could be cost effective at cost per QALY - saving lives and saving the NHS money. It shows that even if our sensitivity was lower than we expect, our sensor would be extremely cost effective.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html,"Would you buy one if you saw them in the grocery store?
Some of the bananas are dual-purpose, bringing out a different flavor profile when cooked. How do you feel about cooking bananas?
Did you know there were other varieties of bananas beyond the Cavendish?
Do you shop with diversity in crops in mind? Do you buy organic, non-GMO, etc.?
We found a variety of responses to the event, a lot of participants liked the red bananas and its more complex sweet taste to be better than the Cavendish. Some liked the more tart flavors of the other bananas but it was split between the red bananas and the Cavendish. We found that the majority of participants have never heard of bananas that weren’t the Cavendish, and they mentioned that the would start looking for this in the stores.
We also talked about the project and synthetic biology, and how we can apply synthetic biology to the problem of the disappearing Cavendish banana. They were interested in learning more about it, and they preferred that we used a soil probiotic rather than genetically modifying bananas themselves.
Reaching Out to the Community
BUGSS
One of our continued collaborators this year was BUGSS, the Baltimore Underground Science Space. They are a community lab based in Baltimore that provides anyone in the area interested in synthetic biology with the resources to design and conduct their own experiments.
We reached out to them in the beginning of the summer initially regarding our hardware project. Because community labs often have limited resources, we were curious to see if they had any insight into what specific equipment we should include in our lab-in-a-box. During this visit, we received feedback regarding our hardware project, learned about what it was like to work in a community lab, and were invited to come back to visit and to collaborate with BUGSS’s own high school iGEM team.
We visited BUGSS again in early October for its Open-House event. There, we presented the community with a basic description of our project and asked them to taste the Cavendish, burro, manzano, thai, and red bananas. As found at our Farmer’s Market visit, most people preferred the Cavendish and red bananas, finding that the other varieties were too bitter or starchy. In addition to this, we were able to listen to BUGSS’s high school iGEM team give a presentation on their project regarding plastic degradation and provide feedback and suggestions.
Our final visit was later in October when we were invited back to present on our projects to local synthetic biology enthusiasts. They found our projects to be very exciting and gave us feedback on the presentation formatting and"

GMO Regulations
Here is the collaboration organized by iGEM Manchester team. They made a series of questions about regulations for the correct manipulation of GMOs, and different teams have answered them, depending on which country they are from.
What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?
The institutional bodies that enforce the laws regarding the use of GMMs differ a lot across the world. In many countries in Asia (Japan, Indonesia, and Korea) and Canada, ministries and departments are responsible for enforcing the laws of GMMs. The kinds of ministries enforcing the laws as well as their numbers vary from country to country, but usually the large organizations are in charge.
On the other hand, countries like India, Brazil, the United States, and Australia have more specialied committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.
In the European Union, the European Commission is responsible for enforcing the GMO laws to be followed by all member countries. Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology, but has responsible institutions when commercing or trading.
Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?
We can distinguish two different administrative ways in which countries decided to regulate the use of GMMs. One way government regulate GMMs is by establishing a special, often non-governmental, organisation, which usually also acts as an information centre in the field of synthetic biology. The other way involves assigning conventional ministries to regulate the use of GMMs in their respective fields.
The European Union, Australia, and Indonesia belong to the first group. For example, in Australia, Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee takes charge of making decisions on products’ approval. Competent authorities in the European Union and The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety in Indonesia have similar roles.
Brazil, Canada, Chile, Korea, India, Japan and the US belong to the second group, where conventional ministries are responsible for their respective fields. Even though the names of these ministries might differ amongst the countries, it seems to be a more prevalent way to regulate GMO. Additional information centres might be present to help the ministries make decisions,"

Queens_Canada,2018,Team:Queens Canada#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Each hour-long session highlighted a different synthetic biology application and focused on a      specific example from a recent scientific publication.
Our first SynBio Club summer 2018 event took place on June 29th and was devoted to better explaining the applications of genetic engineering in the field of medicine.      Our Outreach Lead, Maddison, presented a paper that focused on research done at Cornell University. The research team did a study using genetically engineered      Escherichia coli as commensal bacteria to prevent Vibrio cholerae virulence in mouse models. By transforming the bacteria to produce an autoinducer molecule, they      were able to alter bacterial communication and decrease the amount of cholera present in the mouse systems. This was an excellent example of how synthetic biology      applications can impact the field of medicine and even have the potential to serve as a basis for disease prevention and treatment plans. Following the presentation,      everyone attending was invited to discuss their views on the application, its potential for use in human systems, possible ethical concerns and considerations that      would need to be evaluated if this application was to move forward.
Interested in learning more? Here’s the paper we discussed:
Engineered bacterial communication prevents Vibrio cholerae          virulence in an infant mouse model
Duan F and March JC. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences      of the United States of America. 2010; 107(25):11260-11264. doi:10.1073/pnas.1001294107
Our second SynBio Club event took place on July 25th and was focused on evaluating the use of synthetic biology in research applications and its effective use as a tool      to further academic research. Specifically, the topic of optogenetics, a technique frequently used in neuroscience research, was explored. Optogenetics involves the      introduction of genes for light-sensitive channels that allow for the specific and targeted activation of neurons. The meeting focused on a paper that involved the ability      to create false memories in mice using this optogenetics approach. Following the presentation, the group discussed various topics surrounding this emerging field of research,      which included use in humans, future applications and limitations of this technology, and possible ethical questions that may be raised when evaluating this tool.

Nordic iGEM conference
During this year’s Nordic iGEM Conference we had the pleasure to participate in a three-day conference organized by the Lund University team. The conference consisted of talks, workshops, a poster session as well as a project presentation from all the teams. We were very impressed with all of the teams’ projects and efforts in making this a useful opportunity for us to learn more about iGEM, and to further develop our project. The project presentations were organized in such they served as a “mini Jamboree”. All the teams presented in front of judges, followed by a voting round from the audience and judges.
We were very honored and humbled to win both the audience choice as well as the judges’ choice. It was a great conference and we would like to extend our gratitude and thank the 2018 Lund University team for organizing, the judges for great input and all the other iGEM teams for creating a unique learning space.
Finally, we are looking very much forward to organizing the 2019 Nordic iGEM conference and we will do our best to make sure it will be just as great as this year’s.

Q1:
Why not incorporate SBW in this software to make it more powerful？
A1:
As SBML has become a standard description format for modeling a biological system. Considering the output of our design obeys this standard, a combination with SBW tools such as cell designer should be incorporated in our software for analysis and simulation purpose. We have left a button “SBW” and have written the interface template in our software.

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#ConsortiaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", placed on the Psb1C3), we wanted to put arabinose inducible MetA or arabinose inducible TyrA. However, one of the primers necessary to amplify the plasmid itself, which would be necessary to incorporate the proper homologous sequence for Gibson assembly, did not arrive. Additionally, the PCR to amplify the MetA gene did not work the first time, but has been repeated. The arabinose promoter was successfully PCR'd out of the E. coli genome for both cases.  For the plasmid with YFP, the BBa_I13973, we wanted to put rhamnose inducible TrpA or TyrA after the YFP gene. We received all the primers necessary for this, but the PCR for the plasmid backbone gave several bands and was repeated at a higher annealing temperature. The results are not yet known. The rhamnose promoter was successfully PCR'd out of the genome, as was the TrpA gene. However, we lacked one of the promoters for the TyrA gene. Since there were several bands for the YFP plasmid, we did not do a Gibson assembly. Additionally, it is possible that the primers were designed for the pSB1C3 rather than the pSB1A2, but that should have little effect due to the similarities on the ends of the two plasmids. A simple digest and ligation should be able to move the part from the one plasmid to the other. We also wanted to put a IPTG inducible (BBa_K091111, LacIQ) metA gene after a GFP. The PCR for the MetA gene and the GFP plasmid were successful (although the GFP plasmid appeared as a fairly weak band on the gel), but the PCR for the LacIQ promoter failed. The initial DNA for this PCR was added directly from the parts distribution kit, and as such the composition and concentration of exactly what was added was unknown. The PCR was repeated as a cPCR on the genome, so as to at least get a usable part with the right overhang.
The final primers for the gibson assembly of the kill switch primer also arrived. There are four parts to this plasmid: the plasmid backbone, the lacI promoter, the constitutively expressed lacI gene, and the constitutively expressed RFP for easy selection. The plasmid backbone, the promoter, and the constitutively expressed RFP PCR products has been ready for several weeks, but"

The next step will be to PCR the E. coli genes again, with the ideal annealing temperature, using Pfx polymerase instead of Taq. The Pfx enzyme has proofreading and so is less likely to make a mistake within the genes. The gradient PCR on S. cerevisiae cDNA will be repeated and optimized.

Figure 2. Solution structure of MVN. MVN consists of 2 domains, domain A   and domain B, which are colored yellow and blue respectively. Domain A is formed by residues 38-93 while domain B is   formed by residues 1-37 and 94-108. The mannan binding site is only found in domain A. This figure is taken from   Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2Y1S).
We fused INPNC and MVN together to anchor MVN on the outer membrane. MVN is oriented outwards into the medium to   recognize and bind to the specific cyanobactera cells. We added a 10 aa flexible protein domain linker in between to   make sure that MVN and INPNC can function separately without much mutual interference. The fusion protein INPNC-MVN   is expressed under a constructive promoter J23105. We also designed our E. coli to express GFP at the same time. The E. coli cells were later   co-incubated with M. aeruginosa and observed under the fluorescence microscope afterwards. The fluorescence   of GFP and chlorophyll A can help mark our E. coli and M. aeruginosa so that we could identify the   binding effect later.
Figure 3. Schematic representation of the binding reaction between E.   coli and Microcystis aeruginosa. INPNC anchors at the outer membrane of the E. coli and displays   MVN on its C terminus. Linker1 is the blue strand between INP C-domain and MVN . MVN has one Man α(1 → 2)   Man binding site which is a typical component in the LPS of the M. aeruginosa. E. coli and M.   aeruginosa are bound together by the intermolecular force.
In addition to this E. coli - M. aeruginosa binding assay, we also designed two additional tests.   One test is a direct binding assay with M. aeruginosa and purified MVN protein to prove the binding ability   of MVN directly and the other test is a rTEV protease digestion assay to verify whether MVN is oriented   outwards or not. Detailed information will be described in the Results.

Ms. Guo (70-year-old)       Rectal cancer sufferer
Ms. Guo has been diagnosed as rectal cancer for 8 years. Her initial symptoms were slender stools along with purulence and abdominal pain. But she thought it was caused by her constipation combined with hemorrhoids. She did not know that it was rectal cancer until she went to the hospital for a colonoscopy.
During the 8 years, Ms. Guo has experienced two surgeries. The first one was taken soon after her diagnosing. At that time, as she was found in the middle stage of the cancer, the doctors performed the surgery to remove the lesion. After the surgery she continued chemotherapy treatment for continuous control, adhering to the check every 3 months. However, in 2011 and 2015, Ms. Guo has experienced 2 recurrence. Now she depends mainly on the treatment combining chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Every 21 or 28 days she goes to the hospital for a session of chemotherapy. After accept chemotherapy, Ms. Guo suffers from side effects like vomiting, hair loss, limbs weakness, etc.
As Ms. Guo’s husband told us, the reimburse they received is more limited, because they came for treatment from another province, which is defined as non-local insurance. Ever since Ms. Guo’s treatment, they have spent more than 200k RMB (30,000$) on medical expenses, which add up to be a very heavy burden for them.
At the same time, Ms. Guo told us that there are a lot of people distributing leaflets and ads around the hospital. Some of these ads might be false, yet desperate patients still try to contact them as if they are clutching at the straws of their lives. Ms. Guo hopes that the government could provide some authoritative medical journals for patients like them, enabling patients to understand the latest researches from the formal channels, and to get a better comprehending of the therapies that suit them.
Summary
Long story in short, most of the patient we interviewed showed positive mental conditions, but the economic situation of their families could be uneven. There are not many patients who have relatively well-off condition like Ms. Chen, and more than half of the patients cannot afford molecular target therapy thus rely on the medical insurance reimbursement.
Most of the patients are holding certain expectations for new therapies. However, obviously, aside from efforts to promote the efficacy of new therapies,"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid"

EPFL,2017,Team:EPFL#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," of the day, we were convinced that cell-free biology will provide    high schools with an amazing tool to explain certain principles of biology    (eg. gene transcription, translation and regulation, transformation, cloning,    energy of a system) all in a hands-on way, while at the same time developing    an intuition for biology that students cannot get from books. The idea of our    Mini-Kit was born: A small toolbox that would enable teachers to give a live    demonstration of various biomolecular processes. An easy to handle, high-impact    collection of experiments that poses no biohazard as it doesn’t contain living    cells, perfect for explaining the concepts listed before to high school kids.    A creative and novel way to stimulate each student’s learning process. The workshop    was ideal to give us a roadmap, as a lot of technical details were discussed,    and it inspired us to take this message home and implement it in our local context.
iGEM EPFL at the Curriculum Development Workshop
The Educational Cell Free Mini Kit project
Ever since the workshop in Cambridge, iGEM EPFL 2017 aimed to difuse cell-free biology as an accessible and          exciting scientific field for the younger. Thus arose the idea of the Educational Cell Free Mini Kit (ECFK) that consists in a set of five experiments intended for demonstrations at          local high schools. Leaving a footprint after the end of the competition was also something dear to the team, who          found solace in the distribution of the minikit to several high schools in the Canton of Geneva, set in the          francophone part of Switzerland. For this purpose, we reached out to several high schools   located in regions nearby EPFL to ensure they had interests in our kit and that they would   add it to their classes. A few days later we received many encouraging responses from high school and university          professors in Geneva: François Lombard, Alexandra Suter de Iaco, Bertrand Emery and Jean-Luc Zanasco showed great          interest in the implementation of such a kit in their theoretical and practical lectures and provided us with precise          counselling on how to improve it in order to make it as accurate and suitable for high school classes as possible.          Professor at the University of Geneva and manager of the plateform BiOutils' Karl Perron also shared his          enthusiastic thoughts about the project and reviewed our protocols for the minikit. As BiOutils is a platform which          takes care of the production and distribution of experiments for high schools for the whole Canton of Geneva, we          transmitted him our will to bring cell-free biology into the classes"

2.Transformation of B. megaterium with these plasmids
    We’ve tried a plenty of transformation protocols, including 1 for electroporation, 3 for PEG-P mediated protoplast transformation, 1 for kit of Bacilli transformation and 1 for B. subtilis’s chemical transformation. Each protocol was tried several times with a few adjustments each time. And finally, we worked out with the help of FAFU-iGEM. We propose that our failure in transformation of B. megaterium may results from three reasons, our lack of experience, our lab environment and the protocols themselves. We have gathered and arranged the transformation protocols for expression in B. megaterium for convenience of other teams if they are in need. Here’s the final protocol.
    2.1 Protoplast preparation
    a. A preculture of B. megaterium was grown overnight in 50 mL SMMP on a shaking platform (100 rpm) at 30 °C for a maximum of 16 h.
    b. 50 mL of SMMP was inoculated with 1 mL preculture, incubated at 37 °C, and shaken at 200 rpm until an OD578 of 1.0 was reached (~2 h).
    c. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,683 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in 5 mL SMMP.
    d. Lysozyme (100 μL 5 mg/mL dissolved in SMMP and ﬁlter sterilized) was added and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 100 rpm for 10–20 min until at least 50% of cells were protoplasts (as estimated by use of a light microscope).
    e. Protoplasts were incubated on ice for 30 min and then harvested at 1,400 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in 5 mL SMMP.
    f. Step 5 was repeated three times to remove excess lysozyme.
    g. After the ﬁnal resuspension in 5 mL SMMP, 652.5μL 100% glycerol were added and mixed. Aliquots (500 μL) were prepared and used fresh or stored at −80 °C (viable for 2 month).

Based on their experience with beekeeping in B.C., they recognized that an essential service to facilitate urban beekeeping is a beekeeping club. The explained that this would help in a variety of ways: That it would provide a source of information and support for new beekeepers, a collective organization to share tool, information, and expertise, and would also be a great resource for the government to fall back on in the case of a problem arising. They also mentioned that holding large-scale events such as press conferences may be counter-productive and further scare the community, and that it is more effective to educate people in smaller, more personal ways. They suggested beginning with those “who are comfortable and who understand” urban beekeeping. We took this into account with our human practices approaches, including the seed bombs and speaking to smaller groups rather than holding large presentations or events. Additionally, the beekeepers mentioned combining the more common gardening passion with beekeeping hobbyists, to create a partnership where both pollination and the growth of food sources can occur. We also asked them if they had had any experiences with mites. They stated that over their beekeeping career they have certainly experienced this. They noted, however, that it has not been an issue in Lethbridge thus far. We also asked them for their opinion on the feasibility and practicality of our project, and they raised concerns regarding contamination of the honey harvest. Specifically, there was concern over how the public would feel about the presence of oxalic acid in “honey, which is seen as such a natural product”. This is a factor which we have considered throughout the development of our project.
In general, beekeeping in Lethbridge has a relatively non-existent past, but a bright future. Minister Shannon Phillips provided valuable insight on both legal and civilian opinions of urban beekeeping, while the urban beekeepers provided information on the effectiveness and feasibility of urban beekeeping, and on ways to facilitate it within city limits. The questions, comments, opinions, and concerns of community were taken into consideration when developing our construct, and when evaluating the safety and ethics of our project.

3.2 Silence the PDE5A
cGMP is catabolized to 5’GMP by specific members of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) superfamily. Our goal to increase cGMP synthesis by overexpressing sGC was achieved, but this may also lead to increased cGMP catabolism through the up-regulation of PDE5A. Thus, we created novel circuit consisting U6 promoter followed by PDE5A shRNA to enhance the effects of sGC overexpression.
3.3 On-Off: Hypoxia-Inducible Promoter
Absolutely,the level of cGMP will be up regulated when we enhance cGMP synthesis and block its degradation at the same time.If the devices “overexpress sGC” and “silence PDE5A” work in myocardium cells overtime,it may lead several bad effects we don’t expect.To achieve controllable up-regulation of cGMP level in the cell, we also need a switch to up regulate cGMP only in ischemia or hypoxia situation.
We found that in mammalian cells, there is already a hypoxia-inducible system. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activates transcription via binding to highly variable hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) that are composite regulatory elements comprising the conserved HIF-binding site (HBS) with an A/GCGTG core sequence and a highly variable flanking sequence. Space between HBSs, distance from the core promoter, and orientation of HBSs are all connected with hypoxia-responsive activity. Following these rules, we design a HRE sequence and inserted it into the CMV promoter, ahead of the TATA box. We name the reconstructed CMV promoter as hypoxia-inducible promoter. To examine its function, we test an original CMV promoter submitted by the team Freiburg in 2012 as negative control, BBa_k747096 .Thus, we improved the characterization of a previously existing basic part.

Cold water was then added to the glass container and the AE blue-CBD fusion protein returned to its original blue color (Video 2). This testing shows a reversible, color changing, temperature sensitive fusion protein and is the prototype of a biologically based paper thermometer.

We also added a cellulose binding domain to the DNA2.0 chromoproteins using Gibson assembly. The sequence for these proteins were transformed into bacteria, expressed, extracted, and fix to cellulose sheets. Figure 29 shows the 2 cellulose binding domain chromoproteins (PrancerPurple and LeorOrange) on cellulose sheets. After being allowed to set for three days, we tested the binding capabilities of the cellulose binding domain by washing the cellulose sheet the chromoproteins were bound to with a steady stream of water for 1 minute. After this washing, no color change was detected, indicating that the cellulose binding domain was effective at fixing the chromoproteins to the sheet (Figure 30).

Testing the prototype
In collaboration with the Stanford High Altitude Ballooning Team , we field tested our AE Blue-CBD fusion protein at a high altitude. This AE Blue-CBD fusion protein was extracted from the cells that were expressing it and purified using dialysis to ensure that only the fusion protein remained for this experiment. Prior to the flight we obtained permission from the US Environmental Protection Agency and iGEM HQ. It is important to note that nothing living was sent into the environment to be tested and that our sample was recovered. No environmental contamination occurred as a result of this experiment.
Using our extracted fusion protein, we plated 20 µL drops onto a cellulose sheet that had had wax wells printed onto it (Figure 31). Every well seen in this image is from the same chromoprotein. This chromoprotein is the same as was seen earlier in the NASA logo heat test. Because there are higher levels of UV radiation in the atmosphere than are in our lab environment, we used UV-opaque and UV-transparent glass to cover the top and bottom row of the grid"

Procedure
Important: All steps in this protocol should be carried out aseptically
Inoculate: Prepare flask containing 5 ml of LB medium. Pick up a single colony of cells from plate (using a sterile toothpick) and swirl around inside flask. Incubate the culture overnight at 37°C with vigorous aeration (250 pm in a rotary shaker).
Dilute and incubate: Inoculate two aliquots of 495 ml of prewarmed LB medium in separate 2-liter flasks with 5 ml of the overnight bacterial culture. Incubate the flasks at 37°C with agitation (300 cycles/min in a rotary shaker). Measure the OD-600 every twenty minutes (this step will take around 1.5-2 hrs). (or judge the OD by eyes to avoid always taking the sample to disturb the growth as well as avoiding the contamination)
Rapidly cool culture: Once the OD-600 of the culture reaches 0.6-1.0 (Molecular Cloning recommends 0.4), rapidly transfer the flasks to the pre-made ice-water bath for 15-30 minutes. Swirl the culture occasionally to ensure that cooling occurs evenly. In preparation for the next step, place the centrifuge bottles in the ice-water bath as well.
Note: After this point, do not let your cells warm up past 4°C always keep on ice
Note: When harvesting cells by decanting, be very careful not to disturb the pellet-- this could result in a much lower yield. If necessary, aspirate instead or decant the supernatant. Ask someone to show you how to aspirate. Also, if the pellet seems loose, sometimes it is helpful to re-spin the cells down.
Centrifuge 1: Transfer the cultures to ice-cold centrifuge bottles. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000 g (2500 rpm) for 15 minutes at 4°C. Decant the supernantant and resuspend the cell pellet in 20 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol. Note: this should be done for each of the two 500ml cultures, i.e this is a 1:1 resuspension rather than a concentration by a factor of 2 BC.
Centrifuge 2 (10% glycerol): Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C. Decant the supernatant and resuspend"

Collaborating with Team Aachen
Like in all other fields of modern science, collaboration between different work groups is a beneficial way to combine experience and knowledge in order to achieve proper project results. For that reason, iGEM teams from all over the world collaborate to help each other with complex and challenging tasks on their way of accomplishing their specific project aims. In this year, our team joined forces with Aachen in order to improve both of our projects.
Since the primary purpose of our project was to design and create an artificial compartment, orthogonal peroxisomal protein import is one major part of achieving our objective. For that reason, we needed to deactivate natural protein import facilitated by the two receptor proteins Pex5 and Pex7. Initially, we possessed yeast strains which are deficient for Pex5 or Pex7, but we additionally planned to create a yeast cell line which is unable to express both import proteins, resulting in peroxisomes lacking luminal proteins which are called ‘ghosts’. Subsequently, we will integrate our own protein translocation system, allowing us to completely control the protein content of our artificial compartment. We consulted iGEM Aachen which already had lots of experience and knowledge regarding gene knockouts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The double knockout was performed successfully by team Aachen, allowing us to get rid of the natural peroxisomal protein import machinery. Conclusively, through this collaboration with team Aachen we were able to improve our final results significantly.
Thanks to the double knockout for the import proteins Pex5 and Pex7 we obtained completely empty ghosts. Thus, verification of the function of our orthogonal peroxisomal protein import machinery was feasible. We therefore accomplished to transfer our artificial Pex5"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," structure-based. Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which is featured as the most important part of our program. In addition, process of products generating is not as easy as just creating a new species with specific name, too. Their structures are required to be constructed under rules defined in MoDeL at the same time. The species matching and products generating modules are essential to implement our automatic modeling idea.
To complete the final systemn network from initial conditions, we break up the task to several parts:
Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file;
Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species;
For each template species found matching, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both at the same time;
For each template reaction found possible to occur, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction;
For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied for given constraints, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
Go to step 2 until the end of the species list;
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
Figure 1: Algorithm Flow Chart
Special reactions and volume strategy
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions. The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. It means number of mRNAs per DNA per second for transcriptions and number of proteins per mRNA per second for translations. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminator"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of"

Since our project consists of talking with microorganisms, we asked ourselves the question “what would happen if they lied to us?” Not consciously, of course, but mutants who give different answers to the same question could be evolutionarily favored in a bacterial culture. Our HP team addressed this issue in an integrated fashion: both in public debates and in the lab.
Our Human Practices team and topics play a central and integrated role in our iGEM project. Not only did we explore ethical concerns of our activity, but also we coordinated our work in the lab to test our “lying bacteria” vision. We addressed the questions above in two ways:
1. Debating: We decided to shoot a short film to give insight and a jumping off point to our integrated vision. We discussed it with different audiences in public debates in three different European countries. We then analyzed their comments and response to the short film. We wanted to discuss ethical issues such as: What if this talking technology was used in everyday devices and they lied? How would people react to this? Should the blame be given to companies developing those devices? How frequently would mutants appear? Imagine that this technology was hackable. What ethical issues would arise?
2. Modeling and wetlab : Together with the modeling team, we carried out experiments in the wetlab to predict how often those liars or cheaters would appear in cultures and compared the fitness of cheaters against the original culture.

Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#NoteBook#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html," Laborkittel (lose) nähen, z.B. für die Nano-Reportage. Hierzu herrschte allgemeines Interesse. Aus diesem Grund werden nun die Kosten ermittelt und Probeexemplare verlangt.
Modellsimulation:
Kristian weist darauf hin, dass wir Simulanten benötigen, die unser System mathematisch erfassen (Differenzialgleichungen zu beispielsweise Promoterstärken, Plasmide mit unterschiedl. Effizienz etc.). Ziel ist der Entwurf eines mathematischen Modells mit Hilfe von Mat-Lab, was entkoppelt von der Lab-Arbeit laufen soll.  Es stellt sich die Frage, ob sich jemand im Team (mathematische Begabung erwünscht :) ) damit befassen möchte oder ob Informatiker/Mathematiker/Physiker gesucht werden sollen. Sven merkt an, dass es zu Mat-Labs ein Seminar gibt, für das man sich allerdings früh genug anmelden muss. Außerdem müssen Lizenzen für dieses Programm beantragt werden.
Fun:
Asia Woche im Aldi
Grillen: Mittwoch (16.6.) ab 18 Uhr auf dem Dach der Fachschaft. Die damalige ]Mitbring-Tabelle“ wird übernommen (siehe: Meeting 14.5.2010). Wenn jemand nicht dabei ist, bitte bescheid sagen - die, die sich nicht eingetragen haben und was mitbringen: sehr gerne :)
Movie-Night in der Zoologie: findet als Kooperation zwischen iGEM und Fachschaft statt. Nächste Woche wird es hierzu (mal wieder) eine Doodle-Umfrage geben.
Kanufahren: Die Sondergenehmigungen für das Naturschutzgebiet kommen nächste Woche. Es wird noch nach einer Grillstelle für nach dem Kanufahren gesucht. Eine detaillierte E-mail wird Jessy noch rumschicken (Vielen Dank schonmal für die Orga!).
To do:
1. Theoretisch:
Wo genau befindet sich die Kernlokalisationssequenz? Adrian weist hierzu auf die N-Termini von VP1 und VP2 hin. Genaueres sollte noch recherchiert werden!
Proteomics-Analyse finden. Kristian kann sich nicht vorstellen, dass DNA alleine verpackt wird.
2. Praktisch:

PCR lasR (BBa_C0079). The purpose of this PCR was to add the RBS (BBa_K143021), through addition of the sequence in the primer foward, and also to remove the LVA tag. In our primers we only added the restriction sites X and S, so we still need to put it in the pSB1C3 for the Biobrick standard completion. When standardized this part will be called BBa_K1521001.
