Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Having originally been discovered in 1995 during an in vitro screening for antibodies against cytomegaloviral proteins [7] , the A3C5 antibody is an established molecular tool for specific recognition of proteins. By tagging cell surface proteins with an epitope specifically recognized by A3C5 (being a peptide sequence of 11 amino acids), one is easily able to detect tagged proteins via immunofluorescence microscopy, FACS or one may purify them via pulldown experiments. Through the latter, one may also screen for in vivo interaction partners of the tagged protein.
mRuby 3
Having originally been engineered as a monomeric form of the red fluorescent protein eqFP611, mRuby variants are some of the brightest red fluorescent proteins available. [8] With an excitation maximum at a wavelength of 558 nm and an emission wavelength maximum of 605 nm, the resulting stokes shift of 57 nm makes mRuby a good choice for fluorescent microscopy imaging and, thus, allows the visualization of the receptor in its cellular environment by being fused to the C-terminus of the transmembrane domain. mRuby is especially powerful for the fusion with receptors - not only due to its small size and high stability, but also due to the fact that, in comparison with eGFP, it appears up to 10 times brighter in membrane enviroments. The mRuby variant used here is mRuby 3, having been engineered for even more improved brightness and photostability. [9]
Strep-tag II
The Strep-tag II is an eight amino acid peptide sequence (WSHPQFEK) that specifically interacts with streptavidin and can thus be used for easy one-step purification of the receptor via biochemical and immunochemical methods. [10]
Nanoluciferase
The concept of bioluminescence has a great meaning for several invertebrate species, allowing communication with other individuals, signaling receptiveness or deterring predators. [11] The most common enzyme responsible for the creation of bioluminescence are the luciferases (from the latin words ’lux’ and ’ferre’, meaning ’light-carrier’).  These enzymes, among others found in fireflies and deep-sea shrimp, commonly consume a substrate called luciferin as well as energy in the form of ATP or reduction equivalents in order to create light-emission through oxidation. The underlying mechanism hereby relies on the creation of an instable, highly excited intermediate under the consumption of energy. This high-energy intermediate then spontaneously falls back into a state of lower energy, emitting the"

Virtual assembly results of A* and B* parts on GEntle software: gentle-beta.synbiota.com
A* is LasR Holin Biobrick, in which pLas, the promoter sensitive to LasR protein, determines level of T4Holin transcription.
Previous IDT-ordered A* part had pLas and Holin going in one direction, and inducible transcription of LasR going onto the other direction in the same plasmid.
However, we are putting A1 (pLas-Holin) and A2(LasR) in different plasmid in Synbiota construct of A*. E.Coli that contain both A1 and A2 are designed to show up after transformation, by selecting ChlR A1 and AmpR A2 using both antibiotics.
B* is LasR GFP biobrick. Design of the circuit is identical to A*; we can think that GFP has replaced T4Holin. Level of transcription is dependent on LasR concentration generated by A2.
Questions to Patrick:
We have copied promoter and RBS strength of A2 constructs from your web seminar video. Could you confirm that our promoter and RBS strength in A1 and B constructs are compatible with those in A2?
We have chosen highest copy number of the plasmid(Ori3) for all of the constructs- is there any potential problems with doing this?

Native metabolism or metabolic engineering of biochemical pathways enables the production of desired chemicals and fuels, for example, biomass-derived gasoline alternatives.
Medium- and long-chain hydrocarbons can potentially serve as replacements for diesel, rendering them an attractive target for microbial production from lignocellulosic feedstocks. Unlike ethanol, the low water solubility of longer carbon chain-length hydrocarbons should result in reduced recovery costs and reduced toxicity in the fermentation broth due to phase separation. These hydrocarbons are also more likely to be compatible with existing transport and storage infrastructure and vehicle engines, and possess higher cloud points than biodiesel blends, enabling year-round usage in all climates. 
Two major biochemical pathways exist for production:
The first pathway is the isoprenoid biosynthesis, where precursor molecules from central metabolism are used to generate isopentenyl diphoshate and its isomerized product, dimethylallyl diphosphate.
The second pathway is fatty acid biosynthesis, for which acetyl-CoA (or rarely propionyl-CoA) serves as the precursor and for which long-chain. A number of natural products can also be generated through this pathway including free fatty acids (FFAs), phospholipids and di- and triacylglycerols, alkanes and olefins, fatty alcohols, methyl ketones, and esters of fatty acids.
We chose E.coli as the host organism to develop a microbial conversion process of a target compound. Metabolic engineering offers the opportunity to genetically modify E.coli to optimize production of the naturally produced compound via single gene or entire pathway manipulation. Why we chose E.coli?
Why we chose E.coli?
Because we have well-developed genetic engineering and synthetic biology tools; understanding of their metabolism, physiology, and gene regulation; and rapid and well-developed protocols for transformation and recombination, addition to its diversity of carbon utilization( eg. ability to readily metabolize pentose sugars) and rapid growth rate.

For that reason, we sent an email to them asking if they could share their biobricks Bba_K245005 and Bba_K245113 with us.  They answered us and offered their help. But their shipment never arrived. Anyway, later we realized that those parts are not fully suitable for our needs.
Also, some of us had the privilege to assist to a lecture of Andrew Hessel, an authority in Synthetic Biology from USA. Unexpectedly, he had a slide about us! (He found out about us in Internet). He said he was surprised that Chile had an iGEM team working in a forefront discipline such as Synthetic Biology.
But most importantly, we designed our first secretion constructs, consisting of a GFP Reporter Plasmid, a Protease Producer Plasmid (see section constructs for more information) and a working plasmid. This last plasmid is used as an intermediate plasmid to build the other two plasmids. We ordered the primers that we need (it takes about two weeks until they arrive!)

We met with Ignacio Ibarra, an undergraduate student of the group of Dr. Francisco Melo.  He is willing to advise us in the area of protein modeling. The problem is that spider silk proteins are semi-crystalline and is difficult to predict its structure. He recommended starting with a comparative protein analysis between our spider silk monomer of interest and other similar proteins that have its structure available in PDB.  The idea is that from the structure of those similar proteins we will have a reference of the most stable conformation of our monomer. Later we should be able to improve the self-assembling of the proteins or improve some mechanical properties, such as elasticity and tenacity. Nevertheless, we were warned: protein modeling is a complex and slow task.
Recommended software: -MOE: to add hydrogen atoms. -Autodock: a suite of automated docking tools. This should be useful to evaluate the self-assembly of our monomers. -Force Field: to calculate potentials between particles. Finally, something very important happened: Christopher A.

When E. coli is targeted with single-stranded oligos, Beta stabilizes them inside the cell and facilitates homologous recombination into the genome, see Figure 3. Interestingly, this targeting is many-fold more effective, if the oligo is targeting the lagging strand compared to the leading strand [20,21,23,24]. Based on this observation, it is proposed that Beta functions through binding to the lagging strand of the replication fork and by stabilizing oligo integration between discontinuous Okazaki fragments [20,24].
Figure 3. Proposed mechanism for function of Beta in oligo recombineering during DNA replication. Beta stabilises oligo that is incorporated between discontinious Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand [23]. From Carr et al. 2014.
MAGE becomes multiplex and automated, when the oligo recombineering steps are repeated multiple times. In short, the cells are first grown to mid-log phase, followed by induction of Beta. The cells are then chilled to 4°C and washed in multiple steps to improve their competence. The oligos are added to the cells which are then electroporated. The cycle is repeated every 2-3 hours allowing the cells to recover in between rounds of electroporation, see Figure4 [22].

Chip-based oligonucleotide synthesis
Traditional column-based oligo synthesis is costly for large scale MAGE experiments. Synthesis of 1,000 90-mer column-based oligos costs approximately $36,000 USD [25]. An alternative to this method is the use of Microchip DNA arrays. Microchips become advantageous when the number of oligos increases. With Microchip DNA arrays it is possible to synthesize up to 12,472 different 130-mer oligos for 2,000 USD and up to 92,918 oligos for 5,000 USD [26].
The oligos are synthesized with two 20 nucleotide flanking sequences (barcodes). These barcodes must include a thymidine immediately upstream and a DpnII restriction site immediately downstream of the oligo, while the rest of the barcodes can be designed for amplification with a specific primer. By using different barcodes, it is possible to design one"

This week, we decided to express our Gb3 mimic peptide in N99 cells and investigate its presence in the spent medium. For the same, we transformed the     cells with our Gb3 mimic clone, followed by primary and secondary growth. Once the optical density of the secondary culture reached about 0.7, it was     induced with N-Acyl Homoserine Lactone (3OC8HSL) for 3 hours. Two culture tubes (50mL, induced and un-induced) were centrifuged and the spent medium was     collected for lyophilization.
Meanwhile, the Bioinformatics mini-team started docking studies between the peptide and the toxin on numerous servers such as SwissDock, AutoDock, Hex,     SwarmDock, ZDock, PatchDock and Rosetta. However, the binding modes predicted by these servers were not as expected.
M04W16: The One With the Detective HPLC: (15th -21th Sept)
Lyophilization was completed and the spent medium samples were stored at -80oC till further use. This week, we wanted to test the presence of our peptide     in the spent medium by performing a reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (reverse HPLC). A C18 column was used for the same.
In the later half of the week, we visited local butcher and meat shops with the purpose of creating awareness through our guidebook titled “Code Red.” For     the purpose of the meat-vendors who, we expected, would not be comfortable with English, we translated the guidebook in several vernacular Indian languages     like Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Hindi and Marathi. It was an interesting session where we got to understand the mentality and the thought process of local     meat butchers and tried to spread awareness about our project.

Genetic engineered bacteria which use plasmid as expression vector are widely                                 employed in many social domains and developed rapidly these years. However,                                 the plasmid segregational instability has been the limitation of scientific                                 research and large-scale industry production for plasmid-based expression system.
So, what’s the plasmid segregational instability?
font-family: 'Nixie One', cursive;
It’s known that uneven cell division arises frequently which is bound to                                 produce two daughter cells with different plasmid numbers. The cell with                                 less plasmids will produce cells with much less plasmids.
In our project, those cells with not enough plasmid number is called as ‘Slacker’, in the contrary, ‘Worker’ is the name for cells with enough plasmid.
font-family: 'Imprima', sans-serif;
The existence of slackers will sharply decrease the efficiency and profit due to the slacker’s                                 increasing proliferation ability while producing no target substances.
font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;
There is no efficient way to prevent the birth of the slackers. Can we make                                 the bacteria themselves monitor the plasmid losing situation and eliminate these slackers?                                 In this way, we can enhance the plasmid stability,                                 stabilize the microbial population structure and finally improve the production efficiency.

Overview
This year, we have done the two improvement work:
1. We improved the characterization of biobrick: BBa_K1583003 which was originally characterized by iGEM15_TU_Delft.
2. We optimized the codons for a major functional part of Hydrogenase, HydA. This biobrick: BBa_K535002 was originally designed by: iGEM11_UNAM-Genomics_ Mexico.

Summary: We created new way to characterize this biobrick which was originally designed and characterized by iGEM15_TU_Delft. We utilize NTA-Metal-Histag coordination chemistry and fluorescence emission traits of Quantum Dots (QDs) in our project to improve the characterization. We demonstrated the validity of the approach for measurement of biofilm composed by CsgA-His density of E. coli curli system and think highly of this characterization for its general application in other biofilm systems. Also, we utilized TEM to help us scrutinize the binding effect in microscopic world.
>Improvement:
Quantum dots binding test
In order to test the effect of binding between CsgA-Histag mutant and inorganic nanoparticles, we apply same amount of suspended QDs solution into M63 medium which has cultured biofilm for 72h. After 1h incubation, we used PBS to mildly wash the well, and the result was consistent with our anticipation: On the left, CsgA-Histag mutant were induced and thus secreted biofilm, and firmly attached with QDS and thus show bright fluorescence. Therefore, we ensure the stable coordinate bonds between CsgA-Histag mutant and QDs can manage to prevent QDs from being taken away by liquid flow. The picture was snapped by ChemiDoc MP,B"

Guidati dal professor Roland Eils, un gruppo di studenti dell´universita´di Heidelberg sta mettendo a punto una “macchina biologica” in grado di localizzare e successivamente eliminare organismi patogenici o perfino cellule cancerogene – 84 squadre provenienti da tutto il mondo stanno partecipando alla competizione di Biologia Sintetica iGEM 2008.
iGEM (Competizione Internazionale di Macchine Costruite Geneticamente) e´una competizione organizzata, a partire dal 2005, dall´Istituto Tecnologico del Massachusetts (MIT), situato a Boston, Stati Uniti d´America, e ormai divenuta una delle competizioni internazionali piu´prestigiose in campo scientifico.  Quest´anno si scontreranno 84 squadre di studenti universitari, tra cui per la prima volta figurano tre squadre tedesche. Il progetto della squadra di Heidelberg e´ sotto la direzione del professor Roland Eils, che e´affiliato sia con l´Universita´di Heidelberg che col Centro Tedesco di Ricerca sul Cancro (DKFZ).

III.Pathway for bio-safety—kill switch
To prevent bacterial leakage, we designed two toxin-antitoxin pathways to ensure that bacteria will commit suicide once they escape from the environment we provide. We use riboswitch to identify the different environment, antitoxic is continuously expressed but it can’t prevent the killing effect of toxins on cells, unless the corresponding counterpart of the riboswitch, theophylline, is added, and the antitoxin can inhibit the toxicity of the background expression level of the toxin[2].
  Prefix + lac operator + parE+ riboswitch +parD + suffix
  Prefix + lac operator + MazE + riboswitch + MazF + suffix
1.MazF/MazE toxic-antitoxic switch
Because theophylline itself may be harmful to cells, as a substance that turns off the riboswitch, we first made a gradient dilution and found the mildest range for the bacteria.
Figure 14 This picture shows the effect of theophylline to the E.coli.
Although we used a lower concentration of theophylline in this pathway, we finally found that this pathway did not work.
2. ParD/ParE  toxic-antitoxic switch
We performed a second pathway validation with a lower theophylline concentration.
Figure 15 This picture shows the result of ParD/ParE pathway
We can drew the results that this pathway can work and the best effect of theophylline concentration is 0.2g/L.

The band for the His-MBP of empty vector is missing (or very weak), which might be due to the lower expression, but one can clearly detect the bands corresponding to the His-MBP in the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Our results strongly indicate that the previously described adhesion of the peptides to S. pneumoniae works. Thus, our BioBricks BBa_K1351001 , BBa_K1351002 and BBa_K1351003 should serve as a tool for adhesion to S. pneumoniae.
Killing
A key aspect of our project is the killing module, which enables BaKillus to dispatch pathogens. Therefore, we implement a variety of killing strategies into our chassis.
One of our killing factors is subtilin, a lanthionine-containing antimicrobial peptide. Just like other lantibiotics, it is active against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria by inhibiting the cell wall synthesis and the formation of membrane pores. The latter leads to the depolarisation of the membrane and thus, to rapid cell death. We decided to use subtilin, as it is natively produced by Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633, a close relative to our chassis. additionally lantibiotics are considered to be an alternative to classical antibiotics (to which many bacteria already developed resistance).
Another killing factor is lysostaphin, a metallo-endopeptidase, which lysates the cell wall of some Staphylococcus species. Since this enzyme is highly specific, and S. aureus is especially sensitive towards lysostaphin, this is an ideal killing strategy for our BaKillus. In addition, lysostaphin shows no signs of toxicity and a very low potential for allergic reactions in first tests on animals and humans.
Since pathogens are often protected by biofilms and thus not very sensitive towards killing agents, dispersin was integrated as an auxiliary device. This glycosaminhydrolase destroys biofilms of many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including S. aureus, making them more susceptible for antibiotics and other pathogen defeating agents.
Both, lysostaphin and dispersin were developed as BioBricks and tested in B. subtilis by the iGEM Team iGEM12_Lyon_INSA in 2012. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these two S. aureus defeating agents.

Previous work done by others
Previous work realize the plasmid maintenance                                 through making the plasmid encode essential factors for the host.
Resistance screening and auxotrophic bacteria are depended on the selecting process [1].                                 The plasmid-free bacteria cannot survive under specific selections, such as antibiotics.                                 However, it’s not applicable for industrial fermentation. What’s worse, the unlimited                                 use of antibiotics has raised worldwide concern due to its potential risk which may cause antibiotic resistance,                                 degrade the capacity of the immune system and finally develop to a big social problem.
According to the natural mechanisms for plasmid maintenance, many new strategies are                                 developed, so called plasmid addiction system (PAS) or post-segregational killing                                 system (PSK) [2]. However, these mechanisms are still under exploration and the                                 capacity of plasmid maintenance is not ideal since most of them can only ensure                                  one plasmid remains, can’t truly realize the quantitative control as we hope.
What’s the difference
 Quantitative control
Most existing methods for enhancing biosynthetic performance are stuck                                 at the level of resistance screening or rely on natural mechanisms                                 for plasmid maintenance. These methods have the same problem: there is                                 no clear definition for high- and low-performance variants, or said differently,                                 those methods can’t define a number or a range as the threshold of plasmids’ concentration.
In our project, we can not only set a threshold to control the number of plasmids, but also                                 regulate it as we need by using the different biobricks. That is what we say—quantitative control.
 No human intervention
There is a step called spawn rejuvenation in the existing large-scale                                 industrial production procedure.                                 It’s useful to maintain the microbial population structure, but costs plenty of time and money.
Our design has great potential to simplify the process of spawn rejuvenation                                 as well as increase the profit for companies. We use an intracellular signal                                 correlated with the plasmid numbers, and realize the selection process without                                 any human interference. Through keeping the plasmid numbers above a threshold,                                 we can realize the population quality control and improve the production efficiency.
 No antibiotics
As we know, the employed antibiotics must be removed in pharmaceutical or GMP-based fermentation                                 processes and it’s not an applicable option in industrial fermentation.
As an antibiotics-free project, we can improve the previous approaches by                                 making the process of plasmid-control more environment-friendly.

But, due to the unbalanced expression of upstream and downstream proteins and the limit of their sequence lengths, we proposed a new strategy based on 2A peptide expression system. This system is based on a self-cleaving 2A peptide and much more efficient to cleave the upstream of 2A peptide. Comparing to the widely used method, multiple plasmids for transformation, Viral 2A peptide system not only works in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but also performs much more efficiently than that of plasmids, especially in C. reinhardtii. 2A peptides system was firstly discovered in Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). 2A peptide is a linker which used to separate functional proteins between upstream and downstream, and the length is about 18-22 amino acids long. 'Ribosomal skip' occurs during translation that results in production of independent peptides or proteins from one polycistronic. After cleavage, the 2A peptide remains fused to the C-terminus of the upstream protein when the proline is linked to the N-terminus of the downstream as Figure7. According to the Thomas's research, 2A peptide system has proved the high-efficiency of co-expression and cleavage in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
 
Therefore, we decided to construct the expression system to co-express Cry and Cyt genes in single vector based on 2A peptide system
7.Toxin Groups
As mentioned in the Action mode of Cry and Cyt toxins, Cyt can increase the toxicity of Cyt. Therefore, we designed various toxin groups based on the 2A-peptide system as following figure8.
 
 
Considering the bias of codon in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii, the synthesis biology company helped us to synthesis the Cry10Aa-2A-Cyt1, Cry10Aa-2A-Cyt2, Cry11Aa-2A-Cyt1, Cry11Aa-2A-Cyt2, Cry4Aa-2A-Cyt1, Cry4Aa-2A-Cyt2 toxin gene groups.

Oxford,2016,Team:Oxford#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"T resulted in the same two point mutations in the sfGFP region of this part making it non-functional. To compare this promoter system to the others we designed, we used our parts with chelator-sfGFP fusions instead of the sfGFP which we expected to have similar behaviour.
pCopA with divergent expressed CueR
To facilitate making any protein under control of a copper-responsive promoter we designed a part ( BBa_K1980006 ) similar to the above pCopA sfGFP with divergent expressed CueR but without the sfGFP. The RBS however is still present meaning that any protein with the ATG biobrick prefix and universal suffix can be inserted with biobrick standard assembly with the correct RBS-ATG distance.
pCopA CueR sfGFP/ Feedback pCopA sfGFP
The design of part BBa_K1980008
We designed a part similar to the above but with CueR expressed from the same pCopA promoter that it controls in order to study CueR operating under a feedback loop. If CueR is acting as a net activator, this should in theory act as a positive feedback system whereby a small amount of copper stimulation produces more CueR causing greater activation. Should CueR be acting as a net repressor this system would be less sensitive than our previous system and this appears to be what we discovered.
A BspH1 site was included at the start codon of the sfGFP so that other proteins with a compatible start (such as the copper chelators we ligated into our pBAD vector) could be ligated into this location.
Plate reader data for BBa_K1980008 after 4 hours
CusS/CusR linked systems
The second system E. coli uses to respond to copper is the CusS/CusR two-component system. This consists of the transmembrane histidine kinase enzyme: CusS in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and a cytoplasmic response regulator: CusR.
When CusS binds periplasmic copper it transfers a phosphate group from ATP to CusR aspartate residue 51 via CusS histidine residue 271. Phosphorylated CusR can bind to DNA inverted repeat CusR boxes (AAAATGACAANNTTGTCATTTT) and activate gene expression.
In E. coli this box is present between the promoters for CusCFBA operon which encodes a multi-protein pump that exports cytoplasmic and periplasmic"

""Is livestock breeding more ethical than the usage of synthetic life? Which way is the best and the most ecological? What is your decision?""
Christian Kieschnick
Product Description
This synthetic biodegradable bin is a synthetic organ system which uses up all of your biological waste and provides you with energy and milk. With our product you are supporting a world without miserable industrial food productions. 'BioBin' has the same characteristics of a cow, but is cleaner and feels no pain.
Technical Description
BioBin is a fully-synthetic organ system developed by our organ engineering core. The system consists of a organprotect-chamber giving the organ tissue an optimal living environment. The front of the 'BioBin' is funneled to allow easy insertion of all of your biological waste. The carbons contained in your organic waste can now by synthesized into milk by the bin's internal organism. Some of the remaining waste products are transformed into methane, which can be used to produce energy. The product is designed to be used like a little gas stove. The entire process is complete after just 14 hours. Any waste products are stored in a box at the top of the 'BioBin'. These revoked substrates can be used to fertilise your garden and potted plants, or can simply be flushed down the toilet.ical modules, so that a new moss type can be assembled in the final stage and synthesized by our treehugger-scientists.

Results from the 2011 iGEM Americas Regionals
We are pleased to report that iGEM Calgary came home with a gold medal and two of the eight special awards: Best Wiki and Best Experimental Measurement for our electrochemical reporter . We will be proceeding on to the World Jamboree at MIT in November, after further refining of our project. Stay tuned for more on this!
See the rest of the Regionals results here !
The University of Calgary iGEM Team has had many accomplishments this summer:
In our promoter project...
We designed a novel protocol to identify small hydrophobic molecule interactors within a cell.
We were able to successfully biotinylate a naphthenic acid, suggesting that it is possible to biotinylate other small hydrophobic molecules as well. This may be used to screen for various small molecule interactors.
We identified a gene that is up-regulated in the presence of naphthenic acids, and cloned its promoter (putative) and submitted it to the registry as a stand-alone part, as well as part of a reporter system (with lacZ, oriT, and ori1600).
In our Reporter Project...
We characterized a novel reporter function for the lacZ gene using an electrochemical output.
We laid the groundwork for future use of electrochemical reporting in iGEM.
In our Chassis project...
We characterized a Pseudomonas-E. coli conjugation construct
We submitted parts and protocols for future work in both microalgae and Pseudomonas
We characterized the viability of Pseudomonas and E. coli to grow and"

Random initial conditions
Negative control
The videos above show the results of simulations that were run    at the Flemish Supercomputer Center.    Three different initial conditions similar to those used in    the colony level model were used.    The first and second initial conditions correspond to    colonies of both cell types arranged into a block and     a star-shaped pattern respectively. Cell type B can be seen    fleeing the colonies due to the production of AHL and leucine    by cell type A. Therefore the system evolves qualitatively in    the same way as in the colony level model.
However, the model exhibits very different behavior when    the initial positions of bacteria are random. Whereas    the colony level model did not evolve into any convincing    pattern, cell types A and B clearly separate into different    domains in our hybrid model. Cells of type A cluster into blob-like    formations while cells of type B fill up the space in between.    Our hypothesis therefore is that the sticky membrane proteins    expressed by cells A is crucial for the formation of regular patterns.    To verify this, we performed a negative control by disabling    the attractive cell-cell interactions and running the simulation    under the same conditions. The results are similar to the    colony level model in the sense that there is very little to no pattern    formation to be seen. Therefore we can conclude from the hybrid model    simulations    that cell-cell interactions will play a crucial role in the pattern    formation in our system.
Furthermore, by developing the hybrid model in parallel with    the colony level model we were able to compare the results and    demonstrate the    usefulness of incorporating an agent-based module into our    modeling approach. It allowed us to calculate cell-cell interactions    into our simulations which were otherwise not possible to model    and eventually lead us to valuable    insights into the mechanisms of pattern formation.
Incorporation of Internal Model
In this model, we have ignored the inner life of bacteria. This  includes gene expression, signal transduction, quorum sensing etcetera.  Instead we assumed that AHL and leucine production is directly  proportional to the density of type A cells. As the internal model however  demonstrates, this is a very rough approximation.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," amount of enzyme required to completely digest 1 ug of DNA in one hour at 37 degrees C in 50 uL of assay buffer containing Acetylated BSA added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/uL.""
EcoRI has 12 u/uL while SpeI has 10 u/uL.  For future reference, XbaI has 12 u/uL, PstI has 10 u/uL, and NotI has 10 u/uL.
For 10 ug of DNA, one will need 1 uL of SpeI and 0.83 uL of EcoRI.
For Z0842, one can use 38 uL of plasmid, to give 1.657 ug of DNA.  This would require 1.657 units of each enzyme which translates into 0.127 uL of EcoRI and 0.1526 uL SpeI.  However, one can probably use 1 uL of each just to be safe.    In such a case, one will add no water.  This will yield a 50 uL reaction.
For Z0279, one can use 38 uL of plasmid, to give 4.150 ug of DNA.  This would require 4.150 units of each enzyme which translates into 0.346 uL of EcoRI and 0.415 uL SpeI.  However, one can probably use 1 uL of each just to be safe.    In such a case, one will add no water.  This will yield a 50 uL reaction.
For pRS306, one can use 38 uL of plasmid, to give 5.103 ug of DNA.  This would require 5.103 units of each enzyme which translates into 0.425 uL of EcoRI and 0.510 uL SpeI.  However, one can probably use 1 uL of each just to be safe.    In such a case, one will add no water.  This will yield a 50 uL reaction.
It should be noted that EcoRI has star activity in the presence of multicore buffer so the restriction digest should not proceed for too long.  Placed in incubator for 1 hour then denatured enzymes on heat block at 70 degrees for 10 min.  Put in freezer in preparation for next step tomorrow.
Decided to postpone the linearization reactions until tomorrow since we were lacking BstEII.

ITESM_Mexico,2011,Team:ITESM Mexico#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," a protein used for the cleavage of protein lambda. It has shown that it has a cleavage activity when its binded to lambda repressor. This is a essential part of the project, because these interactions are the link between the photoreceptor and the concentration mechanims by the lambda repressor and the lambda operators. (Sauer et al, 1981)
Concentration:
The concentration mechanism is based in the experiments and mechanisms developed by British Columbia University iGEM team in 2009 ( https://2009.igem.org/Team:British_Columbia ).  This  is the part we focused on improving from the original idea. Basically the experiment was the same, there are only few changes from the original construct, like the addition of an anti-sense key to stop the action of the key that disables the capability of the reporter protein to express.
The construct is very similar to the one from UBC. We took the pieces Pbad st for sensing low concentrations and Pbad wk for sensing high concentrations. We re-designed the activation/inactivation (lock and key) based on the experiments of lock and key developed by UBC in 2009 and the control of gene expression (Isaacs et al,2004)
We re-designed some pieces to make them more specific, we modified the lock and key mechanism, and added more parts, one lock and key specific for the high concentration and other lock and key designed for low concentrations. Also the inclusion of one new part that regulates one of the keys by inactivating it.
The first part of the second construct consists in the constitutive promoter that produces the lambda repressor protein. This lambda repressor binds to the operators, inhibiting the expression of the mechanisms of concentration expression. The operators interacts with the repressor lambda inhibiting the action of the RNA polymerase to transcribe the sequence.
The next link is between the concentration mechanism and the lambda repressor. Those are the operators, that can be found before the promoter Pbad st. these operators are responsible for the binding of lambda repressor protein and for the expression of the reporter protein. If the operators are free then there can be expression. ::Operators can only be free once the RecA protein cleavages the lambda repressor, so the expression can be continued. Then the Pbad st can activate the expression of the reporter protein GFP, but there is a previous step where there is the first lock (crxst);  This first lock inhibits the expression of the reporter protein and that’s why at the same concentration with the same promoter there is the activation of our key"

Overall Project
The ultimate goal of USTC_Software 2010 team is to promote synthetic biology throughout the world. To attract more people who do not have biology background to be interested in this area, we plan to develop a modeling-and-simulation game specially designed for synthetic biology. Users are taught to learn the basic knowledge in the area via constructing their genetic circuits as input to our software and try to understand the system behavior as output. This is the basic functional module. We also plan to develop a rating system to grade users' design for given tasks, and a more friendly game interface that can fill the process of input with joy and ease. Though more functions are expected, we focus on the basic module, modeling-and-simulation, at the first stage of our project.
In practice, many CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as guides. However, they all need users to provide details of the system network, such as the activation and repression of transcription and translation reactions in genetic regulatory network. It is so difficult for even professionals to construct a detailed network of a complex system depending only on their minds. In this sense, modeling through CAD tools will not reduce the work of modeling: users are actually required to model manually and input their model in details.
However, since our software is developed for non-biological background users, it is unrealistic to expect them to model their design manually. To solve this problem, the USTC_Software 2010 team attempts to take synthetic biology modeling one step further by introducing new methods for automatic modeling of biological systems. Just as the word automation implies, users are only required to submit their assembling of parts, and the generation of biological model is automatically done by our program. Being the first-ever team trying to develop a synthetic biology automatic modeling tool, we focus on genetic regulatory network for the first year and develop our software tool, iGa"

SKLBC-DGSYZX,2015,Team:SKLBC-DGSYZX#Medals_-_-_TEXT.html," three learning periods: basic teaching which requires a time-saving tool that is easy to learn and to use, learning engine that needs a good interaction between users and the software so as to offer more chances to explore potential possibility of the work, and automatic learning in great request of a model to reach a well-spread standardization. Although some of the current graphic-design tools such as Photoshop are efficient, they do not have a certain standard, therefore leading to a confusing visual effect for both judges and iGEM learners to go through the various genetic circuits in different projects. And other tools are too difficult to learn. The student interviewee complained that her team had to incorporate several students major in design and computer science to help them deal with the design of the genetic circuits and that even those professional students had to spend about a month to fully master the use of some graphic-design tools like Adobe Illustrator. During the interviews, the student said that due to the lack of time, method and good interaction, iGEMers are often in great need of a standardized, interactive, systematic synthetic biology learning software.
Does the team present a convincing case that their product meets the customers’ needs?
Based on the interviews, our team has learned that there are three periods during learning: the first is basic teaching, which requires a  certain amount of time. With Synsketch, users don’t need to start from lines when they want to design the genetic circuits for experiment. Just chose the design elements they want and then drag it to a suitable place, so that a standardized picture is completed. Also, if users make a mistake, not like other tools as Photoshop, Synsketch is available for them to revise their genetic circuits both quickly and accurately. And Synsketch is easy to learn and it takes only a time to make a cup of coffee to get the mastery of it, therefore saving lots of time in the basic teaching period.
The second period, learning engine period, calls for a good interaction. Users can easily interact with Synsketch by applying the software to learn more about synthetic biology parts involved in the experiment. And Synskecth also establishes a good connection within the whole iGEM community. As user finishes his genetic circuit online, a QR code is generated and he can share it to his friends by scanning the QR code. And he can also store the diagrams in his wechat ID and share them through wechat, one of the most pervasive social tools in China with more than 549million users per month. User can still upload the data to the website, a cloud base. Through the cloud data base, IGEMers are"

Beta Testing Initiative
This year Michigan Software focused on beta testing as a form of collaboration. We sent out a call to all iGEM teams through several mediums, and received responses from the iGEM teams of MSU, Carroll High School, IIT Madras, Westminster University, the University of Florida, and our sister team Michigan Synthetic Biology. The teams followed instructions to upload a protocol and viewed several of the key features of our site, and were then asked to provide feedback. For example, they were asked what information might also be useful to have when searching for protocols. The complete survey guiding the testing can be found here (https://goo.gl/forms/TJOCenKrEzsICL2g1) (embed this later).
Through this collaboration, we gained quite valuable feedback and insight into how scientists and science students not only use our software, but how they see it and what improvements they believe we should implement. As a software team comprised mainly of computer science students, this feedback is essential to the further development of our software. It helps us determine whether or not our project is useful to the target community. In exchange for their feedback, we provided assistance to the teams with their wikis. If they encountered issues while formatting or styling their wikis, we helped them with the HTML and web design aspects, areas of software where we have expertise.

Needless to say, average expression rate shows a fine deceasing Gradient graphic, indicated that our system could not only determine the existence of microRNA but also the quantity of microRNA as well.
3 Test Device 2.0
Considering the feedback result from human practices, we designed Device 2.0
Before any experiment, we can’t determine which kind of repressor would provide the best initial intensity. Therefore we designed 8 combination devices including 4 constitutive promoters and 2 repressors (Fig. 6).
Plasmid and circuit: (Fig. 7)
We transformed well-constructed plasmid in to competent E. coli cell, then we got Device 2.0.
Finally, we shifted microRNA into Device 2.0 and did a continuing florescent intensity report (Fig. 8).
It can be inferred that for each system, an observation of an increase in the expression of the florescence intensity is detected due to the addition of the microRNA. Therefore, a conclusion that the addition of the microRNA to the system repressed the expression of the repressor could be made. We could say that the expectation of our prediction has appeared.
Therefore, in contrast of repressors with different promoter strengths (Fig. 9), we minus florescence intensity expressed by each system after the microRNA add to them with the florescence intensity each system expressed before the microRNA add into the system to get the Δ Florescence Intensity of each device. According to the figure, we can tell that in the first place, each ""Δ Florescence Intensity-time"" function figure of each device appeared to be a bell curve. This means that the window period of Device 2.0 still exists. Along the growth rate of the bacteria speed up, the division of the bacteria will make the florescence intensity decrease to the same level of the period when the microRNA hasn’t introduced to the system yet. Therefore, the Δ Florescence Intensity could be zero. Moreover, when the promoter strength of the repressor protein increase, ""ΔFlorescence Intensity max"" expressed a gradually decrease tendency. This decrease is especially well observed when we focus on the ""Lacl-Plac NOT gate"" gene circuit. Therefore, we can draw a conclusion that the different combination with different promoter strength could produce a theoretical ‘detectable minimum value ’. We could say that if the concentration of the microRNA is below this theoretical value, predictable low florescence intensity would occur because of the low concentration of microRNA's incap"

Students should learn that DNA and proteins are ordinary tools of biologists. The students have seen, by what means organisms are changed and what safety standards prevail in an S1 laboratory. In a final discussion students could ask about synthetic biology.
A second important area in Germany is the elder generation. Demographic trends in Germany go on towards an elder society. Traditional and often conservative thinking restricts the development and especially the exploration of new technologies. For this reason, the iGEM team of Darmstadt took part in a senior session of chemists in order to elucidate the elder generations about the new technologies. Often, the elder one has to face with fear of things, they do not even know. The team has tried to take the fear and tried an open and honest talk about opportunities and risks of synthetic biology. The enthusiasm of the team was also well received by the elderly.
Another aspect is mainly the industry, because they are interested in most cases for new technologies. The iGEM team from Darmstadt got the opportunity to present their project to an economic audience at the ACHEMA. It attended quickly that the questions about the project were very different. Even at the ACHEMA the team had to made persuasions to the company and also informs about the new technology of synthetic biology. Risk management plays a special role, as the technology is in contact to the product and further with the consumer.
Another area in which it should be informed and discussed is the scientific field itself. The CAS Conference - Synthetic Biology offered a good place especially for discussion about pros and contras of Synthetic Biology. Here got the team from Darmstadt the opportunity to present their project to a consortium of scientists. Discussions quickly immersed themselves in tiny scientific details
Probably the most important section are people from everyday life. To achieve these people, the iGEM team had organized an interactive panel discussion. Here were the residents of Darmstadt informed about the project and of course biotechnology and also Synthetic Biology. Guests were able to actively participate in the discussion and remained a few hours even after the end. At the event day, that has been initiated by the eleven German iGEM teams in Berlin, the team was able to take part at an ""Umweltbörse"". This gave the team an excellent opportunity to address the people on the street to interest in the project. Since the project of the iGEM team dealing with environment and recycling, it fits well in this event day of the city of Darmstadt.

NRPSDesigner Database Content
The information currently stored in the NRPS database was mainly retrieved from already published data [7] and extended or changed according to our own experimental results. Because of the already present domain organization and the related substrate specificities we mainly filled our database with information from the NRPS-PKS
library, which saves the protein sequence of diverse NRPS, and added the missing coding sequences. Accordingly, the positions of domain boundaries and linkers had to be converted from their protein specific coordinates to DNA coordinates. In some cases manual curation was necessary, because the substrate specificity stored in the NRPS-PKS database erroneously did not agree with the published experimental results. Furthermore, several pathways seem to contain special domain types with unclear functionality. In such a case we used antiSMASH combined with in-depth literature research to clarify the correct domain functionality. The current progress of the database curation is shown in table 1 . In total our database contains curated information about 658 Domains encoded on 99 DNA sequences.
Extension and Validation of the Database
One of the core requirements for our software is the ability to detect NRPS domains. This feature enables the automatic and standardized definition of domain boundaries and also facilitates the addition of new entries into the NRPSDesigner database by the community.
Based on the antiSMASH [10] [11] program we established our own pipeline to maximize domain recognition specificity. antiSMASH is implemented in (BIO)Python and uses HMMER3 [13] and thus, could be easily integrated in our framework. To improve domain recognition especially for the Adenylation/Oxidation/Adenylation (AOxA) domain of IndC, a HMM profile of the AOxA domain appearing in diverse indigoidine synthetases was constructed and added to the pipeline. Also, the Adenylation domain HMM (from Pfam, id PF00501.21) of antiSMASH was replaced by the HMM of the Maryland tool (special thanks to Prof. Jacques Ravel for providing us with the seed alignment). Note, that the start boundary for the A domain varied a lot depending on the prediction tool used. We chose the Maryland HMM, because it agreed most with our Tyrocidine experiments, as well as previously published results [14]. Furthermore, Thiolation domains have been split into two categories, depending on whether an epimerisation domain follows or not, as experimental evidence has shown that their functionality differs [15] (see Fig. 3 ).

Abstract
The goal of our project is to modify a protein cage such that disassembly can be induced by thrombin protease.  Our protein cage is a previously-created synthetic cage composed of 12 subunits that form a tetrahedron.  By creating mutant protein cages with inserted thrombin cleavage sites, disassembly could be induced by treatment with thrombin protease.  We designed 13 mutant protein cages and successfully cloned our top candidate based on selection criteria.  We were then able to successfully express and affinity purify both the native protein cage and the mutant protein cage.  However, complications with protein aggregation occurred, and upon assaying for protein cage assembly using dynamic light scattering, we found that our cages did not assemble at the expected size of 16nm.  Future directions will be focused on improving expression conditions for proper cage assembly, as well as on functionalizing the interior/exterior.
Introduction
The seed project for next year involves the controlled disassembly of protein cages in response to thrombin protease.  What is a protein cage?  A protein cage is a type of supramolecular assembly, where multiple protein subunits interact non-covalently in order to form a higher-order structure. Classic examples of protein assemblies include viral capsids, ferritins, and clathrin coats(1).  The cage that we are working with is a previously-designed synthetic protein cage(2–4) (Figure 1), created by one of our advisors, Todd Yeates.  To make a subunit of the cage, two distinct, naturally oligomerizing proteins were selected—a trimer, bromoperoxidase, and a dimer, M1 matrix protein.  Each were fused with a linker to form a 109.5 degree angle.  This angle is crucial in that it allows 12 subunits to come together, in order to create a cage that has tetrahedral symmetry(2).

The Tm of the overlapping regions should be as high as possible (ideally between 60 and 70oC) to maximize hybridization specificity. The Tm of all overlapping regions in the final CPEC assembly reaction should match each other as closely as possible, ideally with differences within ± to 3oC. This will help eliminate mis-hybridization and ensure highest cloning efficiency and accuracy. The length of the overlapping region, typically between 15 and 35 bases, is of secondary consideration and is dictated by the Tm. Standard PCR primer selection rules and software can be applied to facilitate the design process. If PCR is used to introduce overlapping regions with the vector or with adjacent fragments, primers should be designed to include at least two parts, each hybridizing to one end of the two neighboring fragments to be joined. If an additional short sequence needs to be inserted between two existing fragments, it can be simply included in the primer design between the two overlapping regions.
2. Preparation of linear vector.
The linear vector can be prepared most conveniently by PCR amplification using primers designed to introduce overlapping regions with the insert(s), as described below in the Procedure; this approach offers the most flexibility in selecting cloning sites. If a convenient restriction site is available on the vector that does not introduce unwanted sequences, restriction digestion can also be used to linearize the vector. To prevent carryover of undigested or intact circular vector templates, we recommend gel purification of the linear vector after PCR amplification or restriction digestion. In addition, to eliminate the effect of any residual carryover vector, we recommend using an empty vector as the starting material for PCR amplification or restriction digestion; this way, any carryover of the empty vector will not interfere with downstream functional assays or screens.
3. Preparation of inserts.
The inserts can be a single gene, a gene library, multiple genes or even multiple libraries. They can be isolated from natural sources or synthesized on the basis of in silico designs. Irrespective of whether they are single sequences or libraries, ensure that they share overlapping regions with the vector or neighboring fragments, as described above. If PCR is used to prepare the inserts, as described in the Procedure below, a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (e.g. Phusion DNA polymerase) is preferred in order to minimize the introduction of mutations or addition of an extra nucleotide at the ends of amplified products. Gel purification is sometimes necessary to ensure purity of the products.

While debugging and finding an solution for PCR fragment for the part tAOX1, test the annealing temperature of 60 °C that was proposed by the Tm calculator from NEB . Therefore, we run a temperature gradient from 50 °C until 67 °C with the usual protocol for Phusion DNA polymerase. But no specific product could be detected.
Because there were also many problems to get a PCR fragment of the HIS4 fragment for the shuttle vector we run a temperature gradient from 55 °C until 60 °C with the usual Phusion DNA polymerase protocol. From 50 °C until 65 °C we could detect the right fragment. The highest yield was at 60 °C.

Evry 2013 iGEM Team
The Evry 2013 iGEM team have already characterised 3 plasmids that we would later modify and gave us with a template for lab work that we knew would work.
The 2013 team's project was aimed to tackle iron deficiency diseases using synthetic biology. The outline of their project was to design a capsule that releases an iron biosensor which would produce an iron chelator to reduce iron levels in the small intestine. Our construct was inspired by BBa_K1163102, BBa_K1163103 and BBa_J04450. We modified the protein that is control to amilCP thereby creating a new construct & introducing further variability to characterised biobricks.
FeSO4 was used as the reactant as documented in the Evry team's notebook. We also use 50uL of FeSO4 but noticed that our bacteria stopped growing under 10mM concentrations. We therefore modified the concentration too.

Due to the unforeseen circumstances with the qPCR we unfortunately were not able to integrate these wet-lab data for each protein in our system. More about this qPCR story can be read here .
These amounts were meant to reduce the uncertainty in the model. Rather than running our model with unrealistic values (eg. the transcription rate formula described in section 1) and add uncertainty to the data, we opted to not use this model at this point.
However, we think that our extensive literature study has been very instructive, and hope that other iGEM teams could use this study (for example the RBS calculator) as a basis for their model. We also want to emphasise the importance of the qPCR approach. Providing we can circumvent the problems associated with high copy number plasmids, wetlab data will offer more realistic values than currently used, modelled transcription values.

The Visit to Zhejiang Food and Drug Administration
With many concerns about the regulation of food processing using synthetic biology materials, Jianan Li from team HFLS_H2Z_hangzhou and Junbo Yang from team ZJU-China contacted Dr.Jin at Zhejiang Food and Drug Administration. He introduced the process of regulation: by scrutinizing the raw materials and production process, quality control specialists predict the possible impurities in the final product, and then set specific examining procedures and standards.
Since we were planning to use the enzymes from E. coli in pickle processing, we raised a number of questions regarding genetic engineering bacteria and their products. Dr.Jin explained that there are more tests for organic impurities than for bacteria themselves. However, if the bacterium used is not proven safe for human health, the test and control will be much stricter. Although the bacteria are usually removed during production, even if there is one colony left in the product, it will be cultured for identification. Different methods are applied for different types of bacteria.
When asked about molecular detection method such as whole genome sequencing, Dr. Jin said, there are already some trials and applications. Yet the required equipment and personnel for such technology are not widely available, so it is still too early to issue new regulatory guideline and promote the method.
To our great excitement, Dr. Jin was quite interested in the details of our project and we had a thorough discussion. From that, we realized the importance of removing all of the bio toxins in the final product. Our original experiment design—separately express three enzymes—was too prone to bio toxin leakage. Therefore, we improved our method to Fusion Protein.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Design1_-_-_TEXT.html," chemical signals, optogenetics is leading a methods revolution across all fields of science and engineering(""Method of the year"",2010, Nature Methods) [15]
Optogenetics can stimulate and monitor the activities of individual neurons within freely-moving animals and precisely measure their response in real-time. In our project, it makes it possible to train worms, observe their behaviors and quantify the neuronal signals. In traditional training experiments, the simulation (input) is always has an inevitable residue, from hours to days. Besides, the readouts(output) are not in the same pace with the optical control. However, by using our optical device(see hardware-link), these issues can be solved greatly.
Why microfluidics?
Microfluidics is a powerful technology that can integrate a number of functions in a tiny plate, which is well matched with the size of C.elegans. Scientists have successfully achieved high-through imaging and screening of worm populations with this technology [16] Inspired by this, we design two microfluidic chips to study the development of learning behaviors of C.elegans by observing their phisical responses at the population level and measuring the signal of individual neuron after optical stimulations.
Despite the fact that worms are confined in chips and pushed by the fluid, the channels are specially designed to effectively simulate their normal movements. PDMS, the material of the chips, is transparent and has no influence on the quantification of light signals in optogenetics experiment. Gas molecules, diacetyl and 2-nonanone, can diffuse in PDMS so that worms can sense the odor of such molecule. As a result, we can observe their preference to these odors.
About light
In our design, we use a group of optogenetic proteins and optical devices. Channelrhodopsins protein CoChR and Chrimson are coupled with dual-Color fluorescence protein GEM-GECO and expressed in the pair of neurons AWA and AWB. This combination is used to lower the cross-talk and to get clearer image during experiments. Excited by blue light and red light separately, CoChR or Chrimson can induce the change of calcium ion concentrations inside the nerve cells. Then it can cause the blue-shift of fluorescences of GEM-GECO. To enhance preciseness, we modified the projector and design our own software of microscope. New filters are installed in the device so that we can simultaneously control the intensity and period of light when stimulating the individual C. elegans during manipulation.

Berkeley,2010,Team:Berkeley#Clotho_-_-_TEXT.html," for the development of new tools. As illustrated by the picture below, Clotho Apps are built on top of the Clotho API, and are able to use functionality provided by this API. Clotho in turn uses functionality from other libraries below it. The App framework is built on the Netbeans Platform (( netbeans.org ), which manages the App environment. This includes checking that all the dependencies of an App are satisfied before it is launched, managing all the files that may be necessary for a App to function correctly, as well as actually loading the executable code for each App into Clotho at runtime. The Hibernate library provides a structured interface to external databases and is discussed in more detail on the Data Model page.
High level schematic of the Clotho architecture. The Clotho API servers as a bridge between the more general frameworks and the Apps. This allows Clotho to provide an interface with domain specific functionality that tools made for synthetic biology can leverage.
Clotho classifies Apps into seven distinct categories: ClothoAlgorithm, ClothoConnection, ClothoFormat, ClothoGrammar, ClothoTool, ClothoViewer, and ClothoWidget. These categories are based on the different types of functionality a App can provide. For example, a ClothoConnection provides connections to a database, while a ClothoTool is a tool built on the Clotho platform. Apps are discovered and loaded dynamically when Clotho starts. For more information about how to write a App, what functionality the Clotho API provides, and to download Apps for your own use, visit the clothocad.org .
Automated Workflows
Automating synthetic biology workflows has always been a goal of the Clotho project. As devices become increasingly complex and utilize greater numbers of parts, it makes more and more sense to automate many of the steps in the construction of these devices. Last summer, the Berkeley iGEM team sought to build an automation framework for synthetic biology on top of Kepler, a tool for automating scientific workflows developed by the CHESS group at Berkeley ( chess.eecs.berkeley.edu ). Kepler is a powerful tool, but its large size and complexity makes it hard to integrate with Clotho. Additionally, the use of Kepler had been restricted to its use in the context of Automated Assembly as a plugin to Clotho's core functionality.  Because we believe that this type of program would be useful beyond one specific application, we sought a new strategy for integrating the core functionality of Kepler into the core functionality of Clotho.  So we decided to recode a simplified automation framework using the ideas from the Kepler project.

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the"

Module 3: Genome Deletion Overview
Thermoinduction
After Module 2 has been completed, genome deletion is triggered by raising the temperature. This is especially suitable since it is difficult for normal chemical induction to penetrate the colanic acid coating.
The pLambda promoter and cI protein form a thermoregulatable system.
see thermoinduction under temporal control )
Module 3 is the final module of our system. It is designed so that the cell is programmed to destroy it's genetic material after encapsulation has finished.
After Module 2 has been completed, The E.ncapsulator is programmed to 'genetically self-destruct.' The cell produces enzymes which specifically target and cut DNA sequences, in order to destroy all genetic material contained within the cell. One advantage of using these enzymes for our 'killing' mechanism is that the cell membrane is left intact afterwards, and the protein of interest will still be protected by the encapsulated cell.

Cyano Q&A
A lot of current iGEM teams work with cyanobacteria. These tiny green microorganisms require special cultivation methods which aren’t always common knowledge to everyone. We created this Cyano Q&A especially for iGEM Hamburg 2018 in order to solve the most prominent questions they had and also for other teams entering the world of cyanobacteria.
What are the culture conditions of cyanobacteria?
It depends on the strain. Typically Synechococcus elongatus sp 7942 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 - two model organisms - are incubated at 30°C (86°F). Moreover, as an autotrophic organism they need light in order to survive. We use light bulbs with a light intensity of 120 μE/m2·s . With those settings they have a growth rate of 0.052 h‐1. Optionally, you can use the light intensity of 60 μE/m2·s. With those adjustment the growth rate would be 0.026 h‐1."

Project > OR Gate and Output
Design
The OR gate and output module is constructed as below: Salicylate promter is placed upstream of the PO promoter, the double promoter construct can act as an OR Gate, either PhiR73 or salicylate can activate the promoter.
fig1. OR Gate and Output
In Cambridge 2007 Amplifier project , the PhiR73 activator and the PO promoter is used to amplify signal from an inducible promoter.
fig2. Cambridge 2007 amplifier project
picture from Cambridge 2007 page
In order to make the transcription level from PO promoter similar to that of the sal promoter, the activator is designed to be on a lower copy plasmid than the reporter. This is also discussed in the second stage assembly section.
Testing
In order to test whether the OR Gate works, we constructed the following 2 strains of E.coli to test each of the two promoters.
The first strain is to test the PO promoter, which consists of an PhiR73 activator that can be induced by salicylate. The Second strain is to test the Salicylate promoter(after PO promoter is inserted in between the pSal and the Transcriptional Unit).
The result of the induction is shown right: Fig3 shows the result of the first strain induced by salicylate. Fig4 shows that of second strain, induced by salicylate.
Fig4. OR Gate activated by Salicylate. In order to see whether the inserted PO has blocked the function of the salicylate inducible promoter, we use salicylate to induce the strain. Fluorescence is observed, which demonstrates that salicylate promoter works in the OR Gate.
Fig3. PO-GFP Gate activated by PhiR73 delta. We believe that if PO-GFP can be activated, there is no problem that it can be still activated when pSal is placed upstream of it.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#OperationCharacterization_-_-_TEXT.html,"utive promoter is strong (Fig 4, Fig 5).
When the Hg (II) concentration became as high as 10^-5M, cells can not tolerate the toxicity (Fig.4). However, data fit Hill function well apart from this. The ‘n’ values ranged from 2~4, determined by in silico fit of origin data.
Fig 5. The expression intensity of MerR significantly determines the threshold of sensitivity to mercury (II). Five representative lines are selected and it can be seen that the thresholds have varied apparently. The letter in the bracket after the promoter name denotes the backbone (pSB3K3 or pSB1A2) where Pc-RBS-merR was cloned. The deeper the colour, the stronger the expression level of MerR is, leading to a higher threshold.
In summary, promoters from partsregistry constitutive promoter library with different strength were prefixed before MerR coding sequence to exogenously maintain MerR expression at different intensity. The sensitivity of PmerT under different MerR concentrations can be denoted by mercury threshold concentration at which reporter (GFP) expression emerges. Data demonstrates that cells with different MerR intensity exhibited correspondingly different sensitivity to mercury, indicating that the stronger the expression intensity of MerR is, the higher threshold will be represented.

As shown below, the AHL concentration is set to be 10-8M, which should not be suffient to induce the system. If we increase the leakage level of lux pR on safety catch, the system becomes active under this condition and GFP is produced readily. It seems that the more “leaky” the promoter is, the more easily can the system be induced.
Figure 9     Impact of lux pR leakage (on Safety Catch Plasmid) on the Performance of the System
Based on the previous results, both the transcription efficiency and the leakage level of lux pR seems to be crucial to the performance of the system. An optimal combination of transcription efficiency and leakage level is required. Thus, we seek to obtain a better mutant form of lux pR. In the end, we developed lux pR-HS, an improved version of the promoter.
Summary:
- lux pR leakage on Safety Catch plasmid influences the “threshold” of the system.
- Both leakage and transcription efficiency when activated should be taken into consideration when building an optimal promoter.
3.4   Effect of IPTG
IPTG can be added to the system to eliminate the effect of lacI. Addition of IPTG should result in increased production of guide RNA, making the system more difficult to induce. In other words, lacI helps to modulate the threshold of system activation and adjusts the rate of GFP synthesis. To validate this hypothesis, we run simulations of our model.
4.Sensitivity Test and Robustness of the System
4.1 Overview
What is robustness? Robustness means some properties of the system are able to remain the same under perturbations. In our case, if our model is ""robust"" to some extent, then perturbations of certain ""inputs"" of the model should cast little effect on the ""outputs"". As for the ""inputs"", they can be the initial concentrations of chemical species and biological parameters. As for the outputs, they are the simulated GFP concentrations at given time points.
First of all, we would like to determine whether the model is robust given perturbations in parameter values. theoretically, none of the values of these parameters can be exactly precise, so confirming that minor shifts from ideal values do not cause the result of simulation dramatically is naturally important. Robustness to parameter values is somehow closely related to ""sensitivity"" and ""sensitivity test"".... The sensitivities of an ODE system are defined as the derivatives of the solution with respect to the parameters. We choose to perform Global Sensitivity Analysis, which is meant to"

Goettingen,2016,Team:Goettingen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Using this signal peptide, it has already been achieved to export a heterologous protein normally transported by the Sec pathway through the Tat system (Christóbal et al.., 1999). To connect the export signal with a B12-binding protein domain we use the five amino acids following the signal peptide in trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase as a linker.
Figure 1. Function of the Tat pathway. In contrast to the Sec pathway which translocates unfolded proteins, the Tat pathway translocates already folded proteins through a cellular membrane. (Rao and Anné, 2011)
Figure 2. Schematic view of the Tat signal peptide aligned with signal sequences from proteins exported via the tat pathway.
Residues that match the Tat consensus are shown in red, with the twin arginines underlined. (Palmer and Berks, 2012)
The B12 binding domain
For the binding of B12 to our Synporter, we use domains of proteins which are naturally capable of doing so. To increase our chances of success, we chose to test three different constructs.
MutB is the α-subunit of the methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase from the Gram-positive bacterium Propionibacterium shermanii. The enzyme family it belongs to uses adenosylcobalamin to create a substrate radical that then rearranges to exchange a hydrogen atom with a group attached to a neighbouring carbon atom. Methylmalonyl CoA mutase catalyses the interconversion between linear succinyl CoA and branched methylmalonyl CoA and is thus involved in the fermentation of pyruvate to propionate (Allen et al..,1963). It is an αβ heterodimer and has a molecular weight of 150 kDa (80 kDa for the α chain and 70 kDa for the β chain). The active site as well as the cobalamin binding site are located in the α chain (Francalanci et al.., 1986). Crystal structures of the whole enzyme bound to cobalamin (PDB 1REQ; Mancia et al.., 1996) as well as bound to cobalamin and its substrate (PDB 4REQ; Manica and Evans, 1998) are available. Since a TorA-mutB fusion protein could already be produced in significant amounts and has been exported to the periplasm in E. coli BL21, C. freundii and S. blattae (Toeche-Mittler, 2002),"

Plasmid Design
Our plasmids encode the enzymes necessary for the biochemical synthesis of phytosiderophores.[i] Two plasmids were used because the number of DNA base pairs for all of the genes (9,535 base pairs) was too high to fit on a single plasmid. The genes were split to make the plasmids as equal in length as possible while maintaining an appropriate configuration. This may lead to different expression of the genes on each respective plasmid, but we chose to take this risk and compensate for it in our characterization. Sequences for our enzymes were obtained from corn and codon optimized for Bacillus subtilis.
The first plasmid had 4,832 base pairs and included two of the corn genes involved in the biosynthesis of phytosiderophores, the corn gene responsible for transporting phytosiderophores out of the cell, and a reporter. It starts with a constitutive promoter (“Pveg”) which has a medium level of gene expression in Bacillus subtilis[ii]. Following the promoter is an RBS; the RBS’s used in this plasmid and the second were all “SpoVG RBS”, which has been shown to have high levels of translation in Bacillus subtilis[iii]. The corn genes are naat1 (1566 base pairs), which encodes nicotianamine aminotransferase[iv], DMAS (942 bp), which encodes deoxymugineic acid synthase[v], and TOM1 (1431 bp), a transporter of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores[vi]. Following them is a reporter, sfGFP, or superfolder Green Fluores"

This summer vacation, our five teammates of our team went to National Chiao Tung University in Taipei to take part in 215 iGEM Asian Conference.
In Taipei, we shared our idea and experience of experiments and mathematic modeling with other igmers. There were so many enthusiastic students from famous university. In the conference, we talked about projects, some problem we ever faced. Not only did we talk projects and science, but also we made precious friends.
2.Conference of three university of Central China
The three university Consortium of Central China is consist of, HUST-China、WHU-China and HZAU-China. In the meeting we discussed project，teams and other problems we met. Beside We plan to build a shared platform, which contains the information of synthetic biology, the laboratory equipment of wetlab and so on.
We are also considering to expanding the breadth of communication. We choose iGEM, we love biology, why don’t we talking about more biology problems not just for a competition? it must be cool, and we are trying to do that !
3.2015 CCIC PEKING
We are invited to participate in the second CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer's Committee) hosted by Peking on August 14th-15th. In the presentation time, many teams show their project and ideas about H&P、wiki and so on. In tea break time, we communicated actively with other teams about our project, and received many good advice and suggestions.
By the way, the CCiC means “Central China iGEMers Consortium”. It’s origin from the 1st Central China iGEMers' meet up hosted by our team in 2014. This year, There is a novel idea occur in our mind: How about make the CCiC to be a iGEMer’s Olympics in China? That’s means the host team will change in each Olympic game. Isn’t it interesting？
CCiC aims to deepen the connections between iGEM teams and to provide a collaboration platform for iGEMers to explore the frontiers of synthetic biology. We leant a lot from that and met many new friends while enjoying the meetup time. In this way we think iGEM teams will communicate with each other closely and the influence of iGEM will spread in a wider range in China.

TetR Extension PCR
Back to protocols .
The purpose of this procedure is to induce specific mutations in the tetR linear template. It requires two sets of PCRs: the first set amplifies the common sequence and the mutant sequence, and induces mutations in the mutant sequence. As illustrated below, the common sequence extends from the beginning of the gene to the site of mutations. The mutation sequence covers the remaining segment. The second set of PCRs stitches the two sequences together, making a mutant gene. In the following, the first set of PCRs is referred to as ""Mutation PCR"", and the second set as ""Fusion PCR"".
In the mutation PCR, one reaction has to be run for the common sequence, then one reaction per mutant. For example, seven reactions are needed for six mutants. All of them use the tetR linear template; they differ by their primers. The common sequence uses primers 5' final and common primer, whereas the mutant sequences use primers 3' ext and mutant primer. All but the mutant primer are standard PCR primers (XXX with overlap? XXX). The mutant primer is the key to inducing mutations: it doesn't perfectly match the sequence to copy, but contains one or more substitutions that are then replicated on the PCR product. After this PCR, the desired sequences are gel extracted, and used for the next step.
The fusion PCR is then run with the common sequence and one mutant sequences as templates, and primers 5' final and 3' final. Each mutant is reacted separately.

Investigations
Ways of spreading the survey
The spreading method we used was internet through facebook and email. The main reasons of this choice was that it was the most efficient and practical way to reach a high number of respondents. But it was also a really good way to reach populations with different backgrounds as we wanted to get answers from biologists and non-biologists.
At first, we contacted iGEM teams through mails and facebook publications on iGEM-related pages. In order to enhance cooperation with some iGEM teams, we established a badge system between a gold badge for teams who helped us the most spreading our survey -  Aachen, Bettencourt and Freiburg team -  and silver badge for others teams who participated - UPMC, Eindhoven and Valencia teams.
In order to reach biologists from outside of the iGEM community, we identified some relevant facebook groups. To find them, we used random keywords on the toolbar such as  “bioplastic”, “PLA”. But we also wanted to reach people with no specific interest in our topic, and that is why we looked for student facebook groups from non-biologic fields. We thus looked for students in literature, law, arts,etc.
Another point which was important to us was to reach respondents from different continents, especially in Africa and Europe because we would link some human practices aspects to those continents.
In Europe, we had a good proportion of results. However, we had a small proportion of respondents from Africa. Thus, we decided to contact student universities administrations from some African universities in order to ask them to spread the"

We performed multiple assays to prove the encapsulating and growth inside the Peptidsosomes. Detailed descriptions are provided in our protocol section . Adjustments regarding bacterial concentrations used are stated in the specific experiments.
Results
Characterization of Peptidosomes
Before we could encapsulate bacteria, we had to establish a robust and reproducible protocol of Peptidosome generation under lab conditions. To tackle this task, we used pH indicator cresol red solutions to visualize the generated Peptidosomes (Figure 5). The pH indicator color also correlated with the status of the Peptidosomes formation. Prior to the CO2 exposure the indicator was red (Figure 5, A), after sufficient CO2 exposure (will be discussed later) the solution changed to yellow (Figure 5, B), indicating a self-assembled Fmoc-FF layer and thus ready-to-use Peptidosomes.
These generated Peptidosomes stayed stable after CO2 treatment and we were able to transfer them into liquid filled petri-dishes or well plates.
After we have established the protocol for the Peptidosome creation, we evaluated if we could vary the size of the Peptidosomes. For testing this, we simply generated Peptidosomes of different volumes and could demonstrate successful created and stable Peptidosomes ranging from 1 to 20 µl (Figure 6).
For discovering the optimal exposure time to CO2 we varied it between 30 sec and 20 min. We found out, that the ones with an exposure time of 10 min were the most stable ones, showing stability after several days, even under 37°C incubation with shaking (Figure 7).
Figure 5: The color change of the Peptidosomes with pH indicator during production. A Peptidosomes before exposure to CO2 the pH indicator is red as a control, Peptidosomes without indicator are shown, these are transparent B Peptidosomes after the exposure, only the Peptidosomes with pH indicator changed color from red to yellow
Figure 6: Different sizes of Peptidosomes
Figure 7: Peptidosomes generated with different exposure times. Peptidosomes are shown, which were exposed to CO2 for 30 sec, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min or 20 min.
The final aim of the project is the encapsulation and cultivation of bacteria inside the Peptidosomes. For this, it is crucial that while the Fmoc-FF"

- tRNA specific for tyrosine and UAG codon in E. coli For incorporating non-canonical amino acids into a protein, an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair is needed, that does not crossreact with the cognate tRNA/synthetase pairs. This tRNA can be assembled with a variety of synthetases into a plasmid to incorporate ncAA in E. coli in response to an amber stop codon. This tRNA derives from the wild type tyrosyl Methanococcus janaschii tRNA/synthetase pair. It was proven to not crossreact with the cognate E. coli tRNA/synthetase pairs. The tRNA is used together with a tRNA synthetase. It has been proven to work with various synthetases for incorporation of ncAA by iGEM Team Austin Texas 2014

Last year the UIUC iGEM 2011 team proposed a class in synthetic biology as part of their human practices project. This year we can see the continuation of our efforts.
This fall the first class of BIOE 498 Section TL ""Introduction to Syn Bio"" met with Professor Ting Lu to learn about the basics of synthetic biology.

Further Resources
While just beginning research, we as a team tried to understand the impact synthetic biology has made on the public and what type of public impression has been made. The result of our research was this compilation of resources, which shows how popular media has reported on synthetic biology advances. It is an excellent source for both learning more about synthetic biology and understanding how science relates to social policy.

NAU-CHINA,2018,Team:NAU-CHINA#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," the system. As for visibility and operability, cell surface-expressed GFP as a model of extracellular signal molecule is a better choice. Therefore, we want to replace the excellular domain of synNotch with Lag16, a kind of antigen of GFP. Similar parts  have been used in previous project ( iGEM 2017 Fudan ). We received the plasmids with the gene of cell surface-expressed GFP and synNotch from iGEM 2018 Fudan team. But the intracellular domain of synNotch is tTA, a kind of activation factor. Since synNotch was applied to the transformation of cells, the intracellular domain has been replaced by transcription activator factors such as GAL - VP64 and tTA [2]. However, promoters are not completely non-expressed until they are activated, and they often have background expression. Moreover, we hope to make some changes to the intracellular domain of synNotch, trying to replace the intracellular domain with non-traditional transcriptional activator factor to broaden the selection and application of synNotch intracellular domain. So we construct the part of Anti-GFP-mnotch-TEV protease-NLS( BBa_K2557000 )
We found that the previous team iGEM 2017 Oxford modified TetR by replacing the domain between TetR DNA binding domain and regulatory core domain with TEV enzyme cleavage site, so that TetR with TEV cleavage site ( BBa_K2557050 ) will be destroyed in the presence of TEV, losing the function of repressing promoter after tetO( BBa_K2557038 ) sequence and opening up the expression of downstream genes.
According to the idea of iGEM 2017 Oxford, we replaced the intracellular domain of synNotch with TEV and repeated the function verification of synNotch to explore whether replacing intracellular domain with TEV will affect the function of synNotch.
