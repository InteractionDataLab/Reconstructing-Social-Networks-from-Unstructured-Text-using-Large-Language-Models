Orthogonality test
I Background
     In our project, we hope that the warriors only kill the bacteria from the other side, but not from its own side. In other words, the orthogonality of the gene circuit must be good. Necessarily, it means that the AHL molecules secreted by warrior I can just activate the promoter inside warrior II, but cannot activate the promoter inside itself and vice versa. (Note: In this text, we mean the same when we refer to response intensity of AHL promoter and killing effect of warriors. That is to say, if the response intensity of the promoter to the AHL secreted by warrior A inside warrior B is high---A may equals to B, which means that the warrior A can be effectively killed by warrior B and vice versa.)
    To help us choose appropriate circuits of the two warriors, we should know how specific receptor-promoter combinations respond to specific AHLs.
    This is characterized by ETH_Zurich 2014 . However, we cannot use their results directly. The detailed explanation is shown below:
    The response concentration of some receptor-promoter combinations to AHL molecule may be too high or too low that they exceed the concentration range that ETH_Zurich considered. For example, in our project, we want to design two kinds of E. coli which can synthesize two kinds of AHLs and respond only to the AHL secreted by the other. Therefore, according to results from ETH_Zurich 2014, shown below (Fig. 1), we may design the gene circuit of our"

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.

A high for the team this week was finally understanding how Cre-Lox recombination, a method that we will use in one of our experiments to integrate our gene cassette into the yeast genome, works. We now expect to run three parallel experiments to get to our end goal: a control using Gibson and homologous arms to create our gene cassette and integrate it into our Y. lipolytica genome; assembly of the plasmid inside S. cerevisiae using yeast-mediated cloning,  isolation and insertion of the plasmid into E. coli for amplification, and insertion of the gene cassette into Y. lipolytica using lox sites; and assembly of gene cassette/plasmid inside Y. lipolytica and integration into genome using lox sites. For each of the three experiments, we will begin by inserting lox sites into the Y. lipolytica genome using homologous recombination.

About half the team spent the week drafting our thesis. While some of us were writing, others were meeting with professors on campus to discuss our ideas and to pick up some S. cerevisiae strains to use as our experimental organism. We learned from Rohinton Kamakaka that we could insert Cre recombinase into our yeast using a plasmid, so now we are in pursuit of a method to both express and remove Cre recombinase once we no longer need it. Our yeast parents have been growing our Y. lipolytica and amplifying the plasmids that we have received. Our wiki boys have almost finished formatting the website to their (or our) liking and are now adding more content about our project itself. A few of our team members scheduled an interview with a representative from Family Planning 2020, but due to timing issues, had to reschedule.

BioBrick Safety
None of the BioBrick parts utilized or constructed are known to pose any safety issues.      Furthermore, they are well contained by the microbes that harbor them. The risk of unintended transfer to any other organism is minimal.
Biosafety Group
Rose-Hulman does not have a biosafety group, committee or review board other than an Animal Care and Use Committee,      which oversees animal research. Safety training and laboratory waste disposal are facilitated by an Environmental Health and Safety Officer, who also serves as a resource for faculty and students.
Future iGEM Safety
The possibility of designing mutually dependent strain/vector systems for routine manipulation and storage of BioBrick parts should be explored.

BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Science#Inhibitor_-_-_TEXT.html," ability. Loss of DNA binding by the lac repressor is required for transcriptional activation of the operon. LacIq is a mutation type of LacI which can express a lot of LacI inhibitor to repress the lac promoter completely and has a low or zero background expression levels. Thus using lacIq as inhibitor is a more efficient way to control the expression. Tac promoter is a functional hybrid promoter composed of different promoters from trp and lac operons and could only be regulated by lacI inhibitor.
CI-pR
CI inhibitor found in the phage lambda is a notable example of the level of control possible over gene expression by a very simple system. In the phage lambda, the lambda repressor is a self-assembling dimer also known as the CI protein.
The key regulator in the λ genetic switch is the CI protein, which binds to the OR and OL regions of the λ genome to repress the lytic promoters during lysogeny. Cooperative binding of a pair of CI dimers at two of the three CI operators at OR (OR1 and OR2) represses PR, and similar binding at two of the three operators at OL (OL1 and OL2) represses the PL promoter. Binding of CI to OR2 also stimulates the intrinsically weak promoter for the cI gene, PRM, so that in the lysogenic state CI positively regulates its own synthesis and the presence of CI is maintained. Switching from lysogeny to lytic development, called lysogenic induction or prophage induction, occurs on activation of the host SOS system in response to DNA damage.
TetR-pTet
Tetracycline (tc) is a broad family of antibiotics to which bacteria have evolved resistance.
Tc normally kills bacteria by binding to the bacterial ribosome and halting protein synthesis. In Gram-negative bacteria, the expression of resistance to tetracycline (tc) gene is regulated by Tet Repressor Protein, call tetR. Regulation of expression of the ptet is mediated by Tet repressor, which binds to two operator (tetO) sites. TetR is used in artificially engineered gene regulatory networks because of its capacity for fine regulation. In the absence of tc, basal expression of TetR is very low, but expression rises sharply in the presence of even a minute quantity of tc through a positive feedback mechanism.
Application in our project
In order to sense the number of plasmids, we use different kinds of inhibitor as the signal. In host cells, the concentration of inhibitor increases while plasmids’ number rises. Once the number of pl"

Functional verification of three kinds of recombinases in HEK 293T cell
Fig.7. All three recombinases can effectively reverse the sequence between recognition sites, and exhibit different reverse efficiency due to different promoter strength and recombinase types.

(B) The image under fluorescence microscope for 293T cells, transfected with plasmids containing the recombinase recognition sites (the first column picture) or transfected with plasmids containing corresponding combination of promoters and recombinase genes (other column pictures) together, are shown.
The results show that the recombinases can recognize the sites and reverse the sequence between sites in HEK 293T.
Functional verification of reversal efficiency and threshold characteristics of different recombinases in HEK 293T Cells
Fig.8. Recombinase has different intensity reversal efficiency and threshold
HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with six different amounts of plasmids containing recombinase genes (tetO-miniCMV-Bxb1( BBa_K2557010 )and tetO-miniCMV-TP901( BBa_K2557016 )) , and fixed numbers of plasmids containing corresponding recombinase recognition sites. After 36 hours of plasmid co-transfection, the proportion of fluorescent cells and the average fluorescence intensity of cells were detected by flow cytometry. Transfection of different amounts of plasmids containing recombinase genes into cells indicates that cells can produce recombinase at different concentrations. The experiment was repeated three times.
(A) Fluorescence microscope observation of HEK 293T  undergone different experimental treatments
(B) The statistical chart of average fluorescence intensity of cells shows that the cells with Bxb1 recombinase have a higher fluorescence intensity than those with TP901 recombinase under the same promoter strength and recombinase concentration. However, if the concentration of recombinase is low, there is no significant difference in fluorescence intensity.
(C) The statistics of the proportion of fluorescent cells show that the proportion of fluorescent cells has a sudden jump discontinuity between low concentration and high concentration of Bxb1 and TP901 recombinases. Similar results were obtained in all three repetitions.
The results of image B show that the reverse efficiency of Bxb1 recombinase is higher than TP901 recombinase under the same promoter strength and recombinase concentration. However"

But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Why We Chose to Do Integrated Human Practice
The idea that is presented here on our wiki has evolved a lot since we first started the journey towards the Giant Jamboree 2018.  Through involving different stakeholders, experts, and the public we managed to get the best out of our work.  During the process of evolving our project we frequently asked the following questions:
Is our project useful?
Who can make use of our end product?
Where are the limitations and the potential bottlenecks?
What does the the public know about Synthetic Biology and how should this affect the way we present our work?
What is the most important aspect of Synthetic Biology according to the public?
Since we started asking these questions, our project has changed focus.  Our idea changed from gaining insight into how chaperones in E.coli can be used to study protein folding in neurodegenerative diseases, to focusing on increasing protein production by facilitating the folding process.
This development came from a number of steps taken within the project. By continuing reading, we will do our best in order to guide you through these steps.
Survey - Letting the Public Influence What We Do in The Lab
During the course of the project, we became interested in finding out how much the general public in Sweden knows about the field of Synthetic Biology. We also wanted to know which part/parts of the field they think is the most important to make research within.  In order to this out, we decided to conduct a survey.
The survey was constructed with the help of Marie Berlin, who has much experience within the field of social science.  Marie Berlin is a PhD student at the department of Sociology at Stockholms University.   Through her help as our social science expert, we could construct the following survey questionnaire:
Survey Questionnaire: LiU iGEM .
To get a broad perspective of samples, we went to central Linköping to find participants for our survey.  This resulted in a total of 92 participants and a mean age of ~37 years.
Through this survey, we got the opinion of the public, concerning our project (and Synthetic Biology in general). With that in mind we could let it influence our work. For one, we adjusted our way of presenting the project to the public, but we also made changes in the lab.
In the survey the participants were"
Queens,2009,Team:Queens#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," CO acts as a local vasodilator, which may minimize chances of plaque rupture, as well as retard plaque growth. BV inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, which has been shown to lead to stenosis of blood vessels. Fe++ induces the production of ferritin, which has an antioxidant effect that may protect the surrounding tissues from free radical attack and reduce the chance of plaque rupture.
3. Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)
ANP activates membrane-bound guanylate cyclase (GCA), which increases the level of intracellular cGMP, a signalling molecule that mediates vasodilation. The effect of ANP is similar to that of carbon monoxide. cGMP also possess an anti-clotting effect, although it is unlikely that we can take advantage of this since platelets do not have membrane-bound guanylate cyclase.
Part Three: Cleavage and Termination
After our chassis has been bound to the site of the plaque for a period of time, it should begin to produce DNases and proteases. The DNases will function to sheer the bacterial genome, making it unable to proliferate in the blood; this functions as a safe-guard against bacteremia. The proteases serve to detach the chassis from the plaque site, so as to avoid a build-up of dead cell debris in an already inflamed area.

A high for the team this week was finally understanding how Cre-Lox recombination, a method that we will use in one of our experiments to integrate our gene cassette into the yeast genome, works. We now expect to run three parallel experiments to get to our end goal: a control using Gibson and homologous arms to create our gene cassette and integrate it into our Y. lipolytica genome; assembly of the plasmid inside S. cerevisiae using yeast-mediated cloning,  isolation and insertion of the plasmid into E. coli for amplification, and insertion of the gene cassette into Y. lipolytica using lox sites; and assembly of gene cassette/plasmid inside Y. lipolytica and integration into genome using lox sites. For each of the three experiments, we will begin by inserting lox sites into the Y. lipolytica genome using homologous recombination.

About half the team spent the week drafting our thesis. While some of us were writing, others were meeting with professors on campus to discuss our ideas and to pick up some S. cerevisiae strains to use as our experimental organism. We learned from Rohinton Kamakaka that we could insert Cre recombinase into our yeast using a plasmid, so now we are in pursuit of a method to both express and remove Cre recombinase once we no longer need it. Our yeast parents have been growing our Y. lipolytica and amplifying the plasmids that we have received. Our wiki boys have almost finished formatting the website to their (or our) liking and are now adding more content about our project itself. A few of our team members scheduled an interview with a representative from Family Planning 2020, but due to timing issues, had to reschedule.

Collaboration
While preparing for iGEM, we always hope we can accomplish more and more people can join this great project. Luckily, by cooperation with others, all these hopes come ture.
Collaboration with professors
While completing our project, we encountered all kinds of problems, of which some could hardly solve by ourselves. We solved them by discussing and cooperating with many professors of USTC. At the same time, we knew more about the original thoughts of synthetic biological researchers. So we tried to combine their needs and our project, hoping we could also help them. Now, we believe that we realized our original intention.
Collaboration with Chinese iGEMers
One reason why iGEM competition is unforgettable is that it makes us know more like-minded people. This year, we hoped iGEM teams could communicate more with each other, so we organized iGEM meetup this summer. Teams from China got familiar through the meetup, and we kept in touch after it. We not only got to know each other by frequent communication, but helped each other with their problems to bring about good results for us all as well.
Collaboration with HFUT_CHINA
While enjoying iGEM, we hoped more people could join us. This year, HFUT_CHINA sent a team for iGEM for the first time. As a team new to iGEM, it would surely encounter more problems. As their neighbor, we kept in touch with them and did everything we could to help them with their project. Through the course, we got to know a lot of people enthusiastic about iGEM of our age. We are glad that they also join iGEM.

Austin_UTexas,2018,Team:Austin UTexas#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," strain of E. coli that can act as a plasmid donor in conjugations.
In addressing Dr.Davies' suggestion that we show the kit can work in multiple organisms, we attempted to express a variety of our assemblies in non-model organisms. These organisms included:
Serratia marcescens
Serratia symbiotica
Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984
Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228
Psuedomonas chloritidismutans
Vibrio natriegens
Lactobacillus plantarum
Success was only confirmed in a few of these organisms. However, these experiments were informative in that they demonstrated the variety of transformation and growth procedures necessary to genetically manipulate non-model organisms and underscored the strengths and weaknesses of our kit.

One Tube Reaction Feedback
Rice and Texas Tech University
After discussing our kit with members of the Rice University and Texas Tech University iGEM Teams, we designed methods to simplify Golden Gate Assembly reactions, redesigned our presentation of the kit, and amended our protocol for potential users.
Members of our iGEM Team gave the Rice University iGEM Team and the Texas Tech iGEM Team a One Tube reaction to test in their lab. One reaction contained all our confirmed full assemblies and the other contained our assemblies for a single antibiotic, kanamycin. After performing the one tube reaction, Rice University sent us the pictures found in Figure 2. Texas Tech was unable to perform the transformation, but provided a critique of the protocol sent with the tubes.
Figure 3: These are the results of Rice's One Tube electroporation with E. coli.
While the E2-Crimson, shuttle vector assemblies did not initially express when our team performed the one tube reaction, Rice saw blue colonies on their plates, which acted as a secondary confirmation of the Shuttle vector origin. They also gave us feedback that we incorporated into our protocol and experimental design. They mentioned that it would be helpful to have the expected colony phenotype for each assembly in the protocol. Instead of the one tube reaction, they would have preferred  that each assembly was sent in a separate tube which they believe would have been more amenable to the heat shock protocol they used.
From their and Texas Tech's feedback, we made the following changes to our protocol:
Explicitly stated the purpose of using the One Tube Reaction at the beginning of the procedure, as well as the reasoning for providing both a tube containing all assemblies and a tube with just the assemblies for a specific antibiotic.

Tool Overview
The MoClo planner is a collaborative, touch-enabled software tool that simplifies information gathering and design steps of Golden Gate Modular Cloning; a hierarchical cloning method that relies on biological “parts” to create multi-gene constructs. Users can browse through a library of biological parts using filters, search for a specific part using the part’s name or registry ID , access a data sheet for each part, and view relevant publications from Pubmed. The layered workspaces allows for efficient and organized transfer of information from one level of the cloning method to another without distracting from the primary workspace. Furthermore, the built-in primer designer allows for the generation of primer sequences and lab protocols without ever leaving the workspace.
An image of each of the layered workspaces in a partially viewable mode.
Implementation
The MoClo planner is being implemented on a 40 inch Microsoft Surface . The software tool is programmed using the Microsoft Surface SDK written in C#. Eugene is used to generate and regulate Level 1 permutation from Level 0 BioBricks. We also use Visual SBOL to visually represent the distinct parts in the standard way.
Golden Gate Modular Cloning
Golden Gate Modular Cloning is a DNA construction method that allows for the assembly of any multi-gene construct from a library of biological parts. The method is hierarchical, allowing the user to link the standard biological parts (promoters, ribosome binding sites, coding sequences, and terminators) in order to create genes, and then use these genes to assemble multi-gene constructs.
The Interface
The MoClo planner has three layered workspaces called the Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 workspaces. Each workspace represents one level of the modular cloning method. Basic biological parts are handled in Level 0. The construction of genes is managed in Level 1. The assembly of multi-gene networks is done in Level 2. The user can work in multiple workspaces at a time. While working in any workspace, the user can arrange the work"

$$\rho \cdot \overrightarrow{f_2} \cdot \overrightarrow{n} \cdot dS \cdot dt $$
According to the mass conservation we can get the equation:
$$\iiint_D(\rho |_{t=t_2}- \rho |_{t=t_1})dxdydz=- \int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt  \iint_{\partial D} \rho \overrightarrow{f_1} \overrightarrow{n}dS+  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt  \iint_{\partial D} \rho \overrightarrow{f_2} \overrightarrow{n}dS$$
Assuming that \(\rho\) , \(\overrightarrow{f_1}\) , \(\overrightarrow{f_2}\)  are all continuously differentiable, according to Gauss Formula we can get that:
$$\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt [\iiint_D \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \overrightarrow{f_1})- \nabla \cdot (\rho \overrightarrow{f_2})]dxdydz=0 $$
Because of the continuity of integrand in   and the randomicity of   and  , we can get that:
$$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \overrightarrow{f_1})- \nabla \cdot (\rho \overrightarrow{f_2})=0, \quad  \Omega \times (0, \infty) $$
And the definition conditions:

$$ \rho |_{t=t}=\rho_t $$
\(\rho_0\) , \(\rho_t\) can be measured directly in the experiment. For the  \(\overrightarrow{f_1}\), \(\overrightarrow{f_2}\) , we can estimate the value range based on our experiments and determine the the most appropriate value according to the simulated annealing algorithm. Then the \(\rho(x"

If the cholesterol concentration decreases SREBP is cleaved by the proteases site-1 protease and site-2 protease resulting in a release of the aminoterminal domain of SREBP. Two additional proteins (Scap and Insig) are needed to regulate this process in a way that the cleavage occurs exclusively during lack of sterol [17] . The aminoterminal domain of SREBP is translocated into the nucleus and binds to the DNA consensus sequence TCACNCCAC. The binding causes an up regulation of the genes needed for cholesterol synthesis.
Sp1
Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is a transcription factor which belongs to the zinc-finger protein family. It binds to promoter elements containing a central CpG motive with the following consensus sequence; 5'-G/TGGGCGGG/AG/AC/T-3' [18] .  Sp1 is involved in chromatin-remodelling processes [19] as well as in derecruiting repressor proteins from the promoter [20] . For these and for other reasons Sp1 is often considered as a universal transcription supporting protein.  Sp1 was shown to regulate various genes responsible for cellular processes like apoptosis, cell growth and differentiation and immune response [21] . It interacts with several well known proteins, such as c-myc, c-Jun and Stat1 [21] .
AP-1
Activating Protein1 (AP-1) is a transcription factor which is activated by several pathways and extracellular stimuli like UV radiation, growth factors and bacterial and viral infections. AP-1 is a heterodimer consisting of one member of the Fos and one member of the Jun family.  AP-1 composition and activation is mainly controlled by MAP kinase cascades by up regulating the expression of both Fos and Jun proteins. Besides the heterodimerisation process, phosphorylation of the complex is needed to achieve an efficient transcription of the target genes [22] . Activated AP-1 binds to DNA sequences with the consensus sequence 5'-TGAG/CTCA-3' [23] . The genes regulated by AP-1 are involved in cellular processes like apoptosis, cell differentiation, cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation [22] .
AP-2
Activating protein 2 (AP-2) is a family of transcription factors being closely related (AP-2alpha, -beta and –gamma).  AP-2 proteins are activated through homo or heterodimerisation and bind to GC-rich motives in their target genes [24]"

After than, each spot (donor, recipîent, control, two conjugative) was resuspended on liquid LB and some dilution was done (from 10-2 to 10-6). Each dilution was put on LB plate with         adequate antibiotics and putted at 37°C O/N, to check the result of conjugation and/or Crispr/Cas9 system.
Classic conjugation assay used for our test
Conjugation in plate test 1 (non quantitative) targeting AmpR (TEM1)
Donor (D) : S17-1 with our killer plasmid (sgRNA targeting AmpR, resistance: KanR)
Control (CTRL) : S17-1 with our conjugative plasmid pK18mob, with Cas9 BUT without the sgRNA (no targeting). KanR
Recipient (R) : TOP10 (with a TEM1 gene in chromosome)
Conjugation time : 3 hours 30 min
D.O. (600 nm) = about 1 (for recipient strain), about 0,5 (for donor/control strain)
Conjugation in plate test 1: On left : Donor and recipient strain after conjugation. On right : control and recipient strain after conjugation.
First result seems to show that conjugation append (at least in control strain) and that donor strain (if have conjugated) seems to kill the AmpR gene as expected. This first test is non quantitative, so we don’t know exactly how             much bacteria we have, and more test are needed.

A negative control was performed using a donor strain that did not include guide RNA. Donor cells were counted after         dilution on LB kanamycin and recipients on LB ampicillin. Colony counts are carried out three times for each dilution. The effectiveness of our system using Cas9 carried by a mobilizable plasmid give 27% for a D:R ratio 1:169.

Also 5-alpha is more efficient anyways.) --- AL - I've done this already, I'm leaving the plates out over the weekend (9/3-9/5). They should be by the RT shaker)

Sequenced colonies, ran gels - gels did not have bands 2.7kb!! And sequencing results were trash as well!!
DAY 2 If transformation is successful (if not, we need to retransform lol)
If plates are lawns.. we'll have to replate. Scrape some colonies and inoculate a 1mL LB-chlor culture. Replate them after 2-3 hours.
If plates AREN'T lawns... Pick ~3 isolated colonies and do cPCR (use VF2 and VR. Size of plasmid should be 2.7kbp. Annealing T of VF2 and VR = 66C). After cPCR ends, run a gel to confirm the size of the PCR product and perform PCR cleanup. Send out for sequencing (use both forward and reverse, because the plasmid is so big). Grow 5 mL liquid cultures of the picked colonies and leave overnight (use 5 mL LB + 5 uL chlor media)
Don't forget to put them in the fridge after you're done!

Parts from Caroline actually came in today, so we decided to attempt transformations.  Note that the parts were estimated to be at 200ng/uL in 10mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5.  At first we were going to do transformations of all of them, but we quickly realized that, although the sheet indicated that there was 10uL of plamid in each tube, there actually only appeared to be about 2uL.  Our guess is that some of each plasmid dried up during shipment.  Therefore, we decided instead to attempt a trial transformation with a part that we already had in glycerol stock, P0501 or J63006, to use Caroline's naming system and the registry's, respectively.  Placed only about 2 uL in with 50uL competent cells, but put the whole 4 uL in for the positive control.  Only realized after the two hours of incubation that the volume for the positive control should have matched that for the part P0501.  Will have to redo this experiment should transformation fail.  Incubated for 2 hr and 2 min, then plated all of the liquid onto two separate plates.  For each tube, used 20% of the liquid on one plate and 80% on the other.  Placed in incubator at 10:14 pm.  Will come in tomorrow around 12 pm to check on them.
Note: For the transformation, used the plates that had been slightly burnt.
6/14/08
Came in around 1:30 pm, after the plates had been in the incubator for 15 hr and 23 min.  Discovered good colonies on P0501 as well as the positive control, with no colonies on the negative control.  For some reason, it appears that the incubator had been set to 25 degrees Celsisus, so the colonies were still quite small.  Set the incubator to 37 degrees and put them back in for several hours.  Took them out again after the timer had said 19hr and 34 min.  Will use two colonies from P0501 to make glycerol stocks and store the plates in the fridge.

There’s a Gene for That
Deinococcus Radioduran (D. rad) is famous for being resistant to 3000 times the radiation dose lethal to humans.  Inspired to prove the potential of genetic engineering, the New York City iGEM Team chose to create radiation-resistant biobricks. We planned to find the genes that give D. rad extraordinary radiation resistance, and put them into loserish bacteria like E. coli, and see if we could turn the E. coli into super-hero bacteria.
By finding genes that allow life to thrive in extremely harsh environments, we help develop the emerging field of genetic engineering into a classic engineering discipline like electrical or mechanical engineering. We will demonstrated that we too can tackle the complex problems. Below find a table of extremophile values. Achieve these and demonstrate the power of synthetic biology to yourselves, fellow iGEM teams, fellow engineers and the general public. In addition to the list below, we have submitted these values to the BioNumbers Database.  Good Luck!
Extremophile Numbers
High Radiation:  Deinocuccus radiodurans can live in 17500 Gy
Low Temperature:  Assorted Bacteria can live in < 1 celsius
High Temperature:  Strain 121 can live in 130 celsius
High Pressure:  Pyrococcus CH1 can survive 120 MPa
Vacuum:  Tardigrades can live in a near perfect vacuum
Salinity (Concentration):  Dunaliella salina can live in 30% NaCl
High pH :  Assorted Bacteria can live in 13.2
Low pH:  Cyanidium caldarium can survive 0.05
Low Water Activity  : Xeromyces bisporus can live in 0.62

11th May 2014, Finding a Project
In the beginning of every project there is the planning: What project do we want to do? What CAN we do? All these questions had to be answered.
11 May 2014, Skype Chat with iGEM Waterloo
Collaborations or contact with other iGEM teams is a bit more complicated if you live on another continent. Nevertheless, we have a nice talk with the iGEM Team Waterloo.
11th May 2014, We need Food!
During the project planning phase there is one thing - besides good ideas - every scientist needs: Food to keep the brain running! Luckily food comes right to our doorstep if we want.
13th May 2014, Meeting with iGEM Team Hannover
When iGEM teams meet there is not only scientific talk but also much fun and laugther. Especially when there is sun and BBQ at hand.
13th May 2014, Meeting with iGEM Team Hannover
After a nice evening Team Hannover and Team Braunschweig both went home with new friends and one or two helpful thoughts for further lab work.
20th May 2014, LehrLEO-Slam at TU Braunschweig
At the LehrLEO event it was our turn not to present our project but the concept of iGEM as a teaching principle to the public and members of our university. Nevertheless, we used this opportunity to communicate our project and gather some opinions on eating habits.
20th May 2014, Winner of the LehrLEO-Slam!
We did it! We presented iGEM and our project in a science slam contest and could win over 70% of the votes.
22th May 2014, iGEMers can handle a variety of bricks!

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," investment in our calculation (Appendix 7).
Key Ressources. We produce our models in a rented laboratory and need employees to operate the 3D printers as well as the remaining laboratory activities. Moreover, we take our costs for research and further development of our technology into account.
Value Proposition. We create value by printing the unstructured cells we buy from our supplier into the 96-Well-Plates and thus improving our customers’ test results. Thus, we reduce the number of necessary animal tests and save our customer time and opportunity costs.
Customer Relationship and Channels. Our business is highly sales and less marketing orientated due to the need for explanation of the product. Therefore we seek to have a strong sales team and intense contact to our customers. Our distribution chanel is either bei shiping per specialsed logistic partner our inhouse production at our customers facility.
Cost Structure. Our major cost drivers are the rent for the laboratory, laboratory costs, and material costs for the cell medium. An additional high investment in the beginning are the 3D printers. Our current calculation resulted in a cost of about € 242 per plate. We calculated that each printer can print 3 plates per day, and we believe that a single printer is a reasonable number to start with. Thus, we are able to produce about 600 plates per year, which perfectly fits to the calculated needs of the strategic partner we plan to exclusively supply during the first year. A detailed calculation of the costs and revenue streams can be found in the appendix (Appendix 7).
Revenue. Our revenue stream is our customers purchasing the plates. To calculate the amount of our product that we can sell to them in one year, we expect that usually 2–3 drug candidates can be screened on one 96-well plate. Since usually around 30 drug targets with 30 potential compounds for each target are present in a pharmaceutical pipeline, the required number of 96-well plates is around 400–500. From interviews, we gained the impression that we can demand about € 10,000 for one plate. Therefore, we calculate with a turnover of € 4–5 million. Altogether, we expect a satisfactory gross profit margin of 97%.

How Did We Start?
After we decide to do with the CRISPR-Cas system, we start to think about how can we combine our lab work with the world.         Firstly, as we all know China is a developing country, a large number of pollutions are inevitable, especially some         heavy metals in water from metal factories. Secondly, cancer is always a big problem around the world, comparing         to paying lots of money on the low chance of curing it, the prediction seems to be more significant. So with our         theory of gene editing and detection, two embryonic thoughts of our projects related to the society came out, which         are “heavy metal detection in the water” and “high throughput screening of cfDNA of cancer.
Communications
During the time we are working on the projects, Junjing Chen went to the 2018 Eurasian meetup to communicate with other         teams. Chenbo Sun went to Nankai University for a communication which was attended by nine teams. We took an active         part in the first iGEM Eurasian meetup co-organized by TU Delft and BGI college in Shenzhen, which several other         teams participated including EPFL, Tongji, HKU and so on. The meetup schedule is similar to that of Giant Jamboree,         which offered us an opportunity to practice presenting our project. Through the Eurasian meetuo and communication         in Nankai University, we received useful suggestions on how to improve our projects, and we firmly believe that we         will do better in the future. Furthermore, we also established strong relationships and built collaboration with         buddy teams. We received other teams’ advice and figured it out that we can turn our work into products or make the         results useful to every person, not only to the entire society.

The Helmholtz free energy per lattice site $f(\phi)$ in units of $k_B T$ for a solution containing polycations and polyanions is given by what is known as the Voorn-Overbeek model ( Qin et al. 2014 ; Qin & De Pablo 2016 ), and reads: $$f(\phi) = \frac{\phi}{N} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)+(1-\phi)\cdot \ln(1-\phi)-\alpha \cdot (\sigma \phi)^{3/2}$$ Here $\alpha$ is the interaction strength from the Debye-Hückel theory, and $\sigma \equiv Z/N$ is the charge density of the polymer. For aqueous solutions at room temperature, $\alpha \approx 4.1$. Now what the system will do, like any system, is go to a state in that locally minimizes its free energy. What remains to be seen however, is whether the energy minimum towards which the system will go is indeed a phase separated stated, or a homogeneous solution. It will be a homogenous solution if and only if the mixing criterion is satisfied, and this mixing criterion states that $$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2 }>0$$ (see ref Doi 2013 ). There will only be coacervation if this criterion is not satisfied for our system. What we can do is plot the curve for which $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2 }=f''(\phi)=0$, which is known as the spinodal curve, and identify regions in this plot in which coacervation does (not) happen. In fact there is also a region in the parameter space where both phases coexist. This is defined by the coexistence (binodal) curve, and a full treatment of the theory would also include this. However, as long as we are near the critical point of the spinodal curve (the minimum in the graphs of Figure 2), the coexistence curve approximates the spinodal curve and the coexistence region is negligibly small.
From here it will be immediately clear why the coacervation method works. Taking the derivative of $f$ twice with respect to $\phi$ yields that $$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2} = \frac{1}{N\phi}+\frac{1}{1-\phi}-\frac{3\alpha\sigma^{3/2}}{4"

“People must be given a reason to trust biotechnology and recognise its potential in research. Projects which demonstrate right from the start that they have a positive effect on the world in which we live, and can even remedy anthropogenic problems which are thought to be insurmountable, deserve to be realised. The iGEM project provides young researchers with the opportunity to realise such creative ideas and at the same time develop an awareness of how to treat our environment in a responsible way. These are the main reasons I am delighted to be a part of iGEM Team Hannover.”

Prior to imaging, roots were washed in PBS to wash off bacteria and facilitate imaging. We imaged the plants incubated with 8ml of bacteria and were able to find bacteria inside one of the roots. A 3D picture was taken of uninfected roots and roots containing bacteria by taking a Z stackk image using confocal microscopy.
This video shows a zoom from the top to the bottom of the root. It was put together from successive images taken at different depth levels. The GFP-expressing bacteria are clearly visible within the root.
We also imaged roots that did not contain bacteria via a similar Z-stack scan. This image is shown below.

Jiaming had no remark on this video, believing that every one should have the right to express their opinion. He further added that as celebrities, they should be cautious about their words and comments in the public.
Inspirations on project
The talk with Jiaming involved no sciences or technologies; we were concerned about the social impact of the technology itself. With his help, we realized the importance of regulations. Maybe in the project, we should consider reminding users of their social responsibility and all these regulations? An user agreement may help.
3.Ethics
Motivation
Ethical issues are important in the study of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology has enable scientists to change the genetic makeup of an existing living things, so it might raise controversy. CORE is designed to help re-engineered the genetic makeups of bacteria, so it is necessary to consider the ethic issues in the project.
Practices
Consulting Prof. He on bioethics considerations when designing a project.
We consulted Professor Zhumei He, experts on bioethics and biosafety in the campus. He gave us a small lecture about biological ethics, including the widespread controversy caused by transgenic technology, genetic therapy and human cloning. He also gave some advice in biological ethics to our software.
we have a discussion with prof. He.
1.  Users must be prohibited from re-engineering the genetic makeup of embryo.
2.  Users should be reminded of their potential responsibility in ethics and safety.
3.  Users, no matter who they are and where they come from, should be equal with respect to the right to know what synbio brings to them, and what might be the good and the bad of synbio.
We also invited Prof. He to do some assessment on the software. For more details, please navigate to “ Human Practice/Risk Assessment”.
Inspirations on project
Software in synbio should help the progress of synbio but should NEVER violate the public consensus on ethics and safety. In general, users cannot directly operate on embryos using CORE, and a user agreement embedded in CORE should tell users what can be done and what should not be done. So we should focus on the second and third notations by Prof. He. The equality in the right to know should be ensured by open communication; a bi-directional dialogue between scientists and ordinary people

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Other languages_-_-_TEXT.html,". The proposed strategy is reminiscent of the ancient Trojan-Horse story as bacteria are unable to distinguish between the gallium and iron uptake. We are convinced that through attacking a highly conserved metabolic pathway, we have found a successful strategy to combat multiresistant bacteria.
This year’s iGEM team Hamburg is working on trojan-horse-approach to fight multiresistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae with an approach based on synthetic biology. “Trojan-horse” implies that we use a vector delivering an effective drug that will be uptaken by the targeted bacteria. These vectors are siderophores, a polypeptide class synthesized by bacteria to replenish their iron storages to proliferate. Siderophores have a high iron affinity and are able to scavenge free ions from the surroundings or other molecules by forming a strong chelate complex. But the siderophores ability to complex ions is not exclusively limited to iron, a fact that we want to use. Through a chemical exchange reaction, we will remove the iron from the siderophores and add gallium ions instead to form a similar complex, that is then uptaken by the targeted bacteria. Gallium however has been proven to have cytotoxic effects. As siderophores are highly specific for particular pathogenic organisms, a therapy method based on them will only affect those without harming the host’s own flora. To create a working method we will combine all disciplines that our team members bring to the table. Our Life Sciences and Biology Division will manipulate bacteria to create two types of siderophores from the salicylate pathway, Pyochelin and Yersiniabactin, which are prevalently synthesized by pathogens. In the next step, we will perform toxicity measurements to analyse the effectivity of the described method. The Nanoscience Division works on a microfluidic device, lung-on-a-chip, that is able to carry out long term toxicity tests with human lung epithelial and alveolar epithelial cells. Our Chemistry Division will build both siderophores with a pure chemical synthesis and help to analyse and characterize our products.

Paris_Bettencourt,2011,Team:Paris Bettencourt#HumanPractice#wikiAnalysis_-_-_TEXT.html," generations of iGEM teams (2009-2011) although not as in the second iGEM competition. There were quite a low number of Do It Yourself biology (DIY) (green colour) issues addressed by the iGEM teams and this trend was also observed in teams that tried to develop tools (sea blue) (software, manual guides etc.). Some of the trends observed can also be attributed to the increase in diversity of the human practice projects as more teams tend to address different issues of synthetic biology in their projects.
Analysis of the Grenoble Video
The team from Grenoble made a video of a debate on synthetic biology that they sent to us as part of our Human practice project. They read the cooperative project proposal and decided to focus on a more ethical point of view. This kind of video provides a unique insight into what non-SBist think of the field.
The way they created the discussion allows people to express themselves and also to stir up substantive issues together. From their video, we highlighted three major issues: firstly, what means synthetic biology and what are the thoughts in terms of dream and fable? Secondly, what could be the main ethical issues? And finally how the future of such a field could take shape?
In the assembly, we saw two kind of personalities: on the one hand those that set out the idea of a technological tool that has practical applications and which is dedicated to commercial use. On the other hand people looking for any convincing arguments on the usefulness of SB. It clearly appears here that these people ask for more clarifications from scientists and companies. One of the fable behind could be the will of the synthetic biology cosmos to hide the truth in order to avoid any mass panic, as it happened with GMOs in France.
From the ethical point of view, two notions are underlined: the first of which is the scientists' responsibilities. Is the field too young insomuch, we scientists, fail analyzing it by taking a step back? Do we have enough credibility (And who would decide anyways? Politics, firms or scientists?)?  The last issue that was raised during the debate was: if there are commercial interests, how to avoid propagation of GMOs? Any scientist really has to dwell upon notions of capacity to live outside the lab, control and analysis of external factors. It is true, for instance, that if a commercial synthetic biological products was to be used by the general public there would be a clear concern of proper usage and proper recycling. This point allows me to dress up the second notion which is: do we have to put one's head on the block and"

UNF Summer Camp
The UNF Summer Camp is an opportunity for high school students to show extra dedication towards science. We talked to some of the brightest young minds imaginable, all of whom aim to work in different fields of science in the future. At the summer camp, we held a presentation about our project, the iGEM competition, as well as how to handle and work with genes. We taught them how to assemble BioBricks and provided them with BioBricks for DNA assembly experiments, creating a ‘hands-on’ experience for these enthusiastic teenagers.
One of the high school students suggested that the Powerleaf should be able to rotate according to the sun, to ensure maximum exposure and outcome. We took this brilliant advice into consideration and contacted Robot Systems Engineer student, Oliver Klinggaard, who helped us with the potential implementation of a pan/tilt system. He provided us with his recent project report on the subject, as well as a description of the adjustments required for the implementation in our system, which you can find here .
Two students from the UNF Summer Camp thought the PowerLeaf was an interesting approach to sustainable energy, and they wanted to hear even more! So, they contacted us in late October, as they were interested to work on a project about green technology.
The Academy for Talented Youth
We hosted a workshop for the Academy for Talented Youth, an association for some of the most talented high school students in Denmark. During the workshop we invited the students into our laboratories, where they conducted a miniprep and a gel electrophoresis on bacteria containing our BioBricks. Additionally, we held a presentation and discussion about our project, with the dedicated students. We strongly believe in mutual communication and made sure to compile feedback, all of which was positive!
Presentations for the Local Schools
The local high schools, Mulernes Legatskole and Odense Tekniske Gymnasium, invited us to present our project, in addition to starting discussions with the students about GMO.
An 8th grade class from the local public school, Odense Friskole, were invited to see our laboratory workspace. It was a challenge to successfully convey our project and the concept of synthetic biology in a way that would be easily understandable by 8th graders, who have only recently been introduced to science.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#19 September 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,". The Judges really liked the Second Life part of our project. They wanted to see more of Second Life . Some Judges recommended making Second Life the main part of our project. The judges unfortunately felt that they had trouble finding links betweent the 4 parts of the project. They also didn't like that in the poster presentation a different speaker was called to present his or her part of the project . They felt that only one speaker should be able to speak about all aspects of the project. The handouts given were praised.
After the Teams presentations were over , a Guest Speaker talked about the Finer Points of Public Speaking .  He talked about speaking softly when trying to highlight important points instead of speaking louder . He also recommended speaking slowly through out the presentation so that the audience had time to digest the information begin presented. He emphasized on pausing before speaking about the really important aspects of the presentation so that the audience knows to pay extra attention during that time.The science of memory in not perfect. People can only digest a certain amount of information at a time. At the end of a presentation , he urged , the audience should be able to recall three things about the presentation. It would be really advantageous if these three things were the main points of the presentation. To the get the message across it is important to organize the presentation in a way that it highlights the message's three important points. He recommended engaging the audience a little bit if time permits to create a connection with them . Attention grabbers are also important to keep the audience interested during the presentation. It is also important to know who the audience is so that their concerns can be addressed and also so that the audience can be addressed in their language.
He also gave us information about the Non Verbal Communication that happens during  public speaking between the audience and the speaker.
Crossing arms while speaking tended to make the presenter appear hostile and aggressive .  Keeping hands behind the back made the speaker seem like he or she had something to hide.  Hand in pocket showed disinterest from the speaker about the presentation topic.  Best to just leave hands beside body .  Moving hands around is good it shows enthusiasm.
Tips about answering questions :
When answering questions it is better to look down when thinking about the answer rather than look up . Looking up meant that the presenter was looking up at the heavens for answer because he or she was unsure of it. When answering questions , take a small pause before answering so that the answer doesn't look too prepared.  If the presenter is unsure of the meaning of the question it is a good idea to repeat the question being asked as it gives the presenter"

Sampling of expressed proteins
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was to take a 5 ml sample of the cell suspension 20h after expression induction.
Operational sequence:
At first, the OD600 was measured (1/10 dilution) and determined as 4,0. Afterwards, 5 ml of the cell suspension were taken out and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 4°C and 1500xg. The pellet was washed with 500µl of sterile water, followed by a second centrifugation step. The pellet was then stored at -80°C until cell lysis.

    From the killing test, we find that although warrior 2 is nearly perfect, but warrior 1 kills itself and is too weak. We modified the gene circuit in order to enhance the performance of warrior 1. We did this through changing promoters and adding the part TetR. We built a model to help us modify the gene circuit, see improved gene circuit. Apart from this, we a more thorough discussion on killing ability in model part ---regulation of killing ability."

Transforming into Bacillus subtilis 168
This protocol is designed to transform Bacillus subtilis 168 with a given BioBrick, which has been cloned into a suitable vector plasmid. This vector should be able to integrate with the Bacillus subtilis's genomic chromosome
These are some of the solutions needed for the Bacillus subtilis transformation procedure
Considerations
If not already done so, make up the individual solutions involved in the MM competence medium and starvation medium prior to the day you intend to transform the Bacillus subtilis cells – this includes the SMM medium, solution E, tryptophane solution, solution F, 20% casamino acids and 0.22% Fe-NH4-citrate solution. It is recommended that you make up 10ml stocks of each of these solutions except for SMM, which should be made up to 1 litre.
Don’t make up the MM competence medium or the starvation medium until the day you will be carrying out the transformations.
To carry out this transformation you will need to produce an overnight culture of B.subtilis – therefore inoculate the growth media (LB) on the evening before the transformations making sure that you follow the rest of the protocol starting in the morning.
This procedure will take over 6 hours to perform therefore make sure that you have your place in the lab booked for the whole day!
Make sure that you know the resistance conferred by the plasmid you are trying to insert into B. subtilis – this is important in the final step when you will plate out the ‘transformed’ cells onto selective media.
What you will need

Drug Delivery
Enabling highly specific drug delivery would be very beneficial in medicine.  It would allow doctors to deliver more efficacious therapy using smaller doses and without exposing the patient to the systemic effects of that drug, thus reducing side effects.  We are interested in the potential of using bacteria to increase specificity of delivery by utilizing their natural specificity to ecological niches.  Several models for this have already been proposed including utilizing bacteria to convert prodrugs into their active compounds (Rubinstein 1990), allowing bacteria to colonize tumours (Gardilk et al, 2010) and experimenting with drug delivery using bacterial ghosts, 'empty bacterial envelopes of Gram-negative bacteria...[that form] a lysis tunnel structure within the envelope of the living bacteria.' (Kudela et al, 2010).  When addressing how GEMs might be used in delivery of drugs, understanding how one might control the dosage of drugs being delivered and controlling the colonization of bacterial vectors within the body is important.  Our kill switch aims to give future teams of drug designers a tool with which the can selectively induce bacterial cell death under certain conditions, allowing precise control of bacterial vector colonies within the body.
From the beginning of our kill switch design, we foresaw the application of the project being used within a drug delivery context.  As intracellular antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production builds, protegrin-1 would slowly integrate into the bacterial phospholipids bilayer, causing pores to form between the membrane and the extracellular matrix (Lam, 2006).  We believe that the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the cell would cause the intracellular contents of the cell to be exported upon pore formation. This means that along with the cytosol, the potential drug will also be released into the extracellular matrix.
Bacteria as a drug vector?
Why use a non-pathogenic bacterium as a drug vector?  Isn’t using a pill a much safer and cost-effective way to absorb chemicals into the body?  Capsules have been used since their creation in 1834, as they allow the medicine to be contained within functionally-important media, such as oil"

PoPS -> His/Trp rich peptide export devices
In order for the cross-feeding scheme to work we need each strain to export the amino acid they produce (either Histidine or Tryptophan). To achieve this we created a devices design to secrete to the medium an His (or Trp) rich peptides.
Basic DNA structure of the devices with their constitutive parts
Kozak consensus sequence for initiation of translation.
Signal peptide that targets the product of the gene for secretion.
Trojan peptide to increase internalization in target cell.
Payload: this is the exported amino acid rich domain of the protein.
The input of the devices are PoPS and the output is secreted amino acids, so the devices are PoPS -> exported AA transducers. In principle any PoPS generating part can be used.
We built 2 His-export devices, and 2 Trp-export devices:

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

The gel of the PCR products showed bands about ~2900bp in length.  We also set up a PCR of the construct 10 primers and BBa_J04500 + TALE A template DNA. The gel of the PCR products showed 1800bp bands, which were too small. We repeated the PCR with an increased extension time and the gel showed bands of the expected size. The PCR product was purified and cut with BsaI, ligated together and transformed.
Because the PCR product was shorter than expected for the first Kapa PCR (construct 10), we also did a PCR of the BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B with BioBrick primers and with specially designed TALE primers to confirm the length of our TALEs. The results were good (Figure 23).

BIOFILM ENGINEERING
What are biofilms?
Biofilms are communities of microbes where the cells are in an aggregate on a surface, bound together by extra-membrane material made of a mixture of specialized carbohydrates and extra-membrane proteins. The special environment in the biofilm allows cells to survive harsher environments.
What is the “biofilm response”?
Bacteria cells can exist in multiple physiological states, which are caused by environmental factors. Common ones include heat shock, nutrient (carbohydrate or amino acid) starvation, metal micronutrient starvation, etc.
Gene expression in each of these physiological states is mediated by the changing the sigma factor involved in transcript synthesis. Each sigma factor has its own consensus sequence; the sigma factor on the RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to promoter regions. When a sigma factor is active, its effect is to shift which fractions of the genome are preferably expressed, because of the different promoter recognition consensus sequences. The sigma factor that is involved in the stationary phase (I.E. no motility, no reproduction) of E. coli strains is the σS factor. It directs the expression of genes necessary to induce biofilm and aggregation behavior are a subset of those genes whose promoters are recognized by the σSfactor.
Modulating and Measuring the Biofilm Response
The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.

Cooperation with KAIT_Japan on issues of safety.
KAIT_Japan has an issue of safety. When we were trying some program which could make our research safer, we got their proposal about safety. They performed ""Safety Icon Project"".In this project, they designed icons in safety, which you could tell whether the parts in registry were safety or not at a glance. You can see the explanation of the icons and their meanings here .

FLOWERING LOCUS T is derived from Arabidopsis thaliana and other all genes expect for iGEM Parts Kit are derived from E.coli. All experiments are conducted under the Biosafety level 1 control. All of rubbish containing recombinant E.coli is not carried out of our Lab before being sterilized. We always take care to lock the door of our Lab when there is no person so that the possibility that someone goes into our Lab and takes away recombinant cells is very low.
We are trained in applicable lab safety to ensure researcher safety and environmental safety. The researchers have also been trained in proper usage of chemicals and equipment. Some of the biological reagents and experiments necessary for the project needed safety measures. They were; Ethidium Bromide (EtBr), phenol, chloroform, 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid, gas burner, ultra violet LED, polyacrylamide, 2-mercaptoethanol, PFA. Therefore, all researchers keep following rules when we use the chemicals or equipment above.
EtBr (Ethidium bromide): EtBr is regarded as a mutagen, carcinogen or teratogen. Lab members were briefed on the possible effects of EtBr. During the experiments, we wore gloves. After use, the gloves and gel were separately disposed.
Phenol and 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic Acid: Phenol and its vapors are corrosive to eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid can cause serious irritation to eyes."

Where do you eventually hope to see your product being used?
We will deliver reliable diagnostics to the poorest & most remote areas of Central America & then the World!
When do you hope your product will reach the market?
Validation kicks off in November, rounding off right in time for dengue season next year!
Where do you see GlowDx in the future?
As a leader in developing diagnostic tests, tailored to the low resource regions of the world. We are first targeting neglected tropical diseases but will expand our portfolio into diagnosing diseases that universally affect humanity.
What do you think of iGEM and the buzzing synthetic biology community in Cork?
It’s great that one of the diseases you have targeted is Tuberculosis because it is so hard to culture, you are using clever molecular methods along with basic culture methods which get a rapid diagnosis of Tuberculosis compared to the available methods, this is the gold standard all over the world and is applicable to almost every lab.
For example, when I was in Honduras, they had a microbiology lab in the main hospital and they would have to common culturing methods but they were still using very slow growing methods for culturing TB.
In the last 5 years the WHO and The Foundation of Renovated Diagnostics have put an emphasis on investment into diagnostics for developing countries. Diagnostics are central to an intervention with the patient. Unless they have a suitable diagnostic, there won’t be any progress and they won’t get the correct treatment on the other side. For a student team to be able to create this can have a massive impact on the world.
From what I’ve seen over the summer, this year’s iGEM team is very diverse and each of you have an area of expertise and traits that you bring to the team. You are a very talented group of students. Good luck in Boston!

Advice from Dr. Brigid Lucey
In our talks with experienced biomedical scientist, Dr. Brigid Lucey, we found that a niche exists even in developed labs for a rapid diagnostic for TB. As Mycobacterium tuberculosis is slow growing, it is difficult to culture. For this reason, lab results are often delayed even weeks for a confirmation of results. Basehunter could"

Printemps des sciences
Education engagement: printemps des sciences
March 25th 2018
Alex and Marine, members of both 2017 and 2018 iGEM UCLouvain teams took part in Printemps de Sciences (literally Science Spring). Printemps the Science is a yearly event organized by Sciences.Be ( http://www.sciences.be ).
The aim of this event? Talk about Science and Research to a general public of any age, interested in science but not working or studying in the field!
Ever since the beginning, we focused on making our ideas and project understandable for anybody and this event has been a great rehearsal in preparation for our European Event!
During the event our colleagues talked about BactaSun, last year’s project, and explained to the public what iGEM is and how it can improve the world!
We also briefly talked about our new project, BactWars, that we were already developing and conceiving!
Workshops for high school pupils
Education engagement: workshops for high school pupils
November 2018
Following the Giant Jamboree we will organize some workshops for High School pupils of Lycée Martin V, a public high school based near our campus.
Our colleagues are in contact with Mrs Anne-Catherine Burteau, science teacher, that will take her pupils to our lab where they will be able to try some basic techniques and learn about safety rules!
We are very excited for this upcoming event, that will also allow us to raise awareness about our project among these young students

Visiting professor Chen huaigu
Chen huaigu is a professor who specializes in Fusarium head blight. He mostly focuses on the chemical control , and he acknowledged the biology control is a promising treatment for  FHB . He gave us the professional suggestions on the mechanism of our project.
Visiting professor Zhou
We introduced our project to professor Zhou, getting many useful feedback. His suggestions helped us view our project in a different way, find the existing problem in our project, and lead us to think more about application and the practical problems. We used his advice and constantly kept in touch with him. In addition, we also gathered information and data on the Fusarium head blight to assist us with modeling from professor Zhou.
Visiting professor   Wang yanzhang   Tang weihua
Institute of Plant Physiology & Ecology ，SIBS, CAS
Tang and Wang are professors who work on the “The Interaction of Fusarium and host plants”. We had made a strong impression and a solid case for continued suggestions from these experts in this area.
Professors help us better understand how this pathogen proliferates within the host plant.
More knowledgeable after the visit  : the strategy of infection; the synthesis of toxins; the mechanism of host plant ’s defense response; the mechanism of fungicide resistance……
“First and foremost, You need to know the production of proteins from the yeast ,then you should think about how to spray drugs , just like the easiest way that you can spray biological pesticide , but you have to purify the proteins first. Besides, you had better know when to spray the biological pesticide and where to spray.”

Also in the last lab session, the Metal Sensing team digested 10ul of BBa_J33206 (in pSB1A2) with ' and ' and ran the fragments through agarose gel in DNA gel electrophoresis. The backbone fragment (minus the original promoter) was then excised out of the gel and stored in an Eppendorf tube. Today will see the team remove the gel from the excised band by using the Gel Extraction kit.
Practical Outline
By the time the day is over the Metal Sensing team hope to carry out the following:
Carry out a second attempt at a PCR reaction on the genome of Bacillus subtilis
Purify an excised band (the BBa_J33206 in the pSB1A2 plasmid without the promoter)
Procedure
PCR Reaction
Setting up the PCR machine
Exp.No.2 We used the same protocol as used on the 21/08/2009 to carry out our PCR. The only difference is that this time we have only 6 samples, and the annealing temperature will be changed to 50 degree ( instead of the previous 56 degree). Also, we got some B.subtilis genomic DNA from Prof.Colin Hardwood's lab; last time the PCR reaction was carried out on crude cell extracts.
Sample 1 : B.subtilis 168 genomic DNA + pGFPconf2 + pGFPconf3 = control Sample 2 : B.subtilis transformed with pGFP-rrnB + pGFPconf2 + pGFPconf1 Sample 3 : B.subtilis transformed with pGFP-rrnB + pGFPconf4 + pGFPconf3 Sample 4 : B.subtilis transformed with pGFP-rrnB + pGFPconf1 + pGFPconf4 Sample 5 : B.subtilis transformed with pGFP-rrnB + pGFPconf2 + pGFPconf3 Sample 6 : PCR water + pGFPconf2 + pGFPconf3 ( no template DNA ) = control

today we started looking into databases to find regulatory network for MITF, our question is: what does it regulate? if it is fused with cpp, will it effect regulation on any gene in E. Coli?
there are many databases that we need to look for:
- MITF regulates not only the expression of enzymes involved in melanin synthesis, but also the expression of a receptor which plays an essential role in melanocyte functions
- Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) regulates the differentiation and development of melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelium and is also responsible for pigment cell-specific transcription of the melanogenesis enzyme genes. Review.
- MITF and STAT3 cooperatively induce c-fos, resulting in cellular transformation
- The results of this study demonstrate a role for glutamate in MiTF regulation that may have implications in melanocyte associated disorders.
- Sphingosylphosphorylcholine reduces melanin synthesis via MITF downregulation.
- MITF evokes transcription of a paradigmatic MITF target tyrosinase and show that the adenoviral E1A protein represses the MITF-driven transcription in these cells.
and more on http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4286
After talking with Lars about iGEM, he mentioned some databases:
Transfac: transcriptional gene regulation in eukaryotes Consite: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15215389 web-based prediction of regulatory elements using cross-species comparison. Jaspar: JASPAR 2010: the greatly expanded open-access database of transcription factor binding profiles. http://jaspar.cgb.ki.se/
I also found this database which is for prokaryotic PRODORIC: prokaryotic database of gene regulation. link for article: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12519998
Mathworks offers several tools for computational biology. Knowing the capabilities of them will help in future estimations.

Summary
Increasing global oil demands require innovative technologies for the extraction of unconventional oil sources such as those found in Alberta’s Carbonate Triangle. Carbonate oil deposits account for almost 50% of the world’s oil reserves and 26% of Alberta’s bitumen1. Due to unstable oil prices in Western Canada, these vast reserves have historically been set aside in favour of less time consuming, more economical sites. Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) has been utilized across the world to increase the productivity of difficult resources including carbonate oil deposits. Using a synthetic biology approach, we have designed the CAB (CO2, acetic acid, and biosurfactant) extraction method that demonstrates a modified MEOR method for extracting carbonate oil deposits. CAB extraction will utilize natural carbon fixation machinery in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus to convert CO2 into sugars to fuel acetic acid and biosurfactant production in Escherichia coli. Acetic acid applied to carbonate rock increases the pore sizes and produces gases to help pressurize the well site and facilitate extraction. The biosurfactant rhamnolipid will also be applied to the carbonate rock to further enhance extraction yields. Our objectives include:
Introducing enzymes for glucose production and secretion into S. elongatus to convert CO2 into metabolites needed to fuel E. coli cell growth.
Constructing a co-localized multi-enzymatic pathway in E. coli for optimized acetic acid production and secretion.
Utilizing Pseudomonas aeruginosa enzymes in E. coli to produce rhamnolipid to enhance oil recovery together with the acetic acid.
Integrating an inducible “kill switch” gene into the E. coli genome to prevent cell proliferation and risk of environmental contamination.
By coupling carbon capture with acetic acid and biosurfactant production, carbonate oil deposits can be mined with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The use of carbon fixation to feed downstream systems can be tailored for use in many applications requiring inexpensive methods for fueling biological systems. Furthermore, a carbon capture module will be of interest in more conventional oil extraction strategies such as in situ steam methods, as it will help mitigate CO2"

We digested both the PCR products of Cre and pC13F with EcoRI and SpeI. We may have found a limonene synthase gene we can use. We ran another PCR to append cut sites to the linearized pC13F that ultimately failed with no bands visible on a gel. As our previous construction of pC13AY likely failed since no colonies being present on the new plate, we redid digestions of pC13E and pC13P to redo the construction. We also redigested both pAK13D and pC13P minipreps with SpeI and PstI since the gel from yesterday was inconclusive. We then ligated pAK13D with GFP, pAK13D with mRFP, pC13P with GFP and pC13P with mRFP. We prepared pellets from our cultures of pC13F+pC13BK, pC13BL, pC13BJ, and pC13BM cells which were stored in the fridge as we wait for our miniprep kit to arrive. Sequencing of pAK13AC has failed, and we will resubmit a miniprep of it. We plated stocks of pC13M and pC13K.
Cloning of the Cre gene is going well, and we may have found a useful limonene synthase gene! We are continuing the previously problematic cloning of GFP with T7 promoter-hopefully it works this time! Sequencing of pAK13AC unfortunately failed.
