        Our work belongs to level Ⅰ~Ⅲ which means that we have                     to gain the approval of the relevant administrative departments when we decide to covert the project                     into industrial manufacture. Professor Yang also suggested us paying more attention to the popularization                     of biosafety to avoid the situation that the public rejected to use because of the confusion of bacteria.
Environmental Protection Administration in Zhongshan City
        We were honor to interview the Environmental Protection Administration in                     Zhongshan City, Guangdong Province for acquiring the policy about the environmental monitoring and the                     regulations of polluted water discharge.
        The official of the administration told us that electroplating                     and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacture would produce wastewater with heavy metal ions. And inspectors                     would visit the factories to take sample checking whether the discharged wastewater reached the national                     drinking water safety standards. After our introduction of the project, the official said that the public                     and the factories can use it to detect the heavy metals in the water or soil as a mean of self-monitoring.
Questionnaire
        In order to learn the public’s awareness status of heavy metal pollution,                     we conducted a survey with a total of 356 people participated in, most of whom were undergraduates over                     18 years old.
        Our questionnaire included three parts: public attention to heavy metal pollution,                     public awareness of heavy metals and the status quo and demand of heavy metal science popularization.
Public Attention to Heavy Metal Pollution
        More than half of the respondents believed that the heavy                     metal pollution in nearby district was not severe and it was necessary for the public to learn more about                     the heavy metal pollution and repair status.
Public Awareness of Heavy Metals
The Status Quo and Demand of Heavy Metal Science Popularization
Q1: If you have a brochure in hand, what are you most interested in?
A. The source of heavy metal pollution
B. The damage of heavy metals causing to human body
C. The treatment of heavy metal poisoning
D. The means to detect the heavy metal
E. The repair measures of heavy metal pollution
        More than half of the respondents believed that the local government lacked                     heavy metal pollution prevention and propaganda work, indicating that there was a great demand for relevant                     propaganda. At the same time,"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#ecoli survival_-_-_TEXT.html," more evidence was needed to see what would happen to the E. coli in the sugar water for the time scales we are interested in. We know the presence of the high amount of sugar water leads to osmotic stress. 1 This is because the sucrose molecules from the medium are not able to travel across the cell-membrane, but still pull the water molecules present inside the cell towards them. The effects of the osmotic stress on the bacterium were not clear outside of the 90 minute range determined by the metabolic model. However, as determined by the BEEHAVE model , we require that the BeeT survives for days in the sugar water. In this project we aimed to experimentally determine how long BeeT can survive in osmotically unfavourable conditions.
Testing Survival
The results from the experiments were a great success, as you can see in Figure 1 and 2. The result of experiment 3 is that the E. coli was still able in the LB was still possible after the 24 hours in the sugar water solution. All three experiments clearly show that sugar water is not as lethal as first hypothesized. Not only that, but the results fit with the model hypothesis in that long-term survival is indeed possible. Thus we have shown that ​ E. coli can indeed be used as a chassis for our BeeT. This result was taken into account in the BEEHAVE model .

The time step increases for row 3 to 50 minutes, row 5 to 90 minutes, and row 7 to 120 minutes. Row 8 and all intermediate rows are negative controls.

We had a clear choice here: We could have made Neptune interface with industry grade, powerful and very expensive fabrication methods using photolithography and plasma bonding. If we decided to do this, there would be a blunt eighty-thousand-dollar barrier of entry to researchers and hobbyists looking to use Neptune. That would be unacceptable. We could have had Neptune’s microfluidics be controlled using very high precision, high accuracy pumps that would provide flawless flow rates. But the hardware and infrastructure for these pumps would cost hundreds of dollars per pump, and the cost would not scale. We could not settle for this.
Instead, we framed our workflow around the low cost MakerFluidics fabrication protocol. In this protocol, the eighty thousand dollar fabrication process of photolithography is bypassed; instead our microfluidic chips are fabricated with a simple CNC mill, costing a order of magnitude less, while still delivering high performance devices.
We made it our project goal, to fully integrate accessibility into Neptune. Neptune is microfluidics for industry, for research, for education and for hobbyists. We made Neptune have the lowest possible bar to entry; it is the only microfluidic design, fabrication and control workflow all integrated into one software tool-- and the best part is it can be used by anyone. We made accessibility the centerpiece of Neptune.
Open Hardware Schematics
A big aspect of enabling accessible microfluidics is reducing the barrier of entry for controlling these devices. Microfluidics are controlled by pumps that generate pressures gradients to push or pull fluids, or open and close valves. Most modern microfluidic control pumps are expensive and difficult to integrate, making it hard to scale for larger microfluidic designs, and dissuasive for hobbyists.
We chose to directly target our hardware designs to this problem. We developed completely open 3D print design schematics for our microfluidic control infrastructure. These designs are available for download on our GitHub repo, and server though Neptune as well! Furthermore, we developed a completely original hardware design to control syringe pumps using very low cost servo motors.
NONA Research Foundation Partnership
Integrating our workflow with the idea of accessibility was a huge step; we successfully build Neptune as the most accessible microfluidics creation tool to date, with low cost fabrication protocols, open hardware designs, and powerful design algorithms- virtually any research lab can now realistically consider microfluidics as an option, without devoting huge costs or needing expertise in the field.
A big step, but we had to go further. The biggest issue we faced as the summer drew to a close was sustainability. Indeed, a"

The autotransporter secretion system
Only Receptors that are exposed to the outside of E. coli can catch the virus. E.coli is a gram-negative bacterium that has an inner membrane and an outer membrane, and a periplasmic space between the inner and outer membranes. Because of this, we need the autotransporter secretion system to construct our receptor proteins on E. coli 's surface.
We chose to implement two different autotransporter mechanisms (OmpA and C-IgAP) because we wanted to test and compare their secretion abilities. We suspected that the C-IgAP system is more efficient than the OmpA system.

NTNU-Trondheim,2013,Team:NTNU-Trondheim#ExamplePage_-_-_TEXT.html," toxicity to the cell.
Stress is a common regulatory cue that allows organisms to adjust to variable conditions in the environment. As a result, stress-responsive regulatory elements are prevalent motifs in nature.  Due to the toxicity caused by the toxR chimeras in E. coli, a method of regulating its expression to produce the maximum amount of ToxR chimera without killing the cell was needed. We hypothesized that the E. coli genome likely contains such stress responsive regulatory systems from which regulatory feedback systems can be constructed. Expression of the ToxR chimera to toxic levels by stress promoters can be downregulated by stress in a feedback loop. This maintains a high but nonlethal level of expression of the toxic gene.
In order to construct a feedback system, we analyzed microarray data of the E. coli genome for regulatory elements downregulated by stress. Moen, et. al. (2009) subjected E. coli to generalized stresses and measured the global mRNA levels of all genome elements for stress response. From their data, we identified 35 potential stress promoters that were downregulated under all stress conditions tested for further characterization. We isolated the region of the genome upstream of the ORF through PCR and placed the resulting pool of 35 stress promoters in front of GFP.
The construct was transformed into E. coli and subjected to general stress conditions. We measured the fluorescence with a tecan plate reader and looked for decreased fluorescence. While not all promoters responded by downregulating GFP expression, a few did show a significant change in fluorescence, with the cold condition yielding the best data. The fluorescence measurements from the Tecan plate reader were confirmed by flow cytometry.
Since some of the stress promoters displayed the desired behavior, we proceeded to incorporate the stress promoter pool into a stress response system with ToxR. In our stress feedback system,  expression of the  ToxR chimera activates the ctx promoter (Pctx), driving GFP production, and creates cellular stress. The stress promoter responds to stress by downregulating ToxR-IILK expression to a nonlethal level, allowing the cell to maintain a high level of ToxR chimera expression without toxicity.
In order to ensure nonlethal expression of the ToxR chimera, we created an rbs library for each of the 35 stress promoters to construct a promoter-rbs library in front of ToxR-IILK. We transformed the plasmid into cells containing Pctx.RBS.GFP and grew them up to assay the efficacy of the stress responsive feedback system. In our growth assay, we looked for large, healthy colonies as"

To get an estimate of how the detection system would work under ideal conditions we created two                     mathematical                     models of the system. These two models represent two likely scenarios of how the biological process                     works.                     Using these models we can simulate the biological reactions that occur within the sample area when                     the
peanut protein Ara h 1 is introduced and thus estimate parameters and variables involved in the                 process.                 Furthermore, by estimating the detectors dimensional, optical and electrical restrictions we can                 estimate                 the final signal strength of the detector.
The models
By researching the many reactions involved in the biological process we finally created the                     following                     mass                     action models for the system.
Model 1
`(dEAC)/dt=k1f*Ab*E-k1b*EAC-k2f*EAC*Ar`
`(dA AC)/dt=k2f*EAC*Ar-k3f*A AC+k3b*Ar*Ab`
`(dAb)/dt=k3f*A AC-k3b*Ab*Ar-k1f*Ab*E+k1b*EAC`
`(dE)/dt=k2f*EAC*Ar-k1f*Ab*E+k1b*EAC`
`(dAr)/dt=k3f*A AC-k2f*Ar*EAC-k3b*Ar*Ab`
Model 2
`(dEAC)/dt=k1f*Ab*E-k1b*EAC`
`(dA AC)/dt=k3f*Ab*Ar-k3b*A AC`
`(dAb)/dt=k3b*A AC-k3f*Ab*Ar-k1f*Ab*E`
`(dE)/dt=k1b*EAC-k1f*Ab*E`
`(dAr)/dt=k3b*A AC-k3f*Ar*Ab`
EAC and AAC are the epitope- and Ara h 1-antibody complexes. Ab, E and Ar are the antibodies,                     epitopes                     and Ara h 1 proteins that create the complexes. The differential equations above describes the                     interactions between these molecules with the association (f) and dissociation (b) rate constants                     k1-3.1, 2, 3
For model 1 we assume that the change from epitope to Ara h 1 is done by changing one protein for                     the                     other, independently of the dissociation of proteins. In"

NEU-China-A
Overview
The goal of NEU_China_A this year is to design a biological system aiming to alleviate intestinal inflammatory diseases and prevent potential colorectal cancer. We chose E. coli Nissle 1917 as our chassis, a probiotic that is safe for humans. On the one hand, when it senses an inflammatory signal in the intestine, it releases an anti-inflammatory drug (interleukin-10) to put out the fire in the intestines. On the other hand, it can release myrosinase to convert the glucosinolate contained in cruciferous vegetables into sulforaphane. The sulforaphane can both alleviate inflammation in the intestine and prevent colorectal cancer induced by chronic inflammation.
Intestinal homeostasis
There are a lot of microorganisms living in the intestines. The intestinal villi and the underlying tissueshave      the largest immune cell population in the human body. Harmonious coexistence between the intestinalflora and      the immune cells is critical to human health. Consequently, the intestine has evolved severalmechanisms.
In the crypt, the goblet cells secrete mucus covering the surface of the intestinal villi and Paneth cells     secrete antibacterial peptides to inhibit bacterial invasion. In addition, the basal stem cells continue to     proliferate and differentiate to renew the intestinal epithelium.

NYMU-Taipei,2010,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Project#Speedy reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," All the examples above is studies on eukaryotic system. Recent studies suggest that the mature mRNA transcript remain confined within subcellular regions (Mascarenhas et al., 2001; Montero Llopis et al., 2010). The RNase E, a component of RNA degradosome in E.coli, also shows uneven distribution in the cytoplasm (Montero Llopis et al., 2010). Thess findings challenge the assumption that translation and decay of any mRNA are homogeneous in space of prokaryotic systems. Thus, the spatially organized mRNA processing is essential for the control of gene expression. As we know, there are a few studies of mRNA location in prokaryotic systems. The localization of genetic information transfer is arguably the critical part of designing customized signalling circuits (Lim, 2010). The more basic rule of prokaryotic system we know, the more successful and speedy experiments we will have.
The common way to detect mRNA is RT-PCR, which can only be done in vitro but can’t in a real living cell. The common way to detect the protein is fusion a reporter protein such as GFP to report it, and the folding of GFP takes about four hours. In order to do both assay speedy and in vivo, we apply a novel technique Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation, BiFC. In our design, we need not to wait four hours for folding of GFP to detect our protein fusion GFP. We can get our signal in few minute using this method. And it also can detect the mRNA both location and quantity (Demidov and Broude, 2006). We can use this method save about fours for protein assay and two hours for mRNA assay (Fig.1).
Figure.1 compare to the traditional method of detecting mRNA and protein. our speedy reporter only need 3 min to obtain signal (Demidov and Broude, 2006).
BiFC is developed base on the technique Protein-fragment Complement Assay, PCA (Barnard et al., 2008; Demidov and Broude, 2006). Protein-protein interactions coupled to refolding of a pair of split enzymes in the PCA technique. The enzyme used in PCA has it activity only when two split parts reconstruct together. The activities of enzyme act as a detector of protein-protein interaction (Remy and Michnick, 2007). While the BiFC technique use split fluorescent protein instead of split enzyme in the PCA. The split form of fluorescent protein alone has no fluorescence. Fluorescence"

This week we optimized our fluorescence-based assay for the characterization of our quorum sensing regulated promoters BBa_K1670001 and BBa_K1670003 by adjusting the measurement intervals and slightly adapting the measured emission wavelength. The results proofed the functionality of BBa_K1670001 and BBa_K1670003 and further characterized BBa_K1670002 and BBa_K1670005 . The fluorescent assay was further used to characterize pCERI in both used chassis, E.coli BL21 and E.coli Nissle 1917. The results showed us that we are probably having some problems with the expression of EsaI and CepR, leading to a lack of 3OC6-HSL and no expression of mRFP and CFP. When we supplied the cells with external C8- and 3OC6-HSL however we got a good CFP emission in BL21, however hardly any mRFP expression, which might indicate, that the CepR expression under the control of the esaS-promoter is not sufficient to produce enough activator. Due to a lack of the CepR-activator, no mRFP gets expressed. This assumption is further supported by the fact, that BBa_K1670003 showed to be functional, when characterized individually. E. coli Nissle 1917 on the other hand seems to degrade the formed CFP quite fast, as the measured fluorescence seems to rise in the beginning, but starts to decrease after a few hours.
This week mutAADC, CvATA, TYR as well as CHAP with the added BioBrick prefix and suffix were first purified and then further digested with EcoRI-HF and PstI for insertion into linearised pSB1C3 which was also digested with EcoRI-HF and PstI.

Transformation in Physcomitrella patens
To transform Physcomitrella patens, the moss material has to be taken from the liquid culture and its cell walls have to be digested with driselase dissolved in mannitol to obtain protoplasts. The protoplasts are isolated by passing the digested material through sieves and the enzyme is washed off with mannitol and then resuspended in mannitol.
The number of protoplasts is determined with a hemocytometer and the material is suspended in the right amount of 3M medium to adjust the concentration. The linearized and purified DNA is mixed with PEG4000 and the protoplast solution and incubated while regularly mixing. After incubation, the mixture is diluted with 3M medium, centrifuged and resuspended in regeneration medium.
The protoplasts are put into 6-well plates, left in the dark over night and then left for 10 days for the regeneration of the cell walls at standard conditions. After moving the protoplasts onto solid medium covered with a layer of cellophane for three days, they are transferred to solid selection medium plates for two weeks. To ensure stabile integration, repeat the two weeks of selection after a two week release phase.

We had the great chance to perform our Physcomitrella patens transformations at Prof. Dr.Reski´s lab in Freiburg, with Dr. Wiedemann as our expert instructor. Our first trip started in a great hurry, because we worked on our DNA preparations until the very last minute. Ingmar even pulled an all-nighter to get the DNA ready.

""The advances in computer science are what allow for synthetic biology to be such a rapidly booming discipline. Only with the advent of fast, computerized data analysis are we able to systematically study every single one of nature's nuances in a high-throughput and unbiased way.
Then, by understanding everything, we can begin to understand why nature has evolved in the way it did, and give us ways to cleverly manipulate the data. In my opinion, synthetic biology wouldn't really exist without the help of computer science (obviously, it would still have been developed with Knight and the Biobricks, but would not be getting the attention that it does now)
As for upcoming research ideas, it's all about the CRISPR and Cas-9 system. The possibilities with gene editing are endless and I can't wait to see what developments arise with this wonderful technology to give Jennifer Doud"

UVR8 - TetRDBD fusion: a UV sensing protein
We wanted to keep the TetRDBD as intact as possible, thus we fused the C-terminus of TetRDBD to the N-terminus of UVR8. Three different fusion strategies were carried out to test for the best TetRDBD-UVR8 construct:
1. TetRDBD-full UVR8 - Full length UVR8 fusion with TetRDBD without a linker
2. TetRDBD-GGS-UVR8 - Full length UVR8 fusion with TetRDBD with extended [GGS]2-linker (6 additional amino acids)
3. TetRDBD-dUVR8 - Truncated version of UVR8 lacking 13 amino acids in N-terminus fusion with TetRDBD
Plasmids
Constructs were tested in two plasmid system: repressor and reporter plasmids.  We used a medium copy number pSEVA183 derived plasmid (provided by Andreas Bosshart ) constitutively expressing LacI as the repressor-plasmid. UVR8-TetRDBD fusions, TetRDBD and full length TetR (as a control) were cloned under the control of the Ptac promoter.
GFP controlled by Ptet promoter (<partinfo>BBa_I13522</partinfo>) was cloned into pSB4K5 - a low copy number plasmid - and used as the reporter system.

Safety
The field of synthetic biology recognizes biosafety as an important consideration alongside its revolutionary research and rapidly emerging technologies.
Our team has held all safety concerns to the highest standard by complying with all general laboratory safety guidelines, recognizing and minimizing potential risks and hazards, consulting our institutional biosafety committee, and exploring how safety concerns can be addressed in the wider iGEM community.
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Our team is working on RNA strand displacement reactions in mammalian cells. Most of our team worked in a BL2 lab with E. coli, and a few members of our team worked in an adjoining BL2 tissue culture facility with Human Embryonic Kidney cells. These cell lines are uncontaminated, and we follow standard BL2 protocols to ensure our safety. Potentially hazardous chemicals, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), are handled according to recommendations listed on materials safety data sheets (MSDS). The team participated in 4 hours of classroom training administered by MIT Environmental Health and Safety and was closely monitored by a MIT EHS representative during all lab work. We were in compliance with local and national safety and lab-specific equipment regulations to avoid potential cross-contamination. All researchers donned personal protective equipment including gloves, laboratory coats, and eyewear when necessary.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? How did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
We have developed many BioBricks this summer. However, none of our parts have potential hazards for any organisms. We made the decision not to pursue viral infection as a means of delivery of nucleic acids to mammalian cells, ensuring our risk was fully minimized. Additionally, no killer proteins or any protein known to trigger a serious"
TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html," sequencing it seemed that there is no Endonuclease there but a T4 DNA ligase.
BBa_K142202 is also available in the registery(it is the same as BBa_K142205 but without promoter). Tim checked this biobrick also by sequencing and it seemed that it is the right part, as I understood. But after assembling BBa_K142202 with a pLAc promoter the same results showed on agarose gel as with BBa_K142205, same fragment size. So last friday we tried to sequence this biobrick but this sequencing failed.
Otherwise things are going as smooth as planned.. Probably next week we'll have the final construct (Absent next week)
Sriram
In delay device: 1st plan did not work, luckily the backup plan did.  The problem is that final microlitres of T4 DNA ligase & SpeI endonuclease were not showing best activities and hence we ordered new ones from Ginko biolabs. In the meantime we tried to use the lab enzymes from other company which obviously didn't work because of buffer conflicts.
We have to order miniprep kit.

The questionnaire is ready to be sent around, waiting final feedback from Emrah. Helping people in the lab, absent next week.
20th August 2009
We had a big meeting with Groningnen, Amsterdam and Delft
7th August 2009
Update of procedures:
Amount of cells grown by the delay device team is quite small
Transformations for the delay device team did not work as well as expected; it is unknown if it is because the cells are incompetent, the transformation process went awry or too much antibiotic was used
The delay device cascade model has been upgraded (we have 30 parameters in 9 different equations (IPTG diffusion equation, 4 ODE's for the mRNA concentrations and 4 ODE's for the protein concentrations))
Some modelling conclusions: if there is leakage, there is no delay (if leakage is higher then 10^-5%, the delay would be less then 1 minute, where the maximum delay is 400 minutes)
mfold hybridization software was used to hybridize the secondary structures of locks designed by Daniel and key3c designed by Berkeley 2006 iGEM team. The kinks and unpaired bases were modified by changing the key3c sequence to make new keys fitting the locks

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#TERRA Software_-_-_TEXT.html," the user would enter information about their experiment, such as the number of outputs and the vessel they plan to use. They would then configure each output by inputting which control syringes from the control syringe pumps actuate it. Lastly, the user selects the wells for dispensing on the table under Output Destination.
The feedback we received from the Harvard iGEM team and scientists in the lab, however, highlighted that it was difficult to use. The requested information was unclear and the format of the UI was confusing. In addition, initial users felt that the UI needed a slight “face lift” in terms of aesthetics. During the design process for the next iteration we decided to improve the UI by reducing the amount of information the user enters, adding a UI tutorial video, and additional focus on the UI’s aesthetics.
To do this, we first had to break down exactly what information the UI needed to gather from the user to run TERRA. This was important because it gave us an idea of how to restructure the UI and make it more efficient. We broke down the necessary input information based on key sub-functions TERRA executes to transfer the outputs of the user’s microfluidic chip into the desired locations on their vessel.
Sub-Functions
Dispense Time
Output Selection
Dispense Location
User Input
Fluid Density
Control Syringe Pump Pairs per Output
Vessel in Use (24, 96, 384 well plate)
Flow Rate
# of Output
Well Locations per Output
Microfluidic System (Continuous Flow vs Droplet)
Sample Volume
# of Outputs
Nozzle Tube Length
Vessel Dimensions
Nozzle Tube Outer Diameter
Nozzle Tube Surface Tension
Sample Volume
After aggregating the following information we identified user data that can be standardized to offload it from the user. The first and easiest fix was to have TERRA use tubing of known length, material, and outer diameter. In addition, the TERRA Adapter was standardized by characterizing each output in advance. By knowing the total number of outputs for the experiment, TERRA automatically configures the outputs with their respective control syringes. The user simply needs to ensure that the TERRA Adapter is connected properly to their microfluidic chip. Once inputs were offloaded, error-check functionality was incorporated to alert the user if inputted data is unfeasible or incorrect format. With error-check, the input fields are either highlighted red to prompt the user to change their input or to green to confirm that the entered data is in the proper format.

7/15/2015: Day 32
Today we built off of the victory of yesterday and programmed the flasks to rotate in the direction of Mars’ center to create the illusion that the flasks deploy the bacteria onto Mars.  We checked in with our PI, sent out an updated list of designs and artistic things needed to Casey, and scheduled a meeting with Larry to receive laser cutter training.  Then, the HCI lab met with the MIT App Inventor team and showed them some demos of the research we were working on.  It was very exciting to meet everyone on the team and learn about their very cool work (and some of their ties with iGEM!)
7/16/2015: Day 33
This morning we had our training with Larry on laser cutting basics-- it was so exciting to be in the machine shop and see all of the machinery at work.  We made a simple “Hello World”-esque plaque for Johanna, and explored the other things and opportunities in the shop!  Casey also sent us a lot of beautiful artwork and designs that we incorporated-- very exciting :)
7/17/2015: Day 34
Today we’ve been doing our best to pull everything together and have the best possible prototype for when the BU and MIT iGEM teams come visit us tomorrow!  We’re also discussing next steps to take!
7/20/2015: Day 35
Today we reflected on how the BU/MIT iGEM teams’ comments and made some adjustments to our project accordingly.  In particular, people wanted specific instructions at every step of the process, so we created “bubble instructions” and contact Casey to ask for a template of message images and icons.  We also continued to look into creating the tangibles, including contacting Larry about materials and googling pros and cons of different materials and where to order them from.
7/21/2015: Day 36
Today we continued discussing how to obtain different materials with Larry, added status bar functionality, and generally prepped for prototyping-- tomorrow, three high school interns will be coming to our lab to try out the project.  I am very excited to see how people interact with it and how they feel, especially since I couldn’t attend the BU/MIT meet up!

""The biobrick R10 standard is restrictive and becomes more and more cumbersome if more than 1-2 forbidden restriction sites are present... However, I am concerned that if the standard was not available the registry might not be able to maintain and produce biobricks as easily as it can now."" Student
""I agree that current ""one pot"" assembly methods and DNA synthesis are making the previous standard assembly methods obsolete.  That said, what standard - if any - do you propose as a replacement?  Does the notion of part standardization apply in synthetic biology?  If so, how do you refine the definition?  If not, what are the possible down sides to no longer defining part standards?  I'm all for moving forward, but I'd like to know what I'm moving towards."" Faculty Instructor

The Open Sequence Format
After many meetings and brainstorming sessions we decided to propose The Open Sequence Format via RFC95 that is intended to replace the current Biobrick standard RFC10 in order to reduce restrictions on parts submitted to the Parts Registry. Crucially, this RFC removes the sequence restrictions imposed by RFC10 regarding the removal of the restriction enzymes sites EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI from parts before they are eligible for inclusion in the Parts Registry.
You can download our pre-Wiki-freeze draft of the RFC95 below:

Quality Control and The Open Sequence Format
Quality control is critical for any serious engineering endeavor. While teams SHOULD sequence verify their parts to detect point mutations and small indels, the BioBricks Foundation needs a simple and rapid method for determining that parts are at least the correct size when submitted to The Registry. Currently this quality control is achieved through the use of the restriction sites present in the BioBrick prefix and suffix, resulting in highly restrictive rules for part submission. Therefore, we propose an alternative submission plasmid, pSB1C95, featuring the homing endonucleases I-SceI and I-CeuI and their"
Lund,2017,Team:Lund#Modeling#ParameterEstimation_-_-_TEXT.html,"11 has approximately 600 amino acids which             yields $\ce{k_\text{ME}=1.5}$ min-1. The GFP1-9 transcript has approximately 200 amino acids which yields $\ce{k_\text{MG}=4.5}$             min-1.
e) The rate constants were taken for 17β-estradiol [4].
f) The NahR-Psal association and dissociation rates were taken as $k_\text{aNP} = 4.7 \cdot 10^{-3}$ nM-1min-1 and             $k_\text{dNP}=11.46$ min-1 after unit conversions [5].
g) A dose-response scheme for the salicylate inducible promoter was taken from the iGEM parts           registry documentation page , see figure 13. In the experimental setup, eight doses of salicylate were added every 30 minutes, activating           the transcription of repressed GFP. The response was measured as an induction ratio of the fluorescence with respect to the fluorescence at the           uninduced state. Fig. 1 illustrates the dose-response curve.
Figure 1:             Dose response scheme for the NahR system taken from the iGEM parts registry documentation             page . The data points are represented as red dots linearly interpolated with black lines.
Implementing the entire system with all parameters except for $\text{k}_\text{MG}$, $\text{k}_\text{aSNP}$ and $\text{k}_\text{dSNP}$ (see Model derivation for the equations and Implementation for implementation details), we fit the model to             the dose-response scheme to obtain the parameters. In the setup we assume an induction base level of 100 nM which corresponds to approximately 100             proteins per cell at the uninduced state and assume a linearity in the concentration with respect to the induction ratio. We further assume that a             maximal induction ratio is obtained at a dose of 0.001 M salicylate.
Doses of salicylate were added every 30 min and the parameters were fit as follows: we defined a penalty function             $f(\boldsymbol{\theta})=f(k_\text{aSNP}, k_\text{dSNP}, k_\text{MG})$ corresponding to the root mean square difference between the models             output of folded GFP1-9 and the corresponding response data. This function is then a measure of how good the model fits the measured data with             respect to the three paramters $k_\text{aSNP}$"

Second Strand Synthesis
The second DNA strand is synthesized using LongAmp Taq Polymerase (NEB) incubated for one round. Primers used in the reaction are complementary to the sequences introduced by SSP and VNP primers.
Results
Initially, very low concentrations of cDNA were achieved. It has been decided to amplify the product using the same primers, which are used for 2nd strand synthesis in order to see if any cDNA was synthesized what so ever. After visulizing the amplified PCR product with cDNA as a template as seen in Figure 1, we could conclude that cDNA was in fact successfully synthesized. It has a similiar size distribution as bacterial mRNA, alhought strong band at 270 bp was of unclear origin.
The remaining task was to ensure that we synthesized enough cDNA. Eventually, we have managed to achieve high yields of cDNA after excessive trouble shooting, which revealed that the reason for low yield was inefficient polyadenylation as described here .
cDNA Yield
The amount of cDNA as measured by Qubit (Thermo Fisher). Typically, the cDNA amount would be equal to roughly twice the mass of the input RNA. For 125 ng of mRNA input we have synthesized (in an usual experiment) about 300 ng of cDNA. This amount was sufficient for further experiments.
RNA Contamination
cDNA which was synthesized during this experiment was used to prepare the sequencing library. Due to the suboptimal sequencing performance as described here , we began to investigate among other factors the quality of the input cDNA. After extensive troubleshooting it was determined that RNA was still present in the cDNA samples despite digestion and cleaning steps. In several samples very high amount of RNA has been found, often corresponding to the input quantity. RNA content was measured using Qubit HS RNA Kit specific to RNA.  Unfortunately, an efficient way of removing RNA has not been found during the course of the project, which is the main reason for poor sequencing results.
The following section describes the various troubleshooting approaches to investigating the RNA contamination.
Figure 1. Amplified cDNA using primers provided in the kit shows that cDNA has been indeed synthesized. The sizes correspond approximately to size distribution of bacterial distribution. A strong band (270 bp) is seen which suggests preferential amplification of certain small fragments.
Troubleshooting
Does Mix of RNA/DNA Interfere with Qubit Measurement?
Hypothesis:
The measured RNA in the sample could be due to lack of"

Introduction
Prepared our biobricks to send for sequencing. Measured the concentration of the midipreps for our work.
Diluted the primers for pSB1AT3
Digest yesterday's Mini prep results
Gel extraction for cotC PCR fragment after digestion, 4 sample's from Jen's promoter library experiment.
Conclusion
We checked the colonies on starch plate with iodine. We had successful transformation of pGFP-rrnB into B. subtilis however after the microscopy we realized that we did not have pMUTIN4 integrated into B. subtilis and we had to transform the colonies with pMUTIN4 for IPTG to work. So that LacI would be expressed in the cells.
We picked some colonies for kinA transformation growed on LB+Amp plate, after mini prep and digestion, the result of digestion told us that the colonies growed on LB+Amp plate are right colonies. Even they should not grow on LB+Amp plates.

Figure 7: Chemical structure of BPA, BPF and BPS showing the different chemical groups linking the two phenols.
BPF and BPS are used in a broad range of applications that involve the use of polycarbonates or epoxy resins and thus can often be found were BPA is also present. Accordingly, their presence is a potential disruptive factor that could lead to a false positive signal with our biosensor. This is especially true for BPS that in some cases is used as a substitute for BPA in baby bottles [1] . Studies concerning the environmental pollution with BPF ( Fromme et al. (2002) ) and the acute toxicity, mutagenicity and estrogenicity of BPF and BPS ( Chen et al. (2001) and Kitamura et al. (2005) ) indicate their potential harmfulness but further research is needed to fully assess their impact on human health.
E. coli KRX carrying genes for the bisdA | bisdB fusion protein behind the medium strong constitutive promoter <partinfo>J23110</partinfo> with RBS <partinfo>B0034</partinfo> was cultivated at 30 °C for 36 h with LB-Medium containing 120 mg L-1 BPA, BPF respectively BPS. The BPF and BPS concentration were determined with a HPLC using the same method as with BPA. Figure 8 shows the degradation of the respective bisphenol after 24 h of cultivation in percent.

Cultivations were carried out at different temperatures in LB + Amp + bisphenol medium (starting concentration 120 mg L-1 BPA, BPF or BPS respectively) for 24 h in 300 mL shaking flasks without baffles with silicon plugs. Samples were taken every 3 hours. Two biological replicates were analyzed (n=2).  While BPA is fully degraded only a small fraction of BPF (~7%) and BPS (~3%) was degraded.
The results of the experiment indicate that the bisdA | bisdB fusion protein has a high specificity for the degradation of BPA. In addition it is possible that the decrease in BPF and BPS concentration is due"

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane AptamerPurification_-_-_TEXT.html," novel aptamer sequences in silico (MAWS). If fully realized, this software would be a huge advance in reducing the experimental time and effort associated with developing new aptamers. In addition, the work done by the 2014 Team at the Technical University of Denmark around using Spinach aptamers as a way to measure promoter efficiency was of great use in helping us find and explore relevant atpamer literature. Another innovative iGEM use of aptamer technology was the 2012 Zhe Jiang University team's development of an aptamer based RNA scaffold to help localize products together to increase the efficiency of engineered biosynthetic pathways. Finally, iGEM has a small section of parts relating to DNA aptamers , and we looked to many of them for inspiration as well.
Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) Purification
The second section of this project was aimed at using just the capturing properties of aptamers, independent of sensing applications, to concentrate trace amounts of desired small molecules out of dilute solutions. Here we built on both previous work [1] and our own observations from the FQ project that immobilized aptamers appear to retain functionality when bound to solid surfaces. Accordingly we used streptavidin magnetic beads to bind two candidate biotinylated aptamers which captured PQQ from both pre-purified (HPLC) and a comparable concentration from the supernatant of an over-the-counter supplement. We used both racemic lysine and peptidyl lysine (in the form of a nickel column purified collagen construct) with copper(II) sulfate and demonstrated activity using an Amplex® Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit. Importantly, the bound PQQ retained its catalytic activity, with comparable results seen for HPLC-purified and supplement-sourced PQQ. This makes the beads solid surfaces functionalized by addition of DNAzymes, which can be used to purify their own cofactors in functional amounts (none of the original PQQ solution was used for the H2O2 assay). See the chart below for positive results. At the time of the assay, we were working with limited resources; with more time I would certainly like to repeat the analysis and use a rigorous set of controls, but this is at least a very positive indication that this concept merits further study and this application in particular could have interesting extensions for elastin or collagen nanostructuring.

Site-specific insertion was checked by colony PCR. Then a positive strain was electroporated with pSB4A5-asRNA (improved flip-flop, module II).
Cloning the basic flip-flop in to the miniTn7BB module. The basic flip-flop was inserted into the miniTn7BB module of pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm and pUC18R6KT-miniTn7-Gm by heat-shock transformation of competent E. coli cells.
Characterization of attTn7. I performed a mating assay using as donor pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm, as transposition helper pTNS2, as mating helper pRK2013 and as a receptor DH5α/pSB1C3-attTn7. The biomass of the resulting LB-Cm-Gm plate was collected in order to purify the plasmid. This purified plasmid was transformed by heat-shock transformation into DH5α competent cells. Selection was performed in LB-Cm and LB-Cm-Gm plates, and the next day all plates had thousands of colonies. Using colonies from the LB-Cm plate, I performed patches into LB-Gm and LB-Cm plates. 97 out of 100 colonies were able to grow in Gm and Cm, and only 3 out of 100 could not grow selectively in the LB-Cm plate. The function of the portable attTn7 has been successfully characterized. Also, I performed analytic digestions to verified that the insertion occurred into the attTn7.
Checking the construction of new plasmids with specialize functions based on pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm. pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm-RBS+RFP, pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm-LacZ+GFP and pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm-RFP were verified by analytic digestions.
Week 13 (October 24-27)
Any new construction? That week I tried to construct more plasmids with specialized function for the miniTn7BB tool kit, but finally there was not time enough to finish them.

I am interested in the molecular mechanisms by which pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli cause disease. In my group, we aim to identify bacterial virulence factors and further characterize the molecular cross-talk taking place at the host-pathogen interface during infection. In this framework the C. elegans model organism is used extensively for both genetic and proteomic analyses of bacterial infection.

I've been obsessed with the idea of assembling minimal from the bottom up since I was a student, and it's therefore a great pleasure for me to support our iGEM team.  iGEM is operating in the other end of Synthetic Biology also addressing ""what is life?"", but from the top down through modifying and simplifying existing life-forms.
Perhaps as the field of Synthetic Biology matures, iGEM 3.0 will also include a competition for teams developing minimal life-like systems from the bottom up: minimal molecular aggregate motility; minimal energy transduction systems; autonomous sensing signal transduction and actuation systems; aggregate growth and division; evolution in minimal replicator systems, and the like.

Gel Electrophoresis
Table 11. Agarose gel formulations and DNA separations.
Pouring a Standard 1% Gel
Measure 1 g of agarose.
Pour agarose powder into microwavable flask along with 1x TAE. Use ~65 mL for purification and ~35 mL for diagnosis.
Microwave for 1-3 minutes until the agarose is completely dissolved with sufficient bubbling.
Let agarose solution cool down for 5 minutes.
Add SYBR Safe stain to the molten agar and swirl to mix. The stain binds to the DNA and allows you to view the DNA bands under an ultraviolet blue light.
Pour the agarose into the gel tray with the well comb in place. Use the thick side of the comb if you are purifying from the gel.
Place newly poured gel at 4 °C for 10-15 minutes or let it sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes until it has completely solidified.
Loading Samples and Running an Agarose Gel
Add loading buffer (dyed) to each of the digest samples.
Once solidified, place the agarose gel into the gel box (electrophoresis unit).
Fill gel box with 1x TAE (or TBE) until the gel is covered.
Carefully load a molecular weight ladder into the first lane of the gel and your samples in the additional wells of the gel.
Run the gel at 80-150 V until the dye line is approximately 75-80% of the way down the gel.
Turn off power, disconnect the electrodes from the power source, and then carefully remove the gel from the gel box.
Use any device that has blue light to visualize your DNA fragments.
Chemical Transformation
Take chemically competent cells (CC) out of -80 °C and thaw on ice.
Take agar plates (containing the appropriate antibiotic) out of 4 °C to warm up to room temperature or place in 37 °C incubator.
Mix 1 to 5 µL of DNA (usually 10 pg to 100 ng) into 20-50 µL of competent cells in a microcentrifuge or falcon tube. Gently mix by flicking the bottom of the tube with your finger a few times.
Place the competent cell/ DNA mixture on ice for 20-30 minutes.
Heat shock each transformation tube by placing the bottom 1/2 to 2/3 of the tube into a 42 °C water bath for 30-60 seconds (45 seconds is usually ideal, but this"

UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," to stop trying to construct this part, maybe I will start from the beginning in the future if I have had time.
A good news from the sequencing arrived: my construct K731480 with GFP is right! But I had the confirmation just looking at the plate, actually.      Anyway also bad news came from sequencing results, and they involved K731600 of course… I sent two samples to sequence, one contained an unknown gene and the other had CysE and not CysDes as insert…! I can't explain how it could have happened. It remains the fact that this construct is cursed, and I had to start again from the beginning.
This week I finally started to characterize my constructs, and I began by making growth curves, serial dilutions and fluorescence measurements of K731480. I did every measure twice, and I tried with two different carbon sources: glycerol (that is in MOPS A) and glucose (in MOPS B). I won’t show you every chart and data I have, you can find them into the file “Characterization of CysDes”.
… which almost failed.
I screened twelve colonies instead of the usual ten. The 11th and 12th seemed successful.  Also, bacterial pellet was fluorescent at the transilluminator, so I’m pretty confident. While I wait for sequencing results, I will try to characterize the constructs.       K731530 has been fully characterized. In order to do so, I’ve done duplicates in a single day, for a total of 144 measurements. It has been harsh, but necessary.
On Monday our advisors came back and even Mansy didn't believed that sequencing. He suggested we set up another (yes, another one) screening digestion; we run the gel and….magically the bands appeared!!
We`ve got it, finally!!! We failed so many times making it but eventually we succeeded!      Such a good birthday present!
In the rest of the week we amplified the correct construct and screened several colonies from the T7terminator-pSB1C3 ligation; they seemed all positive , so we sent some for sequencing.
Amplifying the right Cherry-Venus construct we had, ironically the bad luck kept to persecute us and that construct: I failed several times to miniprep the overnight culture, and when Giacomo had mercy and helped me, I spoiled also his ones!!!
Anyway we had lot of fun even in failing, and this success put us in a good mood.
We also made the mutagenesis PCR to replace T7promoter with Ptac in the vector…"

Our project includes 2 independent software tools-the brick worker and E' NOTE. The former is a software suit for the evaluation and optimization of biobricks, i.e., promoter, RBS, protein coding sequences and terminator. E' NOTE is a web application serving as an assistant for experiments. Its useful functions such as experiments recording and experimental template customization make experimental process easier and more enjoyable.

Promoter-decoder
Abstract
In a promoter sequences, the sigma factor binding site and other transcription factor binding site affect the strength of binding significantly.        For annotating promoters, some software was developed which mostly focused on the prediction of other transcription factors or one particular type of sigma factors but failed to analyze the promoter with both sigma factors and other transcription factors. 1-2 To solute this problem, a module of our software was designed which can analyze and evaluate promoters.
Our software use PWM method to calculate the similarity between promoter sequences and the position frequency matrix of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) to locate the TFBS as well as to predict the relative strength of the promoter.               Promoter-Decoder overshadows its counterparts with all-round analysis and the prediction of promoter strength.        It enables users to figure out promoter types, predict promoter strength, changeit by mutating the key sites and even change the property of certain promoter by adding new TFBS to the promoter sequences.
Background
Sigma Factors
Bacteria encode several thousands of different proteins, which are necessary for normal cell functions or for adaptation to environmental changes.3 These proteins are not required at the same time or in the same amount. Regulation of gene expression therefore enables the cell to control the production of proteins needed for its life cycle or for adaptation to extracellular changes. The various steps during transcription and translation are therefore subject to different regulatory mechanisms.4
The most prominent step in gene regulation is the initiation of transcription in which the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the key enzyme. The RNAP or the RNAP core enzyme is the catalytic machinery for the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template. However, RNAP cannot initiate transcription by itself. Initiation of transcription requires an additional polypeptide known as a sigma factor.5 sigma factors are a family of relatively small proteins that can associate in a"

Simulation & Analysis
 
Simulation and Parameter Scan | Sensitivity Analysis | Stoichiometric Matrix | Steady States | Jacobian         and Modal Analysis
 
With the aim of predicting the behavior of the system, the biochemical reactions were  implemented in the SimBiology package of MATLAB, using the previously defined parameters .  Simulations were run for different values of the initial concentration  of AHL and Nitotal (Niint + Niext) which are the metabolites that we  can directly manipulate in our experiments. A parameter scan was also  run for some parameters to understand their influence on the system.
In order to gain insights into the system dynamics to  elucidate the conditions needed to get the desired behavior, we performed a series of analyses on it: Sensitivity analysis allowed us  to identify critical parameters that needed to be defined on the most  stringent way. Basis for the (right) null and left null space were  calculated to obtain information about the general network behavior.  Steady-states were calculated by graphic analysis of the systen behavior. Finally the Jacobian of the system was  calculated around the steady-states. All simulations and analyses were  implemented and performed on MATLAB.
 
Simulation and parameter scan
Once the model was implemented on SimBiology, simulations were carried out to analyze its behavior through time after a given AHL concentration. We would like to observe a moderate and ephemeral change in the intracellular nickel concentration; this would allow our bacteria to sing without killing them.
After exhausting our literature search for parameters, we tuned the remaining ones in such a way that they ensure the desired behavior. We performed a parameter scan on the CI dimerization constant (an early step in the signaling cascade) and the rates at which nickel enters and leaves the cells.
 
CI dimerization
Several scans where performed on the CI rates of dimerization and dissociation to define the range in which the desired response would be observed.
[CI] equilibrium is defined by its synthesis and degradation rate, while k4.1/k-4.1 determine the equilibrium of [CI:CI] and modify time"

DNA sequencing
The best thing that can happen to a DNA: to acquire DNA sequences, we sent our samples to the Microsynth Seqlab sequencing laboratories Microsynth Seqlab sequencing laboratories in Göttingen.
RNA sequencing
RNA sequencing analyses were done by Dr. Anja Poehlein and Prof. Dr. Rolf Daniel from the Göttingen Genomics Laboratory . The comprehensive RNA sequencing data set helped us to develop a glyphosate reporter system.
Genes
We ordered some genes, called g-Blocks, from Integrated DNA Technologies , which was free of charge because the company supports the iGEM competition.
Analyses of DNA and genome sequences
DNA sequences and genome sequences were analyzed using the Geneious software package. We are grateful to Mrs. Claire Westwood who provided us with four Geneious license keys.
Bacterial strains
We are grateful to Dr. Daniel R. Zeigler and Prof. Dr. John Helmann from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center at The Ohio State University and the Helman lab at the Cornell University, respectively, for providing B. subtilis strains.
Biochemical and structural characterization of EPSP synthases
For isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements and structure determination of the purified EPSP synthases from E. coli and B. subtilis, we sent our proteins to the members of the iGEM team of Marburg that is hosted by the Bange lab in Marburg"
UChicago,2015,Team:UChicago#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," of KaiC western blots were conducted. For simple expression assays, such as when characterizing the pRha promoter and quantifying KaiA expression, a 14-20% BioRad precast protein gel was used during SDS page gel run. For tracking different phoshphorylation states of KaiC, a 4-7% BioRad precast protein gel was used. Bradford assays were conducted before SDS-page in order to standardize the amount of protein added per sample. A positive control of cyanobacterial lysate, and a negative control of E.coli cells containing an empty Cam circular backbone were run. Purified protein samples provided by the Rust lab were run to quantify amount of KaiA, B, and C expressed by transformed E.coli cells. Transfer accomplished using PVDF membranes. Membrane sandwich apparatus was prepared under Towbin transfer buffer. Blocking to prevent non-specific binding of antibodies was conducted using TBST+2% dry milk. This was followed by a stain of primary anti-rabbit antibodies for the Kai proteins provided by the Rust Lab. The membranes were washed using wash buffer then stained with anti-goat HRP secondary antibody allowing us to visualize the primary antibody stain. The membranes were washed then imaged using chemilumenescnece imaging systems.
 
Imaging and Quantification
Densitometry of images was conducted in ImageJ. For the induction time course and the oscillation assays (oscillation data not up on wiki, but to be presented at the Jamboree), the nanogram amount of each protein was determined by calibrating to a logarithm curve of purified standards of known concentration ran on the same Western blot. This allowed for determination of accurate stoichiometric ratios between KaiA on the rhamnose inducible promoter and KaiB and KaiC, both on the constitutive promoter. Normalization for OD was performed for post-shock time points, including oscillation time points, to control for changes in cell density and protein degradation after induction of KaiA was turned off.

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Bioaccumulation_-_-_TEXT.html," available. Natural binding proteins act as a model and initiator in design of new artificial binding proteins combining research in different fields of biotechnology. Lipocalins, natural binding proteins, as base and scaffold for the design of anticalins confirm the popularity of bioaccumulated proteins in red biotechnology [ Schlehuber et al., 2005 ]. The role of Fibrillin in the abscisic acid-mediated photoprotection shows an example of functioned bioaccumulation in a plant  [ Yang et al.,2007 ]. The most commonly known binding proteins are antibodies which defend mammals against pathogens and toxins. Besides these natural binding proteins and anticalins  there are more and more designed binding proteins such as Affibodies derived from the z-domain of the antibody-binding protein A (Ref) and DARPins that are based on an ankyrin scaffold. One research topic of the chair of analytical chemistry of the TU Munich is the depletion of algal toxin contaminated water by using selective biofilters based on plantibodies. Plantibodies are plant- produced and derived antibodies which can construct antibody-mediated pathogen resistance as well as change the plant phenotype by immunomodulation [ Stoger et al.,2002 ].
For our project we exemplarily choose three different binding proteins which each exploit different mechanisms to bind Proteins:
The anticalin fluA as an example for a binding protein.
The enzyme Gluthathione-S-Transferase as an example where the formation of covalent bonds between the target pollutant and another molecule (gluthatione) is catalized.
The enzyme Protein Phosphatase 1 as example for a target of a binding protein. Here we exploit the inhibitory binding of the pollutant to the enzyme.
To sketch the theoretical binding to a membrane anchored protein in our video, we created a short animation of the process using the molecularMaya software:
Bioaccumulation via binding proteins
Problem Example: Diclofenac
Are pharmaceuticals a blessing or a curse? Respective to the ecological consequences of diclofenac this task must be valued negative. Diclofenac which is a proven, nonsteroidal anti-imflammatory drug (NSAID) is used mostly in human medicine to treat a variety of acute and chronic pain and inflammatory conditions via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)[ Gan,2010 ].

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#Implementation_-_-_TEXT.html," behind that solution was to grow the moss on a big textile fiber inside the tube or on the tube wall. In this manner many parameters are set and degradation experiments could return significant values.
This ""bioreactor"" is an ideal solution to clean highly contaminated water within a closed system. The big area of contact between the moss and the water enables the use of membrane bound effectors. Compared to the open pond and Remediation Raft implementation, the ratio of contact surface and water volume is relatively high. Therefore a secretion of effectors into the water is not needed.
Open filter on felt base
Figure 11: open pond
Our open pond model consists of meander shaped perspex and two threads to adjust the pond's pitch. Therefore different flow speeds can be implemented. The floor of our open pond is lined with agar to grow the moss on. The pond's lid can be taken off to remove the moss.
The open pond implementation can be used as the last step of a wastewater treatment plant. Even though the contact surface between moss and water might not be as big as in the tube reactor, an implementation with membrane bound effectors is still thinkable. Using membrane bound effectors has the advantage that an emission of effectors into the clean water can be avoided almost entirely. Yet a secretion of effectors to the water may accomplish the biodegradation more effectively.
Our swimming remediation raft
Figure 12: Rendering of our remediation rafts in front of the MIT
Figure 13: 3D-print of our remediation raft
At least there are problems both reactor types don't solve. In both cases upscaling involves a great deal of expense.  The tube reactor guarantees a big contact surface between water and moss which is an asset to the filter properties, but the carbon dioxide exchange is a major problem due to the lack of water-air through mix. To manage big scale filtering on an appropriate area it's inevitable to stack the tubes. That makes extra lighting necessary. The open pond model brings along a smaller water-moss surface, therefore the filter properties may suffer and a wider area is needed. As opposed to the tube reactor the costs are lower and there are no air exchange problems to face.
Slightly we return to the question how a biofilter could look like. It has to be a solution that can be implemented in any scale. The costs must be kept as low as possible. Additionally the energy consumption and maintenance must be kept to a absolute minimum to make it universally usable.

Anti-KRAS siRNA (siRNA for KRAS gene silencing)
Introduction
This part is an artificially designed RNA strand. It serves as an element of the Team NJU-CHINA RNAi module which can be used for down-regulation of KRAS expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells. We designed specific KRAS siRNA with algorithm based on a software developed by SYSU-Software team. This tool can find the best siRNA sequence on target gene KRAS to ascertain the maximum gene-specificity and silencing efficacy and also designs the pair of oligonucleotides needed to generate short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the plasmid. Then we synthesize the shRNA sequence from a DNA synthesis company (Genscript).
Figure 1. The sequence of KRAS shRNA
Usage and Biology
We packaged KRAS siRNA into exosomes by transfecting HEK293 cells with a plasmid expressing KRAS siRNA and then collected siRNA-encapsulated exosomes. When modified exosomes being intravenously injected, they will specifically recognize integrin receptors and fuse with lung adenocarcinoma cells under the direction of the iRGD peptide. Once inside cells, KRAS siRNA will bind to KRAS mRNA through base-pairing and digest the mRNA, resulting in sharp decrease of K-ras in lung cancer cells. As a consequence, K-ras protein’s reduction and disturbed function will both result in the inhabitation of the proliferation of cancer cells, which ultimately have some therapeutic effects on lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer in this case).
Characterization
Interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid
To ensure the interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid, we transfected it into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and then extracted protein from these cells to perform western blot. Significant down-regulation of K-ras can be observed in A549 cells treated with anti-KRAS siRNA, demonstrating that anti-KRAS siRNA has the gene silencing effect on lung cancer cells"

SAFETY
The Problem
Tailings ponds, lakes that hold the toxic by-products of oil sands mining, cover an area of 176 square kilometers in Alberta and contain enough liquid to fill 390,000 Olympic-sized pools. Tailings ponds are extremely detrimental to the environment and pose challenges for improving extraction processes used by oil and mining industries. If left untreated, tailings ponds have the potential to pollute water sources, damage ecosystems, eliminate biodiversity and kill a variety of living organisms. An example of tailings ponds pollution includes harmful ions such as lead and mercury which affect the environment.The removal of heavy metals in tailings ponds as well as wastewater is appealing yet challenging. In addition to benefiting the environment, the extraction of these metals creates value out of what would otherwise be waste.
Our Solution
To address these issues, we propose a system using engineered bacteria and bacteriophage-- viruses that infect and reproduce within the host bacteria-- to capture and remove ions from solution using novel capsid composition and inducible precipitation. Utilizing biological systems and local infrastructure will both purify contaminated water and extract reusable metals renewably. To better understand the feasibility of our project, we plan on using a mixture of kinetic, agent-based and spatial modelling. Kinetic modelling will allow us to mathematically understand the trend of our system as well as how our system will react to specific parameters. Agent-based modelling will display the different components of our system. This allows for a more accurate visualization of the system as a whole with the different agent interactions. Finally, spatial modelling will help us demonstrate our unique system to the general public. Additionally, we plan to contact the head of the Water  Treatment Plant in Lethbridge to see how our project could be integrated into their facility, as well as to understand how our project would function in their system. Our system of engineered bacteria and bacteriophage will provide a solution to the issue of metal contaminants present in water.
And a big thank you to our sponsors!"

A lot of iGEM teams we've looked at don't have much beyond the biology, so we really try hard to do interdisciplinary projects, as they provide a great opportunity for learning to work with different kinds of people.
Spring break knocked out a couple of meetings, but it looks like some research was accomplished nonetheless! The phytase project idea is looking pretty promising-- it incorporates a lot of different disciplines, with stuff for our mechanical and electrical engineers to do, as well as modeling.

We had a call today with Ecovative Design, a company that uses mushrooms to make a biodegradable styrofoam analogue-- our mycelial materials project idea would involve working with them to improve their product. It seems like our interests are aligned and that we should be able to work with them. Exciting!

This meeting was dedicated to project pitches from each of the four ideas, followed by voting on which project we should pursue. Some of our graduate advisors also attended to provide a more seasoned perspective on the viability of each project. After some deliberation and spreadsheet magic, we decided on mycelial materials!

Bio-remediation: Carbon fixation
Overview
CO2 levels are rising and will likely have significant effects on the biosphere. Many propose that the proper action to take is to eliminate and eventually sequester large amounts of CO2 in order to abate or attempt to reverse the effects.
Comments
Fixation via photosynthesis
Fixation via carbonic anhydrase, base for limestone synthesis

During our brainstorming session, we discussed bio-remediation for carbon fixation, but also respect to oil spills. Any ideas? MandM 16:22, 7 June 2009 (UTC)
Preemptive Part Optimization
Much time in (synthetic) biology is spent optimizing devices after importing parts from a model organism into a different model. A focused effort could eliminate these problems. This project would likely involve"
TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," a lot of waste and uses a lot of chemicals. The waste of the seafood-processing industry, mostly the shells of crustaceans, contains 14 – 40 % chitin. This waste is treated with alternate acid and alkali to remove other components from the shells of the crustacean and to extract the chitin [1] . One approach to produce the polymer in an environmentally friendly way, are bacteria like E. coli which can produce chitin enzymatically via a CHS.
The production of chitin appears to be important as it is a useful substance which finds applications in medicinal, industrial and biotechnological research. Chitin, and its derivate chitosan, are non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable. Their bioactivities are for example the promotion of wound healing or hemostatic activity, immune enhancement, eliciting biological responses, and antimicrobial activity [1] .
Chitin oligomers are also of great biological interest as they lead to biological responses in plants and form the backbone of substituted lipochitooligosaccharides which induce the nodulation in leguminous plants [3] .
There are various kinds of CHS from several organisms. The  enzyme of our interest is the NodC which originates from the gram-negative bacterium Rhizobium leguminosarum. It is a homologue to the chitin synthase from yeast (Structure see Figure 2) [6] .
Figure 2. Structure of NodC. The 3D structure was modeled with SwissModel [7]
Rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae is found to live in symbiosis with plants of the genera Pisum and Vicia of the family Fabaceae [9] . Rhizobium species live in symbiosis with legumes, where the bacteria form nitrogen-fixing nodules in the legume roots. The symbiotic interaction leads to an activation of the bacterial nodulation (nod) genes and the secretion of Nod factors. These nod genes create and modify the Nod factors. The Nod factors have a backbone consisting of β-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharides, most often tetra – or pentasaccharides with an acyl chain at C2 of the non-reducing end instead of an acetyl group [6] [10] .

This added two amino acids to the linker, one of which was a cysteine. It is unclear whether these additional amino acids will disrupt the ability for TraR and the CGFP fragment to fold independently from one another.

Results
Leucine Zipper Controls
Leucine zipper controls glow only upon addition of both arabinose and IPTG
After co-transforming pET11a-z-NGFP and pMRBAD-z-CGFP into BL21(DE3) cells, we plated on media containing IPTG (0.1mM) and arabinose (0.2% w/v). We incubated at 30° C for 10 hours and left the plates on the bench top for 24 hours. We observed accumulation of GFP only in colonies plated with both IPTG and arabinose.
TraR Fusions
TraR PCR product using pCF222 from Dr. Fuqua as template
After trying to PCR traR coding sequence from multiple sources, we finally succeeded using a plasmid generously provided by Dr. Clay Fuqua from University of Indiana (pCF222)
We successfully cloned traR coding sequence into pET11-a-link-NGFP between the XhoI and BamHI sites, and into pMRBAD-link-CGFP between the NcoI and SphI sites. We confirmed insertion with diagnostic digest and sequencing.
Characterization of Fusions
Diagnostic digests were performed on minipreps from transformed colonies to see if a traR-sized fragment was indeed inserted into the two plasmids. In both plasmids, a ~700bp fragment was observed. These minipreps were sent for sequencing and traR insertion was confirmed and seen to be in frame.
Transformed BL21(DE3) cells carrying both the pET11a-TraR-NGFP and pMRBAD-TraR-CGFP were plated on media containing IPTG, arabinose, and varying amounts of autoinducer, either synthesized, or from sterile supernatants. As of this writing, no conditions produce visible GFP on plates.

Aachen- Prediction of mutated Subtilisin E protease
We met with experts from the Technion to help us visualize the Subtilisin E and the photocaged serine in order to obtain insights regarding the structure of the mutated protein.
We contacted iGEM Aachen when we learned their project deals with protein inactivation, as we believed it might correspond with our Intein sub-project. After discussing the details, we concluded that the Intein protein would not be applicable to Aachen's system. Nevertheless, we decided to collaborate on different aspects of our projects.
iGEM Aachen asked us to visualize and model the structure of the Subtilisin E protease, which is mutated with a photo caged serine as part of their project.
After consulting with several professors from the faculty of Biology,  we concluded that it would be impossible to finish this task properly in our time period. As an alternative, we wrote a document describing the steps for an exhaustive computational work, including insights from the comparison of the structures of Subtilisin E and the photo-caged serine. ( View PDF ).
Finally, we constructed a 3D visualization of Subtilisin E adjacent to the photo-caged serine along with the above document. The information we have obtained was highly valuable and helpful to Aachen’s project.
Tar fused to GFP marker
In return, we asked Aachen to build a biobrick consisting of the Tar chemoreceptor fused to a GFP marker.  We provided them all the information necessary for this task ( View PDF ).
Aachen's work was successful, providing us with a valuable result on the importance of a linker domain to connect the Tar receptor and the GFP marker. The work made by Aachen had a major significance to our project and we would like to express our gratitude to the Aachen iGEM team for the valuable scientific work they have done for us.

TU Eindhoven - Writing a manual for the Rosetta software
We have written a manual for the operation of the Rosetta software together with iGEM TU Eindhoven .
Our collaboration with iGEM TU Eindhoven was a result of the challenges we faced using the Rosetta software               suite in our project. When we took our very first steps with protein modeling using Rosetta we quickly               discovered numerous problems and difficulties that occupied us for weeks before"
