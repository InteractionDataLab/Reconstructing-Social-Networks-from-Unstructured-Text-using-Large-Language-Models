Restriction digest
Today we did restriction digest for a miniprep prepared for BBa_C0178.  We prepared DNa ladder to load to the gels. At the end of the day, we prepared our gel to run tomorrow.We followed the restriction digest protocol for our two miniprep prepared for BBa_C0178 and used the followings to prepare the solutions.
H20, 6.5 ul
10x Buffer, 2ul
DNA from minipreps, 10ul
EcoRI, 0.5 ul
PstI, 0.5 ul
BSA, 0.5 ul (It was diluted 100 times)
We gave a quick pulse to mix everything in the tubes before we put them into 37C incubator for an hour.
Running the gel
The Stochastic Switch Team's DNA samples undergoing DNA gel electrophoresis
Metal container team had already prepared the gel for us. We placed the gel tray into the gel electrophoresis device and top it up with 1xTAE buffer. 9ul of DNA from each tube is combined with 1ul of buffer and loaded into the wells. DNA ladder was loaded into the 1st and the 4th wells, DNAs were loaded into the 2rd and the 3rd wells. Restriction digest should have cut the plasmid(pSB1A2) into two pieces, plasmid and the the biobrick, from EcoRI and PstI sites. pSB121A2 is 2079bp and BBa_C0178 is 609bp long. As it can be seen from the results below, they match with the HindIII markers.

Result
DH5α template isolation for pcr purification of nhaA promoter. The left part of DNA MIX MARKER is done by manuel and the right part of marker is isolated by DNA isolation kit supplied by Anatolia Genework. For the next step, we used DNA template isolated by kit because of their concentration view on gel.
Figure 1:  Agarose gel results of DNA isolation from DH5α strain
We have done gradient pcr between 55-62 oC annealing temperatures (first well is 55 and the last well is 62). As a result, we saw only one fragment at fifth (59.2 oC) well. We designed our pcr for 59 oC annealing temperature.
Figure 2: Agarose gel results of amplification nhaA promoter from DH5α strain via gradient PCR
PCR products of nhaA promoter at 59.2 oC annealing temperature. First well is a negative control (without template), second and third well shows us non-purified promoter fragments. Last well shows purified promoter fragment. We agreed that is our promoter of interest because according to sequence of nhaA promoter, it has 194 bp. It can be seen that fragment is close to 200 bp according to marker.

Module 4
Overview
Kill switch system is required to prevent the release of genetically modified organisms to the environment. Also, our genetically modified bacteria would be colonized in human intestine so we have to prevent the spread of GMO to the other part. To realize this aim, we benefit from glucose and auto-inducer 2 (AI-2) concentrations. MazE and MazF are stress-induced molecules that mediate cell death and their production would be controlled with two different promoters that sense glucose and AI-2. Furthermore, MazE is anti-toxic and MazF is toxic for the cell so they must be found in equilibrium. If the amount of MazF is more than MazE, the cell would die because of its toxic effects. Based on these reasons, our kill switch system consists of two parts.
How does it work?
The first part is just to keep alive in the presence of glucose. MazE would be produced by the sense of glucose and a"

Knockout designs in our project
Pex 9
Pex9 is a recently discovered import receptor for PTS1 proteins, which is induced by oleate and is an import receptor for both malate synthase isoenzymes Mls1p and Mls2p. In order to get a completely empty reaction room, a Pex9 knockout was designed to prevent unintended protein import.
Pex 31 & Pex 32
It has been shown that knockouts of Pex31 and Pex32 leads to an increased Peroxisomal size, but additionally the membrane permeability was affected ( Zhou et al. 2016 ). This effect can be used as a tool for engineering membrane permeability by knocking out or overexpress both genes. A knockout would lead to an"

AHUT_China,2018,Team:AHUT China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," is consistent with the problem.by using the experimental data (ie, Table 1) and linear regression with matlab, we obtain a linear regression equation between carbon dioxide concentration and color reading.
Multiple linear regression model
By using multiple linear regression ,we plot the residuals (see Fig.3). As we can be seen from the residual plot, except for the 15th data, the residuals of the remaining data are close to zero, and the confidence interval of the residuals contains zero points, which indicates that the regression model can better match the original data, and this data can be regarded as the abnormal point (cull). After the rejection, the multiple linear regression is performed again to obtain the residual plot (see Fig.4),the significance test indicators of the regression equation (see Table 1) and the specific residual values (see Table 2). From the table 1: correlation coefficient R2 = 0.9250310882931, indicating that the regression equation is significant. According to the test of F, the probability of F corresponds to p < α, rejecting H0, and the regression model (VIII) established. However, the estimated error variance is too large.

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"fluidics chip. Then, insert the chip in our device and put the whole device in the thermos-stated container.     While encrypting, we should select a specific time (for example, to begin counting when the bacteria solution is added into the microfluidics chip) to press the LED switch on the top of the device according to the input information (for example, if the input is 0101, then the LED light should be red, green, red, green). Using corresponding light to irradiate different areas on the chip (we regard each area as an encryption unit. In our initial device, we select 4 areas as encryption units). After a period of time, we can observe fluorescence which is the cipher text (for example, if we observe gfp, rfp, rfp, gfp, then the output is 1001).
    While decrypting, input the cipher text by pressing the LED switch at the same time, or at the same phase in the oscillation period (for example, if the cipher text is 1001, then the LED light should be green, red, red, green). After a period of time, we can observe the original text (for example, if we observe rfp, gfp, rfp, gfp, then the output is 0101).
    However, if we input the cipher text at a wrong time (which means the user does not know the encryption time), even if the cipher text is true (1001), the output is not convincing, sometimes even opposite from the real information (for example, 0110) because at this phase, the codebook is not the same as encrypting. So, compared with the first generation, this second generation of cipher machine is more reliable.
    We have got the double-period oscillation circuit already. But when doing an experiment, we could not realize a stable oscillation because of the continuous split of bacteria and the accumulation of autoinducers. In order to solve this problem, we use micro-fluid technology. Microfluidics is science and technology using micro-channel to operate micro fluid. By this methods, we can keep the quantity of bacteria at a certain level and take the accumulated autoinducers away, making the system a better coupling and could operate steadily.

Identification of infection time
According to our experimental results, we noticed that Salmonella might follow Poisson                     distribution in                     cells, so we use Matlab to judge the distribution of bacteria in the cells. We assume                     that the area less than 1 in the Poisson distribution is a part of cells which are not infected by Salmonella. According to our experimental results, cells which are infected by only one Salmonella can also die of pyroptosis. Based on this feature, we divide cells into uninfected and infected                     cells. When the average number of bacteria in the cell changes, which means that the λ of Possion                     distribution changes, the ratio of the two kind of cells will change. In summary, when the average                     number of Salmonella in cells changes, the proportion of dead cells will change.
Figure 1. Poisson distribution and Salmonella infection results. a. Based on                     statistics of                     experimental results, we proved that the Salmonella follows Poisson distribution in normal                     cells. b. We assume that the area less than 1 in the Possion distribution is a part of cells which                     are not infected by Salmonella. When the λ of Possion distribution changes, which means the                     average number of Salmonella in cells changes, the proportion of infected cells changes. c. Cells                     which are infected by only one Salmonella can also die of pyroptosis.
Infection in tumor cell culture experiments
We hope that the mathematical model can help the Salmonella infection experiment. In our                     final                     phenotypic experiment, the cells carrying the GSDMD gene are induced by ATc, and we hope that the                     observed result is that the proportion of ATc-induced cell death is more than that of not induced                     to prove the ATc promoter is effective. In this experiment, the error may be big if the proportion                     of cells infected by Salmonella is different.
Figure 2. Results caused by efficiency                     differences of infection.
If the proportions of infection are different, the experimental results may not be able to prove that pyroptosis is induced by atc promoter. Figure 2 showed that the ATc promoter is induced and 90% cells death are caused and 70% cells die because of the promoter disclosure, but the difference of the proportions of infected cells is so big that the experimental results cannot reflect"

Project Abstract: Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," organism [5].
How do we create a system that is self-regulating and at the same time avoid the risks discussed earlier?
To prevent one organism from outcompeting the other, there has to be some sort of communication between them. Several approaches to this has been attempted in the past. A quorum sensing (QS) system is one alternative that has proven capable of maintaining population equilibrium within a system comprised of different strains of the same species [6,7]. However, QS within the same species might be conceivable, but achieving a functioning QS system between organisms of different species that originate from completely different environments is a challenge to say the least.
Another alternative is the exchange of nutritional metabolites, e.g. amino acids. This approach has been shown to provide an additional fitness benefit due to the division of metabolic labour [8]. It has also been shown to be capable of purging cheaters from the system, i.e. cheaters do not seem to be able to outcompete the cooperating population [9]. Furthermore, in a scenario where the industrial strain escapes, an auxotrophic bacterium will have a significant fitness disadvantage without its partner and will therefore pose a very small threat to the wild flora and fauna.
These arguments lead us to construct our microbial consortia based on metabolite dependence rather than a quorum sensing mechanism. This solution has two main advantages. Firstly, amino acids are universal and most organisms on earth share the same set. Modularity becomes easier to achieve compared to a QS system, in which entire new synthesis pathways may need to be implemented for the QS molecules. Secondly, with respect to safety, a metabolic dependence based on auxotrophy of amino acids prevent the unwanted spread of the organism since it cannot survive without its partner organism providing it. Furthermore, in 2015 the Amsterdam iGEM team achieved a proof of concept in which they created a symbiotic culture between the cyanobacterium Synechocystis and Escherichia coli based on auxotrophy. This provided great inspiration in how to achieve our production system.
The system will be based on a strain of Synechocystis providing a carbon source in the form of acetate to the production organism.  In return, it would provide the cyanobacterium with a required amino acid, as seen in Figure 2.
Fig 2. a schematic view of the system and the symbiotic relationship between the carbon-converting cyanobacteria and the production organism.
To expand the idea further and to make the system more universal, a level of modularity was desired, therefore the production organism should be interchangeable. Different"
BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#LargePhage#Summerexp#Period11#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html,"9+.  We did spots of 10^-3, -6, -9, -10, and -11. We also spot tested 10^-3 through -6 for the T4 WT liquid culture we used as a stock for all of these mutagenesis procedures.
10/23/13
Yesterday I plated out 10^-6 through 10^-8 for the T4 WT stock to calculate the pfus so we can use it in another mutagenesis and calculate it better.  Last time we didn't ever get lysis, and looking at the spot test plates yesterday it appears our superinfection failed because we didn't ever get titers up to 10^-9 at all... some just made single plaques on 10^-6 or not even that far.  The T4 WT stock had a titer of 1.2 x 10^10 pfu/mL, so I'll need ~100 uL to infect the liquid cultures.
Today I started another mutagenesis. I grew E. coli B in M9+ overnight, supplemented with 150 uL of adenine. This morning I measured the OD600 of this culture at 0.765. I added 4 mL of this culture to 21 mL of M9+ broth and measured the resulting optical density for each of the four flasks at ~0.15.  I had a T4 WT flask with no supplements. Each of the other flasks 150 uL adenine, 250 uL uracil.  One flask had 500 uL BrdU and 100 uL phage, another had 1 mL BrdU and 100 uL phage, and one had 500 uL BrdU and 200 uL phage.  They were put on a shaker at 9:30 am.
At 2:40 pm, the flasks were still not very turbid.  I measured the OD as:  T4WT=0.369, M91x=0.395, M9 2x = 0.430, and M9 1x extra phage = 0.348.  None of them produced visible lysis when I added chloroform but it was difficult to tell because I could see through the 15 mL tube before I added the chloroform.  Some bacterial debris did appear at the interface when I shook the chloroform to mix it with the broth and bacteria, but I couldn't observe ""visible lysis"" like we saw last time.

Laccase CueO from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)
Summary
First some trials of shaking flask cultivations were made with changing parameters to identify the best conditions for  the production of the laccase CueO from E. coli BL21 (DE3) named ECOL fused to a His tag. Because of no measured activity  in the cell lysate a purification method was established (using Ni-NTA His tag resin and Syringe or ÄKTA method). The purified  ECOL could be identified by SDS-PAGE (molecular weight of 53.4 kDa) as well as by MALDI-TOF. The fractionated samples were also  tested concerning their activity. A maximal activity of 55% was reached, measured in ABTSox [µM]. After measuring activity of ECOL a scale up was made up to  3 L and then also up to 6 L that enables an intense screening afterwards. A further scale up to 12 L with a optimized medium was implemented to enable additional experiments to characterize ECOL. Additional scale up experiments will be important for further application. The enzyme was characterized further regarding its temperature and pH optimum and concerning the influence of different concentrations of CuCl2, ABTS, MeOH and acetonitrile. A total specific enzyme activity of 5,5 U mg-1 was determined for ECOL at pH 5 at 25°C with ABTS as a substrate.

6/5/13
Regarding our PCR attempt yesterday, we did see a thick fat band ... at the bottom of the gel! Once again our PCR failed. This has led us to propose several reasons why we can't PCR amplify CRO: 1) the Lambda prophage isn't actually in TT 9901 or TT9907, or 2) our primers aren’t functioning to amplify CRO. We streaked a few plates of TT9901 and TT9907 to subject to UV light. If we see plaques, then we will know Lambda has been induced. Meanwhile Dr. Grose is going to check that our primers are the correct ones.
6/7/13
KK, KP After a little investigation, it turns out our primers were NOT for the CRO gene in Lambda, but for the CRO gene in another phage. Dr. Grose immediately ordered another set of primers, which arrived this morning! With the correct primers to amplify CRO, we performed the PCR protocol again today. Also, we set up an overnight of E.Coli with pIG12 to purify the plasmid tomorrow. We'll use pIG12 as our vector.
Our community project will be writing a children's book on synthetic biology. I wrote a story line which was distributed among all the team members; with their ideas I'm going to make changes and contact Redge Ballard, our illustrator. Since we hope to do our community project in one month, hopefully he can illustrate the story in such a short time!
6/9/13
CH Did a PCR Check for the Cro insert on 7 colonies of modified pIG12. The PCR was not promising so we decided to mini prep colonies labled 1 and 2 to sequence to check for the cro insert. The primer IG12 was used which is a reverse primer outside of the MCS. The sequencing results showed that Cro was cloned into pIG12 perfectly. Sequencing for pIG78 was also set up. Primers used: BI218 (HapR F), BI220 (GFP R), BI225 (RFP R), BI227 (Qrr4 R), B248 (LuxO mid), BI229 (LuxO R), BI230 (CqsS F), BI 247(CqsS mid), BI222 (GFP R).

TECHNION-ISRAEL,2017,Team:TECHNION-ISRAEL#ModelCRE_-_-_TEXT.html," As can be seen in Figure 6, the Cre recombinase at times is incapable of achieving the 100% recombination we require. It is our understanding that any recombination based system may ever fully eliminate every copy of our plasmid, and as such we decided to focus on a “Suicide Mechanism” wherein every cell containing our plasmid will undergo apoptosis. This is both more effective for our purposes and clinically proven.
Lastly, we would like to thank team Edinburgh UG again for the amazing work they did, our project would not have been the same without their help.

Note:
Unfortunately, (almost) no colonies have grown of CaXMT1 and CaDXMT1. This is a bit strange, because the same medium was used at the inoculation and all colonies had grown in the SC-U 2% glucose medium. The induction of the expression will be repeated with these transformants.
The taken samples were centrifuged at 1500xg for 5 minutes at 4°C (200ml in several steps, eGFP 50ml in one step) and washed with 10 and 5 ml water, respectively. Afterwards, the suspension was centrifuged again and resuspended in 2ml water. The suspension was repelleted again and stored at -80°C until further usage.

Reflection
Using a Beyond the Bench[mark] approach to beginning to solve the scientific literacy issues we have in our society worked wonders in classroom settings. Throughout our summer and fall season, we were able to have 8 Beyond the Bench[mark] Events, which are described in the Project Presentations and Educational Events section of Policies & Practices. Over 200 people have participated in Beyond the Bench[mark] thus far, and another 625 are scheduled for the upcoming months. Creature Feature helped us with public outreach in the middle school sector and the NetLogo Environmental Simulation helped us best explain our endocrine disruptor project to a more advanced crowd. At the beginning of the summer, we had no clue how we were going to approach such controversial topics such as synthetic biology or endocrine disruptors, but an engaging, educational, and exciting environment fostered by Beyond the Bench[mark] made us feel like it should be an international initiative that iGEM teams, the scientific community, and society can benefit from.
Feedback/Expectations from teachers for Beyond the Bench[mark] in their classrooms:
“I'm excited about the new kits! The kids had a really good time with those activities and I thought the lessons were highly engaging. I'll pass on the information about the new kits to the rest of my science team.” – Hilary Buttenfield, Teacher at ECS
""It gives me great pleasure to hear from a Lamar Louise Curry Alumnus and see that you are committed to furthering the education of our students. I thank you for this wonderful opportunity that you are offering our school. We cannot wait to see you in December for Creature Feature!"" -Jannet Marrero, LLCM Science Department Chair
""We spoke at the YCC Chemistry Fair on Saturday about classes at Bishop Guilfoyle being involved in the testing of outreach kits that you are developing.  My principal enthusiastically approved this!  Please let us know what our next step is.  I had particular interest in the Environmental Science computer simulation being developed.  We would like to hear about everything!"" -Gina Baker, AP Environmental Teacher

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," students
On May 18th, one of our team members, Pierre-Louis, took advantage of his stay in China to go to a college in Huailai City in the west of Beijing. In this college, he gave a course on air pollution and synthetic biology. To better convey his message, he gave part of his presentation in Chinese. The fun aspect was essential in his presentation: thus, to encourage interactions, he offered sweets to all students who participated in the quizzes and games he had prepared.
Two members of our team, Karima and Diane, went on April 29th, 2017 to Vincennes in the east of Paris to organize workshops on the theme ""Bacteria in my belly?"" For children 8 to 12 years. Karima and Diane presented the essential role of bacteria and the diversity of the intestinal microbiota. To make the presentation more interactive, children could observe under microscope the different types of bacteria to become aware of their diversity.
On May 23rd, two of our team members, Juliette and Gabriel, plus our coach, Pr. Gopaul, went to the High School Charles de Gaulle of Poissy. During a half-an-hour-long presentation, we introduced the students of a class to the field of synthetic biology, beginning with the more theoric aspects and then, the problematics and issues linked to that theme. We briefly exposed to them our project and given them an idea of what is iGEM, which could be interesting for them to know since iGEM teams composed of High School students exist.
Diffusion through the media
We were convinced of the importance of going through the traditional media to communicate around our project. Our work has been presented in different national journals:
-Radio France Bleu: We had the great opportunity to present our project on the second radio station in France in the morning, listened to on average by more than 3.9 million people every day! Here you can find the podcast of our presentation in the “Positive Waves” radio program. https://www.francebleu.fr/emissions/ondes-positives/107-1/pierre-louis-schnitzler-futur-ingenieur-en-biotechnologie-cree-un-dispositif-de-depollution-de-l-air
-20 Minutes: Our project was also presented in the newspaper 20 Minutes, that spreads about 500 000 copies in Paris every month! http://www.20minutes.fr/paris/2133731-20170916-journee-qualite-air-chasse-tresor-traque-partic"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html,"imer and tetramer versus time are plotted in Figure 4. Since dissociation constant (Kd) of LacI-LacI monomer interaction (77nM) is mush larger than that of LacI dimer-dimer interaction (0.1pM), steady-state concentrations of LacI mRNA and protein are in different scales with that of LacI dimer and tetramer. Due to very large Kd of LacI dimer-dimer interaction, LacI protein would finally exist in form of tetramer in the system (concentration of LacI dimer is several orders of magnitude lower than the scale of the left Y axis and thus be ignored).
Figure 5 shows dynamic behaviors of plasmids in our model. Since only one copy of plasmid DNA0 was transformed, its quantity increases at the very beginning and decrease soon because all DNA0 will bind with LacI tetramer and no free plasmid exists. The process will end in one hour and quantities of both DNA0 and DNA1 enter into a stable level. It is worth mentioning that the stable concentration of DNA1 is about 380 nM, a little lower than its maximum concentration 475 nM. It is owing to reproduction of E.coli cells. After quantities of E.coli cell go into its stable stage, its concentration will continue to increase until the maximum setup value.
This basic example proves great success for iGAME to automatically model genetic regulatory systems. It shows real biological process in a qualitative manner and give suggestions for users to adjust their experiment plans.

Project
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we attempt to apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically.

THE 2018 UNIVERSITY OF IOWA iGEM TEAM
WHO ARE WE?
Welcome! We are Iowa’s 2018 iGEM Team – a group of 14 undergraduate students at the University of Iowa, pursuing studies from all across campus, including biology, engineering, anthropology, chemistry and more. We have come together to compete in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition. We are the second-ever team from the state of Iowa to compete in this world renowned synthetic biology competition.
The competition provides students like us—from diverse majors and backgrounds—the opportunity to collaborate, develop teamwork skills, and carry out real-world experiments that have a substantial impact. Our team will spend the summer working in various labs, designing and conducting experiments. We are focusing on how to genetically engineer a microbe, called Bacillus subtilis , to produce an industrial bioplastic in an environmentally-sustainable and affordable way. You can read our full project proposal here .
Although we are working with faculty advisers from four different departments here at UI, this project is primarily student-driven and will demonstrate the excellence of Iowa research and the potential of Iowa undergraduates on an international scale.
We could use your help!
In order to conduct these experiments, we need to raise money to pay for materials such as chemical reagents, bacterial cultures, and genetic engineering tools. All donations are tax-deductible and will help our team partake in the opportunity of a lifetime. Thank you for your support!
About the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition
iGEM is an international synthetic biology competition where student teams, from across the world, work                 during the summer to build a microbe that carries out some sort of ‘programmed’ function (something that the                 specific microbe would not normally be able to do). iGEM was founded at MIT in 2003. Last year, 340 teams from                 around the world entered the competition, creating microbes that can sense atmospheric carbon monoxide, clean                 up wine stains, convert sugar into biofuels or medicines, and much more. These teams ranged from Pakistan,                 Kenya, Canada"

3A Assembly
Introduction
3A assembly (which stands for three antibiotic assembly) is a method for assembling two BioBrick parts and selecting for correct assemblies with antibiotics. 3A assembly is now the preferred assembly method at iGEM HQ and the Knight lab at MIT.
It differs from Standard Assembly in that it relies on three way ligation (between the two parts and the backbone vector) for assembly rather than two way ligation between a part and a part + vector.  It uses effective antibiotic selection to eliminate unwanted background colonies and eliminates the need for gel purification and colony PCR of the resulting colonies. In theory, about 97% of the colonies should be the desired assembly.
Motivation
3A assembly was designed such that gel purification of the digested parts is unnecessary.  Incorrect assemblies are selected against via either positive or negative selection.  The motivations for eliminating the gel purification step are as follows:
Gel purification is slow and not easily susceptible to automation and scaling.  As the Registry moves to larger scale assembly of parts, gel purification can be a limiting step in terms of how many assemblies can be done in parallel.
Gel purification tends to be inefficient especially on small pieces of DNA.  It can be difficult to isolate small pieces of DNA (< 200 bp) from a gel.  Thus, when assembling two small pieces of DNA, 3A assembly might prove advantageous.

It would be irresponsible to ignore the potentially harmful applications of synthetic biology. However, the potential benefits provided by research in this area exceed the disadvantages. Through establishing firm regulations in this area I believe that research can be conducted in a safe and productive manner. I believe it is the responsibility of members of society, including those in the scientific community, to establish the ethical groundwork which will shape the aims and applications of synthetic biology.""

Synthetic biology creates biological systems that do not natural exist. Does anything about synthetic biology make you feel uncomfortable?
“The idea of synthetic biology doesn't make me feel uncomfortable but the applications and potential outcomes are somewhat worrisome. I don’t know much about the topic on hand but just as long as there are regulations in place and governing bodies to overlook the research and applications, I would feel at ease with it all.”
iGEM Calgary | Calgary, Alberta, Canada
“I know it's an old school example, but my favorite application of syn bio would have to be when they got E. coli to make human insulin. That definitely revolutionized how we look at type 1 diabetes and really improved people's lives.”
Cornell University | Ithaca, NY
“I can see why people often raise ethical concerns about synthetic biology and GMOs. To some extent, we are artificially manipulating nature, or as some people say, “playing God.” But at the same time, I feel that the technological innovations and benefit towards society due to genetic engineering far outweighs these qualms. For example, the Golden Rice Project strived to engineer a strain of rice rich in beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency is one of the major causes of malnutrition and has historically plagued many undeveloped nations. GMOs provide a medium to produce nutrients and materials such as vitamin A in bulk, and thereby help alleviate problems like Vitamin A deficiency. With proper regulation, I see GMOs as a huge opportunity that can be safely utilized for our benefit.”
Ithaca, NY
Where do we draw the line with syn bio?
""I do not agree with the term “playing God”. In my opinion, we have a duty to use the technology we have to improve the quality of human life as well as continue forward progress. The line should be drawn where humanity and planet earth as a whole begin to suffer from the use of synthetic biology. There is a massive amount to be gained through the use of this new and rapidly expanding field. Utilizing syn bio"

Le vecteur tissulaire
Le vecteur tissulaire a pour fonction de véhiculer le vecteur cellulaire jusqu'à l’organe d’intérêt, celui comportant la cellule cible.
Il doit posséder trois caractéristiques essentielles. En tant que vecteur de type bactérien, il ne doit pas être pathogène pour le patient, ou du moins peut être peu néfaste. Il doit avoir un tropisme intéressant,  c'est-à-dire avoir la capacité d’atteindre l’organe cible. Et enfin, la caractéristique la plus importante, il doit pouvoir déjouer le système immunitaire, afin de ne pas être détruit ou éliminé avant d’avoir atteint ses objectifs.
Vous allez découvrir au cours de ce chapitre sur quelles caractéristiques nous nous sommes basés pour choisir la meilleure bactérie.

FOOD ADULTRATION TESTS
As the track we've chosen is 'Food', we saw it fitting to conduct simple experiments in the field. In this activity, students were taught techniques by which different adulterants in food can be identified.
Thus, the day ended on a high note with the students leaving with a fresh perspective on Synthetic biology and Science, as a whole.
NATIONAL CONFERENCE iGEM STALL
This year, our college hosted a National conference on 'Food and Entrepreneurship' the 15th and 16th of September We saw this as an excellent window  to interact with some of the greatest scientific minds from across the country.  To make the best use of this opportunity we decided to put up a stall at the entrance.
We presented our project and its applications to the different students and research scholars  from various backgrounds of science that were present at this conference. In addition, we handed out survey forms before and after our presentation to record their feedback and suggestions.
BIOFAIR
Our team decided that in addition to academicians, we also wanted the opinion of the general public, considering that they would be the population we'd finally impact. In collaboration with team SVCE CHENNAI, we conducted 'Biofair', an initiative to spread awareness about Synthetic Biology and our respective projects. It was held at the Tower Park, Chennai, India. We set up stalls and taught the general public what synthetic biology is and how it makes a difference in our lives, apart from explaining our current iGEM projects. We also carried out simple but fun science experiments to engage the kids in the park. We spoke about the need for our project, and its application in real life. In order to impart more clarity on the subject, we explained some similar previous year projects.
A majority of our audience associated GMOs with wild mutations and a Frankenstein-like end product. After a deeper explanation into the workings of synthetic biology, we were able to change their mindset towards the subject. More queries about the feasibility of our project were addressed and explained.
SURVEY
We at REC – CHENNAI wanted to make sure that synthetic biology and our project reached the masses.  So we set on a journey collecting opinions after opinions right from 16 year olds to 60 year olds. This survey was a result of this journey and we have come to understand that the public is more educated about synthetic biology than we expected.
We gave out survey forms before and after explaining our project, and everything"

Collaboration with team Dundee 2015
Team Dundee 2015
Some aspects of our project were similar to team Dundee. They built a chromium biosensor based on the same system we used, the chromate inducible operon of Ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl1. Therefore, we decided to cooperate and exchanged ideas, plasmid maps and sequences. During our collaboration, we realized that they were comparing the original sequence of the repressor to one with the first 15 codons optimized, while our system is based on a complete codon optimized repressor. So we exchanged samples to test in each other’s systems and look for differences. We were able to measure a combination of our promoter and their repressor in CFPS.

However, despite this decontextualized view of science is presented in society appears as something neutral, oblivious of the implications of their occurrence. This neutral view does not consider the evolution of knowledge, know what are the difficulties and obstacles to overcome to obtain improved knowledge.
EVENTS RELATED TO SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
The development potential of synthetic biology in Uruguay has been stimulated by activities with entrepreneurs, public sector representatives and researchers in biotechnology. This has provided an initial stage to extend this knowledge where experts from the region will impact the introduction of synthetic biology in production chains in neighboring countries and their current situation in Uruguay. Then be searched for by an instance of group work, the participants' perception about the development potential of the area in the country and its potential transfer to industry.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," different biosensor components together. This separation of components will enable the decoupling of non-specific components from specific detection systems. Using this approach, production of biosensor variants will not require subsequent engineering steps: cells containing desired components will simply be mixed together (Figure 2).
Figure 2: SBOL Visual for the modular and multicellular Sensynova framework design.
The splitting of biosensor components into separate cells may have additional advantages besides ease of variant production. Goni-Moreno et al. (2011) have previously suggested that the use of synthetic quorum sensing circuits enables each cell to be considered an independent logic gate, which may rectify the “fuzzy logic” seen in some biosensors, where stochastic cellular processes may produce false positive results. Quorum sensing has also been previously used to synchronise gene expressions, leading to reduced variability within a population (Danino et al., 2010).
Preliminary Experiment
In order to support our theory that genetic assembly is the rate limiting step in biosensor development, we attempted to assemble a simple GFP producing system using three engineering techniques: BioBrick, Gibson and Golden Gate. Further information about this experiment can be found on our interlab page . Gibson was the only successful technique we trailed, however, Gibson assembly is not an ideal method for circuit variant production due the the specificity of the overlapping regions: For example, to assemble ten genetic parts into all possible orders would require the use of 90 different overlapping sequences (Ellis et al., 2011). Therefore, the ability to generate circuit variants without the need for further genetic engineering would be useful.
Design Stage
To modularise biosensor components, it was necessary to first confirm which devices types are commonly found in biosensors. An in depth systematic review was conducted to determine these components. Team seeker, a tool for keyword searches of iGEM team titles and abstracts for the years 2008 to 2016, was used to identify biosensor based projects (Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team, 2014). The search terms used to identify potentially relevant projects were “sense” and “biosensor”. 121 projects were identified by these search terms. In projects including multiple sensors, the most well characterised sensors were used for this review. Sensor designs, rather than constructed biosensors, were used for analysis, as time constraints in iGEM often prevents project completion. Ten projects were unable to be reviewed because their wiki was broken. Of the remaining 111 projects, 18 projects were deemed not eligible for further analysis. This was either due to a lack of information regarding bios"

Educational Pamphlet/Instruction Manual for Hardware
In order to have a well functioning piece of hardware farmers can use to detect rust fungus, we would need an instruction manual accompanying the hardware. Using feedback from Dr. Parikh and her ugandan research team, we should use ugandan students and professionals to best develop an instruction manual appropriate for that audience. This can be expanded to other areas. The best instructions will come from people more accustomed to the target audience’s background. Ideally these instructions would be written on the side of the device for ease of access.

How to connect the battery to the arduino inside the hardware
How to collect samples in fields
How to insert the collection disk into the container of rehydrated cells
How to operate the device, first blanking the system and then measuring the difference

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," was successful in injecting proteins across a membrane.
Background and Introduction
The Idea
The inspiration for this project came from the 2011 Hokkaido iGEM team and their ""injection assay using onion cells"". We wanted to replicate the experiment to show that the Injectisome served its function, a proof of concept of sorts. First we were focused on using onion cells but in the process of the experiment some problems arose which led us to look to other options. We decided on that the other option should be tobacco cells.
Bacteria and reporter proteins
The E. coli strain we wanted the proof of concept for contained the injectisome, secretion signal and a reporter protein(GFP and Mcherry). We wanted to use Mcherry for the assay on the onion and GFP for the assay on the tobacco due to ease of analysis of results in a fluorescent microscope. IPTG induces the formation of the injectisome and arabinose induces the reporter protein.
Protoplasts
Tobacco protoplasts and onion protoplasts differ quite a bit. Onion cells are large and without any chlorophyll but tobacco cells are small and contain chlorophyll. Protoplasts are in essence plant cells without a cell wall. To make our protoplasts, the cells with an intact cell wall, have to be incubated with a solution with cell wall degrading enzymes, an optimal osmotic pressure and PH value, so the cells don't shrink and/or burst. The optimization of the production and handling of the protoplasts was one of the biggest barriers to overcome, during the experimental process.
The reason for making the protoplast in the first place is that a plant cell with an intact cell wall might pose a problem to the attachment of the injectisome to the cell and the injection of the protein into the cell.
Figure 1 showing experimental overview
Methods, process and results
Intro
We used the protocol from the 2011 Hokkaido iGEM team as a start point and tried to follow their protocol as best as possible. When that didn't give useful results other than burst cells, flabs of apparent onion remnants and fluorescent bacteria floating about, we had to optimise several aspects of the protocol to our needs.
Protoplast production and preperation
After trying effortlessly attaching onion cell sheets with agarose to a slide glass and incubating with an MgM-MES buffer(ph 5) with 0.4M Sorbitol and cell wall degrading enzymes to obtain protoplasts, we got the idea of making tobacco protoplasts instead and keep"

Building the BDSF Sensor
Chromosomal DNA from Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315 was kindly gifted to us by Drs Robert Ryan and Shi-Qi An from the Division of Molecular Microbiology in the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee. This was used as template for the amplification of BCAM0228 and the cblD promoter region.
The cblD promoter region was cloned into the pSB1C3 plasmid (to give BioBrick BBa_K1315008 ), and was then subcloned into pBluescript. Promoterless gfp was amplified (using BBa_K562012 as a template), and was cloned into pBluescript downstream of the cblD promoter. The manA promoter-gfp construct was then subcloned into pUniprom. A schematic of our completed construct can be seen below (Fig 2).
A modified version of the BCAM0227 gene which was compatible with BioBrick specifications and standards was synthesised by a third party (Dundee Cell Products). This was subsequently subcloned into the pUniprom vector harbouring PcblD-gfp.
To adhere to the iGEM rules and regulations, it was necessary to remove an illegal EcoRI restriction site present in BCAM0228. The modified gene was cloned into the pSB1C3 plasmid (to give BioBrick BBa_K1315007 ). BCAM0228 was then subcloned into the pUniprom vector that already harboured PmanA-gfp and BCAM0227. To facilitate immunochemistry, we chose to supply BCAM0227 and BCAM0228 with an influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) tag which can be detected with commercial antibodies. This tag was added to the C-terminus of each protein.
The plasmid was verified by sequencing. The completed construct was transformed into MC1061 E. coli as a chassis for our biosensor.
Characterisation
Initially, Western blots were undertaken to test for the sequential production of BCAM0227-HA and BCAM0228-HA.  An overnight culture of the cells were lysed and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE in a 12% acrylamide gel. Anti-HA antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase were"

To deal with these problems, firstly, we believe that we should advocate people to protect their ears. In addition, for people who have suffered from these problems, we want to do something to improve their social acceptance and discover better resolutions for hearing loss treatment.
Charities
We consulted several local charity associations about the issues they concern related to hearing-impaired population. We also expressed our interests and we hope to further our Human Practices after the Jamboree.
Lions Club of Shenzhen: They irregularly hold activities to help blinds in rural areas of China under the help of government. In Shenzhen, they keep tight contact with community health center all over the city and they periodically organize health care for people with hearing impairment. Other events including helping them with employment and other living problems and holiday consolation are often arranged. They also have special service team formed by individuals and authorized to develop activities on their own.
Two Cups of Water Sign Language: They set up sign language class at Shenzhen Centre Book Store, one of the biggest book store in Shenzhen, to teach people for free. According to their person in charge, people with hearing loss account for 1/10 to 1/5 who participate in learning.
Shenzhen Ear Caring Plan: This organization provide hearing aids and Cis for child with hearing loss, aiming to let them go to school and receive education just the same as normal healthy child.
We also cooperate with Southern University of Science and Technology Volunteers (SUV), a charity group organized by students in SUSTech. They have arranged activities to help people with visual disorder and their work is very impressive. Helping with hearing-impaired people could be the next thing they plan to do.
Public Outreach
Commonweal organizations
After collecting and analyzing our questionnaires, we found that most people lack the experience of communicating with severe hearing-impaired people. However, they showed great enthusiasm on learning more about them and caring them as possible.
We contacted some charity organizations which regularly provide lectures and information for the public. For example, Two Cups of Water Sign Language set up courses every week in Shenzhen Center Book Store for people to learn simple sign language.
We think the biggest problem of people with hearing loss is caused by communication difficult. If normal people can learn basic sign language, they can have more contact with hearing-impaired people and thus discrimination and prejudice on this population can be largely decreased. Further, it is the simplest way to make people with hearing loss feel comfortable in this society.
The questionnaire also shows many people lack basic knowledge about hearing loss"

Team:Sheffield/20 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Tuesday 20th July - The team travel to Newcastle for the UK iGEM meet up!
Early start for the 9.20 train to Edinburgh. We all (...or most) met at the train station for 9.00 to ensure we all made the train. A couple of team members arrived just in the nick of time, which kick started the our adrenaline for the day. We arrived at newcastle for 11.30 - plenty of time to get up to the university for lunch... or so you would think. Sadly we got lost in a field somewhere, avoiding the quicker direction because there were cows nearby (an unfortunate case of bovinophobia within the team). Finally arriving at the right place for 13.00, we grabbed what lunch we could and sat to enjoy the team talks.
Following alphabetical order, we were quite far down the list to give our presentation. It was great to see how well plannned and clear ther other teams' presentations were. Some very interesting ideas this year. This set a high standard for us to follow on from - here come the nerves! Overall though, we don't think we did too badly. Every team appeared to have strong points, and we seemed to have made a good impression with our human practices work. Let's keep it up!
After giving our talk we had a brief break and watched the rest of the talks. Looking good for the UK this year! Following the talks we had our team building exercise of building the tallest egg holding tower out of spaghetti, cocktail sticks, a plastic tub and marshmallows. It appeared that most problematic (and tasty) were the marshmallows that faked their structural integrity. At first appearance they were quite strong, but given a few minutes holding a structure together entropy ensued and the marshmallows disintegrated. We can't remember which colour team won, but sadly none of our team were a member of this team - well done winning team.
Next on the agenda was a visit to the local pub, which had a nice selection of ales and a friendly atmosphere for us to get to know members of other teams. Naturally hungry from the busy day, we followed on to La Tasca in town for muchas tapas y sangria! The walk down was quite lengthy and wet, but it definitely helped us work up a healthy appetite. Dinner was very tasty and it was good to chat to the teams over lots of food.

All of the lab members received training for PCR, culture of cells, miniprep and etc., the minimal genetical operations and use of autoclave.
Q4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
IGEMers should set up a common clear biosafety regulation in iGEM competition and establish a systematic guideline of education about biosafety. This education should include information about biohazard and biotechnology risk assessment and risk analysis.
Backgrounds of iGEMers have become wider and wider, from high school students to graduate student in biology and from major in physics to major in molecular biology.  For some students, iGEM is the first contact to genetic engineering and they have little knowledge of biohazard and importance of biosafety.  Each iGEM teams, of course, teaches the knowledge to their members. However, a systematic education way of biosafety will help students to understand biosafety and to conduct their experiments more adequately.
From these reasons, we recommend that iGEM establish a systematic guideline of education about biosafety.
We work together with KAIT_Japan on issues of safety.
Cooperatively with KAIT_Japan, We iGEM Kyoto placed icons on our Wiki, which immediately enable you to see a risk of parts. The icons are as follows:

Simulation Setup
Molecular modeling methods ultimately aim for direct comparison with experimental measurements. As such, a good model of molecular interaction is essential. Quantum chemistry based ab initio molecular dynamics methods aim to reduce the amount of fitting and guesswork required for accurate modeling of molecular interactions. However, such approaches are generally limited to small systems and short timescales due to the added computational demand [17] . In classical molecular dynamics, molecules are described using stick-and-ball models: spherical atoms are connected by springs that represent bonds. As such, molecular forces can be described by simple mathematical models. For example, Hooke's law can be used to describe bonded interactions, while non-bonded interactions can be described by a Lennard-Jones potential. [ 14 , 1 ]
Molecular dynamics (MD) is based on numerical, step-by-step, evaluation of Newton's equations of motion. Due to the many-body nature of the problem, Newton's equations of motion are discretized and solved numerically. MD trajectories, that describe the time evolution of the system, consist of both position and velocity vectors of the particles in the system. The position and velocity vectors are reevaluated according to a finite time interval by using numerical integrators. The position vectors define the geometric configuration of the system while the velocity vectors define the kinetic energy and temperature of the system. [ 14 , 1 , 17 ]
We investigated the behavior of DCD-1L in aqueous solvents at varying salt concentrations and temperatures using molecular dynamics. the simulations make use of the GROMOS forcefield parameter set 53A6 [11] . GROMOS53A6 is considered a united-atom forcefield, which maps a carbon and its associated apolar hydrogens as one interaction center. The parametrization of the forcefield is based on accurate reproduction of free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation of a wide range of compounds. The relative free enthalpy of solvation between apolar and polar environments is an important property in"

But it is the detection limit of our biosensor. The figure on the right showed the mercury binding capacity of bacteria expressing differently localized MBPs. The surface displayed MBPs appear to have highest binding capacity while the pyramiding of MBP expression does not work well. This is because it is hard for the hydrophilic mercury ions to pass through the hydrophobic inner membrane.

Introduction: Antigen 43 is a unique autotransporter that promote bacterial cell-to-cell aggregation. Antigen 43 can be expressed on the E.coli cell surface in large quantities, up to 50000 copies per cell.[1] The structure analysis of antigen 43 revealed that antigen 43 has an N-terminal signal peptide; an N-proximal passenger domain that is secreted, which could also be called α domain; an autochaperone domain that facilitates folding of the passenger domain; and a C-terminal β-barrel domain that forms an integral outer membrane protein, also called β domain[2]. The passenger domain(αdomain) confers the autoaggregation phenotype and it is bound to the surface via non-covalent interaction with the βdomain.
Figure 1: The structure of the coding sequence of antigen 43. Antigen 43 contains a signal peptide, a passenger domain, an autochaperone domain and a translocation unit, which are all indicated in this figure.
Antigen 43 mediated aggregation is a distinct phenotype that can be visualized macroscopically as flocculation and settling of cells in static liquid suspensions. Since we use E.coli to detect and absorb heavy metal ions, it is of great importance that we consider the disposal,which requires minimal"

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated"

This is done very simply by using the Parafilm on the sides of the tubes to join a new and old tube together. The upper layer of Parafilm on the old tube is then slit and the double tube placed with the slit sachet down on filter paper. The old diet leaks out and is absorbed by the filter paper and, deprived of food, the aphids take themselves upwards to settle on the new sachet.

Human Practices
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.""

Overview
The Peking iGEM 2016 has been focusing on current treatments of uranium pollution worldwide and how to solve the pollution using synthetic biology.
Besides the Uranium Reaper project, we did a lot of human practices as well. This page is a quick overview. If you are interested in any work, click ""learn more…"" button for results and more details.

311 Brigade
Visiting the Hunan Nuclear Geology 311 Brigade
We visited the Hunan Nuclear Geology 311 Brigade, which fights uranium pollution on the front line, to best understand the current situation of pollution abatement. Their feedback showed that they were using a comparatively high-cost, time-consuming and possibly incomplete strategy in which they buried at least the lowest-grade nuclear waste underground and grew appropriate plants on the site. All these shortcomings motivated us to figure out a better solution.

By doing so, we hope that we can assist other users to find and use those parts efficiently. Ultimately we want to facilitate the implementation of the philosophy of Part Registry, which is to get and give (and share), through a better organization of ncRNA parts in the registry.
This page was written in compliance with Part Registry's format for general Catalog Pages. Currently, the information is uploaded manually because we have yet to submit our suggestions to iGEM HQ. Upon approval, we will tag existing regulatory RNAs and complete the page. Being part of the cross-cohort ""Project Riboregulator"", the page is far from complete and is expected to take shape by Summer 2015. We welcome and encourage constant update and adoption of this page in the future.

The BIG TEMPLATE : RESPONSIVE and FREE
Introduction
Plastic is a ubiquitous material in modern consumer goods. One of the most common plastics used today is polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Chemically, it is a polymer consisting of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid subunits. With the increasingly short life cycles of consumer products, PET waste is accumulating around the globe at an uncontrollable rate. Moreover, PET is a plastic that does not biodegrade well, and degradation often has to use industrial processes. Given the rapid accumulation of PET and the difficulties associated with biodegradation by ecosystems, it is paramount to find a more efficient method to degrade PET.
Our iGEM project was inspired by the results of a collaborative study between Keio University and Kyoto Institute of Technology, two prestigious Japanese universities. Their research investigated the ability of PETase, an enzyme, to degrade PET plastic using a bacterium known as Ideonella Sakainesis. The success of PETase in the degradation of PET plastic into Polyethylene Terephthalate and Ethylene Glycol sparked our interest in improving the Japanese ecological environment. Thus, the goal of our iGEM project is to create a biobrick incorporating an ideal Anderson promoter to optimize the use of PETase in an E. coli bacteria system. Past iGEM projects centered on plastic degradation, such as those of Turkey 2014, University of Washington 2012 and Darmstadt 2012, also provided us with inspiration on the potential applications for our project, as well as lab protocols.
Our team focused on making a biobrick featuring the PETase enzyme to contribute to the IGEM registry. In addition, we hoped to optimize the initial step of PET breakdown, or depolymerization, so as to expedite the overall process of degradation. To accomplish these goals, we selected several Anderson promoters of different strengths (weak, moderately-strong, and strong) to test for optimizing PETase production. The faster the rate of transcription for the PETase gene, the more PETase enzyme is produced. The greater the volume of enzyme, the faster the rate of depolymerization, since there is more enzyme available to ‘work’ on a plastic sample.
Project Design
Each of our constructs featured an Anderson promoter of a given strength, followed by an oSMY gene, and then PETase. This is demonstrated in the construct diagram below"
Zamorano,2014,Team:Zamorano#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," we propose this tool as a simpler alternative to elaborate consistent risk assessments for Synthetic Biology practices, complying with national and international biosafety regulations in Latin America.
Setting forth a synthetic biology project has been challenging. However, the learned experiences has helped us a lot in understand synthetic biology and its applications. In addition, obtained results will be useful tools to establish the basements of synthetic biology establishment in Honduras. We hope to generate a positive impact in Honduran students and to spread and generate alliances with other universities in the region.

Parts Collection
UT-Knoxville 2017 has submitted the following parts:
The xylR coding sequence was synthesized during our 2016 project, and the Pu promoter was amplified from 2013 Peking’s part BBa_K1031803. All constructs were made by Gibson Assembly. Confirmed sequences of these parts are available on the registry.
Each gene of interest was amplified from E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA, and Gibson Assembled into a linearized vector consisting of pSB1C3, BBa_B0034, and BBa_B0010. The constructs were first transformed into Top10, and characterized and sequenced in BL21DE3. Confirmed sequences of these parts are available in the registry.
Note: pRob (BBa_K2451006) remains BioBrick incompatible due to EcoRI and PstI in the coding sequence.

Speed
The entire process of 3G assembly takes only about eight hours (including down time) followed by an overnight transformation. Furthermore, as explained above, numerous circuit variants can be created at once. Therefore, 3G is significantly more efficient than hierarchical cloning methods like ordinary Golden Gate.
Cost
Because standard adapter sequences are used, there is no need to redesign primers every time you create a circuit. This substantially cuts the cost of primers associated with Gibson assembly. In addition, the reactions in 3G are very small in volume, which saves on reagent costs. Our collaborators at UVA specifically cited this as an advantage they appreciated.
Simplicity
3G is a simple procedure that can be carried out with ease by any molecular biology lab. To demonstrate this as well as to ensure that our protocol was clear and repeatable, we collaborated with University of Pittsburgh and UVA. We sent these teams parts to assemble and test. Their success can be seen in the following gel images, which show Golden Gate PCR products of the expected lengths:
Figure 7: UVirginia Golden Gate gel extraction
Figure 8: UPittsburgh Golden Gate gel extraction
In addition, UVA conducted tests on a circuit they constructed. As expected, fluorescence levels were higher in the circuit with BBa_B0034 than BBa_B0032, the observed relative expression of B0032/B0034 (0.23) was roughly in line with the registry value of 0.3.
Figure 9: UVA circuit testing results: Each dot represents the relative fluorescence of an independent biological replicate compared to the geometric mean of B0034. The line represents the geometric mean of 3 independent biological replicates.
Because our collaborators were able to carry out 3G assembly, we expect that other iGEM teams should be able to as well. Thus, 3G can be practically implemented in iGEM labs, enabling teams to rapidly and inexpensively produce countless circuit variants. This leaves more time and resources for experimental work. In effect, 3G will allow for an advanced rate of scientific advances within iGEM and SynBio in general.
Within Our Project
Part One: Pad Sequences on Parts
One of our first goals was to create a library of parts that can easily be used in 3G assembly. To begin this process, we designed two sequences: WM_Pad1 and WM_Pad2. These pad sequences are orthogonal to the genome of E. coli and to the UNS sequences used later in 3G assembly. We designed prim"

Moving dCas9 to pET26B
E. coli glycerol stocks containing pdCas9 (Addgene plasmid # 46569) and pET26B were streaked on LB plates with the appropriate antibiotic, liquid cultures were inoculated and the plasmids were isolated .
Q5 PCR was performed on these plasmids, to make fragments with cleaving sides for PacI and SpeI:
pdCas9:
Fwd primer: Bel-cas9 Cas9 fwd (acacacTTAATTAATGACAGCTTATCATCGATAAGCT)
Rev primer: Bel-cas9 Cas9 rev (acacacACTAGTTCAGTCACCTCCTAGCTGAC)
Annealing T: 60ºC, elongation time 1.5 minutes.
Expected band size: 5340 bp
pET26B:
Fwd primer: Bel-cas9 pET fwd (acacacactagtgcgcaacgcaattaatgtaag)
Rev primer: Bel-cas9 pET rev (acacacttaattaaatggatatcggaattaattcggatc)
Annealing T: 60ºC, elongation time 1.5 minutes.
Expected band size: 3737 bp
Fragments were checked on 1% agarose TAE gels, 100V, 30 minutes. The PCR for pET26B worked, whereas the one for pdCas9 did not.
Collection and construction of pEVOL plasmids
The following plasmids were received from Peter Schultz:
pEVOL-pAzF (Addgene plasmid # 31186)
pEVOL-pBpF (Addgene plasmid # 31190)
As well as the recoded strain C321ΔA-exp, from George Church (Bacterial strain #49018) All were delivered as agar stabs, that were streaked on LB plates with the appropriate antibiotic.

NTNU-Trondheim,2013,Team:NTNU-Trondheim#ExamplePage_-_-_TEXT.html,"rogen receptor because it fulfilled the criteria of being a homodimer and dependant on Estradiol for dimerization. Furthermore,  it has been previously used in a two-hybrid assay as a chimera attached to GAL4 parts to measure ß-galactosidase activity (Peters 1999). In addition to its structural and mechanical advantages it would also make a useful biosensor since estradiol poses numerous hazards to the environment. Therefore the ability to sense it cheaply and effectively would have great implications.
The Estrogen Receptor is made up of 6 domains: A, B, C, D, E, and F. Domains A and B serve as a transcriptional factor, domain C recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences and is also involved in dimerization (Peters 1999). Domain E is the Ligand Binding Domain (LBD); when it binds to estrogen it homodimerizes to another Estrogen Receptor LBD. Domain D’s function is unknown. Domain F has been shown to inhibit dimerization and/or binding of estrogen and is thus undesirable for our project. In a wild type system these domains interact to bind Estrogen with Domain E, confer conformation so that C can bind a specific DNA sequence, dimerize with another estrogen receptor and act as a transcription factor to promote transcription downstream of its binding.
After studying the function of each of the domains as well as the findings of Peters 1999 paper we began by making two different ToxR chimeras with two Estrogen Receptor truncations: ER∆F (no F domain) and the ER-LBD alone. Both of these estrogen receptor truncations were attached to the 3' end of ToxR and tested under various Estradiol levels. However, these truncations were non-responsive with and without estradiol. We hypothesized that different estrogen receptor truncations may be unable to express in the membrane, and the LBD by itself does not homodimerize as it didn't in the Peters' 1999 study. So, in order to mitigate both possibilities we made 8 more truncations that spanned the range between Domain A and Domain C.
Preliminary data suggests that truncations 5, 6, and 8 all showed constitutive ToxR dimerization and resulting fluorescence. However, none seemed to be inducible in response to Estrogen. Nevertheless, we believe we are getting very close to successfully expressing an inducible chimera because by showing activity it proves the estrogen receptor is not broken. Peters "

BioBricks
General design of our project has been architected; thus it is the time to learn more about the individual parts of the big picture. Here are the detailed descriptions of our planned BioBricks of this year’s project, the mechanisms of how they conduct and what is expected from them exactly.
Hypoxia Respond Element (HRE)
Hypoxia response elements (HREs) are 234 bp long small DNA sequences present in most of the body cells which work as binding domains for hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a common transcription factor found in our body cells released during hypoxic conditions. (Semenza et al. 1992)
We intend to add several HREs to the upstream region of weak constitutive promoter, PminiCMV, in order to design a novel hypoxia inducible promoter. We expect that in normal conditions with enough oxygen presence, PminiCMV promoter will express very small amount of mRNA which will be degraded soon conceivably. However, in hypoxic conditions, more transcription factors will hopefully bind to our designed HRE sites to enhance the transcription rate of PminiCMV promoter.
According to the studies in the literature, HRE sequence has provided significant high transcription rate in hypoxic cells when it was attached on the upstream region of Simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter. (Tang et al. 2002) In this study, plasmids which contain HRE inducible promoters were presented in cell lines and the amount of these plasmids were increased gradually to test whether the detection level and transcription rate of hypoxia would raise. As a result, the production rate of reporter gene attached to HRE promoters increased 410 times more. This result encouraged us to use these sequences as novel, efficient and powerful hyp"

Because Carboxysome is a bacterial microcompartment of a size close to 10nm (6) , one way to study its expression and formation is with the use of fluorescent proteins fused to one of the major proteins of the shell (4) . In order to achieve this, we fused via an Ala-Ala-Ala linker to a red fluorescent protein (RFP) ( BBa_E1010 ) at the carboxyl terminus of CsoS1A.
In order to know which strain was better for the expression of the BMC, we performed a study in different strains of E. coli: TOP10, BL21 and DH5alpha, in order to see if there were any significant differences. All strains were made competent under the same protocol (Click HERE to go to the protocols section), as well as the bacteria transformations and inductions remained the same for the three strains.
At this point, is important to remember that the objective of this project is to target proteins into the Carboxysome: For this, we created four constructs that consisted on one of the two subunit of RuBisCO, large or small, linked to a GFP at the amino or carboxyl terminus. More information about part of the project, go to the Targeting section ( Link ).  So, we also transformed the bacteria of each strain with the two vectors: the pHnCBS1D for Carboxysome expression ( Bba_K1113100 ) and one of the four available targeting vectors ( Bba_K1113002 ).
We chose the better strain (TOP10) depending on which showed better parameter of induction and less basal expression at the same conditions, after being analyzed with Fluorescent Microscopy. The selected strain was observed for proper assembly of the BMC by a Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), to be sure that the observed fluorescence corresponded to properly assembled Carboxysomes and not some kind of inclusion body or protein aggregates.
Another important point to analyze in the formation of Carboxysome was whether the co-transformed bacteria with our targeting construct ( Link ) produced any kind of problems associated with increased energy expenditure (because of the presence of two plasmids in the bacteria) or because of the presence of more quantity of one subunit of RuBisCO.
In order to check this, we decided to implement a strategy similar to the one used for the Dundee 2011 iGEM team.
Click here for more information about the strategy to check if the Carboxysome was assembling correctly.

Some examples of what modules can do and how you might want to connect them together.
Components
Input Modules
Inducible promoters
If the expression of GAL4 is powered directly by an inducible promoter, for example a phosphate-starvation inducible one, then activation of the processing module will be directly tied to this condition.
Other promoters induced by heat or salt stress, nitrate, sulphate or potassium starvation could all be found (See our promoter hunt page under the marchantia tab for how we looked for them) and turned into input modules.
Promoters and associated sensing systems in plants have naturally evolved to be hugely specific for plant-relevant challenges. Therefore most of the utility of harnessing endogenous promoters in our synthetic signalling cascade would crop up in plant-based applications such as monitoring soil conditions in agricultural earth or allotments.
Hammerhead ribozymes
A second type of input would be the hammerhead ribozyme aptamer system created by Christina Smolke's lab at Stanford. This consists of an RNA sequence made of two fused parts. One catalytically self-cleaving RNA molecule called a hammerhead ribozyme is fused with a ligand-binding RNA sequence called an RNA aptamer.
Figure: Diagram showing general hammerhead ribozyme structure, from Christina Smolke's paper A modular and extensible RNA-based gene-regulatory platform for engineering cellular function pnas vol. 104 no.36 14283–14288.
RNA aptamers specific for thousands of different molecules and ions have been generated, and a library of these can be browsed here http://aptamer.icmb.utexas.edu/)
By fusing an aptamer to the self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme in an appropriate way, its self-cleavage activity can be modulated by the binding or absence of the ligand. In other words, when the ligand binds, it can promote or"

PBAN ( Pheromone Biosynthesis Activating Neuropeptide )
PBAN (Pheromone Biosynthesis Activating Neuropeptide) is a kind of peptide that can activate biosynthesis of pheromones of specific insects. Once a PBAN binds with the G-protein coupled receptor located at an insect’s pheromone gland, it will send a signal to activate kinase and phosphatase, which in turn activates other enzymes that participate in the biosynthesis of insect sex pheromones. These pheromones are eventually emitted(35).
In nature, female insects such as moths release PBAN to stimulate the synthesis of pheromones in order to attract male moths during mating. PBAN can also facilitate the release of non-sex pheromones such as trail pheromones for ants. Overall, this kind of natural substance, PBAN, has many advantages in the following, which"

BactoSafe
People are in fear about their properties, their families, their lives. Media and some politicians stoke those fears and produce an atmosphere that brings people to switch the priorities from 'freedom' to 'safety'. And this might have a high price. How do we want to punish people for misbehavior, what would come up if everyone has the possibility to use bacteria and virus for tracing e.g. intruders. Which other secondary effect would an area-wide DNA database have, for example on the employment market. How far are we really willing to go to protect our 'safety'?

Ko*ko*ro*mo
With the beginning of the chemical prime-age in the early 19th century organics with their natural abilities have gotten replaced by new revolutionary synthetical substances as an basic material for almost everthing. As a cause of this trend even popular plants with former medical backround sank into oblivion with a bad reputation as unaesthetical weeds.  Although we know that even the most efficient chemical products can cause harmful side-effects on our bodys,  our association with chemicals and plants changed very slowly since today. Thats why Ko*ko*ro*mo, the green synbio product, likes to approach as a intermediator between modern human needs and a plants rights to exists, via demonstrating new alternatives for a greener and more sustainable lifestyle in coexistance with plants.

Purdue,2014,Team:Purdue#The Problem#Current Agriculture Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," agricultural scene, it was used primarily to grant plants selective resistance to herbicides and pesticides. Monsanto’s herbicide Roundup, which used glyphosate as its active ingredient, debuted in 1974 as a pure herbicide that killed anything green it was sprayed on. While this was successful for a decade, cheap competition forced Monsanto to innovate. In 1996 they debuted Roundup Ready soybeans in 1996, which had genes for glyphosate resistance spliced in, making them selectively resistant to the herbicide (UC Biotech).  In 1994 Roundup sales totaled 1.2 billion dollars, this marked the definitive proof of concept that swapping genes could have immense economic benefits for both Monsanto and for farmers (Estes). Whereas traditional breeding approaches focused on yield and  aesthetic quality, this shift made herbicide resistance the most important characteristic of a new seed type. Some would argue this eventually led to the sacrificing of characteristics like nutrition. In support of this argument it was found that crops as a whole, have experienced a decline in 6 of 13 major nutrients in the past 50 years, the most drastic of which was a 38% reduction in riboflavin (Davis et. al). Another study concluded it would take eight oranges today to provide the same amount of vitamin A as an orange fifty years ago (Moss and Scheer).
When this level of plant breeding was first introduced, the long-reaching effects of pesticide spraying or selection for traits of size  and aesthetic quality were not considered. It is only now that we are seeing negative implications of these advancements. Take for example the “superweed” evolution, in which weeds with resistance to current herbicides are growing at an unprecedented rate(10).
To supplement the problems with genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the market preference has shifted away from genetically modified produce. In a study where participants bid on GMO vs non-GMO, 35-41% bid less for each individual GMO product (Huffman et. al). This trend is due to the spread of misinformation about possible side-effects of consuming GMOs. At the top of this list is that GMOs cause cancer. However, while GMOs undeniably do not cause cancer (Lim), the spread of misinformation has already swayed the market opinion and lowered the willingness-to-buy value of GMOs. The strength of anti-GMO sentiments was seen in the August 2013 uprooting of the golden rice fields in the Philippines. Golden rice, a variety of rice that had the benefit of producing beta-carotene (the precursor to Vitamin A), had been in development for years"

Auxotrophic Approach
BactaSun
Overview
Auxotrophic approach details
Our aim is to create a rapid UV-response system, so people can be rapidly warned of potentially harmful exposure to sunlight. For this reason, we’ve decided to work with a photocaged amino acid. One of our PIs, Professor Patrice Soumillon, has already worked with those compounds during his doctoral thesis and knows how efficiently they work. We’ve used the ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine (ONB-Tyr) for its relatively low price compared with other photocaged amino acids. The oNB cage is cleaved when exposed to UVs (312nm), and releases the tyrosine for protein synthesis (Fig 1).
Figure 1 : the photo-uncaging of the ONB-Tyr (https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/2/24/T--Aachen--onbtyrosincleavagereaction.png-modified)
We placed the ONB-Tyr inside a liquid cell culture. We studied a tyrosine auxotroph (TyrA-) E. coli strain. Those cells contain a plasmid including a gen encoding for a red fluorescent protein (RFP). This plasmid was furnished in the iGEM DNA distribution kit (BBa_K577882), developed by Boston University and Wellensly College in 2011 (Fig 2). The RFP originally comes from a coral, Discosoma striata and gives a red color.
We used a pBad promoter to induce the RPF expression with arabinose when the biomass is sufficient to produce a visible indicator.

QUANTIFICATION of PROGESTERONE
Several quantification methods were evaluated based on their specificity, accuracy and time efficiency.  Each of these methods, additionally, require the purification of the products of the synthetic pathway from the yeast cells. We considered gas or liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry since they report concentrations of precursors and quantify our desired product. However, gas chromatography would require the derivatization of progesterone so it could be vaporized during the mobile phase.  We determined that we should use liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry due to the convenience of the solid phase extraction system. Solid phase extraction utilizes the affinity of mobile phase solutes for a solid in its stationary phase to separate a mixture into its components by means of a cartridge. We would also use affinity column chromatography with progesterone-antibody beads, or ELISA for a more specific detection of progesterone. These methods would require progesterone antibodies and more preparation, but allow for immediate on site results.
DOSAGE
Our project requires a method for a consumer to obtain a reliable dose of contraceptive. Initially, we considered a galactose inducible progesterone biosynthesis pathway so we could establish a concentration of substrate to product curve. We abandoned this idea after learning that galactose inducibility is repressed by glucose which is present in the fuel source. We then considered methods of ceasing production of progesterone by use of a sensor that would inhibit the pathway at a specific concentration of progesterone.
Progesterone Receptor
The human progesterone receptor has 3 common isoforms, one of which is inherently cytosolic and translocates into the nucleus to affect gene expression after binding to progesterone. We considered using this action to initiate an apoptosis event upon binding of progesterone in the cell. This idea had some problems; the natural binding affinity for these receptors was much too high for our purposes and would result in apoptosis when the cell had accumulated ~0.05% of our target progesterone concentration of 20mg. This concentration is the required dosage for progesterone to suppress ovulation when taken sublingually. Changing the binding affinity of a cell receptor would require a large effort to intelligently design a new receptor or, more likely, a large library of random mutant"

The changed immune epitope count of serveral of the individual amino acids in Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2 shows, that especially the clustered regions with many epitopes were edited by our algorithm. This can be explained by the fact that a single mutation in this area has probably the biggest impact on the immunogenicity.
Figure 5.1 T-Cell immune epitopes before the deimmunization workflow shown as combined bar-/lineplot. For each amino acid position, the number of MHC class II epitopes  is plotted. Note that there is a prominent cluster of amino acid between residue 100-130 which are part of many immune epitopes.
Figure 5.2 T-Cell immune epitopes after the deimmunization workflow shown as combined bar-/lineplot. For each amino acid position, the number of MHC class II epitopes  is plotted.
Structural Verification
To validate whether the change of amino acids at these three positions still results in a stable protein, we did another MD simulation of 25 ns of the mutated protein with and without the fusion domain of the structures of previous MD simulations. Both RMSD plots show a RMDS of < 0.15 nm, which is a very stable conformation regarding the introduction of three point mutations (Figure 6.1/6.2). All three amino acids have their side chains oriented outwards relative to the protein core (Figure 7) and do not interfere with any present secondary structures of the protein or any other amino acids. This also suggests that our algorithm made a good choice regarding the substituted residues.
