Brief Introduction
Bio-brick stands a pivotal status in all iGEM experiments, being the base of synthetic biology. Targeting iGEM community, we upgraded WEiGEM 2.0, a cloud-based bio-brick search engine, by new features including optimizing the search algorithm, personalized search options, auto-addition of prefix and suffix and instant mark-and-share your bio-bricks on your mobile phones. With in-time and well-sifted biology articles, WEiGEM 2.0 serves as an educational and social media center where iGEMers’ ideas flow toward biology lovers. We further developed an education tool kit “1kg Bio-Box” to engage potential millions of students in remote areas of China into synthetic biology. In conclusion, we manage to build bridges in connecting thousands of bio-bricks to iGEM community and public.
Background
As the advancements in the field of synthetic biology take place rapidly in recent years, the attention on iGEM is increasing at the mean time. More and more ambitious undergraduates and even high school students are eager to join the iGEM communicity, explore more possibilities in synthetic biology, and contribute to this flourishing area. However, when trying to access more information in synthetic biology, getting a quick check on the previous iGEM programs, or conducting experiments in the laboratory, iGEMers, especially for those in China, always met various troubles which are bafflements on their way to explore iGEM as well as synthetic biology.
·High school students who are interested in biology yet unfamiliar with synthetic biology are baffled by academic papers with recondite terminologies.
·High school students who want to initiate their own research programs find it hard to decide on topics because of the overwhelming informations from countless resources and the uncertainty of the project's practicability.
·New iGEMers looking for inspirations from previous projects are overwhelmed by the vast sea of projects.
·Wet teams in iGEM are having trouble searching for biobricks, since extent biobrick search tools can not yet satisfy their demand.
·Using a script that can add prefix and suffix to the biobricks automatically can make the wet teams' researches more convenient.        ·iGEMers cannot mark and store the biobricks that they consider likely to be useful to their projects in one place.

We distributed questionaires afterwards to make sure they comprehended the talks.  On a larger stage, we participated in the 12th Annual Meeting of the International Conference on Genomics and talked about our iGEM experience. We wrote about our project and documented the progress on several project incubator platforms and receive monetary support for more than 3, 000 USD in total. We also raised questions on the significance of participating in iGEM for high school students on Zhihu (Chinese Quora).

Lambert_GA,2017,Team:Lambert GA#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," of diH2O measurement accounted for the 5uL placed into each experimental tube (15 tubes x 5uL/tube), as well as for any unintentional error when inoculating liquid cultures (extra 20uL of diH2O-cell solution present in microcentrifuge tube). Once all culture tubes were correctly filled with their respective content, they were placed in the shaking-incubator for twenty-four hours, then centrifuged and analyzed.
Proof of Concept Expression Lab Setup
The first experiment produced unfavorable results where, although the cells fluoresced the correct “red” color, there was not a distinctive gradient associated with the incremental IPTG levels. Along with incoherent data, there was obvious contamination where each experimental tube contained arbitrary accumulations of black “dots” in the pellet. The experiment was redone and it was determined the supply of DH10-Beta cells had been outdated and was the cause of contamination. Despite renewing laboratory and biological materials, continued experimentation revealed no fluorescence and, therefore, eluded hypothesized results. At this juncture, it was resolved to purchase and utilize the ATUM Protein Paintbox with the IPTG Inducible T5 Promoter with separate TinselPurple (tsPurple), ScroogeOrange, and VirginiaViolet chromoprotein reporter sequences. Consequently, the above methodology was repeated and expected results were obtained without unusual anomalies or contamination.
Natalie Shih hard at work in the lab.
As hypothesized, there was an observable increase in color expression for all three chromoprotein constructs directly correlated with increasing IPTG levels. The successful experiment was repeated three times for validity. Finally, the visible expression was then quantified using the Lambert iGEM’s Chrome-Q and complimenting mobile app that determines HSV values of specified pictures. These results confirmed the feasibility of the project and engineered machinery for the primary target of aiding underfunded labs in synthetic biology research.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"

Team:ArtScienceBangalore/Notebook/Step 1 - Taking dry DNA from wells
From 2009.igem.org
What Dry DNA? What Wells?
MIT sends DNA kits with the biological parts needed to construct the required bacteria.
There is a specific procedure for 'taking out' the dry DNA from the kit. The DNA is stored in these pits in the box called 'wells' and below is the standard procedure of extracting the required DNA:
1.Making sure the plates are properly oriented, punch a hole through the foil cover using a pipette - into the well you want the DNA from. Don't remove foil cover since it might pose the threat of cross-contamination between wells.
2. Add 15uL of deionized water - diH2O ( Deionised water is purified water from any source that is physically processed to remove impurities)

Hypersensitive responses to the subtilisin enzyme excreted by B. subtilis (which is often found in detergent) is more likely. Standard precautions for handling microorganisms such as proper wearing of gloves to prevent direct contact will help to alleviate this risk.
Of the  few documented cases of B. subtilis infection, the vast majority involved severely immunocompromised patients. Should one of our researchers enter such a state, he or she will not be allowed into the lab and will be expected to rest and seek treatment.
Public Safety
The ultimate aim of our team’s biological system is to perform act as an anti-cancer agent within the human digestive tract. Direct interaction with live human cells is a requirement of its function thus demanding particular considerations for safety. Similar precautions to protect cancer patients for whom the treatment is intended will also help in protecting the public in the off-chance our system enters the environment beyond the lab.
Firstly it must be made clear that no patient exhibiting immunodeficiency or under immunosuppression should be recommended for this treatment or any subsequent approved derivative of this treatment. There is a likelihood these patients will suffer from B. subtilis infection.
B.  subtilis is a known normal gut commensal and is  considered a bacterial species conferring minimal risks to human. It produces no particles considered toxic to humans. Enzymes produced by B. subtilis, including  carbohydrases and proteases contributing to its function as a part of the gut microbiome, are classified ‘Generally Recognized As Safe’ (GRAS) by the FDA.  The species has also been proven to function as a probiotic when consumed in  certain food stuffs, most notably fermented soy bean. No recombined component of our biological system is known to confer negative effects on gut microbiome function.
Two regulatory functions were put in place to control BMP2 production and minimize its potential negative effects. Firstly, the BMP2 construct makes use of a xylose-inducible promoter. This induction system reduces the chance of BMP2 production in any unintended circumstance. Secondly, a cap is placed on maximum BMP2 production per cell by incorporating a toxin-antitoxin cassette that facilitates toxin transcription in direct correlation with BMP2 transcription. This cap is intended to prevent the onset of adverse effects caused by excessive BMP2 signalling. More information on these regulatory functions can be found in"

We studied the below articles for getting an understanding of how to achieve our goals. Having studied each of the articles we had extensive discussions on ""Google Wave"" and during our off-line group meetings.
Initially the idea was along the lines of obtaining band detects as done by Basu etal(See below for further details). However, we realised that the approach used by Basu etal, would only work for AHL. If we or another iGEM team wanted to used some other sensor they would have to again produce mutants of the sensory promoter. These mutants would respond to different concentrations of the input signal. Moreover, we realised that few of these AHL detection sensor mutants where not readily available in the registry.
The brilliant approach used by the iGEM team from Cambridge last year(2009) seemed to hold the answer for our problems. Instead of depending on the sensor for measuring the signal, a separate set of elements would do the part of measurement. However, a linear relationship between the sensor and the measuring element would be necessary. We decided to combine the idea used by Basu etal and the 2009 iGEM team from Cambridge using the parts available to us in the registry.
An inverter was readily available for us to invert the signal. This inverter is used in combination with a measuring element which gets activated at a lower level of sensory input. As soon as the input signal is strong enough to activate the inverter, the reporter inhibitor is deactivated. The higher level of the sensory input directly controls another reporter inhibitor.

Analysis
To prove the accuracy of kinetic equations of the related domains, we stacked the related equations according to the sequence of DEBS 1. When establishing the kinetic model of domain, we got into trouble. According to the analysis of reaction mechanism and kinetic equation we show before, the initial value of the kinetic equations on second AT domain depends on the concentration of DEBS 1, that is, the result of the kinetic equations on Module 2 are not affected by the result of previous domains.
However, if we have a further simplified model in which the second AT domain is ignored, the whole kinetic model stacked will be affected by the whole DEBS 1, including Loading, Module 1, Module 2.
Therefore, we establish two kinetic models stacked, and compare them with each other. Then we compare them with the kinetic model of the whole DEBS 1.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," measures as for example working with organisms of safety level three or four and using parts from organisms of a safety level of four is completely forbidden. Also, every team has to fill in a safety sheet that requires profound reflection on the topics biosafety and biosecurity (iGEM Foundation, 2018).
Despite most questions dealing with the first-mentioned, the questionnaire also asks about DURC training the iGEM teams might have got. One question also asks about the safety, security and ethical risks the projects might trigger (iGEM Foundation, 2018).
This shows indeed that biosafety and biosecurity have high relevance for iGEM but still DURC issues are not considered long-term. It would be useful providing biosecurity material when iGEM teams register. It has not escaped our noticed that our provided presentation slides about DURC could be used for this purpose!
Legal Situation: An Industrial Perspective
How does the life science industry handle biosecurity issues?
As an iGEM sponsor and provider of gene syntheses we asked Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) about dealing with biosecurity issues. Gene syntheses can potentially be misused to generate hazardous organisms. IDT is one of five founding members of the International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC) and was involved in the development of The “Harmonized Screening Protocol”. This protocol is applied to every sequence order to prevent the misuse of synthetic genes. For their gBlocks Gene Fragments IDT uses this protocol to screen every ordered sequence for regulated and possibly pathogenic sequences. Besides, IDT verifies that their customers are legitimate scientists and ensures that they are involved in beneficial research (Integrated DNA Technologies, 2018).
Legal Situation: Germany
Starting locally, we examined the situation in Germany. Currently, there are no regulations and controls concerning the content of publications here. For this reason, it is important to promote a sense of responsibility from the very beginning of the scientific education. Carelessness of the scientific community could lead to misuse of research. This could entail harsh regulations from the politics and a restriction of free science. If every scientist is accordingly educated and acts in a responsible manner such excessive regulations can be avoided in the future. This issue is very important to protect the society as well as the public trust scientists and scientific institutions rely upon.
First Approaches in Germany: A Commission for Ethics of DURC
In 2014, the German Research Foundation (DFG) published together with the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina recommendations on how to deal with DURC. These recommendations state that research institutions draft ethical rules for dealing with D"

Duquesne Ethics Forum
http://www.duq.edu/academics/schools/natural-and-environmental-sciences/opportunities-and-activities/undergraduate-research-program/ethics-forum
Ethical considerations are a significant portion of any new, developing field, especially synthetic biology. The Pitt iGEM Team believes our best recommendations for the future can be found amongst ethical case studies of the past. To this effect, the Pitt iGEM Team participated in the 2014 Duquesne Ethics Forum, where we presented a case study of the Holmesburg Prison Experiments, unethically conducted by Dr. Albert Kligman from 1951 to 1974.
Our case shows that despite numerous guidance documents, such as the Helsinki and Nuremburg codes, Dr. Kligman was still able to operate without much oversight. In Dr. Kligman’s words, “Informed consent was unheard of. No one asked me what I was doing. It was a wonderful time.” Even when the public discovered how prisoners at Holmesburg were routinely infected with warts, herpes, and staphylococcus, or how the prisoners’ backs were “patched” with dozens of unknown chemicals, Dr. Kligman (along with sponsoring government agencies) faced few repercussions for their complete disregard for medical ethics. Dr. Kligman avoided any implications of medical misconduct by blatantly deleting his results.
Thankfully, the creation of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), has provided the necessary oversight to enforce ethical guidelines, such as the NIH Code of Federal Regulations for Human Trials. However, the Pitt iGEM Team believes there is more to the story. Prior to the Holmesburg experiments, medical ethics were not taught in medical school, which made it easier for Dr. Kligman’s associates to turn a blind eye. In that light, our recommendation to the scientific community is to promote and encourage the study of ethics in university curricula, as it pertains to synthetic biology.

As part of our Human Practices, we wanted to expand our horizons towards an international frame. Which are the most relevant international GMOs' protocols that apply to our project? What is a Genetically Modified Organisms Environmental Risk Assesment and how is it executed? How can our team change the way synthetic biology is understood and practiced around the world? How is it our project affected by this international frame? Trough our United Nations activities we were able to address this questions.

Dr. Mercedes invited us to collaborate with her team in the Genetically Modified Organisms Environmental Risk Assessment guide by helping in its translation to Spanish, making able for their work to reach Spanish speaking people.
Dr. Mercedes invited us to join Saúl Pizarro and her at the COP 14 as members of Youth Biotech, an international group of young leaders who are interested in the development of science communication, policy making, and biotechnology regulation.
Dr. Mercedes will present this guide at the Fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14)  in Egypt.
She recommended us to base our Integrated Human Practices in the United Nations’ three dimensions for a sustainable development: Economic, Environmental and Social. On the social aspect, she recommended us to include our projects’ ethical and legal aspects.
She suggested us to talk about a complex; there is not a complete understanding nor a single reason why bees are disappearing, it might be due to various diseases, malnutrition, insecticides, is a complex of reasons. Our project won't solve the problem, but it will contribute to managing the Colony Collapse Disorder.
Is very common to tend to talk about human rights, but these are not the only rights that have to be worth, the environment should have his rights just for its intrinsic value.
She also advised us in our United Nations’ three dimensions approach.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"A Assembly (Knight, 2003) . This means that the distance between promoter and
RBS
is not changed and therefore we do not expect negative effects in transcription or translation. Moreover, we hope that creating the same scar with a different method will make our experimental data more comparable to the data acquired with plasmids assembled with 3A Assembly in previous iGEM projects. The next bases were integrated between
RBS
and
CDS
parts. The fusion site, which was adapted from the PhytoBrick system, AATG and TAATC was added upstream of it. Previous work has shown that the sequence between a
RBS
and the start codon dramatically affects the expression of the desired protein (Lentini et al. 2013). A spacer length of six base pairs was shown to result in the strongest expression. When comparing different bases in a six bp spacer, the experimental data indicate significant differences. The 3A Assembly scar results in 50 % expression strength compared to the sequence TAATCT which was referred to as the reference (Lentini et al. 2013). We chose to use the spacer sequence which is expected to result in highest expression as we think that a system that is designed to enable strongest expression can be easily adapted for low expression by using weak
RBS
or promoters while going to the opposite direction might be more difficult. Unfortunately, we could not adapt the exact “reference sequence” because the first A in the fusion site AATG is already part of the spacer. Eventually, we used the first five bases of the strongest spacer  (Lentini et al. 2013) upstream of the fusion site.
Figure 4: Additional bases and fusion sites ensure correct spacing and allow tags
Between some parts, additional base pairs were integrated to ensure correct spacing and to maintain the triplet code. We expanded our toolbox by providing N- and C- terminal tags by creating novel fusions and splitting the
CDS
and terminator part, respectively.
Close attention has to be paid to fusion sites that connect two sequences which are translated like the
CDS
part or N- and C- terminal Tags. A fusion site in our system consists of four bases which would result in disrupting the triplet code. To prevent mistranslated proteins, two additional bases have to be added to create a six bp scar that results in two translated amino acids. These can be seen as linkers between the joined
CDS
parts or tags. We decided to preferably use amino acids that are abundant in natural or synthetic flexible linkers like glyc"

Use the sequence of the DNA you’re working with and the goals of the experiment you’re working on to determine which restriction enzyme you need to use. Different enzymes require different buffers to work. You can use the New England Biolabs website to decide which buffers to use and what temperatures to heat inactivate your enzymes at. Restriction enzymes are incredibly expensive, so please check with a senior team member before doing a restriction digest to confirm you’re using the correct enzymes and buffers. KEEP THE RESTRICTION ENZYME ON ICE AT ALL TIMES!!! KEEP IN THE FREEZER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!
1) In a PCR tube, add 1ug of the DNA you want to digest. This is a measurement of weight, so you need to do a little math based on the concentration of the vector DNA to figure out how many uL this translates to.
2) Add 5uL of the 10X NEB Buffer you selected to match the restriction enzyme you’re using.
3) Add 1uL of the restriction enzyme.
4) Add ddH2O until total volume is 50uL
5) Close the tube, then flick it a few times gently to mix the contents.
6) Incubate for 1 hour at the temperature specified by the restriction enzyme you’re using.
7) If the restriction enzyme you’re using says to heat inactivate, heat the reaction at the required temperature.
Ligation
Ligation lets you take a strand of DNA that has compatible sticky ends (usually from a restriction digest) and insert it into a vector (usually a plasmid).
1) Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in.
2) Add 2uL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube.
3) Add 50ng of the vector DNA to the tube. This is a measurement of weight, so you need to do a little math based on the concentration of the vector DNA to figure out how many uL this translates to.
4) Add 37.5ng of the insert DNA to the tube. This is also a measurement of weight, so you need to do a little math based on the concentration of the vector DNA to figure out how"

We have also found articles that describe how GANs were used to generate novel anti-cancer drug molecules that were not tested before, and proven to be effective alter on.
Deep down we already knew the question we wanted to ask - can we generate novel enzymes using the Generative Adversarial Networks?
Setting the goals
Despite the recent success of GANs in various field, to the best of our knowledge, no one attempted to apply this novel technique to proteins. In a way, it can be explained by the great complexity of such task. In order to proceed, one would need to re-design the architecture of GAN networks that work well with images and audio, to architecture that works well with sequences of amino acids.
This is why we have decided to create the world first Generative Adversarial Networks for Enzymatic Sequence generation.
We believe that the development of such framework will facilitate the discovery of novel and useful enzymes and accelerate the field of synthetic biology and protein engineering immensely."
Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," are a little different from DNA sequencing machines.  To scale up our efforts, we need to incorporate more teams and get everyone working together.
In response to this challenge we, along with iGEMers from the 2011 teams at Arizona State, Cornell, University of Panama, UTP Panama, and UQ-Australia, have created a website on OpenWetWare called CommunityBricks                             ( http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM_Outreach ). The site will be a growing repository of ideas for synthetic biologyinspired activities, course plans, and educational media to improve the scope and quality of synthetic biology outreach efforts. We have already posted the protocols for a few fun activities on the site, such as how to make a DNA  necklace or create a DIY gel electrophoresis machine.  However, there is still an enormous space for creativity, and  to that end, we would like to turn to you. As the summer progresses and you begin to think about outreach efforts,  we hope that you will not only use and adapt these ideas when sharing synthetic biology with your own community,  but also share your own: to contribute to the website by adding activities and lesson plans, commenting on outreach ideas proposed by other iGEM teams, and recording your outreach experiences with videos and pictures.
The Brown-Stanford iGEM is proud to be part of this inter-team collaboration!
AlumniGEM
AlumniGEM is a new platform for connecting past, present and future members of iGEM. The mission statement of this website can be demonstrated in a simple exercise: take a look at the picture above, from the 2010 Jamboree at MIT. Imagine standing in that crowd (or perhaps you were there), looking up towards the camera man in the balcony- how many of those around you do you know? New friends, old acquaintances, brought together in an action-packed weekend to celebrate each other’s hard work and great ideas, but after that amazing weekend, how many will you keep in touch with? How many will you see again?
Baking a Community Cake
According to social group theory, the recipe for making a community is very simple:
Add equal parts shared activities (a summer spent elbow-to-pipetting elbow)
and mutual interest (What? You have an account on PLoS too? I just looove reading about cerevisiae);
a liter of adversity (sleep and food? How can you think about such extravagant things when the wiki is closing down in ten hours?)
a generous scoop of good time
and a pinch of magic.

Database
Data Collection
The database was built to meet the needs of synthetic biology and genetic circuit building by offering literature references, storage, maintenance and upload of genetic devices as well as SBML text files for network data exchange.1 Genetic circuit information is not easily extracted from papers making it difficult to begin any genetic device construction. SBiDer provides a centralized library of relevant genetic circuit references in the form of pubmed id’s so that synthetic biologists can quickly and easily access experimentally backed information. Outsourcing the literature search to SBiDer gives synthetic biologists an interface with reliably relevant information. As well as providing literature references, SBiDer extracts the necessary details of each genetic device so that synthetic biologists can build devices using essential genetic building blocks. As a means of further involving the biology community, SBML data exchange files for our genetic parts and SBiDer network are accessible by using the SBiDer API. Using SBML provides further data analysis of the SBiDer network by taking advantage of approximately 200 SBML supported softwares such as Cytoscape, Systems Biology Workbench and more (www.cytoscape.org) (http://sbw.kgi.edu/research/sbwintro.htm) (www.sbml.org).
Figure 1. Plasmids used to create a genetic circuit know as μBE (Hoon Hong, 2012).
Petri Net and Schema Design
This project integrated the Petri net model by describing interactions between species and operons. Species act as input for operon activation and output. In the context of biology, a simple genetic circuit is broken down into operons, and operons can be broken down into their components: promoters, regulating elements, and coding sequences. Combining the biology and Petri net formalism, genetic device information is captured and makes for a database schema that innately captures a network of genetic device interactions. The Petri net model inspired schema works by atomizing the necessary genetic circuit information so the parts necessary for genetic circuit design are represented. Operons and species are represented as equivalents of Petri net chemical species while the interaction of species with operons and the production of species by operons is represent by input and output transitions namely. Genetic circuit design is now formalized for the biology community under the Petri net model and stored inside the SBiDer database.

Filmed a biosafety video together with other 12 teams
Biosafety is one of the most important knowledge everyone should master before starting their experiments. Unluckily, biosafety education in China is far too lagged behind compared with the exploding need; not only because of the out-dated education material but also due to the language problem accessing such resources overseas.
We’ve taken part in an intercollegiate cooperation project to produce series of Biosafety education materials in Chinese. With the tremendous amount of work of our collaborating partners and our team members, the video collection was finally published online and freely available at our homepage on YouTube and Bilibili, a popular Chinese video-sharing website.
12 teams gathered together to film a biosafety video, every team took different topics, but all based on Yale biosafety manual.
Our theme is about transportation of biological materials.

Aquí se emplean un modelo matemático de este sistema para generar las predicciones sobre el comportamiento de los activos del sistema en respuesta a la luz de entrada. Características del sistema que el modelo puede ayudar a investigar incluyen la escala de tiempo de respuesta a las señales de luz, la solidez del sistema en respuesta a las fluctuaciones en la intensidad de la luz, y la traducción entre los cambios en la expresión génica y la absorbancia del espectro de la ingeniería de células.
Aunque el contexto del modelo puede extenderse a la transcripción de EPRR / B genes implicados en la integración de oxígeno y señales luminosas, un primer modelo de prueba fue desarrollado utilizando las hipótesis de determinadas condiciones iniciales para aislar el efecto de la señal luminosa.

Citrobacter freundii Characterisation:
Replicon compatibility
To even consider a new chassis for synthetic biology (and especially iGEM), it should first of all be able to replicate the various types of plasmids that are used to insert genes/BioBricks into it. To test this, our C. freundii was transformed with several plasmids containing the most commonly used replicons. The transformations were done according to standard protocol written for E. coli and the transformants were plated out onto media as indicated in Table 1 and shown in Figure 1.
Table 1 - Replicon compatibility media and results
Figure 1 - Plates containing E. coli or Citrobacter freundii transformed with plasmids that have different replicons. Note that the top row shows Citrobacter freundii cells and the bottom row shows E. coli cells, except for the first plates in each row, which are switched around, for colour comparison.
These results show that all but one of the plasmids have successfully been transformed into both E. coli and C. freundii, therefore these replicons are compatible with C. freundii.

These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

Tsinghua University Lecture Day
On October 16th, we gave a lecture to the public in Tsinghua University. More than sixty Students of different majors and different grades all joined our lecture and participated in our heat discussion about bioethics and experimental safety.
First, Teng Li, the leader of our team, introduced the basic concept and central principles of synthetic biology. We are rather glad that a small part of participants already have knowledge of this subject and have paid some special attention to this field, not only students majoring in life science, but also those from other departments. Then we focused on the introduction of iGEM competition. The origin of the competition, the development history and some well-done projects, were all included in this section. The standard parts were particularly pointed out in our lecture, for it’s the central spirit of this competition. Most audiences were greatly fascinated by synthetic biology and iGEM competition, which really encouraged us.
After the introduction, another student of our team, Yunxiao Zhang, gave a presentation of our project to all the participants. He generally described the aim of our project, the experimental design and the results we have got as well. Questions and very good advices were proposed, which we really appreciate. Thank you very much!
Then we iGEM team members and all the other participants had a heat discussion, mainly emphasize on the public health and safety of products from synthetic biology"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," self-regulation by scientists acting as their own experts might be the better solution. But self-regulation only works if every scientist is aware of DURC issues and its communication. This can only be achieved if it is part of their university education. Therefore, we want to underline the relevance of dealing with this topic.
Biosecurity in the Context of iGEM – Relevance
When participating in the iGEM competition, it is necessary to deal with Dual Use and biosecurity issues. Most participants in the competition get in touch with research for the first time through iGEM. That is why iGEM has the potential of being a role model for the scientific community by providing education and raising awareness for biosecurity concerns and the minimization of its risks.
Each year, over 45 countries and nearly 6000 students participate in the iGEM competition and thus its influence is enormous (iGEM Foundation, 2018). In addition, all results are open source. Consequently, everybody with an access to the web can get all information about every project. Due to this enormous impact and the fact that all results will be published it is important that all participants are aware of the terms “Dual Use” and “Dual Use Research of Concern” and their communication.
Most attendees, including ourselves, were uninformed about biosecurity when starting their research and heard about this topic the first time when they have already started their project. We think this is way too late.
Legal Situations: Different Areas, different Approaches
Legal Situation: iGEM Perspective
""At iGEM we take the risk that others might misuse our work and resources to cause deliberate harm very seriously. We have robust programs designed to ensure that we help enable local people to address local challenges both safely and securely. Leading technical bodies, such as the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, have suggested that almost all modern biotechnology could be used for both good and for harm."" – Dr. Piers Millet, iGEM Vice President of Safety and Security
The iGEM Headquarters (iGEM HQ) strongly emphasizes the importance of biosafety and biosecurity. One problem is the internationality of the competition. iGEM HQ must ensure that US rights are observed but also the teams should be able to successfully participate in countries with different laws. Teams must completely agree on safety and security policies from iGEM HQ to be accepted for the finals in Boston. The high safety measures as for example working with organisms of safety level three or four and using parts from organisms of a safety level of four is completely forbidden. Also,"

Berlin,2014,Team:Berlin#Project cn_-_-_TEXT.html," oxygen atoms. Between species ferritins have different affinity for phosphate. Phosphate is low in animal ferritin iron minerals (Fe:P = 8:1) whereas in bacterial and plant ferritins iron minerals are usually occurring in higher relations (Fe:P = 1:1).[1]       Mössbauer studies on the superparamagnetic character of bacterioferritins (bfr) revealed that the phosphate concentration in a ferritin iron mineral reduces superparamegntic effects heavily due to replacement of the iron bridges between the iron atoms with phosphate. As these bridges have a lower exchange constant the order temperature is reduced further. [2]       The hollow ferritin nanocages are used in the chemical industry as scaffolds for synthesis of magnetite particles as well as for delivery of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, drug delivery and catalysis.

During our summer we collected a variety of ferritin-coding sequences from bacterial and mammalian sources. As ferritins are common among all organisms we categorized our ferritins in three major groups. (Table)
3.4 Inclusion body Strategy
By talking to the Fussenegger group from the ETH Zurich, who published the superparamagnetism paper about ferritins we got the tip to look for another strategy as they experienced the limitations of ferritins. [1]       For this reason, we came up with a different strategy. Park et al came up with a different strategy for the synthesis of biogenic nanoparticles in E. coli. [2] A strategy where they produced impressive results showing one strategy to synthesize a whole array of diverse nanoparticles with E. coli.

The acidification of the supernatant (g) in (d) serves as a purification, that is, the                             Nanobodies is separated from the supernatant, so the total protein concentration decreased                             significantly and the relative abundance of Nanobodies increased significantly.
After processing, the molecular weight of the Nanobody can be calculated to be about 18 KDa.
Nanobody concentration determination
Fig.3. Protein concentration - absorbance standard curve
Based on the standard curve of protein concentration and then based on the molecular weight                             of the nanobody measured by electrophoresis, we can determine the concentration of the                             Nanobody for further experiments.
We measured the absorbance of three groups of protein concentrations:
$$ y_1 = 0.520,\quad y_2 = 0.536,\quad y_3 = 0.495 \quad \mathrm{(Abs)}$$
According to the standard curve, the corresponding concentration was obtained.
$$ c_1=392.7,\quad c_2=410.9,\quad c_3=363.2 \quad \mathrm{(μg/mL)}$$
Liquid crystal verification section
We designed a liquid crystal cell as an observation supporter. First, the upper glass slide                             was modified with 0.2%DMOAP to induce the vertical alignment of the liquid crystals and make                             the optical imaging of liquid crystals appear black at the first time.Meanwhile, we modified                             the lower slide with a mixture solution of 3% (v) APTES and 1% (v) DMOAP and 1% (v) GA, so                             that it could connect to the target protein. Then We mixed the sample with the antibody and                             added it to the modified slide. Finally, the upper and lower slides were assembled, and then                             the liquid crystals were added. We could observe the optical imaging of the liquid crystals                             pool under the microsco-pe, so as to determine the concentration of β2-MG of the                             sample. The following paragraphs are the results of our investigation on the fixed antigen                             and antibody concentration, and the brightne-ss contrast of β2-MG nano-antibody                             modified by C18 and the normal β2-MG nano-antibody combined with the liquid                             crystal.

After iGEM"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," integrating our BioBrick. This “loss of function” strategy would allow us to determine which cells were successfully transformed.  After much research, we narrowed down the potential receiving loci to amyE, SacA, thrC, and lacA.   Meanwhile, we prepared more agar plates containing Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin as our initial supply was running low. Much to our relief, we later received an email from iGEM headquarters stating that our requested parts were in transit.
Week 7: June 9 - 13
This week consisted of ligations and the confirmation thereof. First, colony PCR was conducted on existing RFP transformed colonies to confirm their viability for the genetic circuit which is to be assembled the following week. Fortunately, all of the six colonies which were screened turned out to be successful. Following the confirmation of the RFP colonies, Pveg + RBS ligations were created and transformed into the competent Top 10 E. coli. stocks at hand. One out of several colonies was successful. A confirmation digest was performed on the successful colony following a plasmid mini-prep, and for reasons unknown, the results were negative.
A single successful Pveg + RBS colony was deemed insufficient for our purposes, thus a second, identical ligation was conducted on new E. coli. stock. Meanwhile, another colony PCR was performed on the first ligation, and all tested colonies were ultimately negatives. Fortunately, two of the newly ligated were determined to be successful, ensuring ample Pveg + RBS stock for future use.
We began to prepare our B. subtilis 1A976 (comK) cells for transformation, following the protocol outlined by Zhang et al. (ref). We made 1% (w/v) xylose solution in LB, as xylose induces the comK promoter to generate supercompentency in B. subtilis. We inoculated LB (containing erythromycin and lincomycin) with the B. subtilis cells and shook them overnight (37°C). The protocol suggested an incubation period of around 12 hours, but we found that optimal cell density required a slightly longer period in the incubator/shaker. We adapted the protocol to fit our needs, and decided upon a shaking period of 18 hours.
The protocol required the dilution of our liquid cell cultures with 1% xylose solution until an absorbance reading of 1.0 at A600 was achieved. We made several replicates of these cultures and generated a reference curve involving change in absorbance reading as a function"

The company advised us to use a well-known probiotic, such as L. rhamnosus, since its benefits have been well studied and its good acceptance by the human body is known. On the other hand, they advised us to use E. coli only to test our work before passing it on to L. rhamnosus since it would be easier to test its functioning first in E. coli.

Panel with experts, students, and parents
Insights: Target. The panel helped us identify new groups of people vulnerable to these diseases, we adapted our product and market studies according to the new information recollected.
Changes:The community presented more interest not only on the topic, but in our project.
Resume:
The team decided to invite three expert psychologists in education, systemic family therapy and student affairs to a panel that aimed to talk about depression from an integral angle to the students, teachers and parents of our university. The event was held in the congress center of our university and was planned based on the idea of a coffee talk. At the beginning of the event the project of our team was presented and a brief introduction of the event was given to put in context those present. Subsequently, the experts talked about definitions, myths, truths and situations in particular of depression and anxiety. Finally, there was a time for attendees to express their doubts or share their experiences.           From this event, we realized that depression not only affects people with low economic resources, who have had some loss or suffer from another serious illness, but that all those exposed to stress become vulnerable to develop a disorder depressed or anxious, like students. This helped us along with our market studies to define the audience to which our product would be directed.

Human Practices
Bioethics of Genetic Engineering
With all of the cynicism and spectacle regarding genetic engineering in the mainstream media, for the human practices portion of our project we wanted to educate the general public on what synthetic biology really is and what it has the capabilities to do. We created an informational video giving some facts and expert opinions on synthetic biology to inform those without a scientific background and hopefully reduce the stigma. We researched the history of synthetic biology, starting with selectively breeding crops for a higher output, interviewed Northeastern University bioengineering and ethics professors, and interviewed synthetic biologists at Joslin Diabetes Center who are studying aging in the nematode C. elegans. The video aims to diminish the dramatic representation of biological engineering in the media and cultivate more thoughtful opinions towards it, because in the future our world will be influenced greatly by the possibilities genetic engineering has to offer. The following clip is a trailer for the full length video.

    PCA sorted the data after analysis, and the top 10 are showed here because 61 data are too much. The first five genes with the proportion greater than 0.2 are experimentally verified. The experimental results show that LLNZ_RS02280 (msmK) has the best anti-acid capability. This is almost identical to the direct experimental validation from 61 common differential genes.
    With these two principal components, we improved the accuracy of the result to 0.98. Although LLNA_RS02280 (msmK) is not the first in the model, it is in the top five, which shows that the model still has great reference.

    Now that the acid-resistant component is obtained, it is not enough for scientific research. We also need to explore the mechanism of acid resistance. This model attempts to analyze the mechanisms through GO analysis and pathway analysis. Here we analyze the data of 266 deferentially expressed genes. GO analysis shows that deferentially expressed genes are mainly involved in catalytic activity, binding activity in molecular function and metabolic process, cellular process in biological process. And pathway analysis shows that deferentially expressed genes are mainly involved in amino acid biosynthesis, metabolic pathways,"

Conclusion
In our human practice, we went to ministry of science and technology of the the people’s republic of china to talk with Dr. Wei Yang, and we discussed about the safety of our project in detail. In addition, we also communicated with the Chinese experts in the field of food online, we did a full investigation and understanding in biosafety. We believe that no investigation, no right to speak. We organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to make a big chat about what we had done. Further to make our project more reasonable, and good for the world.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the"

Semi-stable transfection of the receptors in human cells
For the first trials of testing our constructs in human cells, we chose the MEXi™ cell line for semi-stable transfection.  MEXi™ is a suspension HEK293E cell line by iba lifesciences that encodes the viral protein EBNA1 in it's genome. EBNA1, being a protein derived from Eppstein-Barr-Virus that mediates the viruses' replication initiation, gene regulation and maintenance of its DNA in the host cell. The second part of the MEXi™ system is made up by the pDSG-IBA vector that carries the specific origin of replication that is recognized by EBNA1. EBNA1 binds to this origin, and recruits the replication apparatus as well as inducing the maintenance of the inserted DNA in the host's nucleus, leading to the episomal maintenance and co-replication of the plasmid during every division cycle. [14]
Thus, we cloned our receptor constructs into the pDSG-iGEM vector and then transfected the MEXi cells using the PEI transfection method (see methods). Polyethylene imin (PEI) as a cationic polymer forms complexes with the negatively charged DNA. These complexes are taken up by the cell via endocytosis and carried to the nucleus. [15]

An everlasting bond: creating  a stable cell line
Fig.7
Printing tissues - or even only parts of organs - requires billions and bilions of cells. An average liver, for example, weighs about three pounds and hosts ~108 cells per gram tissue. [16] [17] Since transiently and even semi-stably transfected cells do not propagate the transfected DNA indefinitely, repeated transfection of cells would be unwise due to the high consumption of time and ressources. Therefore, we created three stable cell lines that chromosomally encode the respective receptor constructs. For this purpose we used the FlpIn™-System by invitrogen. The three compound system consists of HEK-TRex™-293 cells that harbour one chromosomal Flp re"

File:Muc 3dprintingindustry 001.pdf ""Researchers at the Germany’s Technical University of Munich presented their biotINK project at the International Genetically Engineered Machine 2016 Giant Jamboree in Boston on October 29. BiotINK aims to make printing complex 3D cellular structures cheaper, easier and faster by using a new technique that creates inks using biotin (vitamin B7) and streptavidin, a protein harvested from bacteria.
The Issue with Tissue
The traditional process for growing artificial tissue relies on scaffolding, since this technique allows cells to be held in place while they develop. In this process the 3D printed grid like structure, made of PLA normally, is seeded with organic cells that slowly grow throughout all the structure filling all the internal spaces. As the organic cells multiply, eventually the scaffold degrades or is removed, leaving behind only the organic tissue.
There have been recent advances this bioprinting method, such as a new proposal for bioreactors from Greek scientists. In any case, scaffolding has its limitations; it is costly, the cell maturation process takes a long time and has certain size limitations.
Team Munich’s Idea
The researchers, lead by Dr. Arne Skerra, propose a new method using desktop 3D printers to print organic 3D cellular structures. The method arranges two different type of components (genetically engineered cells and proteins) into a structure that quickly polymerizes creating a rigid structure. This two components are linked by a very strong bonding reaction, also found in nature, called the biot"

SilkyColi: Reprogramming the physical and functional properties of synthetic silks
Human Practices
In addition to our laboratory work exploring the vast usefulness and potential properties of silk, we were strongly inspired to look at the societal and environmental implications of our actions.
Discussing the Potentials of Silk in Industry - Interview with David Breslauer, CSO and Co-Founder of Bolt Threads
First, we were motivated to discuss the societal implications of our research outside of the “iGEM” space.  Namely, we wanted to hear from members in industry how work with silks can transform and revolutionize the field of manufacturing high performance fibers.  We were fortunate enough to meet with David Breslauer, CSO and Co-Founder of Bolt Threads, a start-up company determined to bring high performance synthetic silks to the market using yeast as a model organism.  In our interview and tour of their facility, we learned a great deal about the implications of our silk as a product that could shape an entirely new output of novel materials for defense and biomedical purposes.  He expressed that not only could our work we useful for synthetic biology applications, but could also yield a product that is highly useful for social purposes.
Additionally, below is an interview with Breslauer discussing the social, ethical, and economical implications of research into genetically engineering organisms  to produce high performance fibers.  Check it out!

Improve a previous part or project
We improve a part encoding the Mtr CAB proteins ( BBa_K1316012 ). In other iGEM teams, they only used Mtr CAB to transfer cytoplasm electrons to the outer space. But we improve its function, proving that this Mtr CAB can transfer extracellular electrons back into the cytoplasm. It means that Mtr CAB can transfer electrons bidirectionally. This is a great improvement for Mtr CAB’s function! Besides, we also add a His-tag and two restriction sites( Xho1 and Nde1 ) to the sequence for easier cloning.

Model your project
We built several models in our project to demonstrate and simulate different aspects and process of our system. Furthermore, we can use it to guide our experiments' design and predict our experiments' results.
Firstly, we built a DLA model by fundamental physics laws to demonstrate the crystallization process of the semi-conductor on the membrane of E.coli. And we used quantum mechanics rules to prove the feasibility of our design and calculated the efficiency of our photo-electron transform happened in our system.
Secondly, we successfully simulated the electron flux between cathode and cytoplasm with Markov process and electric circuit. Both of these two models successfully predicted our experiment results.
In the end, we built an universal platform to simulate the expression process of any protein regulated by quorum sensing(QS) system, which is widely used in synthetic biology. By using basic biochemical reaction rate laws, we simulated the expression process of any protein based on its property, and helped us to choose the proper concentration of inducer.

Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge HS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"products of carbon black production are plentiful. We decided to combat this problem by producing a colorant of our own. We chose to produce four pigments in the colors cyan, magenta, yellow and black. These are made from different plant and bacteria genes using synthetic biology (Figure 2).
Figure 1: The process of carbon black production as a byproduct of burning petroleum for energy.
Figure 2: Our process of pigment production using synthetic biology and four constructs which will be put into bacterial cultures.
SynthetINK
Our final decision led us to SynthetINK, the environmentally friendly pigment production. We will be creating four pigments that are found in different organisms such as apple trees or petunias. We have selected the genes that will allow us to have the optimal production of pigment from our bacteria and media. Our project is designed to solve the problem of harmful byproducts of ink colorant production, and it does just that. We can produce pigments using synthetic biology and extract and purify them while producing minimal byproducts, which include Carbon dioxide and other cellular debris. Our project will become more applicable as the world shifts more and more towards green energy. As the world starts to move away from burning fossil fuels for energy, the source of carbon black will decrease in demand, while the demand for colorants is ever-increasing. This is where we come in. Our project will be able to fill the need for colorants and that is where it will be most applicable. Our business plan and market analysis showed us that as it stands we would not be able to make our project into a company on our own as we cannot compete with the market giants, but if we were able to somehow sell or licence our technology to a company then we might be able to get our project out early into use in the large industry. For more information concerning the business plan, click here ."
KU_Leuven,2017,Team:KU Leuven#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," ready to continue to the next steps. 
In the meantime, we have become more familiar with the plate reader: Perkin-Elmer Victor X4. First, we aimed to measure the OD600 reference point. For this, we used the closest available filter, at 595nm. Next, we calibrated the plate reader and prepared the fluorescein fluorescence standard curve. For this, we prepared the plate according to the protocol and measured the fluorescence using two different programs: Fluororescine 1s and Fluorescine 0.1s. Unfortunately, no further modes or options were available. The best results were obtained using the Fluorescine 0.1s program, and we used these settings for the further experiments. 
We then selected two colonies from each plate and grew them overnight in LB medium containing chloramphenicol to activate the resistance marker. During this step, we were assisted by the iGEM Little Snazzy Man. Thank you, US AFRL CarrollHS team! The next morning, we continued with the cell measurement protocol. Our cells were diluted based on the OD600 measured in a spectrophotometer.
We also shared our adventures with the iGEM Little Snazzy Man on our instagram page.
We then immediately collected the samples after 2, 4 and 6 hours. They were kept on ice until the OD and fluorescence were measured using the plate reader. The obtained results are shown in figure 1.
Figure 1: The results of the measurements for the Interlab study. On the left, the mean fluorescence value, corrected for both background signal and the OD of the samples, is plotted for each device. The line colors indicate the different devices, while the error bars indicate the standard error based on the two biological duplicates (originating from different colonies), each measured in four duplicates. On the right, the mean fluorescence value is shown, corrected only for background signal, not for the OD of the samples.
All data has been shared with the iGEM HQ and we are happy to have contributed to the interlab study! We hope these results can help improving the measurement tools available to labs worldwide.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Functionalizing Silk Fibers
To give functionality to our fibers, we will be genetically fusing various proteins onto our silks. In effect, these fusion proteins will have dual function: that of the fused protein as well as that of natural silk protein assembly. Areas like medicine, art, and the fashion industry could immensely benefit from incorporating these dynamic fusion proteins into their current practices.
To begin with, we will fuse Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) onto the silk. This will not only be a proof of concept for future experiments, but it will produce a tangible product. Converting this product into, say, a glowing silk t-shirt, is only a couple steps away.
Next we will attach streptavidin to our silk. Streptavidin is a well-characterized protein useful in molecular biology for its high affinity towards its binding partner, biotin. Both proteins and small molecules can be ""biotinylated,"" allowing them to bind to streptavidin, or in our case, the streptavidin-silk fusion. A simple test we can do to verify this fusion protein is indeed being formed involves biotinylated GFP to act as a visual indicator. After this, we can even try biotinylating enzymes that can function in the body. Silk is ideal in drug delivery as it is sturdy yet biodegradable, and it can act as a scaffold for these enzymes to work in humans."
MSU-Michigan,2017,Team:MSU-Michigan#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Thankfully our bacteria is non-pathogenic and the modifications we made would not be harmful, except possibly the addition of spectinomycin resistance.  Despite the safety of our organism we also made sure that our bioreactors would be safe in an environment and would be nearly fool proof.  With the reactor being almost entirely sealed, except the injection port which is usually sealed, they are safe in the environment.  After discussing our project for a while with the attendees we sat down and had small round table forum style discussions on many topics ranging from wiping out mosquitoes to using genetically engineered bacteria to produce spider silk.  The discussions were informative and heartfelt from some of the attendees.  We ended up leaving the Center with a much better understanding of the public's view and the public left with a better understanding of genetic engineering.

USTC,2018,Team:USTC#Model#Performance evaluation_-_-_TEXT.html," start time of observable GFP signal and the duration time of GFP signal and NicA2 high expression. At last, according to simulation results, we propose the end time of degradation reaction as the reference to experiment design.
GFP is the fluorescent signal which means the existence of an amount of nicotine in the medium, so we first analyze the process of GFP signal production and attenuation. Figure 7 shows that the variation of time for reaching 100 a.u. is small among different groups and the average time is shorter than 5 min. However, the time for signal complete attenuation (under detection limit) varies a lot which increases greatly with more nicotine input. About the time for reaching maximal GFP intensity, it is interesting that more nicotine input and stronger promoter 1 may lead to longer period for GFP signal maximization, because more Vppa expression means more 6-Hydroxynicotine produced initially to release hdnoR repression quickly. Then we calculate the time interval, which is set to be the time for GFP intensity above 95% GFP maximum, for measuring GFP max intensity. The time interval changes a lot among various nicotine input and the maximal timespan is about 700 min.
Figure 7 Heat-map of signal start time
Figure 8 Signal stop time with s1, nicotine
Figure 9 Heat-map of signal max time
Figure 10 Signal max duration with s1, nicotine
The second signal is AHL molecule synthesized by LuxI. The lowest concentration of AHL to activate the transcription of Lux pR is about 0.1 nM, so we calculate the time in which AHL stays in a functional concentration. For nicotine input is lower than 0.1 M, the functional timespan is about 500-1000 min. With higher nicotine input, the state in functional AHL amount can last for over 2500 min.
Figure 11 Functional AHL duration heat-map
Figure 12 Product max time vs s1, nicotine
In the last part, to collect the final product 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine in highest concentration, the time for reaching maximal concentration is calculated. From figure 12, we notice that the range of time is from 0-30 h and the change of time is strongly related to nicotine input but the impact of different promoter 1 strength seems not significant. The possible reason is that the time of GFP signal activation does not vary a lot (0-60min) as described above which means the time for signal induction does not account for a large portion in the total time for nicotine degradation.

Safety
We appointed biosafety as our theme for human practice. As a very significant part of our project, several activities have been conducted to fulfill our arrangements.
First of all, we carefully examined the details of the biosafety questionnaire and decided to conduct a survey on the biosafety issue at our own school. Observations were made during our regular experiment process over this issue and we’ve found out several fundamental requirements as well as limitations on our laboratories. With the supervision of several professors and graduates, we got some basic ideas on lab biosafety issue even at the very beginning of our experiment process. One key point lies in the separation of bacterial, DNA and RNA experiments, which should be essential to modern integrated biological laboratories. Adding to that is so basic a point that it is often neglected by us, and that is a proper classification of preserved bacteria as well as a compact remark on the lab items. The neglect would easily evolve into pollution and destroy the experiment. The limits, however, are obvious, due to limited funds and conditions, some disposable equipment are in fact infected and reused several times. Also, the aseptic technique is not always met up with the standard. In conclusion, though with the reference to a relatively standard biosafety standard, there is still some place to improve in our lab process.
Secondly, in improving the actual safety standard in modern biology, we try to construct a new general transgenic vector. The principle is rather simple: using light condition to manipulate the growth of colony. We have successfully constructed a rather high efficient division repression biobrick and we design a special part consisting of a light sensor and this division repression biobrick. Unfortunately, the fabrication of this small system has not been finished yet due to lack of time. But once the connection is successful, a promising general biological tool would emerge. Imagine the circumstance where the colony is exposed to certain length of light and then died automatically. What the experiment executers need to do is to add specific light (physical) condition to the colony. When the experiment finished, an exposure to normal solar light would directly make the colony die and prevent pollution from the laboratory and therefore improve the biosafety standard.
In the final analysis, our human practice is focused on biosafety issue but also put some attention on the improvement of this general subject as well as this competition. We are just trying to combine what we are doing"

Proper usage of pesticide: We did a survey aiming at the application of pesticide in Ceyu village, Hebei province. The investigation object includes government staff, pesticide individual dealers, farmers and so on.
Policy & Practice:
Interview the specialist of nematodes research to improve our project: We interviewed prof. Liu Xingzhong and communicated with him to improve our design. We improved the method of verifying if compounds can attract nematodes under the suggestion of prof. Liu
Consult specialist about laws and regulations: We interviewed Dr. Yan Houfu, from school of law, Beijing Normal University. We consulted him about the laws and regulation of bio-safety in China, the laws about protection of peasants’ rights and interests, governmental measures about popularizing agricultural technology.
Survey about safety mechanism in different teams: We sent an e-mail to different teams in this track to get a general knowledge about safety mechanism in each team. We also summarized how to establish a safety mechanism according to the replies from different teams.
The research in the country of Heibei province: We did a research which lasted 2 days in Jingxian in Heibei province. We interviewed some rural safety officers, pesticide sellers and farmers in order to know whether agricultural workers at the local level have knowledge about the nematodes.
Soil nematodes screening and proposal: We tested the soil sample collecting from Hebei Province during our survey. We identified and counted the nematodes in the sample. We also drafted a proposal to Chinese government for precaution the nematodes according to the results of our survey.
Voluntary educational service: We provided rural schools students with voluntary educational service during the survey and scientific propaganda, aiming at offering a scientific perspective for students there through our words and deeds.
Conference: We took part in NCTU and CCiC conferences as well as gave a presentation in these conferences. We also improved our project during our communication in the conferences.
Communication: We communicated and exchanged our ideas with BIT-CHINA, FAFU-China and ZJU-China. Through the collaboration with other teams, we all got improvement.
Public scientific propaganda: we established our weChat public platform, gave scientific lectures for rural schools students and organized an open day of our BNU lab. It gave people a better understanding about our project.

Figure 1: The yeast toolkit starter set comprises of 96 parts and vectors. The eight primary part types can be further divided into subtypes. (Dueber)
The cloning steps regarding the plasmid levels are implemented in E.coli in order to reduce the required time to generate the final plasmids. The different levels are therefore defined by their part content and their antibiotic resistances.
To generate a level 0 plasmid, the gene of interest is ligated into the provided level 0 backbone via Golden Gate assembly using the enzyme BsmBI. The backbone contains a resistance to Chloramphenicol, as well as an origin of replication, creating a very basic yet functional plasmid.
The level 1 plasmid contains a promoter and terminator suited for S. cerevisiae. There is the possibility of including  a polyhistidine-tag if there is a need for Western blot analysis. The antibiotic resistance contained in the level 1 plasmid changes from chloramphenicol to ampicillin which enables filtering out residual level 0 plasmids contained in the Golden Gate product. Furthermore, the Dueber toolbox includes the possibility of designing GFP-Dropout cassettes. These are custom-built level 1 backbones whose inserts are sfGFP as well as promoter and terminator suited for E. coli.  Upon a successful cloning step the GFP is replaced by the part(s) of interest, and correct colony shows a white colour. In case of a wrong ligation event colonies show a green fluorescence. This provides a very useful tool to detect unsuccessful cloned colonies. The enzyme used for level 1 changes from BsmBI to BsaI to avoid any interference between different steps.
The level 2 plasmid combines two or more genes of interest with their respective promoters, terminators and tags. The resistance changes from ampicillin to kanamycin. The enzyme of this step is BsmBI again. This level is useful, if the construct you are designing requires multiple genes to be transformed into one yeast strain.

3.3.2   Product inhibition
Because the product has an inhibitory effect on the reaction, the butanol concentration progress curve was fitted to equation (15).
\[v = \frac{{{k_{cat}} \cdot \left[ S \right] \cdot \left[ {\rm{E}} \right]}}{{{k_m} + \left[ S \right] \cdot \left( {{\rm{1 + }}\frac{P}{{{k_1}}}} \right)}}\]
\[{v_{{x_8}}} = \frac{{d{x_8}}}{{d{t_{}}}} = \frac{{k_{cat2}^{AdhE2} \cdot {x_7} \cdot \left[ {AdhE2} \right]}}{{k_{m2}^{AdhE2}\left( {1 + \frac{{{x_8}}}{{_{ki}AdhE2}}} \right) + {x_7}}}\]
(15)
where, P is the concentration of the reaction product and \(k_i^{AdhE2}\) is a product inhibition constant.
3.4 Model solving
We use MATLAB 2014a to solve the above system of ordinary differential equations. The following parameters were used:

RESULTS
Throughout the year we performed various different assays and working out of our small lab experienced a few technical difficulties especially with minipreps.  However, by the end of the year we were able to submit two new biobrick parts!  We also have some promising proof of concept results to show that these biobricks work as expected.  Below the results of all our experiments are outlined.
Because we did not have the biobrick version of our parts completed for a portion of the year, we chose to conduct some experiments with the promoter and protein coding sequences inside a pUC57 backbone. We obtained theses plasmids in a pUC57 vector through gene synthesis.  Or so we thought.
On October 13th, after many inconsistent results in the lab, we realized by looking at the original tube of synthesized DNA that it was mistakenly placed in a pet vector(Kanamycin resistance) instead of pUC57 (Ampicillin resistance).  This was only labelled on the tube and not on any paperwork or any communication (that was all labelled pUC57).  We had ordered them in pUC57 and they had confirmed this.  The mistake is a random, yet unfortunate, accident.  Despite this, we were able to push some lab work into the last week before the wiki freeze and are able to share some promising results and submit two biobrick parts.
The error in antibiotic use explains why we were able to get results immediately after transforming the non-biobrick plasmids, but were not able to maintain the cell lines.
Summary:
Two biobrick parts have been submitted to the iGEM registry. These are the two composite keratinase parts. Because of the synthesis mistake, characterization is ongoing and we hope to have some preliminary results to share in our presentation in Boston.
Keratinases seem to be possibly toxic to E.coli.  KerA seems to be more toxic than KerUS.  In the future, expression cassettes of the keratinases should be created using a promoter that stimulates lower rates of expression and that is less “leaky”.
The non-biobrick KerUS plasmid seems promising and in several experiments shows evidence of some enzyme activity.  Seen either as clearing on skim milk plates"
