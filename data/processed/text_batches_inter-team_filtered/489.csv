KK Yesterday's transformation of pIG13+CRO insert into E.Coli yielded several colonies on both the plate inoculated with 50 microL and the plate inoculated 100 microL. We plated 8 separate single colonies and will wait until Friday, when we will plan to PCR verify which of the colonies has our vector and insert. Afterward, we discussed what we will do on Friday. We'll spend the hour preparing samples for PCR and a few hours later Clarisse is going to drop by to run the samples on a gel.
Also, I streaked lines and waves of V.cholerae today on a plate and for curiosity streaked E.Coli with pIG78 next to it in lines, and in waves intersecting the wavy cholera lines. We want to see if there are varying degrees of fluorescence.
KP 5/15/13 Today I re-streaked our ligation products. I re-streaked the control (pLat vector only) and the test (pLat vector and cro insert.) The hope, is that we can get individual colonies from the plates, so that we can sequence our plasmid to see if the vector took up the insert and if we have what we think that we do. We we will need primers IG57 and IG58 for our sequencing of this plasmid on Friday.

KK All our singles grew up well, so today we set up 10 PCR reactions + our control to test which, if any, had our vector + CRO insert construct. We also checked the plate that we streaked with Cholera and E.Coli with pIG78 next to one another. We wanted to see if the E.Coli would fluoresce at all in the presence of cholera. Under a UV light we didn't observe any noticeable difference between the streaks of cholera and the streaks of E.Coli

KK Clarisse left for Russia on Sunday, so she'll be gone for perhaps a month working at her internship. At the beginning of class we talked about possible community projects. The first project we may want to do is publish a children's book. The other two projects that received votes were: creating a board game, and sponsoring a fun run to raise money for Haiti. I called my friend Redge Ballard, an animation major, to ask if he would be interested in designing the book.

Bed Bugs
Bed bugs have had a long intertwined history with the human world causing a lot of nuisance and disturbance at our homes. Historically it is believed that during the 1940s they were eradicated in the developed world, but in 1995 there has been an increase in their prevalence.
Bed bugs are scientifically called Cimex lectularius and are parasitic on human beings. In general the entire organisms from the Cimicidae family are generally parasitic and specialize to various other organisms. They feed on the blood of warm blooded animals also termed as hematophagy. Cimex lectularius are one such parasitic organism. These are attracted to their host by warmth and CO2 and are very well adapted to the human environment, mostly found in temperate climates.
C. lectularius are small wingless insects that have an oval flattened appearance. They reproduce through traumatic insemination also called hypodermic insemination, where insemination takes place through the body wall, into the body cavity by physical breaching of the epidermis. Males have a hypodermic genitalia that pierces on the abdomen of the female and ejaculates sperm into the body cavity. As these sperm diffuses inside the cavity they reach the ovaries and results in fertilisation. The females can lay 5 eggs in a day and 500 eggs during her lifetime. Eggs are about 1mm long with a milky white tinge and can take 2 weeks to hatch. There are 5 molting stages before they reach maturity.  New-borns are called hatchlings or nymphs and are about the size of poppy seeds. The nymphs start feeding as soon as they hatch and they require one feed in each molting stage. They take about 5 weeks to reach maturity at room temperature environment. Both nymphs and adults are visible from naked eye and there colour might vary from white, light tan to a deep tan or burnt orange. Adults grow about ¼ of an inch long. Female lays 5 eggs in one day and about 500 during her lifetime. Bed bugs can cause adverse health effects to human beings like skin rashes, psychological effects and allergic symptoms.

If we had obtained results of the quantification of produced MlrA, we would have tested the degradation of microcystins from an actual microcystin contaminated lake water sample by supplementing the sample with known MlrA and cyanobacteria-lysing lysozyme.
Conclusions
After experimentally  testing our stress promoters, the CCP1 promoter in particular showed promise for development as an oxidative stress sensor.  It produced a large relative increase in YFP when induced, and had a low base level of expression.
Our simulations support the hypothesis that transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7 play a crucial role in the immediate response of the cell against oxidative stress. This means that promoters relying on these transcription factors, such as our CCP1 promoter, would be rapidly activated by oxidative stress. Therefore, our promoters proved to be good candidates for future development of sensor applications.
Based on our results, MlrA has great potential for production and purification in an active form in both E. coli and S. cerevisiae . Additional experiments should be done to find the optimal chassis and conditions to acquire maximal yields of highly active enzyme.
“ Our model confirms that Yap1p and Skn7p seem to play a crucial role in the immediate response of the cell against oxidative stress ”

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportNaturalityArtificiality_-_-_TEXT.html," importance, we have to consider sciences, in particular life sciences, as deeply political. By ruling about forms of the living, biologist can rule about what is, and so, about “norms of being”. The political characteristic of the scientific discourse has to be related to a standpoint epistemology. Every knowledge is situated : in time, space, culture, history, vocabulary. Words are said by a particular mouth. We have to wonder politically about our own discourses and try to perform that deconstruction of essentialization. These points will have consequences on our subject, through the contradiction Haraway showed in the process of distinction between natural and artificial. Deconstruction is now claiming the hybrid form of entities which surround us. Everything is both “natural” and “artificial”. Natural because it takes a part in our reality and artificial because it is constructed. Nature and device, pure and impure, truth and false, and so many other dichotomies through which we look at the world are now deeply upset.The concept of nature is hiding these mechanisms of construction and of domination. It blurs them to invisibility. Something “natural” is something you can't control but also something  you can't fight. Deconstruction and effort of deconstruction must be daily practices for us.

Bacterial Cellulose
Does the addition of a cellulose binding domain accelerate the degradation of PET?
Model Setup
We considered the following degradation setup: a sheet of PET is “sandwiched” between two layers of bacterial cellulose, to which we add our PETase-CBD which is able to bind to the bacterial cellulose. The bacterial cellulose, due to its insulating nature, will prevent PETase that is close to the PET film from escape into the rest of the solution, resulting in a high local concentration of PETase close to the surface.
Bacterial cellulose creates a ""sandwich"" to maximize PETase contact with the surface
We determined the surface area of a PET bottle modeling it as a perfect cylinder with diameter d = 7 cm, height h = 23 cm, and mass m = 4 g. which is about the average size of a disposable water bottle.
- Surface area of bottle = 2dh = (2)(7π cm)(23 cm) = 322π cm²
- Volume of PET = wdh = (0.1 cm)(7π cm)(23 cm) = 16.1π cm3
We want to model the exact difference between the local and the global concentrations in such a scenario. In order to do this, we used an assumed value for the “working thickness” of cellulose, which is the thickness at which making the cellulose layer thicker will yield a small increase in the insulating behavior of the cellulose layers. We used a value that is an underestimate of 0.1 mm as our starting value. We aim to use experimental data to adjust this value. We determined the following parameters:
- Cellulose density = 1.5 g/cm3
- Total working weight of cellulose = (1.5 g/cm3)(322π cm²)(0.01 cm) = 15.87  g cellulose
Using values obtained from the literature about the CipA-CBD [1"

Millions of humans suffer from vitamin A deficiencies across the world, resulting in blindness and death which could be mitigated by symbitic production of this important vitamin. We will also attempt to get corn endosymbionts to produce pro-vitamin A, a function usually performed by the plant itself. In both cases, the ethical and practical implications of this technology will affect how it might ever be implemented, so we are very excited to be collaborating with the Calgary Ethics team to ruminate on the possibilities and pitfalls of this bit of synthetic biology.
A more basic wet lab project we are doing will focus on RNAi signal delivery by a corn plant endosymbiont to silence corn genes. Most euaryotes react to double stranded RNA by copying it and chopping up any mRNA with the same sequence, while prokaryotes do not seem to possess the same response. Since bacteria like K. pneumonii live in large stable populations within corn plants, it is believed that as individual bacteria grow, die and lyse within the plant host, they will release RNAi transcripts into the sensitive host during the entire life cycle of the plant, which will silence the targeted gene and show a phenotype indicating gene function. Bacterial Induced Gene Silencing (BIGS) will be a useful, quick, and stable alternative for plant functional genomic research. This will be an enableing technology for scientists studying plant gene function, as well as a Biobrick registry value adding tool; any Biobrick compliant peice of DNA will be clonable into a double stranded RNA orientation that could be expressed by bacteria (or plants for that matter).
Project Details
Background and Justification
1) Beta-carotene production by endosymbionts: For socioeconomic and environmental reasons, this might be advantageous. To a large extent, this will be answered by our collaborators at iGEM Calgary Ethics, so stay posted for their results and paper. Their results are posted on their wiki site here : https://2008.igem.org/Team:Calgary_Ethics/Collaboration
2) BIGS for functional genomics: Functional genomics is an area of genetics that uses genomic information to help understand gene function. Currently, the most straightforward way to do this for any given gene is to analyze a single gene mutant to discover that organism's deficiency, and thus the gene's normal function. If you're lucky, you can find a natural mutant, or make one using random mutagenisis. However, in"

Following restriction enzymatic digestion by using Xba I/Hind III enzymes couple and electrophoresis, we checked that extracted plasmids contain insert, and extracted it from the gel. After that, we cloned this insert into digested and dephosphorylated expression vector pET43.1a(+), and repeat the same procedure until the plasmidic DNA extraction and verification by electrophoresis. To produce our protein, we transformed specifically dedicated BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli with “pET43.1a(+)insert” to produce high amounts of proteins. We cultured them and when OD600 nm was close to 0.7, we induced our protein expression by adding isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in the growth medium[4]. It was important to be sure that our protein expression was not constitutive since we didn’t know the potential toxic effect of it onto the bacteria metabolism. Bacteria were harvested and our own protein purified by Fast Pressure Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) by using a Nickel-tagged and plastic-based column[5]. We detected the presence of our protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and protein concentration into fractions of interest was determined by Bradford assay. In order to be sure that it is our own fusion protein, we sent SDS-PAGE bands to mass spectrometry platform of Institut Pasteur, and performed Western Blot by using anti-HisTag antibody (Fig. 4). Moreover, Si4 and CBPa parts were independently validated and characterized into our fusion protein by performing functional experiments: biosilification and cellulose-binding tests. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the time to test BpA part.
Figure 4. Global view of our project.
Si4 : To assess the ability of our protein to biocondense silica, we activated the precursor of silicic acid, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), by hydrochloric acid (HCl) and incubated the mix with our protein for 2h. After that, silica formation is estimated by visual control, and remaining free silicic acid was titrated following molybdate assay from iGEM Minnesota 2011 (Fig. 5).

A modified version of the bacterial two hybrid system was presented by Joung and co. This modified two hybrid system consists of does not initiate the transcription of lacZ, but instead that of the HIS3- and aadA-genes, which codes for an enzyme required for the biosynthesis of histidine and the resistance for the antibiotic spectinomyocine. A Zif268 Binding site (ZBP) is positioned upstream from the HIS3-aadA-promoter. The protein binding to the ZBD is Gal11P fused with the 3 zing finger domains from the murine Zif268 protein (ZF1, ZF2, ZF3). Gal11P-Zif268 is replacing the fusion protein DBD-ID1. Bound to the RNA polymerase of E.coli is αGal4-protein. The αGal4-Gal11P-Zif268 interaction lead to the recruitment of the RNA polymerase, which lead to transcription of the HIS3-aadA-genes. This cassette is placed in an E.coli with a deletion in the homologous hisB gene and grown on HIS selective medium. So if there is an interaction between the zinc finger domains and the DNA the HIS3 gene would be transcribed and the cells would grow.  This system was then used to examine interactions between randomized zinc finger domains and DNA. One of the 3 zinc finger domains (ZFD) of the Gal11P-Zif268 complex was replaced by a randomized ZFD. If only 2 ZFDs could bind the DNA transcription of the HIS3 gene will be low inhibiting growth, while if all 3 ZFDs bind the DNA the transcription of the gene would be high and the cells would grow.

Formal Lab Session - 21st August 2009
Overview
Stochastic Switch Team - mini-preps of the BBa_C0178 BioBrick were carried out as well as restriction enzyme digests on BBa_R0062, BBa_R0079, BBa_C0161, BBa_C0179, and BBa_J44000
Metal Sensor Team - conducted DNA gel electrophoresis on yesterday's mini-prep digests, conducted midi-preps based on analysis of digests and also carried out test PCR on pGFP-rrnB transformant B. subtilis genome
Stochastic Switch Team
Summary
Today the stochastic team split into two, to fully utilise the time in the lab. Jess carried out minipreps for the BBa_C0178 in E.coli DH5alpha cultures that were set up yesterday. Goksel carried oud restriction digests of the BioBricks R0062; R0079; C0161; C0179; J44000 which were miniprepped yesterday.
Miniprep of C0178 cultures
Goksel has certainly picked up his lab skills very quickly, making a very neat job of filling the gel wells
As it happens only 2 of the 3 cultures grew from yesterdays overnights so these were spun down (1ml of each). It was decided that these cultures would be treated separately until after being run on a gel so their identities could be confirmed.
After spinning the cultures down after the addition of solution III, it was observed that there was not much of a protein pellet to be seen which should precipitate after solution III is added. The tubes were shaken well and put in to"

At first, we defined our project as carbon capture.                                                 However, he                                                 introduced the idea of carbon utilization to us as he thought it is                                                 more suitable for our project. Prof. Hsieh introduced some carbon                                                 capture or utilization strategies that implemented in the industry                                                 currently and suggested us to do more research on those methods.

Prof. Chao-Chung Peng is an assistant professor in                                                 Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and International Bachelor                                                 Degree Program on Energy. He used to work in China steel corporation (CSC) so he                                                 gave us a chance to contact CSC.
We met up with prof. Chung to get some suggestions                                                 which more helpful for                                                 our direction of our projects. Prof. Chung is proficient in energy                                                 field, different from giving us experimental technical advice, and he gave                                                 us more about suggestion for action on device and ideas.
He thought that when we look for our advantages, we can                                                 take apart each of our research processes and experimental steps, and find every                                                 possible point that is less efficient. The benefit of the whole                                                 project is very great. For example, what kind of way we can use to let                                                 every E. coli to eat most CO2, the way we replace our                                                 cultured E. coli.                                                 It is true that there are existing ways we can think more about                                                 how we can improve. He also emphized that we must be very                                                 understandable about our project, it included our advantages,                                                 disadvantages, potential threat, our whole project process, and the                                                 most optimum environment we should provide for our E. coli.

Method of testing
The method used to test the survival of E. coli in sugar water is a simple growth experiment . First, the bacteria grow overnight in LB medium. Then, 5 µL per sample of this is pipetted into various concentrations of sterile sugar water made of varying amounts of sucrose, ranging from 0 g/L up to 625 g/L, and sterilized tap water. We then took 5 µL samples of the sugar water and inoculated them into fresh 200µL LB medium wells and left to grow overnight.

High school education session in Yeouido highschool
As a part of the effort to popularize synthetic biology, we arranged a mentoring/lecture session for high school students interested in biology and considering it as their future major. We mainly focused on introducing the concepts of synthetic biology and showing how they are applied in real-life situations.
Synthetic biology is not yet a widely recognized field in Korea, and not many students hear of it in high school. This is problematic, since high school years play a vital role in investigating and deciding one’s own majors and careers. Therefore, we wanted to give these students a chance to learn about yet another aspect of biology, and share some first-hand experience as to how this field actually is from a researcher’s point of view. This way they will have some solid bases of facts and experiences on which they can decide their future, reducing trial and errors many students are going through.
The session was held in Yeouido high school, a science-priority school. Many of the participants were members of the biology club, although other students interested in biology were also present.
The mentoring was mainly comprised of three parts. First, we had a brief introduction about our university and team to the students. Next, we followed up with the definition and various techniques of synthetic biology, along with some actual examples of the studies. Finally, we had an exercise on using KEGG and the RSBP to search for parts to build their own synthetic organisms from. We received questions during the session, and between each successive part of the lecture.
During introduction, we explained the four departments in the college of life sciences & biotechnology, and how they differ from each other. We then talked about iGEM and our team’s activities related to it. We went over some of our previous projects, the Giant Jamboree and other efforts at studying and promoting synthetic biology.
In explaining the concepts of synthetic biology, we started off with the scientific backgrounds that led to the establishment of the field and explained its progress in diachronically. Next, we introduced the concept of Biobricks, and the meaning it has in formulating scientists’ point of view in biology. We then showed some basic assembly methods in synthetic biology, and how this can be used to ‘build’ organisms using biobricks.
We then went over some actual studies in synthetic biology, which includes PROP-Z, recombinant luminescent bacteria and efficient biofuel production. There were students"

August 18th
Today we do colony PCR (yet again!) on our SDM'd plasmid. A clever way we thought of to check if PstI cutting site is still there was to amplify the mtrC part of the colony and digest it immediately with PstI:
Although it was not so cleverly thought to the end: Jonas forgot the control for mtrC before the SDM. Basically, the first pair is the control on the SDM reagent from yesterday, the rest of them are our mtr constructs. First member of the pair is undigested product and the other one is PstI digested product. We can see the the bands are not at the equal sizes, however, that's an optical illusion caused by different volumes added to the lanes (yes, we checked under the manual UV lamp). 1% agarose dyed with SYBR-Safe(right), QStep4 ladder (although irrelevant).
We also tried joining the two mentioned parts to produce BBa_K1127008 using Amplified Insert Assembly .
August 19th
And it did not work for us.
This is the colony PCR with VF2&VR primers and all the bands are clearly lower than the expected 900bp size, it actually fits the size of our recipient plasmid. 1% agarose dyed with SYBR-Safe, Hyper ladder 1kb(Bioline).
We spent the remaining time designing primers for the sequencing of whole mtr complex.
August 22nd
After trying a few other techniques and failures of joining our two fragments together (note that they are now in biobrick format) we decided to test something new. Basically we joined the parts together before putting them inside the plasmid:
August 23rd
We select two random colonies from yesterday transformations and grow them overnight.
Also, we receive sequencing primers for mtr and send the samples to Source BioScience.
August 24th
Purified plasmids from cultures are cut to confirm that we have the gold sensing particle ready.
Left and right of the marker are two plasmids: first the uncut control, XbaI digest, SpeI digest, EcoRI&PstI double digest followed by SanDI digest. Double digest reveals the ~750bp long fragment which proves our method successful. 1% agarose dyed with SYBR-Safe, Hyper ladder 1kb(Bioline).

High School Visits
Teaching the next generation of synthetic biologists
As a team, we noticed that the synthetic biology portion of the high school biology curriculum was often skipped due to various reasons, chief among these being a lack of resources. As a result, we wanted to create a metal detection system that could be used by high school teachers as a hands-on experience to teach their students about synthetic biology. While we were unable to actually bring this detection system to the high schools due to safety restrictions, we were still able to talk to these students about iGEM, synthetic biology and its applications, basics of plasmid assembly, and basics of protein expression through a workshop that utilized active learning principles.
For this workshop, we visited two local high schools, Rockville and Hammond High School, in central Maryland. We first visited Rockville High School, where we were presented with a small group of high school freshmen, who had a relatively limited exposure to biology. As a result, we had to modify our original presentation slightly to tailor it more to our audience. Instead of talking as much about synthetic biology, we focused more on the basics of biology, such as explaining the central dogma. By engaging these students in activities that employed the subject material we were covering, it was clear that by the end of the workshop, they understood the basic principles behind plasmid assembly and protein expression.
The next high school we visited was Hammond High School, where our audience was a larger group of mostly juniors and seniors, who had previous exposure to some basic biology concepts. As a result, we were able to use our originally created presentation. Because this was a bigger audience, we were able to break the students off into groups. This allowed one member of our team to facilitate discussion with and ask some questions about the content to the smaller group before we pulled the groups back together and continued with our workshop.
It was extremely rewarding to see these students be so engaged and interested in synthetic biology. Despite their minimal exposure to it, they were able to pick up the principles and basics of the subject extremely quickly. The students from Hammond High School even sent the team a thank-you note after the workshop.

The majority of people asked in Austria and in the UK did not feel sure whether it is difficult to take part in real scientific discussion (Fig.5). Interestingly the British are more confident about scientific discussions than Austrians. Only a small number of people from the UK found it difficult to take part in scientific discussions, where as nearly 40 percent of Austrians find science-related discussions difficult or very difficult.

Figure 8 The major part of Austrians and also of people from the UK enjoyed the outreach of our team.
Taking into consideration the concept of the Knowledge Deficit Assumption, we designed our outreach activities in a way not to educate through communication of scientific facts but also considering public concerns. The necessity of a sociological survey is that the public is not homogeneous but consists of a number of different “publics”.
The survey showed that the DopaDoser idea is likely to be received positively by people of different age, ethnicity and level of education. Some correlations were revealed implying that those who know synthetic biology concept are likely to have positive attitude towards synthetic biology both in general and in medicinal contexts. Therefore, the team is pleased to receive positive feedback on the outreach activities and synthetic biology concept introduction showed in questions number seven and eight.

A) , B)
In order to obtain first feedback for our DIY bioprinter kit, the iGEM Team from the TU Darmstadt agreed to become our beta-tester for the syringe pump that we had constructed for our bioprinter as well as for the whole Synbio community. Our syringe pump was proven to work well in our lab and it can be built with an investment of less than 50 USD provided an off-the-shelf 3D printer is available. For the beta test, the Darmstadt team received only the files for the 3D prints as well as all the parts (such as a stepper motor, few screws, some end-stop switches and the necessary wiring).
Here is their feedback from after they assembled our syringe pump:
""The pump is neat and stable. The idea of using buttons as end stops is, in principle, good. You took the necessary holes into account and we were able to assemble it according to the instructions. The click system for the syringe was well made and worked straightaway. The linear bearing could be used right away as well. We utilized a homemade 3D printer on highest gear for printing the parts. As you might know, this leads to relatively many ""aberrations"" and errors in the prints. They made the assembly difficult and we had to post-process several of them.
Media:Muc16_Collaboration_syringe_pump2.png
Your construction is designed quite closed, which renders it difficult for any passionate tinkerer to make adaptations after the printing. For instance, we noted that you had sent us a printed clutch though the stepper motor was not shortened and did not fit. Therefore, we drilled a hole in the front, enlarged the clutch and glued the parts together. In general, there are different stepper motors in use in the DIY community; hence, we suggest to conceptualize a more general clutch to ease this problem. Furthermore, the suspension device for the syringe could be improved, though the varying design of DIY printers makes finding a ""good"" solution rather difficult.""
Meeting the iGEM community
The European Experience, Paris July 2nd to 3rd
The first big journey for our team lead us all the way to Paris, France. Following the invitation by the teams from iGEM IONIS and Evry , we packed our suitcases and were off.

EPF_Lausanne,2013,Team:EPF Lausanne#Next steps_-_-_TEXT.html," an anti YFP antibody. Check out Cell surface display for further information.  The results were promising, but we would need to sequence verify our constructs and repeat the assay several times, improve the antibody concentration and incubation time, for better images. Additionally, we would have inquired which other proteins could be fused to INP and still be used to bind nanoparticles.
Sensing/Effector
We successfully cloned a pH sensitive promoter, and proved its functionality, but, with a bit more time, we would have characterized it in more details and would have been able to find its optimal expression conditions. For example, we would have repeated the plate reader experiments with a wider range of pH values and even with different buffers.
Furthermore, we would have transformed another strain of E.coli (MG1655) from which the promoters (hya and cad) originate with the plasmid. This would assure that the necessary transcription factors and activators are present and can initiate transcription of the superfolded GFP. In parallel, we would have restarted the cloning of the hya and cad promoters with slight variations of sequences, to check for a better inducible system.
The effector part wasn't very successful, but we would repeat the purification assay of Gelatinase E and MMP2 to make sure that our negative results aren't due to manipulations error.
Additionally, we would have designed new primers to have a fusion protein between the enzymes and GFP which would facilitate to prove its production.
Eventually, we would clone the sensing promoter and the effector enzymes together into one plasmid. Thus having a plasmid that produces the nanoparticle degrading enzyme when triggered by a pH change, as in the original idea.
Taxi.Coli
Once all the subparts worked, we would clone one Biobrick made out of our promoter and our gelatinase gene in one backbone. This backbone would then contain a different antibiotic resistance than our Cell-surface display plasmid so that we could co-transform bacteria with the plasmid responsible for sensing/effector and the plasmid that encodes the Inp-streptavidin fusion protein. Then, we would bind the nanoparticles to those Taxi.Coli bacteria.
The last step to complete the proof of principle we wanted to provide is to characterize extensively this final version of Taxi.Coli smart drug delivery.

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Killing I_-_-_TEXT.html," including the insert from strategy one had to be removed by mutagenesis PCR. The success of this mutagenesis can be seen in figure 2.4.1. Afterwards the vector was cut with AgeI/KpnI, the bicistronic CmR and GFP cassettes removed and these two parts as distinct cassettes inserted into the vector still bearing the oriT and GAM fragment. Figure 2.4.2 shows the control digestion of pBluescript SK II with the new insert. This new insert which was again restricted by XbaI/XhoI was than planned to clone in the λ phage in the same way as described in 2.1. Unfortunately this could not be achieved due to a lack of time.
Figure 2.4.1: Success of the mutagenesis PCR to remove an unwanted KpnI restriction site.
Figure 2.4.2: Control digestion of the new insert in pBluescript SK II with different restriction enzymes lead to the correct band pattern. So one can conclude that this strategy also succeeded and the insert is ready for cloning in the λ phage.
cI
Since the cI part BBa_J01101 has the wrong sequence and therefore isn’t functional, we decided produce a new bacteriophage λ cI repressor by ordering the cI sequence including a promotor (BBa_J23101), RBS (BBa_B0032) and terminator (BBa_B0015) from geneart. The sequence, which we got from NCBI, was optimized for high expression levels in E. coli using Geneart’s GeneOptimizer technology. Although the amino acid sequence remained the same, an unwanted EcoRI restriction site was introduced, which had to been removed by mutagenesis PCR. Since the standard prefix and suffix were already included in the sequence ordered from geneart, the cI cassette could easily be cloned in the standard plasmid pSB1A2 using the restriction enzymes XbaI and PstI (see figure 2.5.1). The finished part was confirmed by sequencing (using VF2 and VR) and a control digestion (see figure 2.5.2) and then used for characterisation .

Penn,2012,Team:Penn#Barriers_-_-_TEXT.html," for extra materials by utilizing natural processes. Complete chemical synthesis is very costly, so any efforts that can harness the biosynthetic processes are greatly preferred. However, using a purely biosynthetic pathway leads to low yields. This is where synthetic biology techniques come into play where low prices and high yields can become a reality. A case where synthetic processes have been utilized effectively is in the case of the anti-malarial drug Artemisinin. Scientists have successfully managed to engineer E. coli to produce a precursor of Artemisinin by altering some pathways that can purified in a cost-effective manner [3]. Another great bacterium to engineer is Lactobacillus, due to the fact that it is part of pathway of fermenting milk into yogurt. Using this strategy, in 2008, MIT's iGEM team attempted to manipulate Lactobacillus bulgaricus to produce an antimicrobial peptide that would inhibit the binding of Streptococcus mutans. This would eventually prevent the formation of cavities. Moreover, this method effectively creates a cheaper, sustainable way to keep the therapy functional since small amounts of the bacteria are required to re-ferment milk and keep producing this antimicrobial yogurt[4].
In addition, a large proportion of diseases are bacterial. This allows one to consider the possible interplay between different bacteria. One way in which this interaction has been embraced is in the earlier cholera therapeutic with E. coli. Here we have two bacteria, engineered E. coli Nissle 1917 and Vibrio cholera, of which both have the ability to quorum sense or communicate with other cells. However, the latter is pathogenic and the former is not. As a result, since bacteria have the ability to communicate only with other bacteria that produce the specific CAI-2 it allows the E. coli to trick the Vibrio cholera to believe that the they have already inhabited that part of the gut and prevent the formation of the cholera biofilm [1]. These types of bacterial interactions are an interesting consideration to make when creating therapeutics where other non-pathogenic bacteria can beat pathogenic bacteria at their own game by emulating their behaviour.
Many bacteria are also facultative or obligate anaerobes. This is incredibly relevant for many diseases where hypoxic areas need to be targeted, the most obvious one being cancer. Initial attempts were done with facultative anaerobes (although considered to be an aerobe at the time) such as Listeria monocytogenes because they are noninvasive and are easy to control through antibiotics. However although they did cause some tumors to"

This leads to a progressive, yet very fast, substitution of Bac2 by mutant clones under selection pressure.

Berkeley_Software,2009,Team:Berkeley Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,", the binding site have a certain sequence, and the terminator be of a certain type. These rules will be triggered if a device is constructed with does not comply with these specification.
Finally, the executable nature of Eugene allows for permutations of devices which do not break rules to be generated automatically. In this way, large sets of correct-by-construction devices can be created and sent to other tools or assembly workflows.
Step #3: Construction - Spectacles
In order to design composite devices, Spectacles provides a visual editing environment. Not only does this allow for a complete drag and drop ""schematic"" editor style design experience, but it also checks and enforces Eugene based rules, provides visual cues regarding the design's properties, and is completely integrated with the rest of the Cloth design environment. The latter allows the user to assign actual parts from registries to the functional concept captured by Spectacles.
The key here is that Eugene allows for abstract devices to be specified. Actual implementations (assigning DNA parts) can be done with Spectacles. Spectacles is a fully functioning Clotho tool which gives it access to number of other tools so that it is part of a complete design flow. Spectacles also produces Eugene files as well which can then be used in other parts of the design flow or by future Eugene-specific tools.
Step #4: Physical Assembly - Kepler
Once all the design has been done, it will be meaningless unless there is a path to physically create the DNA for the device. We are able to do this by leveraging knowledge about a parts construction (from Spectacles), its physical location in a plate (from Clotho's part's manager), its optimal assembly (via the algorithm manger), and the workflow to generate files for a liquid handling robot (via Kepler). Together we have created a flow whereby one can complete a design flow from start to finish from the comfort of their own computer.
Step #5: Design Flows
Design Flow Overview - Here we illustrate the interaction between Eugene, Spectacles, Kepler and Clotho. This is done via the Communication and Data APIs.
The key to a truly useful set of tools is a design flow that helps the designer not only be more productive and efficient but also perform correct-by-construction design. The figure above shows such a workflow. Here we point out the close relationship between the specification process in Eugene and the construction process in Spectacles. In addition we highlight the need for Data and Communication APIs. The dotted lines encapsulate tools within the Clotho framework. Kepler is an external tool which we are able to communicate to with the help of a special tool for invoking java methods"

Shiyang WANG
You can relax at any time, but not today.
Shiyang is a senior majoring in both chemistry and computer sciences at UCAS.
He greatly appreciates all those understanding and encouragement from his wonderful teammates and instructors. He have made great progress in website techniques, experimental operations and communication skills in this year. All of these make his iGEM journey a precious and memorable experience in his life.
He participated in topic selection, devoted all his summer to wiki programs, and assisted other teammates in modeling and hardware design. He used to be a piano player, outdoors amateur and movie fan, but now he only enjoys sweet sleeping after overnight debugging.
Team Accomplishments
Project:
The prototype of our project was raised by Shiyang WANG in our brainstorm session in Feb. 2017. This idea was then modified and improved by Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG. Our investigators Prof. Xien-en ZHANG, Prof. Chunbo LOU and Prof. Jiangyun WANG helped in our project design. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI also offered help in project design.
Experiments:
Our experiments started in July 2017. As our team's leaders, Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG, separately responsible for the sensor part and degradation part, designed and monitored our experiments. They also did the primary work of data analysis. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI gave their suggestion on project design. Our experiments were accomplished with the joint effort of the following 9 teammates: Ruiling CAI, Jianyi HUANG, Shubo YUAN, Jiang WU, Jingnan YE, Yi WU, Yunfan LI, Yuze WU, Yuqing LEI.

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," product S-Din to ordinary students of SCAU.
We are very excited to witness a hit in public when S-Din first met with the public. From the original inspiration to the real software product, our software can't be born without continuous communication and timely feedback with public and all related fields. We are deeply impressed by the power of human practices. Although this version of S-Din is not perfect, we'll continue to create a better product.
Synbio is just a S-din away.
Public Engagement
iGEM is not only a competition standing at the front of synthetic biology, but also a good chance and a platform to introduce synthetic biology to the public. Further, we should never “work behind closed doors” — though non-technical individuals may lack knowledge about synbio, they might provide us with many sparkling ideas and inspirations on our projects -- That's also S-Din's goal. More importantly, if our project is hardly understandable to the general public, then it cannot be a successful one. If we can establish a bi-directional communication with the public, we can get more feedback on our project and, based on the feedback, we can make our project more accessible not only to the scientists but also to the public.
Biology Festival: introduction synthetic biology to public
Collaborated with SYSU_CHINA iGEM team, we held a parade in the campus to introduce synthetic biology to the public. Our audiences included students of life sciences and many other majors, teachers of different backgrounds, and residents in the campus who are neither students nor teachers. Our parade includes 2 parts: Design a circuit; Project sharing.
As for the “Design a Circuit” part, we designed a funny game. The participants were allowed to design gene circuit based on the genetic parts provided by us for specific purpose. At first, we thought this game would be very easy. All they need to do is just put the genetic parts in the right orders to complete a circuit. The situation, however, is quite different from what we expected. We explained to them what the promoter is, but it was so hard for them to understand, not to mention completing a circuit. Since most of the students lacked related knowledge, few students attended this game. And those who attended this game required a lot of hints to finish the circuit.
In terms of the “Project Sharing” part, we presented the project of 2015, CORE. We demonstrated the function of our software. They also gave us some suggestions.

Robustness in different host
In order to verify that the MINI-GRE is able to work with the same rule in a variety of yeast strains and expend the application range of these MINI regulatory devices, we invited other teams to repeat the same experiments in different yeast strains and experimental environment, which can also be an important part of our collaboration.
The time point of the data collection is early stationary phase of yeast growth. The yeast strains we used with Nanjing-China were Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100. The yeast strain used in Tianjin was synX, the yeast strain with chemical synthetic chromosome.
From the result of other colleges, we can know that our MINI-GRE can also work in other yeast strains. (Fig. F)
Fig. F The fluorescence/Abs600 of strains with different promoter-terminator pairs in the late  from three teams, OUC-China, Tianjin and Nanjing-China(left to right). Error bars represent standard deviation of three biological replicates.
Transcription Level Assay by qPCR
Moreover, we run qPCR towards corresponding protein in order for a further validation of different promoter-terminator combination’s expression on a post-transcriptional level.
The result from qPCR assay shows that at the 22nd hour from setting up culture, the circuits reached the highest expression intensity and the expression level of four circuits is shown below.
Fig. G The relative transcription level of yECitrine and mStrawberry at the 22nd hour from setting up culture. Error bars represent standard deviation of three biological replicates.
However, the transcript level of yECitrine doesn’t matched the fluorescence very well. We infer that it may be caused by the experimental error of the total mRNA concentration and the little mismatch of the primers.
Luckily, we can still learn that the transcript level of mStrawberry is very low, which means the transcriptional read through of both CYC1t and MINI terminator can be overlooked; they can efficiently terminate the transcription, which confirmed the assumption before.
Conclusion
To draw a conclusion, from our experiments, we confirmed the superiority of the MINI-GRE (MINI promoter-MINI terminator pair), which can be summed into three aspects:
(1) Short but strong, which decreases the possibility of undesired homologous reorganization and provide significant output strength compared"
LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Team#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in the parts registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where it only becomes clear upon a closer that the rights are company–owned. This issue (that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain) is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature [1]:
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to the BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more relevant. It would also raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts. This could lead to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source, ideally. At the same time we hope that the examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

I am an American who has been living in Peru for the past 10 years. I joined iGEM December 2016 and have enjoyed it ever since. I always knew that I had an interest for biology and genetics. But, I only really began to be truly passionate once I joined GEM and found out how interesting and intricate Genetics could really be. I would like to do Biochemistry at some point in the near future.

Education: Teaching Science to the Young and the Old
Science is fun. Our goal is to convey this message to young and old. Taking many initiatives, we (re)gained the fascination for science of both adults and children.
Family Day at the Sparrenburg: A little Street Science in Bielefeld
The Familiy Day at the Sparrenburg (a castle in Bielefeld) took place on April 7, 2018 as a cooperation between the city of Bielefeld, the nonprofit organization Biotechnologische Studenteninitiative e. V. and Bielefeld Marketing GmbH. It is part of the opening of the summer season at the Sparrenburg and offers a various range of scientific experiments for children and their families.
In cooperation with the btS e.V. Bielefeld we offered a variety of experiments explaining scientific principles by means of a wow-effect with illustrative examples. We limited most experiments to household products to demonstrate how science surrounds us in our daily life. For example, we let children explore the properties of a non-newtonian fluid. In this experiment, a bowl is filled with a mixture of two thirds water and one third starch. By combining these two substances, the liquid solidifies when pressure is exerted and returns to its liquid form once the pressure normalizes. With our experimental set-up, we did not only inspire many of our young visitors for science, but adults were also able to (re-)discover their fascination in science. An overview containing all the experiments, their set-up and their execution can be found here (German).

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

3. Construction of a fully functional stable cell line combining upstream and downstream circuits
We plan to finally construct our parts on two plasmids.  Stable cell lines with complete functions were constructed through Puro and BSD screening and their concentration threshold functions will be verified by using agarose beads with different amounts of GFP adsorbed. We intend to apply it to real life.
4. Upgrade our system
The above mentioned is only a condensed version of our ultimate system which includes inhibitor and more efficient RDF. We hope to upgrade the condensed version to the final version, which also requires the search for appropriate inhabitor and more efficient RDF. We look forward to the day when our final version will come into being.

Subculturing E. Coli
What you need:
- Autoclaved 250 mL flasks
- Liquid Media
- Antibiotic, if necessary (not for DH5a c competent cells)
- An overnight culture of the cells of interest
Procedure:
1. Into your autoclaved flask add:
- 50 mL liquid media
- 50 ul antibiotic solution if necessary
- 500 uL overnight liquid culture.
Note: there is a 1:100 ratio of cells to media. Furthermore there is a 1:1000 ratio of antibiotic to media. When subculturing DH5alpha, antibiotic solutions are not required.
2. Incubate in the 37˚C warm room on a stirrer for 4-6 hours
Note: Need to check the cells 2 hours after inoculation to test their optical density (OD). The best competent cells come from cells in exponential phase of their growth. Therefore an OD of 0.4-0.8 is desired and this happens after 2-4 hours of incubation.

Awareness Campaign
By means of a guerilla marketing campaign, we sought to raise awareness of our project in conjunction with our presentation and public engagement. That is to say, we embraced the fact that we lacked resources for a major marketing campaign and further embraced the futuristic and 'mysterious' angle on our project. We opted to produce merchandise and rather than giving it out blatantly, we made sure that stickers appeared in public transportation, at bars and in bathrooms. Furthermore a good marketing campaign includes things such as mugs appearing in public kitchens, pens given out at university campuses and notepads strewn about auditoriums. Our hope was that in unity, we could make a serious difference in educating people about human future in space.

Collaboration
    1.Collaboration with Harvard
 The grand iGEM Jamboree is coming, and a lot of teams have put out applications for various collaborations on the iGEM website. Fortunately, we got an opportunity to be part of the team Harvard (Fighting Stigma Against Synthetic Biology), and we also wanted to promote communication between us through the cooperation.
This year, Harvard wants to work with other teams to end the misunderstanding of synthetic biology. We found that human exposure to bacteria tends to have negative effects, which is as something dangerous. As an iGEM team, we understand that genetically engineered bacteria are largely untapped resources, helping us show the world the true potential of using such a bacteria for treatment, diagnosis, environment and so on.Harvard plans to release a series of articles to show all the cool things and germs the team is working on. Besides, they want introductions of other teams’projects, so we send ours to them on request.
Here is the introduction of our project. In the wake of the increasing greenhouse exerting more serious impacts on the global environment, the question of how to efficiently deal with CO2 is particularly critical. However, the traditional gas collection technology featured by high energy consumption and low efficiency is not yet mature enough. Meanwhile, it is these characteristics that have limited the development of itself.Our project is to obtain carbonic anhydrase (CA-2) with high thermal stability through computer simulation of the protein molecules expressed by carbonic anhydrase gene locus mutation, and import it into escherichia coli cells to achieve efficient collection of CO2.
We are honored to participate in this cooperation, and hope that through this channel we can reduce the misunderstanding of genetic engineering.

Application: Oil Sands
The primary platform of our project is monitoring watersheds that may be affected by seepage from oil sands tailings. In order to move forward with this application, it is crucial to understand current monitoring methods, their limitations, and critically assess the viability of our device for deployment for this purpose.
In 2011, the Water Monitoring Data Review Committee (WMDRC) prepared a report for the Government of Alberta that evaluating existing data on the contamination of the Athabasca watershed in Alberta by oil sands extraction processes. They focused on the limitations of water monitoring systems in place at the time. They recognized that due to fluctuations of chemical concentrations over time and space in aquatic systems, the quantity of data is a large limitation in arriving at any definitive conclusions about environmental impacts. Data collection can be limited by duration and temporal frequency of sampling, spatial range and distribution, detection limits, precision, and specificity, as well as consistency of measurement. They recommended that oil sands water monitoring be focused on the “status and trends in key pollutants over time and space,” including PAHs and arsenic. They highlighted that weekly and monthly sampling is inadequate to account for short-term “pulses,” so timing is key. Another major improvement that they suggested was to improve the sensitivity of lab measurement for PAHs and trace metals.
In early 2012, the governments of Canada and Alberta initiated a new oil sands monitoring plan with the goal of being “scientifically rigorous, comprehensive, integrated, and transparent.” The primary purpose of oil sands monitoring is to be able to assess the long-term effects of oil sands monitoring on the environment by collecting data more frequently over time and space. Specifically, water monitoring is focused on assessing the nature and extent of contamination from oil sands waste in the Athabasca watershed. Currently"
Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," PHA market and research is needed to achieve this shift from plastics to bioplastics, especially in Europe where  composting action is encouraged by the government. PHAs certainly has this unique advantage over other bioplastics. 
Over the interviews with Jin Yin and Dr. Chen, it was discussed the ways of solving the plastic pollution. In their point of view, one of them is promoting the use of bio-based plastics for containers and bags. However, they emphasised the necessity of research institutes and industry to work in the optimisation of the manufacturing processes and strain properties. For them, the bottlenecks in the PHA production are the strain properties, as the ability of using different raw materials, and the downstream process which is limiting the efficiency and purity of the product. As SynBio practitioners, they believe that the answer is in the use of this discipline to help solving these problems.

Bluepha Co., Ltd. is a synthetic biology and biomaterial company established in Beijing, China. The company was the first SynBio Startup Founded by iGEMers, and they were the winner of the Future Planet Award for Sustainable Growth. Moreover, they are pioneering a revolutionary cost-effective method for producing bioplastics.
Jin Yin and Dr. Chen:
“Over 20 companies from different countries are focusing on the optimisation of PHA production, all of us are trying hard on solving many practical problems and we truly believe that the answer of some of these problems is in the use of Synthetic Biology. However, it is also important to focus on the discovery of medical applications of PHAs. The biocompatibility of PHAs enclose the potential for using it as artificial cartilage and nerve conducts. For example, US has permit the usage of P(4HB) in surgery. They believe that PHAs is a new thing deserving further studies with surprising properties that can be a potential answer for diseases such like osteoporosis. Despite of the current drawbacks, we believe in a more optimistic future for PHAs“
 
Implementations
We confirmed that our in-situ secretion system is a good approach to tackle the downstream processing problem. As further directions, they recommended us to look for improvements to the strain for being able to use whisky by-products more efficiently. However, it is important to note, that solving technical issues of PHA production is as important as it is related to the biomedical research. As a result, a new focus for our future research is to look into new biomedical applications of PHAs and specifically PHBV.

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," an individual iGEM team) become an important resource to Ontario iGEM teams and for educating the general public about synthetic biology. We are currently working on an iGEM Ontario website.
Building Life: The Science of Synthetic Biology
On June 23, Waterloo iGEM adviser, Dr. Trevor Charles, held an open public lecture aiming at discussing synthetic biology, its means and aims. During the lecture, the purpose of synthetic biology, its ethical and safety implications well as many other current topics were discussed. At the end, a facilitated panel discussion featuring Andre Masella (Waterloo iGEM team), Dr. Kathryn Plaisance (bio-ethicist), as well as Dr. Maria Trainer (Council of Canadian Academics) answered some of the public’s pending questions regarding synthetic biology. The lecture was a great success, with a large number of attendees of various scientific background. It was part of a series of lectures organized by the University of Waterloo’s Department of Biology, in attempt to increase public awareness of current scientific issues.
What We Accomplished
Upon reflection we feel that we have achieved the following goals through our outreach efforts:
1.Introduced synthetic biology to individuals who knew nothing about it
2.Educated multiple audiences on the fundamentals of science such that they will be able to better understand future scientific information and developments
3.Excited young minds about science
4.Strengthened our regional synthetic biology community
5.Communicated the work of other iGEM teams and the benefit and goals of the iGEM competition
6.Increased communication between local synthetic biologists
7.Gained insight and experience into what the public believes about modern science
8.Developed activities and displays to be used and improved upon in the future
Future Plans
We plan to continue our outreach efforts in the future. We plan to expand our efforts and continue to educate the public about synthetic biology and share our love of science. In the future our efforts will continue to center around science education. Our profile in our community is increasing as iGEM becomes a familiar group and synthetic biology ceases to sound frightening and gains familiarity. We hope that the Ontario community of iGEM teams will continue to grow and include teams from all across Canada, helping to strengthen the synthetic biology community across the country. As members of the Waterloo iGEM team we are proud to educate multiple audiences and to share our knowledge and passion with the world.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html,"such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization of MoDeL. Documents can be found here . Example of database written in MoDeL can be downloaded on our GitHub page .
MoDeL is an attempt to define a universal database markup language for synthetic biology automatic modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and so on. It can also describe the species constructed by these parts, and reactions happen with the species, such as binding of species, dilution of species, degradation of proteins, amplification of cells, multi-compartment reactions, and so on.
Many traditional methods fail to consider structure of species when trying to markup reactions with only reactants, modifiers, products and kinetic laws. The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node Model. Based on the model, MoDeL is able to markup almost all kinds of reactions in a detailed and clear way.
Overview of MoDeL
Figure 5 above is an example of a simple network of biochemical reactions(pTetR + TetR2 = pTetR*:TetR2) that can be automatically constructed using MoDeL:
MoDeL supports automatic construction of such network with only the input of its initial conditions and environmental parameters. In order to do this, obviously the data of parts, species, reactions, compartment, units and so on is needed. Besides, relationships between these components are also needed, so we can link to a reaction when we find a species. Data of relationship is stored as references and exists in most MoDeL components.
To define all the needed components in a systematic way, MoDeL organizes them in five component containers at the top level:
:: System: This container contains definitions of units, functions, rules and global parameters. These are all basic elements for other components of MoDeL, and many are mathematical concepts without direct synthetic biology meanings. The name of the container, System, separates this container from others which contains components of biological significance, and indicates this container includes the basic parameters of the whole system.
:: Compartment: This container contains definitions of compartments. Compartment here is considered as a holder of substance with certain volume, so it only stores related data such as units and volume. It also stores a list of compartments that are permitted to be placed inside. For compartments like E.coli that can multiply, a corresponding compartment with the same id will be created"

Project Overview
Haloalkanes are widely used commercially. The majority of these compounds have been shown to be serious pollutants as they are toxic and quite persistent in the environment, such as a man-made industrial chemical 1,2,3-Trichloropropane (TCP) and an organic pesticide γ-Hexachlorocyclohex-ane (Lindane，γ-HCH). These halogenated compounds have been introduced into our environment as a consequence of industrial waste disposal and widespread open use in agriculture, which need to be removed to low levels from waste streams and during sanitation of polluted sites. For this reason, Microbial degradation of these compounds represents an important and efficient way to fulfill the target. In order to improve biodegradation efficiency, several powerful genetically engineered E. coli strains have been constructed by the co-expression of key enzymes involving in the biodegradation pathways of the two compounds.  As putting the different selected enzymes together, it will have an ability to degrade more halogenated compounds besides the both. To construct the efficient co-expression system and achieve biodegradation of γ-HCH and TCP, these key enzymes, LinA, LinB, DhaA and HheC, are chosen, and foot and mouth disease virus 2A peptide and polycistronic co-expression strategies were adopted. Foot and mouth disease virus 2A peptide has been widely used for co-expression of multiple genes in eukaryote systems. However, the use of the 2A peptide in prokaryotes is limited, and so far only one paper described that F2A can work in E. coli as well.[1] To explore whether the 2A peptides can work in our co-expression system, several vectors were constructed by using all three 2A peptides, respectively. The results showed that all enzymes could co-express as a soluble protein with P2A peptide acting as a linker and F"

PART DESIGN
Fig.12 Double plasmid to meet different requirements for each element. Equip the high copy number plasmid PUC19 with sgRNA targeting site on genome and donor fragment with homologous arms. The low copy number plasmid are equipped with expression cassette of cas9 protein and λ-Red recombinase.
Difference between the two methods above: Traditional way use the resistance gene as a selection marker, while the CRISPR coupled way introduce a double-strand break (DSB) into the strain with no recombination occurred.
Application:
In our project, we tried both the two ways to test the integration efficiency. However, the CRISPR coupled way are deleted from our plan list due to the failure of cas9 and λ-Red plasmid construction.
We tried the traditional way with the pKD46 plasmid provided by Chun Li's lab and got the positive results. [results for recombination]
Two main factors will influence the recombination efficiency: the target site on genome and the length of homologous arms between donor fragment. [recombination protocol]
Promoter mutation
For inductive promoters, two kinds of region are significant to its transcription strength. One is common -10 and -35 region which can firmly bind to RNA polymerase, the other is operon region binding with regulatory factors like inhibitor proteins. [see mutation mechanisms]
Aim:
(1) To adjust threshold through changing in-promoter's strength
(2) Tied to specific promoter like PTet, build a mutants library and improve the existing part by measuring the strength through RFP

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," flying colors.
This week we performed a clean and concentrate on D17. This was successful meaning we could begin to use D17 when lox-ura-lox was ready. In addition we also ran our linearized lox-ura-lox gene and the plasmid lox-ura-lox gene on a gel. It failed.
With an absence of successful results from the transformations, we decided to alter the restriction digest protocol again. One of the edits included using the 3.1 NEB buffer, rather than the CutSmart buffer. Using the NEB buffer, PstI had 100% enzymatic activity, whereas EcoRI had 50%, so we used twice as much of EcoRI. Using the newly made protocol, we performed a double restriction digest and ligation to get the plasmids for Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) and 3-beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid dehydrogenase (3BH). We transformed the ligations with electrocompetent and chemicompetent E. coli cells, and we then got four colonies on the electrocompetent E. coli plate for the plasmid of P450scc. The other plates, which were our transformed chemicompetent E. coli, and our electrocompetent E. coli with 3BH ligation failed. Since we had four colonies that contained our P450scc plasmid, we index plated them, inoculated them into liquid media, and miniprepped out the plasmid. To confirm if the E. coli actually had our P450scc Biobrick plasmid, we performed a colony PCR, and a restriction digest. Both the colony PCR and restriction digest had inconclusive results, and we were not able to tell if the plasmid was actually our P450scc BioBrick.
None of the transformations were working, so we tried to alter our restriction digest protocol again. This time instead of using the buffer CutSmart, we used the 3.1 NEB buffer.  In this buffer Pst1 has 100% activity, but EcoR1 has 50%, so we used twice as much EcoR1 this time instead of twice as much Pst1. With this new restriction digest protocol we performed a double restriction digest and ligation to get us the plasmids for P450scc and 3BH.  We transformed these ligations with electrocompetent and chemicompetent E. coli cells, and this time we got four colonies on the"

Students
This year's team consists of twelve students from the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology, medicine, biomedicine, physics, chemistry and philosophy!
During the summer we have been split up into five subgroups, three labgroups and two theoretical groups. One labgroup has been working with the development of the photosensor, one with hyperflagellating the bacteria and one with creating the retinal generator. The two theoretical groups have been focusing on modelling and biosafety, respectively.
As is obvious below, we are unable to coordinate something as simple as T-shirt color. Somehow though, we managed to get succesfully through an entire iGEM project.
Christian
Christian is a 23 year old medical student on his second year. He has been happy to get away from the books and try something new, completely out of his element. This has proved very amusing for the rest of us, seeing as he (and the other medical student, Lars Christian) had no lab experience when we started. Over the summer, however, he has learnt fast and has proven a valuable member of the team. His main interests are in neurology and cognitive development, but the thought of tinkering with E. coli and fruitfly DNA was enough to get him out of his comfort zone. His work in the iGEM competition has primarily been focused on creating the retinal part, but he has never missed a chance to involve himself in other aspects of the project. Nosy guy.
Eddi
Eddi is 22 years old and is studying physics on his fourth year. He has done a great job modelling the system together with Glenn.
When Eddi isn't working on iGEM, he spends a lot of time with his girlfriend. He is a very caring boyfriend and they live together in a small house. Eddi reads a lot and is very engaged in his studies. He impressed us all by studying on the bus all the way to Paris (16 hours) when we went to the European iGEM workshop.

Overview
The model
Simulations
Mathematical models are useful in two ways:
In the absence of experimental data they provide predictions about the behaviour of a system, and rely on a set of assumptions.
When experimental data is available they can be refined and provide explanations about the results we see.
In this model, we made several assumptions, followed by predictions. These are listed below.
Model assumptions
-- Mabult 17:19, 17 October 2009 (UTC) get rid of the blah-blah above...
LacI assumptions:
The lac operon represses by constitutively synthesizing the LacI gene product [1].
Here we have assumed that all the other complicated dynamical pathways are at dynamic equilibrium [2] and the lacI gene product is the only repressing entity in the system. For more details on the theory see our section on Chemical induction .
If these effects were included, the dynamics of the entire system will be more complicated, and the outcome of the model will be different.
-- Mabult 17:34, 17 October 2009 (UTC)Do not say something like this!!!!!
In a culture grown overnight, levels of LacI expression will have reached steady state. We can assume that this is the case before we add in IPTG.
IPTG assumptions:
LacI and IPTG undergo a secondary set of reactions when IPTG is added in. We assume that 1 molecule of IPTG binds to 1 molecule of LacI, creating an intermediate reaction complex:
We also assume that the concentration of IPTG we put in is below the threshold of toxicity that could significantly start killing our cells. ( Literature review on IPTG )
In this model we have neglected the natural degradation rate of IPTG and also of the [IPTG-LacI] complex.
Model Predictions
Taking these assumptions into account, we can predict what the overall Qualitative behavior of the system will be.
In the absence of IPTG, the output amount of our protein of interest will depend on the steady state of LacI protein.
If the levels of LacI at steady state are low, we get a relatively high basal production of protein of interest, as the steady state is dependent on the lac promoter strength and its degradation. A weak promoter does not repress sufficiently the production of protein of interest.
If the levels of LacI at steady"

Why make a video?
In the attempt to make a novel outreach approach, we have made a video adventure – a digital role play, where the viewer is faced with a set of choices. The viewer will then shape the video adventure through  these choices. Depending on the viewer's choice, the adventure will lead down different paths.
The end product of our project design – the Edible coli – will imply us to encourage people to eat  genetically modified bacteria. On this matter we expect some challenge, since people tend to fear  bacteria and oppose genetic modification, and therefore also synthetic biology.

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," classified as non-hazardous (even for the sulfation protocol). Chemical products are just irritants and so need to be handled with gloves. In the lab, there is a specific solvent cabinet for liquid wastes. Moreover, all biological waste will be autoclaved before disposal. All work is done on benches or under open-front hoods.
Since we worked with non-toxic organisms as Escherichia coli (DH5α) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Invsc1), all waste that has been in contact with bacteria was put to bacterial waste in aseptic conditions but no specific security procedures needed to be put in place.
Why is it safer to use Curdlan rather than copper sulfate ?
1. Copper Sufate
For the Environment Even if copper is essential for life at low doses, it is environmentally toxic at higher doses. Not being biodegradable, it spreads through rain water in soils and in river waters. It accumulates on the soils and vineyards are polluted. Its spread is facilitated by water and wind erosion. This element has been used many times to treat mildew which has resulted in it’s accumulation in the Aquitaine region.
This compound also modifies the biosphere since it is toxic for worms and microorganisms living in vineyard soils. Furthermore, copper sulfate does not distinguish harmful and beneficial fungi. It disrupts, for example, the development of mycorrhiza fungi that live in symbiosis with the plant’s root to help the access to nutrients from the soil to the vegetal. The microfungi that decompose the material to fertilize the soil are also in danger.
These effects are poorly seen on an area not exceeding the current authorized limit in organic farming (4 kg of copper per hectare per year, according to AFSSA (French Agency for Food Safety)). However, in terms of conventional agriculture, there is no limit for this substance. The measure reduces the damage to the biosphere but isn’t sufficient:  copper sulfate is tolerated but not banished. It is therefore necessary to take more drastic measures by reducing the use of this substance.
For Humans Through the food chain, copper is an essential element for life at low doses. It is found in insects, fish, mammals and all herbivores, carnivores or omnivores. However, it is harmful if swallowed or inhaled, in cases of skin contact, eye contact (hence the compulsory wearing of gloves masks and glasses during our project) and is very toxic to aquatic organisms. We must not underestimate the long-term effects of chronic copper use.
Also, the copper-related risks"

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," As one of the presiding members of the TATA Institute of Genetics and Society, he was able to connect us to a number of other researchers who helped us understand the implications of applying our solution in low-resource settings.
Takeaway:
We were very excited to see the response to our diagnostic assay, and it gave us another lens to consider our implementation through. Part of the challenge that we faced for working with low-resource settings was that we needed to be able to perform our assay with limited instrumentation and also provide a reasonable turnaround time. It also reaffirmed our decision to implement a cell-free system because GMOs are still not very well understood and have a stigma in South Asia. Since only the protein will be used in the detection, people are more likely to adopt our idea. In addition, Ms. Chowdhury was gracious enough to allow us to present our vision to over 300 people through the Global Empowerment Summit at the beginning of October.
Dr. Jian Dai, Senior Data Scientist for Personalized Health Care at Genentech
Part of our needs-finding had uncovered a critical lag in the development of liquid biopsy tests. Researchers and clinicians were unsure of which biomarkers to analyze for different diseases. Our team wanted to take the step of addressing this crucial gap in existing liquid biopsy workflows. Talking to Dr. Dai helped give us additional perspective in the drylab, and gave us awareness of the tools that are needed for data analysis. After talking to Dr. Dai, our team was able to come up with a methodology for an unsupervised machine learning framework that would aid in biomarker discovery. By using techniques such as Random Forest and Lasso-Cox, we would be able to discover the optimal gene panel combinations to detect promoter methylation across a subset of patients based on the disease of interest.
Takeaway:
We added to the beginning of our workflow to come up with a machine learning-based approach for biomarker discovery. This computational tool uses several techniques to narrow down lists of biomarkers and analyzes the sensitivity and specificity based on a large data set in order to provide optimal results. We have included the biomarker discovery methodology on our wiki for further scrutiny. We also enhanced the overall modularity of our approach because the algorithm could find disease specific markers for any particular cancer given the correct dataset. Subsequent conversations with Dr. Dai and several postdocs in the Zhang Lab gave us confidence in our methodology.

LAB NOTEBOOK
EXPERIMENTAL SUMMARY
We use two approaches to capture nanoparticles (NPs): 1) target citrate-capped nanoparticles (CC-NPs) using a bacterial membrane protein Proteorhodopsin (PR), and 2) trap a wide variety of NPs using an E. coli biofilm. We show experimentally that PR binds to 60 nm citrate-capped silver nanoparticles (CC-AgNPs). We also show that an E. coli biofilm can trap gold and silver NPs ranging from 15-60 nm. To increase biofilm production, we overexpress CsgD and OmpR234, two positive regulators of biofilm synthesis. We demonstrate that E. coli carrying our constructs produce up to 8 times more biofilm compared to controls.
PROTEORHODOPSIN
Our goal is to remove as many NPs as possible from wastewater systems to minimize damage to the environment and our health. Due to the sheer variety of manufactured NPs and the significant chemical differences between them, we looked for common properties across different types of NPs. Capping agents are surface coatings frequently used to prevent aggregation of NPs (Niu & Li 2014). We specifically target citrate, the most commonly used NP capping agent (Levard et al. 2012).
Construct Design
PR is a transmembrane protein found in proteobacteria. Since PR has previously been shown to bind citrate through two positively charged lysine residues on its surface (figure 2-1; Béjà et al. 2000; Syed 2011), we hypothesized that PR may also bind citrate capping agents of CC-NPs.
We obtained the DNA sequence of pR (Syed 2011) and modified it to remove three internal cutting sites (EcoRI, PstI, and SpeI). The sequence of pR was then flanked by an upstream strong promoter and strong ribosome binding"

However, we still have the big issue of whether we can see a visible change in colour over such a short amilCP range. We ideally wanted zero iron concentration to correlate to zero amilCP concentration (y-intercept), but it doesn't. We would need a plate reader and a means to find amilCP concentration experimentally, but we fear there may not be a visible change in amilCP no matter what we do, but we didn't have the time nor equipment to explore this avenue in more detail.
Alternatively, we could vary the system itself. We hypothesised that our promoters were quite leaky, which was causing a lot of sensitivity issues. Unfortunately, we could only find 1 iron sensitive promoter in the iGEM registry, so we didn't have much choice. Perhaps once a new one is characterised (or an alternative system entirely is created by a future team), our project could be revitalised.
Evaluation
As with any good model, we must evaluate the limitations of our model, highlighting any factors we have not accounted for and any errors that may have occurred, as well as how they could affect our conclusion.
We assumed protein degradation rate was zero: Protein degradation is very slow [23, 24], so we felt it was valid to assume it was zero, but nonetheless we could include it.
Did not account for reaction conditions: The reaction conditions of the system were ignored- temperature, pressure and pH.
Other limitations on growth were not taken into account: Although we considered degradation, there are also other factors that restrict the velocity of our reaction. One example would be space. We essentially assumed there was an excess of space. However, this may not be the case, especially as we are dealing with concentrations on a μM scale. Another would be the concentrations of the enzymes were not considered. 
Did not account for diffusion rates: We assumed that everything was perfectly and evenly spread among the reactants and ignored the idea that it may take time for the various parts to reach each other before they react. However, because we were considering very long periods of time and a very small surface area, this is a valid assumption and would have little effect on the outcome of our model.
Possible overuse of sources: We used Eyal Karzbrun et al [7] quite a lot in our model. This was primarily because it was a study of protein synthesis in a cell-free system, which is exactly what our project"

Industry
Our team members also attended a workshop on the future of chemical industry, organized by the Chemical Industry Federation of Finland , an organization that represents a large portion of Finnish industry, including the biotechnology companies. The Foresight Project workshop was arranged by AlternativeFutures and included brainstorming new ideas for current chemical industry and for the future, which were then rated by the level of impact and the requirements to implementation.
Media
To increase awareness of synthetic biology and iGEM among the general public, students, researchers and industry we approached a variety of magazines and newspapers, as well as other media outlets. We were also interviewed on the national radio and were invited to take part in a radio series on synthetic biology, to be aired in the summer of 2016. The articles we were featured on as well as the radio interview can be found below.

The site shortly described in both Finnish and English what synthetic biology and iGEM is about, as well as our goals and our team. As the project progressed, we included information on our project and our supporters.

Δtsr-7028 Δ(tar-tap)5201 Δtrg-100 Δaer-1) harboring plasmid BBa_K533009 , which should has only chemotaxis towards aspartate.
We expected the bacteria to form an obvious concentration difference in the capsule sealed by dialysis membrane, but no obvious difference in the cloudiness was observed in all our experiments. As our modeling put it, in a sealed space like our dialysis capsule, the cells would move towards the destination and turn around randomly, reducing the difference in cell density originally formed by chemotaxis.
Nonetheless, our mathematical model still suggests that certain difference should be present between two ends of the capsule. We took 500ul liquid from either end of the capsule and measured OD600.
As a negative control, we inserted a blank agar bar and took the same measurements.

Statistically we observed a significant difference in cell density between the two ends of the capsule, confirming our hypothesis.
Resetting
We need to test whether the bacteria can return after reaching the end.
We incubated E. coli BW CAV8 (tar-, tsr-, tap-, trg-, aer-, cheW-, fimE-, fimB-) harboring pChemoK plasmid with or without arabinose for 1h at 30 centigrade and dipped on mineral medium supplemented with 2% glucose, 2mg/ml each of methionine, leucine, isoleucine, valine. Aspartate and serine was spread on the two ends of the semi-solid medium and incubated at 30 centigrade.
The photo was taken 30 hours after inoculation.

Description
Choosing reliable protocols for new experiments is a problem laboratories routinely face. Experimental practices differ immensely across laboratories, and precise details of these practices may be lost or forgotten as skilled members leave the lab. Such fragmentation in protocol methods and their documentation often hampers scientific progress. Indeed, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that measures a protocol’s success. In turn, the lack of commonly accepted protocols and inadequate documentation affects experimental reproducibility through method inconsistencies across laboratories. Review studies even estimate that only 10-25% of published scientific results are reproducible, and up to 54% of materials/antibodies/organisms are not identifiable for reproducibility studies ( https://peerj.com/articles/148/ ). This is an alarming figure and suggests that many of the results we base continued research and development on are inaccurate or cannot be replicated independently.
To attempt to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowd-sourced ratings and comments system to clearly document, rate, elaborate, review, and organize variants of experimental protocols in order to increase the likelihood of reproducible scientific results. This would streamline some of the confusion associated with finding and replicating protocols by creating a database where investigators can upload protocols, comment on them, and even use a rating system to allow the best protocols to rise to the top.  Before starting, we designed a survey ( which you can check out here ) to poll a range of scientific researchers on their experiences trying new protocols.  We disseminated it across our networks and over social media to judge the interest and usefulness of our project.  For those still interested, the survey will be available here for people to take at least through the end of 2014.  So far, we've found that among a diverse and experienced set of respondents, every single scientist has struggled with replicating protocols from other experimenters, with >50% of respondents having difficulty more than 25% of the time.
Additionally, our survey identified that unclear language and missing steps of protocols as the greatest contributors to the irreproducibility of protocols. Furthermore, 100% of respondents indicated they would use a database like this to browse and download protocols, and"
