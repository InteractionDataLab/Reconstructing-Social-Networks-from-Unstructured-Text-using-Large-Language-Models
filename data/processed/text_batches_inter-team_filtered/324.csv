Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," project description for different members of the community. When writing these “elevator pitches” we were surprised to discover how difficult it can be to modify language to fit the audience. Children in particular were a difficult group to target as they could have varying degrees of understanding and varying interest levels. Writing pitches for discussions with companies and financial supporters was easier because the objective of the talk was clear: how can we demonstrate to companies that we are worth investing in? We ended up using many of these “elevator pitches” in our outreach events as well as when talking to potential financial supporters. Here are a few examples of those pitches. Media: Story Oriented The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) is a global initiative that aims to get students tackling real world problems using synthetic biology. Competitors get to choose which problem to address. We wanted to focus our project on something that was close to home, yet could also have a big impact. One of our first ideas was to develop an easier way to make biofuel. While this idea is not particularly novel, we managed to put our own spin on it. We’re creating biofuel from forestry waste. Why? The forestry industry is a major source of cellulose waste. Cellulose can actually be converted into ethanol -- which is a potent biofuel. There are already ways to convert cellulose into ethanol but they are not exactly efficient. After a lot of research, we think we have found a way to make the conversion process more efficient. Lots of animals eat wood and they have to digest it somehow, right? Most animals can’t do this themselves and instead rely on bacterial enzymes found in their gut to help them. One of these animals is the porcupine. We decided to take the cellulose-degrading enzymes from one of the porcupine gut bacteria to see if we could make it work for us. In the future we are going to try to streamline the process so that we can make large amounts of ethanol in an efficient, waste-free way. We’ve been working throughout the whole summer to make this happen, and are now getting ready to present our research at the global iGEM conference in Boston. In front of a global audience we will be the only team representing Atlantic Canada! The message: Team of undergraduate students participating in an international competition in which they are developing a novel biofuel production system. Technical difficulty: Limited scientific jargon, accessible to a general audience. Corporations: Economically Oriented iGEM is a global initiative encouraging students to use synthetic biology to solve real world problems. Our project tackles two major problems facing Atlantic Canada"

I’m currently a second-year graduate student at UCSF in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program, where I am a member of Zev Gartner’s lab.  My research involves using chemical techniques to make protein therapeutics more specific and effective. During my undergrad, I majored in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley and worked in Chris Anderson’s lab for 3 years.  At Berkeley, I was on the iGEM team in 2006 and loved it so much that I joined again in 2007.  I think that iGEM is a unique opportunity for students to conduct research in a fun team context, and also gives them to skills to perform research independently in the future.  Because of this, I wanted to stay involved in iGEM during grad school, and that’s why I’m a buddy for the awesome UCSF team this year!

Alvin Lee
I am currently majoring in Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge, and I will be entering my second year in the fall. This will be my first year contending in the iGEM competition. I joined the UofL iGEM team to exploit the many opportunities it has to offer. And so far, the program is very rewarding: it allows me to explore an alternative and fascinating field of biology, and provides me with the privilege of working alongside and learning from veteran iGEMers. But enough of the science-y stuff! When I’m not working in the Kothe RNA lab or the iGEM lab, you can find me on the battlegrounds defending the Sanctuary from the Prime Evils or living vicariously through the Game of Thrones series. But aside from the medieval fantasy, I also enjoy hiking, and playing badminton. I’d like to think of myself as a pretty outgoing kind of guy, but really I am socially awkward. By the way, the name’s Alvin Lee.

I am from Edmonton though grew up in the small town of Vermilion. There I never would have thought this would be the path I would eventually end up on, but one thing lead to another and here I am. I am taking my Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience, and find it a very exciting field, with a great cross application to Synthetic biology. I enjoy camping and hiking in the mountains, I love skiing both downhill and cross country, and have coached youth cross country ski in past years. I had heard about i"

To target potential customers that may not want to buy a new glucometer to test AFT, we also considered using color as readout. However, it seems that yeast is not easy to get colorful and the coral chromoprotein spisPink cannot change yeast’s color. So this is not involved in our final design.
We also want to know whether citizens are willing to let our biosensor ferment for several hours in their home, so we asked whether they have fermentation experiences. As it turned out, 58.3% of investigated citizens do have their experiences to ferment something at home. This is a good news for the spread of our product.
Except for product design, we also want to know how citizens are familiar with AFT. The result is not that satisfying. Only 61.6% of surveyed people know that AFT cannot be depleted by any kind of cooking method. This may leave the 38.4% believing that, although AFT can cause cancer, it cannot do harm to our health because we eat cooked food instead of raw ones, which is absolutely not the truth.
At the same time, despite most people know that AFT can contaminate nuts, oil and crops, only 8.2% know that it can also contaminate meat and dairy products. This may also weaken their alerts when choosing meat and dairy products.
All these indicate that we still need to strengthen the propagation of AFT safety issue. So we investigated how people get safety information. According to the questionnaire result, TV program and Facebook counterparts (like WeChat, QQ and so on) are the major information source, indicating that propagation in these two ways is the most efficient.

Pasr
Enterobacteria can respond to low pH by de novo synthesis of specific proteins and altered levels of gene expression. The response to environmental stresses, such as pH, is often a complex mechanism and also depends on other environmental factors such as nutrition, the presence or absence of oxygen or starvation2. The E. coli asr (acid shock RNA) gene encodes small RNA, of about 450 nucleotides in length2. This gene is inducible by low external pH and contributes to the organism’s survival2. It has been suggested that asr genes may be regulated by the two component system PhoBR2.
In this two-component system the protons from the environment (H+) activate the sensory part (PhoR- in the periplasm) of the two-component system, which then transduces the signal to the activator protein- PhoB, which can bind promoter DNA of asr2. The promoter region of asr was analysed and showed to contain a sequence similar to the pho-box; this is a consensus sequence able to bind to the PhoB protein2. These interactions of H+ from the external environment with this two-component system are thought to lead to asr transcription2. Interestingly the PhoBR system also controls the pho regulon which is induced by phosphate starvation, the link between these two factors is not fully understood however, it has been suggested that the level of Asr expressed in minimal media is higher than in enriched media2.
PgadA
Bacteria have a variety of environmental response mechanisms; the GAD (glutamate decarboxylase) system in E. coli has been suggested to be the most effective response to environmental acidic conditions3. This system uses two main isoforms – gadA and gadB and a putative glutamate/Q-amino butyric acid antiporter encoded by gadC3. By decarboxylation of glutamate the protons that leak into the cell can be consumed4. The end product, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), is then transported out of the cell by GadC4. The control of this system is very complex involving two repressors (H-NS and cyclic AMP receptor protein), one activator (GadX), one repressor activator (GadW) and two sigma factors (σS and σ70) 3.

Week 12 19.09-23.09
NiFe Hydrogenase subunits and HydABC were ligated and transformed into E.coli cells. All plates had colonies, however the digested gel samples showed that our insert was not in them this was most likely due to incomplete digestion of Bba_J04450. The DNA concentrations of HyaB C- and N-terminus were low. Thus, we decided to order new DNA, in order to re-attempt cloning of HyaB C- and N-terminus into pSB1C3
The triparental conjugations and electroporations from the previous week did not give any positive results. Protein expression trials (induced with 0mM, 1mM and 10mM arabinose) using SDS-PAGE and Western Blot were repeated for Mr1:HydABC and E.coli with 8A5 and 9A5.
Week 13 26.09-30.09
The digests of RFP were repeated to obtain a source of vector for new ligations for NiFe gene inserts and HydABC cluster. There were transformed into E.coli cells. All plates showed the ligations were successful as colonies had grown. The colonies were used to inoculate LB and mini prepped to perform a diagnostic colony PCR. Results showed correct ligations of all NiFe gene inserts, yielding more BioBricks.
Week 14 3.10-8.10
We grew wildtype MR-1 and MR-1 FeFe overexpression strains (our modified strain i.e. HydABC ligated into pBAD by Golden Gate cloning) in anaerobic conditions with varying concentrations of arabinose added. This showed the difference in expression between arabinose concentrations and also the effect of adding our FeFe HydABC hydrogenase cluster into the bacteria. This data could also be compared to MR1 without arabinose.

Proceeding with the recommendations from last week regarding BioBrick constructions the plasmid switches of the coil genes into pSB1C3 were attempted again. Based off of the colony PCR there were some potential completed parts for the plasmid switches. Verification digests of the miniprepped plasmids from these colonies combined with sequencing revealed the successful plasmid switch of the E-coil with a His-tag (Figure 8).
Figure 8. Confirmation digests of the K-coil, E-coil with His-tag, K-coil with His-tag and the E-coil parts within the pUC57 vector using the NotI enzyme are present in the respectively labelled lanes. These digests were used to confirm if older coil stocks were suitable for construction. Also present are the confirmation digests of the K-coil, E-coil with His-tag, and K-coil with His-tag after an attempted plasmid switch into pSB1C3. The expected bands were observed for the plasmid switch of the E-coil with the His-tag. Due to the faintness of the bands they are indicated with orange arrows (reference stock plasmid bands are also indicated). Positive and negative control lanes are present on another gel. The gel was a 2% agarose gel and was run at 80 volts for 90 minutes.

I digested pUC18SfiI-miniTn7BB-Gm with EcoRI/PstI and NcoI; ligated the plasmid with previously digested and isolated BioBricks and resistance cassettes; and transformed the ligations in DH5α competent cells. The next day the number of colonies was low. Colony PCR was performed and there was just one positive: pUC18SfiI-miniTn7BB-Km.
Week 9 (September 19-21)
Characterization of pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm. In order to determine the orientation of insertion of the miniTn7-Gm in the pUC18R6KT vector I performed two analytic digestions (EcoRI+HindIII and ScaI). All four strains showed the same orientation of the miniTn7. Thankfully it is the same orientation I entered the plasmid in the Part’s Registry. In order to determine the transposition efficiency of this plasmid I co-transformed DH5α competent cells with pTNS2 and pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm. Plate Counting revealed a transposition efficiency of 4x102 transpositions/μg of plasmidic DNA. The transformation frequency was 1x108 cfu/μg of plasmidic DNA. The site-specific insertion of the miniTn7BB-Gm was checked by colony PCR, resulting in 11 out of 12.
Characterizing the resistance excision by Flp recombinase. I followed the protocol for recombination by flipase, making dilutions in plasmid selection plates and then patching in Gm plates and LB plates. This assay showed six strains unable to grow in Gm plates, what means that the Gm resistance cassette had been excised from the miniTn7BB-Gm previously inserted in the genome of the bacterium.
Checking pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Km. I set up inocula, mini-prepped and digested (with NcoI) the colony PCR positive candidates of pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Km. Electrophoretic gel analysis showed the expected patter. So the construction of this new plasmid is verified.
Characterizarion of the portable attTn7. I prepared DH5α/pSB1C3-"

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," product could be harder to purify than when produced chemically. In order to sell our yeast-produced adrenaline, there would be a need for a serious investigation of its purity and the methods taken to prove it.
We also considered the possible production of enantiomers. Indeed, the chemical synthesis of adrenaline results in a racemic mixture of the R and S enantiomers. The R enantiomer, which is biologically more active13, must be purified by chiral HPLC chromatography. This additional purification step increases the production costs. Unlike the chemical procedure, the biological synthesis can only produce enantiopure molecules as enzymes are enantioselectives14. Since we inserted human DNA into our yeast, we expect them to produce only the biologically active R-enantiomer of adrenaline. However, we still intend to investigate the presence of an additional enantiomer by chiral HPLC chromatography.
Adrenaline is a hormone used in medicine to treat cardiac arrest, anaphylactic shock and some serious shock conditions (ICU). It is toxic even in low concentrations (subcutaneous, LD50 0.007 mg/kg15). Pure adrenaline can be lethal if in contact with the skin or if ingested16. The wearing of personal protective equipment is thus required during laboratory work including the synthesis and purification of this molecule.
Transfer of Responsibilities
Another aspect discussed in this meeting was the transfer of responsibility for our product to the industry. Responsibility is the duty to answer for one's actions, all circumstances and consequences included, that is to say, to assume the enunciation, the execution, and consequently the reparation or the sanction when the expected is not obtained17. Therefore, “the responsibility is the consequence of the competence because it is to answer for its acts in the presence or not of a fault in the exercise of its competence”18. This means that if something serious happens, those who assume the responsibility for it are held accountable. We must ensure that there will not be consequences if we transfer our responsibility to another company and that we thus cannot be held responsible.
Consent
Finally, we discussed patient consent in the context of immediate need of adrenaline injection as well as when prescribed. It is important for a patient to know the medication he is being administered and where it comes from. This means that patients who could use adrenaline produced using synthetic biology should be informed on its synthesis. We think that we should create, with the help of a legal team, a consent form, informing patients of everything they need to know. This form could be distributed by the pharmacist or the physician before the patient buys"
UC_Davis,2010,Team:UC Davis#notebook#c0051debug.html_-_-_TEXT.html," on switch was RBS-RFP-F1610. Sequencing results available here.
This construct clearly exhibited a white phenotype. No abnormalities here!
Test #1
To determine whether Bba_C0051 played a role in the unexpected transcription, we ligated RBS-RFP to RBS-RFP in order to see if transcription occurred.
The construct exhibited a white phenotype. Thus, we concluded that transcription did not start in any part of the RFP. This helped to narrow our focus down to the possibility of the cI coding region in Bba_C0051 or a possible artifact in the plasmid as the cause for the unwanted transcription.
After the results were in, we diligently sent them out for sequencing so that we would be sure that our results were accurately reflecting the parts that we believed we were analyzing.
Test #2
Our scanned image of our plate with colonies with C0051 into Chris Anderson's promoter screening plasmid.  Click to enlarge.
Next, we sought to determine whether the presence of an artifact in the plasmid might be the cause or contribute to the promoter function.
We ligated RBS-C0051 to Chris Anderson's Promoter Screening Plasmid (Bba_J23006)
By changing the context in which the parts were placed, we were able to removing the possibility of the artifact causing transcription
Even after placing this part into a new context, we obtained red colonies! Therefore, we know that the transcription initiation has something to do with the Bba_C0051 region.
Sequenced? Yes! For sequencing data, click here .
Test #3
Our scanned image of our plate with colonies containing RBS-RFP in Chris Anderson's PSP.  Click above for the full-screen image.
Now, although the presence of an artifact from the original plasmid has been determined to be negligible, it is also important to verify the same for Chris Anderson's Promoter Screening Plasmid (Bba_J23006)
We ligated RBS-RFP into Chris Anderson's Promoter Screening Plasmid (Bba_J23006)
A white phenotype was expressed. Therefore, it is clear that we must focus down on the Bba_C0051 part in order to determine where a promoter function is being expressed.
Once again, of course this part was sequenced!

UChile-OpenBio,2015,Team:UChile-OpenBio#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," time to activate the second system (PLA production and exportation) by quorum sensing.
What parts did we use? And why?
prcfB (extract of BBa_K609001): The rcfB promoter is the most recently reported gene which is highly induced by acidity. When the external pH value declines to 5.5, rcfB promoter will be highly upregulated .  The Harbin Institute of Technology iGEM Team designed in 2011 a part consisting in a promoter rcfB joined to a repressor lacR. We extracted only the DNA sequence corresponding to promoter rcfB to later request to Integrated DNA Technologies  the DNA chemical synthesis using its offer of 20 kb of gBlocks® Gene Fragments to registered teams.
pTet (BBa_R0040): This is a widely studied and characterized promoter frequently used by iGEM Teams. It is constitutively ON and repressed by TetR protein.
To all of our constructions we use the Ribosome Binding Site based on Elowitz repressilator BBa_B0034. It is considers with efficiency 1.0, it means has the best translation velocity (what’s translation?), so is used to define efficiency of other RBS
TetR (BBa_C0040): This part is the coding region for the TetR protein which binds to the pTet promoter to repress it. Also, TetR is inhibited by the addition of tetracycline or its analog aTc.
LuxI (BBa_C0061): This sequence is a part of the LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing system from V. fischeri. LuxI is an enzyme that converts S-adenosylmethionine into a small molecule called an acyl-homoserine lactone (HSL); LuxI specifically produce 3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone (3OC6HSL). This signal molecule can diffuse across cell membranes and is stable in growth media at a range of pH waiting for binding to a LuxR protein to induce a pLux promoter (explained below).
To all of our constructions we use the Double Terminator BBa_B0015: This part controls the end of transcription. This is the most commonly used terminator and It seems to be reliable. Consist in a double terminator containing BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 terminators.
What modules will we assembly?

Phenylketonuria
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder where the body is unable to break down the amino acid phenylalanine. This is because of a deficiency of an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. Absence of PAH causes phenylalanine to break down into phenylketone instead. A chronically high level of phenylalanine, called hyperphenylalaninemia will result. Phenylalanine then accumulates in blood and tissues and results in characteristic symptoms of PKU.  Left untreated, PKU can lead to problems with brain development resulting in progressive mental retardation and brain damage.
PKU is usually detected at birth, and all new born babies are tested for the disease using a heel prick test. However, there is currently no cure for the condition. Current treatments are centred around following a very strict low-protein diet. By engineering the E.ncapsulator to manufacture PAH, we hope that our cells can be taken as a dietary supplement to replace the missing PAH. This will break down phenylalanine from the diet in the gut, before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.
Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Detail
Phenylalanine Hydroxylase is an enzyme that catalyses the converstion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. This is conversion is by the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon ring of phenylalanine, to form tyrosine.
Since PAH is usually found in the liver, it unsurprisingly lacks any natural resistance to proteases found in the intestine. In order to overcome this problem we introduced a mutation into the structure of PAH to increase its resistance to proteolytic degradation. The delivery of PAH by The Encapsulator is particularly relevant on two accounts. Firstly, it represents a landmark in metabolic subcontraction and secondly, it offers a treatment for a genetic disease.
We have also modified the PAH sequence on two accounts, in order to remove restriction enzyme recognition sites that would otherwise not allow for the biobricking of the enzyme.

We worked all night and morning to research and rewrite the material, replacing all the information relating to Malaria with that relating to Zika. After multiple rough drafts and finalizations, we put the updated kit to action! Each team (Gaston, East, and Duke) hosted a Building with Biology Event where the materials were allocated to participants and discussion ensued. We used these events to gauge the level of awareness, and knowledge, the public currently has about Zika."

BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Calendar-Main#18 June 2008_-_-_TEXT.html," - This would be attempting to use co-operation in a bacterial population to perform a task none could on their own. In this case moving particles larger than a single bacteria. The main aspects of this are the need for switchable chemoattractants and sensors to detect when in contact with item to move and when near other bacteria moving an item. The switchable chemoattractant has already been implemented by the UCSF team with parts available in the library. This means only the sensing a control aspects would need to be investigated further. Some research has been carried out into using G-proteins but it may be better to use sensors naturally occurring in E.coli. This is a fairly large project which would require further testing of existing parts and any sensors created.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in all of these different places to the gene drive to fail. That is a cool way of doing it, but we didn’t even do this. We did something even cooler and simpler: So these mutations require a change in the genome that stops your gene drive from seeing it. Gene drive recognises a sequence of approximately 20 bases and this sequence is very specific. So, if there is a nucleotide polymorphism there, that might mean, that your gene drive can’t see and cut it. But the mosquitoes don’t care about a single base change, because it might not change the gene, which is encoded of this region. Examples for this are so-called “silent mutations” and this could happen if one base is different, but the actual protein produced remains the same. So if mosquitoes develop these mutations, they will be completely normal, but the gene drive won’t function. So we searched through the genome for regions, which for some reason have never shown any variation. This is not normal. In the mosquito genome, everyone in 2.2 bases is variable. We found a few of this regions, which show no variations in the world. One of this is a gene which is absolutely essential for female mosquitoes to become a female, which is one of the most conserved genes in the whole of life actually. It is absolutely essential in all insects. We programmed a gene drive to cut that piece of DNA with the assumption, that any mutation there is probably very bad for the mosquito. After a few generations you don’t generate any more females, because they all developed wrong. So the population goes extinct. So after releasing the gene drive with a low frequency, it spread to 100% and it generates a lots of different mutations, but because the gene drive causes a lot of broken DNA, the mosquito was not able to develop into a proper female. In the end, the population was completely crashed and died out. [...]
[There is only one rare polymorphism which is viable in nature in one or two countries in africa, which maybe stops the gene drive if it is reached.] [...]
iGEM Hamburg: That sounds very promising! Another question that we have is: This sounds like a very promising solution, maybe “the solution”. What do you think about that?
Dr. Hammond: That sounds very good. At this point, I it is quite difficult to say, that it doesn’t look very promising. But my concerns at this moment are, that there are fitness costs for the mosquitoes that is greater, what we measured. At laboratory conditions, it did spread, so they are clearly fit enough."

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Lysis and purification of PCquad Y will be done today.
Procedures:
-Lysis protocol:
1.  Obtain the frozen cell pellet, keep on ice.  Cell pellet was 0.095
2. To the frozen cell pellet, add lysis buffer to a ratio of 1:10 grams of cell pellet to mL of lysis buffer.
3. Incubate 5 minutes on ice.
4. Vortex vigorously for 20 seconds, incubate on ice for 5 minutes.  A pipette can be used to carefully re-suspend the pellet if vortexing is insufficient.  At this point, the DNA seemed to precipitate and the solution was very viscous.  2uL of DNase was added and the tube was incubated for 20-25minutes until it was clear.
5. Repeat Step 4 two to four times, until the pellet is sufficiently broken"

Laccases
The iGEM Team successfully produced four active bacterial laccases and an eukaryotic laccase (click for the results):
Escherichia coli laccase ECOL
Bacillus pumilus laccase BPUL
Bacillus halodurans laccase BHAL
Thermus thermophilus laccase TTHL
Trametes versicolor laccase TVEL5
Comparison of the different laccases
Purchased positive control Trametes versicolor laccase TVEL0
All bacterial laccases (ECOL, BHAL, TTHL and BPUL) we accomplished to purify. Besides the successfully scale-up fermentation these laccases could be purified in a high amount to characterize the optimal activity conditions regarding  pH, temperature, buffer solutions and  organic solvent resistance. Furthermore the iGEM Team Bielefeld demonstrated that the produced laccases can be immobilized maintaining their activity and the degradation capacity was screened for several micro-contaminants. These tests indicate that they are able to degrade estradiol and ethinyl-estradiol.
Immobilization
Using commercially acquired laccases from Trametes versicolor (named TVEL0) as a standard, it was possible to optimize an immobilization method of the purified laccases from
E. coli BL21 (DE3) (named ECOL)
Bacillus pumilus DSM 27 (ATCC7061) (named BPUL)
Bacillus halodurans C-125 (named BHAL) and from
Thermus thermophilus HB27 (named TTHL)
on CPC-silica beads. All four purified laccases were successfully immobilized, with ECOL and BPUL showing the highest binding ability to beads. Moreover, all four immobilized laccases showed activity. Whereas immobilized BPUL showed a relatively high activity, the results couldn't be compared to BHAL und TTHL due to the low concentration of the latters. For immobilization results see here
Substrate Analysis
To establish the methods for degradation analysis of different substrates TVEL0 was used as positive control.  After that the four produced bacterial laccases were analyzed. The HPLC results showed that estradiol and ethinyl estr"

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Project#Workshop_-_-_TEXT.html," on our projects and on synthetic biology in general. It was sort of a mini jamboree between French teams. We exchanged contact information of course, which made subsequent collaboration between us much easier. For example, Lyon was able to provide us with a 3D-printed mold of a lemon.
Unfortunately not all teams we invited initially were able to come due to last-minute complications for the most part. After all, for some teams the distance to cover may have been a bit of a burden. Out of eight (i.e. all French teams) we ended up with five, which is still the majority. Nevertheless we hope that the success of this year’s meetup will encourage more teams to participate in the future. Organizing events has proved to be quite difficult, but we have learned much on the matter.

The purple line is control. The red curve indicates E coli cells expressing mRFP. The green curve is E coli cells expressing GFP, The blue curve is E coli cells expressing eCFP. Growth of Escherichia coli is promoted with mRFP and eCFP. On the other hand, the cells with GFP showed the delay of growth. Therefore, it is thought that you should use mRFP or eCFP in the experiment to have to get more products earlier.  Other teams will be able to choose appropriate parts in the future by our result that comparing these three parts and having made characterize
As you know, there are the three primary colors for light. In the case of light, various colors are expressed by a combination of blue, red,and green.   We apply this way of thinking to smell. In fragrance companies, specific smells are made by blending several kinds of elements of various smells. For example, the smell of apples is consisted of these nine kinds of elements. According to this concept, we will create various elements of smell in E. coli cells and can produce about lots of fragrances by blending them.  In addition, if we can reproduce the synthetic course of the element smell in the biosynthesis in E.coli perfection, we can create smells semipermanently.  Imagine the world in which you can control all smells!!! We recommend the optimum methods for smell control. One of them is “ E.coli aromatherapy”. If the aroma diffuser contains several kinds of aroma oil produced by genetically modified E.coli, you can enjoy aromatherapy using fragrances you like.
We believe our approach help us make better environment in our lives!

Extract supernatant to do the western-blot. The two bands corresponding to the two samples incubated under different condition show 30% distinction.
To reassure the result of the western-bolt, we measured the relative fluorescence intensity under different gradients of IPTG induction between 0- 0.5%. The 3D diagram presents a result that the GFP expressions of cells incubated under 450nm light and in darkness are of significant difference. Moreover, the 2D diagram indicates that 0.5% IPTG induction caused the largest distinction (28%) between the light and dark among the gradients.

Relative fluorescence intensity of both samples shows a decrease go with the increase of induction.

The Formation of Synchronized Oscillation
The analysis of a series of images that present variations of the culture disks incubating cells transformed luxbrick following the modified protein displays a well-performed synchrony. As it can be seen in analysis diagram, above 90% of the spectrum distribution of the 2000 sampling points randomly chosen reveals a significant concentration in the cycle. The analysis result of culture disks incubating luxbrick promoted by ptetO as control indicates that with the same number of sampling points, the spectrum distribution is rarely concentrated. The result is a perfect match for the simulation.

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Implementation#syntf_-_-_TEXT.html," act as spacers to protect the part from enzyme cleavage.  When two Biobrick parts are ligated together according to the Standard Assembly, exactly one spacer nucleotide from each Biobrick is maintained in the composite part.  The result is a total of eight nucleotides that lie between the two parts, comprised of these two spacers plus the hybrid XbaI/SpeI site.
Biobrick standard
However, Biofusion parts lack these additional nucleotides.  Thus, when two Biofusion parts are fused together in the same manner, the parts are separated by only six nucleotides.
Biofusion standard
The difference in separation length between two DNA parts is significant with respect to translation.  During protein synthesis, ribosomes recognize groups of three consecutive nucleotides known as codons and translate each codon into a particular amino acid.  Should an additional nucleotide appear in the mRNA sequence, the the grouping of nucleotides into threes will be shifted, resulting in an entirely new and undesired sequence of amino acids.
Therefore, since the length of the sequence separating two Biobrick parts is not divisible by three, a frame shift occurs.  If the second Biobrick happens to be a protein-coding sequence of DNA, it will not be translated correctly. Biofusion improves upon these constraints, enabling a synthetic biologist to append numerous protein-coding regions to one another.
By nature of their design, both Biobrick and Biofusion parts can be utilized in the design of modular devices. However, the Biofusion standard provides for even greater customization by allowing for the creation of fusion proteins, hybrid proteins formed by the fusion of protein domains to one another to generate a single functional protein with characteristics from its constitutive parts.
This modular scheme for protein design lies at the heart of our limiter device.
Synthetic transcription factors
Excluding the case of our proof-of-principle design, our limiter device is composed entirely of synthetic transcription factors created according to the Biofusion standard.
As described in Ajo-Franklin et al. (2007), the laboratory of Dr. Pamela Silver at Harvard developed these synthetic transcription factors for the construction of a novel “memory device” in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.   While the details of this device are not essential to understanding our own gene network, it is important to discuss the significance of these transcription factors to our design.

Producing the most widely used and valuable components of palm oil in this way would render the widespread deforestation directly associated with the palm oil industry redundant, and so would halt this relentless destruction of the environment.
Why did we choose delta 9 desaturase, delta 12 desaturase, FabA?
Delta 9 and delta 12 desaturase (BBa_K1027001 and BBa_K1027002)
The reactions converting stearic acid to oleic acid and the conversion of oleic acid to linoleic acid are performed by delta 9 and delta 12 desaturase enzymes respectively. These enzymes are not native to E. coli, which meant our project would include the introduction of non-native genes in E. coli - presenting its own set of problems. We evaluated the various organisms that are native hosts to delta 9 and delta 12 desaturase enzymes in the hope of finding an organism as similar as possible to E. coli in order to minimise the risk of mis-folded products amongst other potential problems. We began looking into other prokaryotic microorganisms that would possibly contain the desaturases we were looking for. We first looked at the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis - that had the native delta 9 and delta 12 desaturase enzymes. However, the potential implications of using a pathogenic organism such as M. tuberculosis meant this wasn’t a viable option. In addition to this, we discovered that there may have been some protein folding issues when M. tuberculosis were introduced in to E.coli
Algae was the next organism we considered, which also has native delta 9 and delta 12 desaturase enzymes. From our initial evaluation of eukaryotic algae (which would almost certainly present mis-folded product) we were hopeful we could also find the same genes located within prokaryotic cyanobacteria. We eventually were able to find a suitable cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.

Blogging Synthetic Biology
Introduction
For one of our human practice projects, our team investigated the current development of synthetic biology in some of the Asian countries. While doing research, we found out that synthetic biology is really a new field in science and that is not well-known in Asia. In fact, when some of our members tried to research information about synthetic biology in Cantonese, we could not find any webpages dedicated to share information about synthetic biology for the public in Hong Kong. To address this observation, we have decided to use an easily accessible platform called Google Blogger. This blog will be used as a means to introduce synthetic biology, share our experience and our project, and report current events related to synthetic biology. It will be written in Chinese and English so that the vast majority of people in Hong Kong can read it easily and pay more attention to this new field in science. By providing holistic and informational blog posts, we aim at raising the public awareness to synthetic biology.

SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour22_-_-_TEXT.html," and wrong becomes blurred. Through history many philosophers have joined the debate about animal rights.
The first philosophical rationalist, Renè Descartes (1596-1650), was certain that animals were mere machines without souls and therefor had no rights at all. They cannot feel pain and when they scream it is to be compared with the sound it makes when one breaks a stick or throws a stone into the water. Reference: Rene Descartes, Meditationer over den første filosofi. Publisher: Det Lille Forlag 1. edition, published 19.04.2002. Hundred years later one of the first proponents of animal rights came along, Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832). Reference: Jeremy Bentham, An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (General Historical Collections). Publisher: British Library, Historical Print Editions. Published 25.03.2011
ISBN-13: 9781241475611 Jeremy Bentham was utilitarian UtilitarianismFrom the utilitarian point of view, an action is ethical correct if the outcome produces the highest possible amount of happiness overall. and meant that the most important criterion for having rights should be the ability to feel pain, and therefor the wellbeing of animals should also be considered.  How to measure happiness though is still a huge challenge for utilitarians.
These two opposite philosophical positions concerning animal rights have been sketched up lets focus our attention on the present ethical approach. Today, the general argument for justifying experimenting on animals is that, opposite humans, non-human beings do not have the experience of the past and they do not expect their future.  But that is problematic. Because if that is the criterions, then why should we not experiment on brain-dead humans or infants?  An argument could also be that because we are able to control these animals, they are less worth than humans and therefor they can serve as tools for us. This straightforward argument is also extremely conflicting with our view on our selves as caring, reasonable beings. There is no bulletproof argument for why it is okay to decide that some animals are born in a laboratory, endure experiments their whole lifespan and at the end get killed. The debate on experimenting on animals is not in any way an easy ethical discussion. Fortunately there has, from scientific integrity, sprung an initiative to find a middle ground. It is called the 3Rs; refinement, reduction and replacement. The Three Rs are a set of ethical guidelines for use of animals in testing. These were first described by W.M.S. Russell and R.L. Burch in 195"

Our main project has resulted in the production of a hybrid bacterial and mammalian promoter optimised for induction by nitric oxide, nitrates and nitrites. We have ligated PyeaR, a known bacterial promoter Part BBa_K216005 (Cambridge 2009) in the parts registry, with its mammalian counterpart, CArG. The resulting hybrid promoter has been synthesised in two orientations; PyeaR (bacterial, B) upstream of CArG (mammalian, M), nicknamed (B-M); and CArG upstream of PyeaR (M-B). These orientations were submitted to the parts registry as our first two BioBricks.
Each orientation of the promoter was ligated to enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (eCFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) to produce four new BioBricks which have been submitted to the parts registry. These promoter + fluorescent protein BioBricks have been characterised following transformation into Escherichia coli and induction by potassium nitrate using methods such as flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and scanning with a fluorometer. The data from these experiments has proved that our promoter works as we expected it to.
We have also transfected M-B + eCFP into a human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, and have provided data to show that the system is flexible and can be used in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. We believe the promoters we have produced have relevant uses in cancer therapeutics, soil fertilisation and detection of emissions from industries such as construction.

For this they have antibiotics that they are allowed to inject in the cows. Most of the times this works, but sometimes it does not, then they have to call the veterinarian. They try to do most things by themselves to prevent high bills from the vet. With mastitis they then have to hand in milk for an antibiotic resistance test, this test takes 2-3 days until results come in on which antibiotics to use. Tjerkje wants a faster method and if she can do the test herself she would like to to save costs of the veterinarian.

Trade-off between reducing antibiotic resistance or animal health. Farmers are trying to reduce misuse of antibiotics, but if they wait to long with treatment the illness could become worse, resulting in reduced animal health.
Changes
Look into Salmonella
Summary
Gerbrich studies animal sciences. She told us that E. Coli, Salmonella, Streptococcus aureus and Staphylococcus agalactiae are the most common pathogens in livestock farming. Giving preventive antibiotics is not allowed anymore, the rules to prescribe antibiotics are quite strict in the Netherlands for the dairy sector. Every year the veterinarian composes a plan together with the farmer, for which antibiotics are allowed to use for which illnesses. When a farmer wants to deviate from this plan the veterinarian needs to have a written declaration. Every antibiotics used needs to be registered. A farmer can thus inject the antibiotics himself, the challenge is that while farmers are trying to reduce antibiotic usage, on the other hand, if they wait to long with treatment the illness could become worse, resulting in reduced animal health.
We asked Gerbrich if there are possibilities to fight multi-resistant bacteria like the salmonella bacterium with antibiotics. She told us that there are still some antibiotics which are used only human. If the veterinarian decides it is necessary to use these, there can be an exception. It is however under strict supervision and noted down which veterinarian prescribes these antibiotics. If antibiotics can no longer be used because of stricter regulations, breeders should focus on health and robustness of the cow. Lower production of milk could also result in a healthier cow because the cow can put more energy in its own immune system. In order to bring the"

Aachen (2014)
For controlling the efficiency of the newly developed methane biosensor, it was necessary to have an equipment as reference. Therefore, we looked for former iGEM teams who dealt with methane and might have a basic gadget which is able to determine the concentration of methane. The iGEM Braunschweig ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Braunschweig ) modified  E. coli in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. They intended to place these bacteria in cow’s rumen, which is a serious source of methane emission, where the bacteria would have transformed methane into non-greenhouse gases. They wanted to know how much their bacteria can reduce the methane emission, therefore, they created collaboration with iGEM Aachen ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen) , and thanks to this collaboration, they was given a low-cost DIY methane sensor ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Collaborations/Braunschweig ).
We liked the construct very much, so we asked Team Aachen for the plans and the program of the sensor and we received valuable help, which we appreciated very much. Thank you!
UNebraska-Lincoln 2017
Since all scientific work should be carried out at the highest level human and environmental safety, we found it important to spread the priority of biosafety. Team UNL 2017 (https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln ) aimed to teach other teams to form their Safety cases. They asked us to help creating their Safety case, and we advised them some further aspects how they could  develop their well-written work ( https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln/Collaborations#hungary ). We also received useful help from UNebraska-Lincoln team so we could accomplish the Safety part of our project.
To be able to finalize our construct, it was needed to have an effective promoter, which can be used in the bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus. We inquired whether they know a possible promoter, and hopefully it was not an unknown question to the UNL 2017 Team. Thank you very much!

We visited the Waag Society at one of the regular open Wetlab days. Every Tuesday evening, interested guests are invited to have a look at their FabLab as well as their biological lab and are encouraged to participate in various open discussions addressing a wide spectrum of scientific topics.
DIY hardware built by members of the Waag Society
Residence of the Waag Society
Afterwards, Lucas Evers, who is leading Waag Society's Open Wetlab, gave us a tour through the castle tower, the Waag Society inhabits. Quite quickly, a diverse discussion group evolved, mainly consisting of students, artists and scientists. Some attendants were regular guests, others were visiting the Waag society for the first time.
The following discussions lasted several hours and covered projects of present as well as absent members of the Waag Society. We learned a lot about the multifarious prospects of DIY Biology and discovered the colorful world of bioart. The outlined bioart projects ranged from simply painting with different-colored microbes to experimentally expressing the behavior of a biological network as a theater play with actors as nodes of an computational algorithm. Using bioart as a starting point, the Waag Society also promotes controversial debates about the progress and opportunities of synthetic biology and biotechnology in general.

Discussing Bioart and the prospects of DIY Biology
One central project of the Waag society is called the ""BioHack Academy"". The intention is to teach how to set up your own laboratory at home based on DIY hardware. In addition to private persons, also newly founded national and international Community Labs use this service.  To make this possible and to maintain the platform provided by the Waag Society, they do not only receive membership fees and donations but also governmental funding.
To sum up, the Waag Society is multinationally connected and involved in a variety of different DIY Biology projects. When we mentioned that this year only one European Community Lab is participating in the iGEM Competition, they revealed to already consider a participation in 2016. We would really appreciate that and hope that they can act as role model to encourage more people in Europe to found a Community Lab.

Fig. 4 shows the resulting production envelope, which in turn shows the optimal delftibactin production rate as a function of the specific growth rate. As could have been expected, the delftibactin synthesis drains many resources which are also necessary for bacterial growth (ATP, amino acids) and thus these two objectives represent a natural trade-off. The maximal growth rate, when the bacteria are not producing delftibactin at all is 0.8093 $ \frac{1}{h} $.
Bioreactor Simulations
Next, we estimated the cost of delftibactin production using a fed batch process. A flux balance analysis model only gives an estimate for steady-state fluxes and does not capture dynamic behaviors, such as fermentation processes. This is solved by dynamic FBA (dFBA) frameworks [11], which essentially discretize time into small steps. Flux and growth rates are calculated by FBA and subsequently included into appropriate differential equations. The results are used to constrain the metabolic network in next time step, etc.

A fed-batch process with an exponential feeding strategy, in which the glucose concentration, remains constant and delftibactin is produced, was modelled by dFBA using the DyMMM (Dynamic Multispecies Metabolic Modeling framework ) MATLAB framework [12] with the following equations adapted from Zhuang et al.

The end of microbe-based production of chemicals?
With general tools for genetic modification becoming commercially available, how do we tackle the arising problem of microorganisms being modified for destructive ends? Certainly, many commercial goods available today can be used for destructive means, after all a regular automobile is a 2000-pound projectile in the wrong hands. But, it could be argued that no product available today have the potential destructive capacity of a highly contagious bioweapon in the form of a genetically engineered bacterium or virus. How should questions of regulation be handled to prevent such a future?
The year is 2116. The world is threatened by a plague! Not a human plague, but a highly resistant bacteriophage threatening to eliminate the microbe-based production of food and medications that the sustainable world has become reliant on.
How could this happen?
50 years ago, there was barely any hope left for the planet Earth. The majority of the population of the Earth was shuttled to Mars, which then was more habitable than our planet. Due to this, the carbon dioxide emissions slowly began to decrease. However, this decrease was nowhere near the pace that was needed in order to save our planet. People were scared. Any solution would do. During the last three decades, a microbe-based production of chemicals using atmospheric carbon dioxide had drawn a lot of interest. Even though it showed great promise, the fear of using genetically modified organisms for production of any everyday product was even greater. But now, even the most skeptical people have agreed. Anything to save our planet.
Today, in the year of 2116, the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are back to the normal level. It’s too good to be true. Or is it?
Due to the availability of using this production system, anyone today is able to use the system for production of everyday products. Limiting legislations were made since it was implemented during such chaotic circumstances. The public was not well-informed of the potential risks of using this system and the importance of using it as intended.
Due to misuse of the system, a highly resistant bacteriophage has arisen. The solution that saved our planet also became a weapon that now threatens to end all human life on Earth. Is this the end of the Earth?

When information flows through gene-regulatory networks, noise is introduced, and fidelity suffers. A cell unable to correctly infer the environment signals from the noisy inputs may be hard to make right responses. But what if the network structure is altered? What if a “parallel circuit”, where independently transcribed monomers assemble into functional complexes for downstream regulation, is in place of a “series circuit”? Inspired by information theory, we scrutinize noise propagation in parallel information channels, and construct synthetic biology circuit using split florescent proteins and split dCas9 to quantitatively measure the capacity of these information channels. Computation and wet lab work are combined to optimize our understanding of such systems, and to interpret potential biological significance of reoccurring parallel designs in nature."

Fifty Shades of Stress
Antibacterial resistance leads to thousands of deaths annually. Meanwhile, only a handful of new antibiotics have been found in the last three decades. Therefore iGEM Leiden 2018 is looking into designing an innovative and colourful screening platform                                                 to detect bacterial cell stress. The system will consist of multiple stress promoters that are combined with chromoproteins. This results in a bacterial strain that produces a specific colour when the                                                 bacteria                                                 experience a specific kind of stress. This way our system visualises which type of stress is experienced by the bacteria. With our system, we hope to
expand the current screening methods for antibiotics. Nowadays, potential new antibiotics are screened for by assessing the lethality of a compound for bacteria. However, compounds that cause                                                   stress to the                                                   bacteria, but do not kill them are overlooked. Our theory is that a cocktail of these stress inducing compounds can be deadly. By using such cocktails, we will expand the pool of potential                                                   antibiotics.                                                   Simultaneously this obstructs the development of antibiotic resistance, as becoming resistant to one specific antibiotic is easier than to a cocktail of stress-inducing compounds.
Design update
The last couple of  weeks we have launched two new pages on our Wiki. The Events page where you can stay up to date on all"
Waterloo,2012,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," by joining five ""pieces"": the two halves of the GFP protein, the two halves of the intron, and a lox recombination site.
3.1 Mathematical model
In order to characterize the relative efficiency of the intron system, a model was developed based on the idea proposed by Kelly et al (8) of comparing steady state fluorescence to a common standard. Our model develops a ratio of protein expression in a system with the intron (Pintron) (Fig 4), to expression in a system without the intron (PGFP) (Fig 5).  It assumes that all reaction rates are linear, and that they remain constant between cell populations.  If the rate of mRNA degradation (δM) is known or estimated, one can approximate the rates of successful mRNA splicing (αS) and failed splicing or folding (αF).  The resulting measure of efficiency of splicing, then, is αS / (αS + αF)

Fig 5. Model predicting amount of protein formed from an intron-less construct
Fig 6. The ratio of the rate of protein synthesis with and without an intron
3.2 Procedure outline
We have designed the construct to be built using the meta format of RFC53 in pSB1C3 and pSB1C5.  RFC53 is useful for creating scarless recombination between DNA sites using the REN EarI.  This cleaves a set distance downstream of their recognition site.
First, the pieces must be subcloned from pUC57 into pSB1C3 or pSB1C5, which contain the meta-suffix format of RFC53.  The planned construct maps are shown in Fig 7.
Fig 7. Planned constructs (a) main experimental construct (K576011), (b) positive control (K576013), (c) negative control (K576012) in pSB1C3
Last year, a diagnostic of the final ligation products revealed unexpected banding. This year, we have re-done the subcloning into pSB1C3, and have proceeded to attempt the ligation of the final construct with more caution.  Previously, diagnostic gels were run only insofar as gel extraction had to be done.  As such there was no confirmation of the ligation pieces before joining them.  This was in part due to the size of the fragments, as several of them are quite small, making it difficult sometimes to visualize them on a gel"

UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". We did this to underline two things - how important ethics are, and how aware you must be of them.
In our project, the main focus of ethics have been on the discussion if it should be okay to bring life to Mars.
At the moment, international legislation is not yet ready for the extensive phenomenon that is space exploration - regarding anything outside of Earth as international waters, and decreeing that any cargo brought into it be sterile. This is not possible to achieve when dealing with a bioreactor, and as such our task was less in considering the ethics and more in engaging the public and starting the dialogue that might end in more enlightened legislation.
Current rules are stopping humankind from developing outside of Earth, and we have attempted to get the ball rolling to a more sensible and specific legislation.
To investigate the yield of the workshop, we asked our participants to answer a survey, where 66,66% answered that they found the ethics part useful. This shows us that ethics of science still needs more focus.
Social media
As another way kind of media, is social media, where people from all over the world can share, tweet and snap about their life, we found it very fit for us to be on both Facebook and Twitter.
On Twitter we have 386 followers and have tweeted 256 images and stories.

British_Columbia,2013,Team:British Columbia#humanpractices#GMOTimeline_-_-_TEXT.html," for adopting the world’s strictest and most comprehensive rules on GMOs. The new system requires that all genetically engineered ingredients – from consumer products to animal feed – be traced and labeled.
2004
Mendocino County in California is the first jurisdiction to ban the cultivation, production and distribution of GMOs in the U.S. By this point, 14 states (including California) have proposed requiring the labeling of GM foods.
1998 - 2004
The EU imposes an unofficial ban on GMO-based products, refusing to engage in experimental or commercial growth of new GM crops and to import GM food products. The World Trade Organization will rule if this unofficial ban impacted trade in a major way.
2010
The FDA receives an application for the first genetically modified animal for human consumption. The AquAdvantage Salmon, created by AquaBounty Technologies, has a gene from the ocean pout and a growth hormone from a Chinook salmon, which allows it to “reach market size twice as fast as a traditional salmon”. The FDA determines more research is necessary to assess the safety of genetically engineered animals intended for human consumption.

Expert consultation
From the very beginning we have interviewed an expert, Prof. Shiru Jia who specializes in microbial fermentation,for his professional viewpoints and deep understanding about BC.
Q：Why is the application of BC in China rare? The reason why the BC products are low-value.
A: BC has high water retention, high mechanical strength and outstanding biocompatibility. This means BC can be used in medical products and cosmetics. However, these types of products fail to widely appear on the market because of its cost. Producing BC medical products and beauty products is very strictly controlled, which requires professional equipment and workers, so it is costly. In contrast, BC food products such as coconut production is very simple and inexpensive. That is why BC mainly produced into some low-value products such as food. Therefore, if you can optimize the pathway of Acetobacter xylinus to increase BC production, you may reduce the cost of BC products in the future.
Q: What is the focus of future research on BC materials?
A:BC composites can make up for the deficiency of natural BC, but there are still problems of high producing cost, low performance and low level of industrialization. To solve these problems, the future research focuses on:
Obtaining stable and high yield strains through efficient genetic engineering.
Exploring the new BC industrial producing methods, including the design of efficient                                 and inexpensive biofilm production device.
Use BC structure of light-based easy to combine and synthetic biology, improve product value and expand the scope of product applications.
Q: What is the current situation in BC production?
A: BC production is slow, so the fermentation cycle is very long. In addition, the producing process requires sterile conditions. Thus, the production requires a lot of labor cost and capital investment. Therefore, the study now focus on accelerating the speed of fermentation so that BC could film quickly.

Ligation was performed at 42 °C for 20 minutes using Taq ligase with ratio 3 between amount of insert and backbone. The ligation mixture was split into two aliquots (1 µl and 9 µl) and transformed into competent E. coli DH5α at 45 °C and plated out on LB plates with chloramphenicol. The plates showed no growth the next day. Negative control of the chloramphenicol plates did not show growth either, meaning that the plates were not the issue. Other reasons might be: (1) using Taq ligase instead of T4 ligase might alter the ligation efficiency, and hence the transformation efficiency; however, somw growth would still be expected; (2) issues with the enzymatic digestion. According to the 3A assembly method, the downstream part and the backbone is supposed to be cut with PstI, not PstI-HF. PstI-HF is heat resistant and cannot be heat killed. The remaining enzymatic activity of PstI-HF could therefore have disrupted the Taq ligase activity. However, freezing should have inactivated PstI"

1 Welcome to ""The DNA Architects of South Bend & Mishawaka""  iGEM Team Wiki!
1.1 Our Problem: We have heavy metals in our environment that can be harmful to the community, but we do not yet know which bodies of water or areas they are in.
1.2 Primary Objective:
1.2.1 Heavy metals, such as arsenic, can be present in seemingly safe water environments. These metals are harmful to people and other organisms when they are exposed to them. Our team's primary objective is to create a device using synthetic biology to detect arsenic in water and give an instant reading to the presence of arsenic. Arsenic is a harmful to organism that use phosphorus in organic molecules because arsenic can replace phosphorus in organic molecules. This can occur because arsenic has similar characteristics as phosphorus.
1.3 Secondary Objective:
1.3.1 Our team's secondary objective is to use our iGEM arsenic biosensor to test different water sources.
1.4 Further Considerations
1.4.1 Ideally, our engineered bacteria would be able to indicate the arsenic levels based on light and odor intensity. When the promoter is activated with the presence of arsenic, RNA polymerase is able to travel down the DNA of the GFP gene or the Wintergreen odor gene. The odor will allow one to immediately detect arsenic, while the creation of Green Flourescent Protein will create light that can be measured quantitatively.

Heavy metals, such as arsenic, can be present in seemingly safe water environments. These metals are harmful to people and other organisms when they are exposed to them. Our team's primary objective is to create a device using synthetic biology to detect arsenic in water and give an instant reading to the presence of arsenic. Arsenic is a harmful"

Growth Curve
As the measurements are carried out in six batches, the growth of mutants of the same batch are similar but differed a little among batches. This implies that GFP expression does not have any significant effect on the bacteris's growth.
1AT denotes A of base pair 1 is changed to T, the same is applied for other notations of RBS mutants.
GFP Readings
The GFP fluorescence readings of mutants shows interesting results. Although the growth curve is similar among mutants, fluorescence intensities varied among the mutants. In summary, it was found that substitution mutations occurring to the AGGAG sequence within BBa_R0034, AAAGAGGAGAAA, showed a decreased GFP expression while others showed increased GFP output. Especially for mutations to base pair 7, GFP expression is near total-depression.
After normalising the GFP fluorescence readings with the OD600 at T=8, the ratio of the normalised fluorescence of the mutants to wild type RBS is computed and plotted as shown.
Spotting
We also spotted the mutants on an LB agar plate to have a qualitative view of the GFP brightness. The culture is diluted to OD600 = 0.4 then 3uL of the culture is spotted on to the agar. Brightness of these spots parallels the results in the above graph. For example, 7GA, 8AG and 9GA is the brightest among the mutations on their respective base pairs while 12AC and 11AC are the darkest.

BAM complex
Liposomes Ribosome modifications BAM complex RNA Thermoswitches Mistic fusion protein Surface display system
Background
Proteins that belong to a small group referred to as nonconstitutive membrane proteins can independently integrate into the membrane from the aqueous phase without the help of other proteins. This is because they possess a stable soluble form, that can bind to membranes and then insert and refold into another stable form.[1] However, most of the membrane proteins do not have a stable soluble form and rapidly aggregate when synthesized in the cytoplasm. That is why living organisms require additional machinery which facilitates MP insertion into membranes and catalyzes their folding.
Structure of BAM complex
Assembly of the β-barrel bearing integral membrane proteins (MPs) into the target membrane is catalyzed by the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex. It contains five subunits, BamA–E.[2]  BamA is composed of a 16-strand β-barrel integral membrane part and a periplasmic domain, which consists of five globular subdomains called POTRA motifs that are essential for complex formation and interaction with a substrate β-barrel proteins.[3] BamB-E are lipoproteins, each attaching to the inner leaflet of the OM via an N-terminal lipid moiety and playing an important role in promoting the folding of OMP.[4] (Fig.1)
Fig. 1 Structure of BAM complex
Outer membrane protein (OMP) insertion into membrane in bacteria cells
Fig. 2 5 steps scheme of OMP insertion into OM.
Generally MPs are integrated during translation with the assistance of the Sec Translocon. However, as there is no protein translation within the periplasm, OMPs require an alternative integration mechanism.
In the beginning, OMPs are synthesized in the cytoplasm with N-terminal signal sequence that directs them to the Sec translocon, which transfers OMPs through the inner membrane into periplasm.[5] (Fig.2, step 1)
Integral membrane proteins forming β-barrel structures are prone to aggregate in aqueous environments. Therefore,"
Evry,2016,Team:Evry#Design#PLAsystem_-_-_TEXT.html," was to use pSEVA2311 plasmid and take profit of playing with two different inducers to control when we wanted more precursor (lactate). To do so, we would change the antibiotic resistance gene, so we could co-transform Pseudomonas and select cells by using the two different antibiotics.
For the synthesis of this gene, we included a constitutive promoter (pTN8-P1) from P. putida genomic DNA in upstream of the sequence. Indeed, separated from the translation unit with BamH1 restriction site, this design allowed us the possibility to choose between expressing the gene under control of the SEVA promoter or using a constitutive one.
In parallel, we ask also to De Lorenzo lab another plasmid, the pSEVA424 which is a plasmid with the save IPTG inducible promoter as pSEVA224 but with a Spectinomycin resistant gene. Indeed, using a single inductor instead of two could be better for the cell in terms of avoiding toxicity. This would allow us to select cell transformed with both plasmid using Kanamycin and Spectinomycin antibiotic. Figure 6 is the plasmid map of the LDH* in pSEVA424.
Figure 5. Design of D-LDH* gene block.
Figure 6. Designed plasmid for LDH*. It is the pSEVA424 vector with the LDH* designed block inserted by standard digestion assembly.
Finally, we would have Pseudomonas putida co-transformed with two plasmids: one would allow to take lactate as the substrate and convert it efficiently into lactyl-CoA, and then polymerize the monomer of lactyl-coA into PLA homopolymer; the other one would allow to increase lactate production in the cell and, in consequence, the PLA yield.
To go further, we extended the pathway analysis by performing computational Flux Balance Analysis , and we also designed a dynamic regulation system to optimize the PLA production, and studied it in silico.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

The single-cell phenotype Aspergillus has a higher surface to volume ratio and results in a lower viscosity of the liquid broth, offering perspective on substantially increasing process yields when used in liquid fermentations.  Besides from an industrial point of view it is also interesting from an evolutionary perspective, which couples application-oriented research using a directed evolution approach to a more fundamental research topic: the evolution of multicellularity.

Then we go into the inner loop, which use each of the value in the vector to train the model and learn the model parameters. When the training is done, we would evaluate whether the learned model meets certain criteria. If so, the corresponding entry in the Evaluation matrix will add one. And the loop goes on and on until finish.
Step 4: By checking out the Evaluation matrix, we can see how many times that a value for lambda has met the criteria for good parameter. By sorting out the first 3 values that has the best performance, we can narrow down the scope of the parameter and set a new vector for lambdas and repeat the above procedure.
The Final Value for the Regularization Parameter:
1. lambda for whole saliva logistic regression: 0.0016
Criteria:
1) 2 F1-scores both ≥ 0.65
2) 2 accuracies both ≥ 0.8
3) mean and variance: mean = 0.232, variance = 0.00097
2. lambda for supernatant logistic regression: 0.03
Criteria:
1) 2 F1-scores both ≥ 0.55
2) 2 accuracies both ≥ 0.7
3) mean and variance: mean = 0.25, variance = 0.0008
3. SVM with linear kernel performs badly on the dataset of whole-saliva samples, so we give up using this model to classify the whole-saliva samples.
4. C for SVM with linear kernel: 10000
It took about 20 hours to select the parameter. Totally the optimization process was called 1500 times. The larger the C value is, the longer it took to train. Considering performance and efficiency, we chose the value 10000.
Criteria:
1) 2 F1-scores both ≥ 0.5
2) 2 accuracies both ≥ 0.7
3) mean and variance: mean = 0.145, variance = 1 * 10-4

My Profile:
Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.

Missouri_Miners,2012,Team:Missouri Miners#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," to emerge. Proper treatment of tuberculosis is typically a multi-drug regimen using first line anti-TB drugs: isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin (Long 425-428). However, if the regimen is not prescribed correctly or is not followed diligently by the patient, naturally drug-resistant mutants in the patient’s population of tubercle bacilli can become a larger percentage of the population (Long 425-428). Tuberculosis is highly contagious and the spread of resistant mutants is causing more and more drug-resistant tuberculosis cases every year (World Health Organization).
M. tuberculosis’s natural drug resistance  is  due to the mycolic acid (a complex fatty acid) biofilm that protects it from the host’s immune system and makes drug delivery extremely difficult (Ojha, and et al 164-174). The original idea for our project was to help combat drug-resistant tuberculosis infections by starting the first steps toward creating an anti-mycobacteria microbe. This microbe would be capable of breaking down the mycolic acid biofilm around the bacilli to allow drugs and the host’s immune system to eliminate the infection.
Background
This proposal means that standardized fatty acid degradation enzymes and an easy implementation of the degrading enzymes needed to be created. E. coli's fatty acid oxidation pathway breaks down a couple different fatty acids including long chain and complex fatty acids, which is carried out by a multi-subunit enzyme that has an alpha2beta2 conformation (Binstock, Pramanik, and Schulz 492-495). This multi-enzyme pathway can be isolated and over expressed in E. coli along with a cell surface display system engineered from Clostridium thermocellum's cellulosome. C. thermocellum, among other cellulose-degrading organisms, naturally produces and utilizes a scaffolding protein that contain binding sites for cellulose degrading enzymes. This structure has been shown to significantly increase the efficiency of the organism's ability to degrade extracellular cellulose (Kataeva 617-624). The structure itself is composed of a number of smaller parts listed below and illustrated in the diagram.
Cellulose-degrading enzymes - the enzymatic subunits of the cellulosome
Type 1 dockerin regions - attached to the cellulose-degrading enzymes
Type 1 cohesin regions - attached to the cellulosome scaffoldin protein and bind to type 1 dockerin regions
Cellulose binding domain - attaches to the cellulose substrate and further increases the efficiency of cellulose degradation"

This would not only provide information about the presence of cancer, but could also indicate treatment progression and has a possibility of predicting tumor size, since the size of the tumor correlates with pFUS expression.
Experimental Survey
Meeting with Lector in Practical Philosophy
In order to get insight into the ethical prospects of our project, we met with Karl de Fine Licht, a lector within practical philosophy at both Gothenburg University and Sahlgrenska Hospital University. The reason why we wanted to have a meeting with Karl de Fine Licht is that he has worked with bioethics, and we thought he could give us some important views on our project and hopefully some good advice, which was also the case. The meeting with Karl de Fine Licht was very informative and we were able to go into some really interesting ethical aspects of our project. We came to the conclusion that we basically have two ethical approaches to consider. Firstly, we had to consider how we wanted to reach out with our product to the society; how we would present it in order to reach out to as many people as possible. We wanted to describe our project transparently in a way that makes people understand how our product works, without provoking preconceptions.
Together with Karl de Fine Licht, we discussed our plan of making some kind of a survey to detect common fears of GMO. Our plan was that we could use this when reaching out with our product. Karl de Fine Licht suggested that we should do an experimental survey instead of a regular one to get clearer results. In an experimental survey, the respondents are handed a scenario in which they have to take different stand points. By creating the same scenario but describing it in two separate ways, it is possible to see if people react differently depending on how the scenario is described. For example, the same scenario can be described, but the difference is that the main character is a man in one scenario and a woman in the other. Do people think of the main character in different ways depending on if it is a man or a woman? By doing an experimental survey, it is possible to detect psychological mechanisms in the society rather than peoples opinion. The reason for this is that in this kind of survey you get a context to every question. Karl de Fine Licht informed us that the psychological mechanisms within a society tend to be less varied than the opinions, which would make it easier for us to interpret the tendencies in the result. Karl de Fine Licht suggested that we could do an experimental survey where our project is described in two separate ways. The first description could be non-academic and describe our project in an easy but"

BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," SSE reflects the variance in a certain level and this random difference is due to the selected sample’s random. For example, the measured length of the microtubule will be different when we add taxol into the test tube.
On the basis of the theory, our F test statistics is:
$$ F = \frac{SSA/(n-k)}{SSE/(k-1)} \sim F(n-k, k-1) \tag{4}$$
The numerator of the equation is a part of the dependent variable which can be explained by the change of the independent variable, while the denominator of the equation can be explained by other random elements except the change of the independent variable. The proportion of the change of independent variable in all change of the dependent variable becomes bigger, in other words, F has a higher value, independent variable influence dependent variable more.
4.0 - The F-test on the data
Our F-test’s null hypothesis is:
$$ H_0:μ_1=μ_2=⋯=μ_k   \quad  vs  \quad  H_1=\quad not \quad H_0 \tag{5}$$
\(H_0\) stands for that different values of the independent variable（the added taxol‘s concentration) make no difference to the mean value of the dependent variable(the light absorption value OD350), in other words, the independent is not important to the dependent variable. Then we use R software to conduct F-test, the outcome is shown below:
Fig.5 Outcome of the F-test about the data
From the outcome, \(F’s\) value is 1.337,  nearly 1. Apart from that, the significance is 0.27, bigger than 0.05. Therefore, we can't think the independent variable make distinct influence on the dependent variable.
Differential Equation Model
For studying the dynamic progress of tubulin assembling under the influence of Taxol, we build the differential equations to describe such progress numerically.
First we have to consider what happened in the tubulin solution. Protein filaments will assemble into the tubulins automatically by arranging dimers. Specifically, the GTP-cap can aggregate or disaggregate at one side of the protein filament. Besides, there are chances that the GTP can hydrolysis to GDP, which can no longer combine the new GTP. In this process, the length and amount of the tubulin are in the dynamic equilibrium or changing.
We know that the differential equations can describe the numerical relationships and patterns between related promoters. Based on these studies, we can"

Moreover, the gene mutation can not be overlooked. Even from one cell of E. coli, the final number of cells after 100 multiplications is calculated as 2^100=10^30. For such a great number of cells, it is no wonder some of these are observed to gain mutation leading to loss of kill switch function.
Another problem might rise from a horizontal gene transfer. Procaryote cell can take in exogeneous DNA  from surrounding environment. If a wild strain took in gene derived from modified E. coli and that gene was not lethal one, the situation would be regarded as a irreversible release of modified gene.
To solute these problem, there are several method: installing kill switch repeatedly for insurance, using lethal gene which degradates host cell’s genome and plasmid, implementing suicide system which starts operating when expression pattern is not change for a certain time. Despite of plenty choices for safety, any choice is not sufficient for perfect protect. Although our project would be the technical basis for release of GMO, we shouldn’t forget discuss problems carefully.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Tag-Optimization_-_-_TEXT.html," the engineered indigoidine synthetases with the synthetic T-domains 1, 3 and 4 result in higher indigoidine yield compared to the native indC. Moreover, the indigoidine synthetase with the synthetic T-domain 1 exhibbits the highest indigoidine production, when coexpressed with Sfp, EntD and without supplementary PPTase.
Discussion
Motivated by the establishment of the Indigoidine-Tag, which enables the labelling of nonribosomal peptides, we wanted to further investigate the indigoidine synthetase indC [3] and thus the overall NRPS modularity in order to optimize the functionality of the indigoidine tag. In previous studies, direct T-domain exchanges have not been successful in the context of the indigoidine synthetase BpsA from S. lavendulae [6][7]. Furthermore, the endogenous PPTase EntD of E. coli was considered inefficient in the activation of the blue pigment synthetase BpsA [6]. Therefore, most studies in the field of NRPS are conducted with the PPTase Sfp from B. subtilis [11]. The family of 4'-Phosphopantheteinyl-transferases was reported to vary in substrate specificity [11]. Therefore, they can only activate specific NRPS module families [9]. We first investigated the production of indigoidine in five substrains of E. coli: TOP10 (Invitrogen), MG1655 [4], NEB Turbo (NEB), BAP1 [5] and Rosetta (Novagen), using an expression plasmid coding for the indigoidine synthetase IndC and the PPTase Sfp. Though differring in their growth behaviour, all substrains showed to be capable of producing the blue pigment indigoidine ( Fig. 3a ).
In our approach, we replaced single domains of the indC indigoidine synthetase module with both respective domains of other NRPS pathways from different organisms and entirely synthetic domains which were created based on multiple sequence alignments of 250 NRPS domains. We also created indC variants, in which different domain borders have been applied for the domain exchange ( Fig. 6 ), since setting the correct linker sequence is crucial for the NRPS function [7]. We used NRPS domains from Streptomyces lavendulae lavendulae ATCC11924 (blue pigment synthetase bpsA) [6], Brevibacillus par"
