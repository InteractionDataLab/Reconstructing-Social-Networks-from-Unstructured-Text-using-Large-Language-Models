Penn_State,2011,Team:Penn State#Plan#Safty_-_-_TEXT.html," coli should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being factored into the design of our device.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there are local biosafety groups at our institution, Environmental Health and Safety department at Penn State. This department is responsible for all safety aspects relating to environmental protection, occupational Healthy and Safety, and Radiation Protection. All researchers were required to attend a safety training program that informed us of lab safety procedures with regards to chemicals and biological hazards. The session was very helpful in providing safety information to our team.
Additionally, our team was required to submit a research proposal to a review committee called the Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC. This committee is responsible for research approval, advocating research safety, and promoting University research for commercial application. Our project idea was submitted to the committee for approval.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
To further enhance safety practices in the lab, all iGEM participants should be required to fulfill a safety requirement that is common to everyone. That way, standards to safety education can be determined and implemented that would ensure safe practices of all teams. A video lecture, developed by iGEM, should be made for all iGEM teams to watch. Then, once the video has been finished, a short quiz assessment should be filled to make sure that all researcher are knowledgeable on the procedures that video discusses.
Environmental Health and Safety has done a similar type of safety education program for our  researchers. Certificate of completion is available for all of the iGEM the team members.
Please use this page to answer the safety questions posed on the safety page .

Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Modeling#Fingerprints_-_-_TEXT.html," visualize hidden correlations in data which otherwise contains too many dimensions to view these correlations (2 , 3) . Principal component analysis was the chosen statistical procedure for its ability to encapsulate and reduce the dimensions of the data. A more elaborate explanation of how PCA works can be found in the method .
Results
Using PCA it was found that squalene contributes 80% of the first principal component. The first principal component, in turn was found to account for 90% of the total variance of the data. In other words, out of the 15 compounds measured, squalene alone accounts for 72% of the total variance, highlighting that squalene has a distinct pattern within the dataset.
Figure 1: This biplot shows the 15 dimensional data projected on a 2D space. The axes are based on the directions of greatest variance within the 15 dimensions. The blue lines represent each of the 15 lipid compounds and how much each of them contribute to both the first and second greatest variances PC1 and PC2. Squalene is seen here contributing 80% to the first PC.
To determine the relationship between fingerprint ageing both with respect to variation between donors, intradonal variation, and within each donor’s samples, interdonal variation, the data was plotted against the first two principal components.
Figure 2: Scoreplot shows the data projected on a 2D space through the first and second principal components. It represents how the fingermark samples age against time across all donors. There are 21 dots for each colour representing seven donors, each with three replicates. The scoreplot shows a there is no general trend for ageing fingermarks across all donors.
Figure 3: Scoreplot shows the data projected on a 2D space through the first and second principal components. There are 39 dots for each colour. One colour represents one donor and all of their aged fingermarks. This plot is an example of how changing the colour scheme of the scoreplot gives a different relationship. This graph shows that because the dots do not group together in their colours, it is not possible to link one of the seven donors to her/his fingermarks based on how the sampled fingermarks aged.
Figure 2 shows interdonal variation between all the donors and their aged fingerprint samples from all ageing intervals. Along the first principal component (PC), both inter and intra variation appear to increase. Moreover, this graph shows that individual donor samples do not distinctly group together which means that it would not be possible to deduce which fingerprint corresponds to which donor based on their PCs. The donor dots appear"

The biobrick is composed part of  the already existing K137076 [2008 Caltech] as well as the pvdQ gene and double  terminator sequence. The first 1,096bp of the K237076 biobrick containing the  LacI and LuxR promoters, two RBS, and the LuxR gene was amplified using the  standard Prefix primer and a newly designed Suffix primer.
We chose the biobrick K137076 to  ligate to the pvdQ gene for the following reasons:
 K137076   consists of a strong, continually expressed promoter (R0011) that can,   however, be further induced by IPTG. Such a promoter allows us to control   the expression of the LuxR protein.  
 
The complex formed when two   molecules of LuxR bind to two molecules of AHL, attaches to a palindromic   site on the pLuxR to transcribe the pvdQ gene.This pLuxR promoter however   causes leaky expression of pvdQ as it can be induced even in the absence of   LuxR and AHL.
 
 
3). Constitutive Promoter (pLacI) + Ribosomal Binding Site + LuxR Gene + Double Terminator + LuxR Promoter  (J09855) + Ribosomal Binding Site (B0034) + pvdQ Gene + Double Terminator  (B0015)
This biobrick was constructed such  that
 
4). LuxR Promoter (R1062) + Ribosomal  Binding Site, LuxR Gene, Double Terminator, & Ribosomal Binding Site (amplified  from K137076) + pvdQ Gene + Double Terminator (B0015)
This final biobrick is entirely an AHL-dependent system, as an identical  promoter controls the transcription and translation of both the LuxR and the  pvdQ gene. This LuxR promoter, unlike its Bba_R0062 counterpart, is only weakly  expressed in the absence of LuxR and AHL. However, a desirable positive feedback  mechanism is generated upon coupling of AHL with the LuxR protein.  The AHL-LuxR  complex binds to pLuxR and upregulates gene expression. As more LuxR  is expressed, subsequent pairing of the molecules further activates the  promoter. Thereby, a large yield of pvdQ is obtainable at low cell density. The  outcome is advantageous as biofilm formation can be interrupted at an early  stage.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2015,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Crowdfunding_-_-_TEXT.html," of Copenhagen this autumn.
Lithuania is a small country and it is a great honor and responsibility for us to represent our university – Vilnius University, and our region at such a prestigious event. We will have to compete with scientists from top-notch institutions like Cambridge, Harvard or Stanford.
The iGEM competition is part of the largest scientific conference in the field of Synthetic Biology. This year 282 teams will be judged and awarded in Boston, home of MIT. It’s a great opportunity to showcase your research findings, but most importantly make connections that can lead to potential business ventures and knowledge sharing.
When we started this iGEM project, we thought of it as a good opportunity to showcase our laboratory work to the research community. However, during the process we realized that we have a bigger social mission to address - to educate the society about GMOs and inspire the new generations of science students to come.
And we decided to use the power of crowdfunding to achieve these goals and prove that science can be fun and is a part of everyday life.

After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Description
Phase separation as a toolbox
In eukaryotic cells, macromolecules and proteins are organized into membraneless organelles. These organelles are structures which are formed through phase separation, induced by multivalent protein-protein interactions (PPI). Due to the lack of a membrane surrounding these organelles, a rapid exchange of components with the cellular environment can take place. Furthermore, photobleaching experiments have shown recovery within seconds to minutes, indicating that the structure of these organelles is quite flexible.[1] [2]
Phase separation in nature
Examples of membraneless organelles are nucleolus, P bodies and stress granules. There is a wide range of the biological functions that membraneless organelles facilitate. The nucleolus is an example of a membraneless organelle and it produces ribosomes. P-bodies, also membraneless, are required for the translation and transport of mRNA (lack of P-bodies results in large amounts of untranslated mRNA). Next to the protein processing, protein storage and transport, the organelles are also important for signalling. An example is the activation of MAP kinase by the clustering of binding partners to a phosphorylated TCR.[3] The work of Banani et al.[4] has shown that multivalent scaffold molecules can assemble and phase separate to form membraneless organelles. These organelles are also able to recruit certain client molecules, by binding these client molecules to the free domains of the scaffold proteins. The recruitment of these client can be modified by adding stoichiometric excess of a scaffold protein or by varying the scaffold valency.
How will we use phase separation?
In our project, we will use the known interaction of proteins 14-3-3 and CT52 to form protein constructs which can phase separate by addition of a small molecule protein-protein interaction stabilizer, e.g. fusicoccin. This construct is expected to have a hydrogel-like structure. A difference in valency between the two constructs, 4:3 (CT52:14-3-3), should lead to free domains in the construct. At these free sites, client molecules can be recruited. This way, it will be possible to enhance the construct with bioactive functionalities. With the formation of this hydrogel-like structure, we hope to gain foundational insights, increase the (iGEM) toolbox, and help with proving the concept of making synthetic organelles."

Constructing A Delay Switch, Multiple Ways
In principle, there are three ways to delay the activation of chemical communications;
Silencing the Speakers: Rate of signal accumulation down-regulated, for instance, by slowing down the signal generators.
Desensitize Receivers: Switching threshold elevated, for instance, by using insensitive receiver/ reporter systems.
Partial Blocking: Decreasing the by chewing the signal up.
Inter-species communications! We decided to go for the strategy inspired by Japanese-classic experience; Whenever we speak to somebody in English, we often experience a certain delay in activating the communication. We though this is exactly what we pursued in See Exp #4. . Same applies to the reverse, too. When somebody speaks to us, we definitely need some time (sometime infinite) to get activated. This is all in spite that he/ she was loud and clear enough. The less affinity (perception) we have to English, the longer we need to activate them. See exp #5.

Using the 3OC12HSL (Las-type) instead of 3OC6HSL (Lux-type) as signaling input, we could delay the activation of the LuxR/ LuxP switch for 2 hours. As of today, Oct 29th), this is the slowest delay switch in our hand.
Interestingly, we kept failing to observe the crosstalk between Lux-sender and receivers from other organisms. Interestingly, we never seen the function of cinI/ cinR from Rhiz"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," in the week, we prepared overnight cultures and plasmid mini-preps for the parts required to assemble the genetic circuit. We also created antibiotic solutions for spectinomycin, erythromycin, and lincomycin in preparation for the supercompetent B. subtilis colonies we were going to receive, along with future use. The B. subtilis strains were generously donated to us by Dr. Wong and Dr. Wu of the University of Calgary. Given the importance of these strains, we immediately prepared backup stocks of the received colonies and incubated them. Meanwhile, colony PCR was performed on E. coli. colonies containing tetR+RBS and the 5`integration, which we prepared beforehand. Dr. Wong recommended we do additional background research on the life cycle and biology of B. subtilis.
We learned that B. subtilis, like most bacteria, are dependent on quorum sensing when trying to induce competence. When B. subtilis cells cluster together and their cell density increases, a collection of small peptides (called competence hormones) are excreted from each cell and recognized by adjacent cells. Research shows that the cells will only become competent if the concentration of these peptides is quite high (Graumann, 2012) . Research was also done on sporulation, a process by which bacteria enter a dormant state in order to survive adverse conditions such as starvation, irradiation, and heat (Eichenberger, 2012) . As B. subtilis reach the stationary phase of their life cycle, some cells acquire competence while others sporulate (Maier, 2012) . We determined that B. subtilis' tendency to sporulate under extreme conditions may be beneficial for our purposes, as the durability of a B. subtilis spore would facilitate an easy transportation of our diagnostic tool around the world. In theory, the spores would not require refrigeration en-route to their destination and could be stored for significantly long periods of time.
In regards to sporulation, the mother cell and the foreshore are genetically identical, but certain proteins must be made specifically in the developing spore. Thus, certain set of genes transcribed from mother cell DNA must differ from the set transcribed from foreshore DNA. The sporulation sigma factors replace the principal negative cell sigma factor A in RNA polymerase holoenzyme - possibly by out competing sigmaA for RNA polymerase (Eichenberger, 2012) .

Lysis Characterization
Introduction
We cloned the Berkeley Lysis cassette ( BBa_K112808 ) under control of the T7 promoter into a low copy number plasmid ( pSB3K1 ).
We tested lysis of cells haboring this plasmid in a platereader experiment. Lysis resulted in a drop in optical density after induction with IPTG. We observed a strong dependence on IPTG concentration.
To learn more about how IPTG induction tests work, click here .
Experimental Setup
1) We made liquid cultures of BL21 cells containing the plasmids with the lysis cassette driven by a T7 promoter. These plasmids have Kanamycin resistance, so the cultures were made using 5 mL of LB medium with 5 uL of 50 ug/uL Kanamycin and grown overnight.
2) 1:10 dilutions of cells to LB medium were made by adding 100 uL of cells to 900 uL of LB with 1 uL of Kanamycin. From this 1 mL mix, we pipetted 100 uL into the wells of a 96 well plate.
3) Each well was covered with 20 uL of mineral oil to avoid evaporation. Then we set the platereader to shake continuously and take optical density measurements at 600 nm wavelength every ten minutes.
4) We waited an hour and a half (approximately) until the cells had reached their log-linear growth phase. Then we took out the plate and added 1 uL of IPTG to each well. We made triplicate data for each concentration of IPTG (0 uM for negative control, 50 uM, "

The primary problems with martian habitat development are the cost of sending materials up to Mars–it costs approximately $2.78 million dollars to send a single kilogram of material up to space [1]–and access to new materials when in space.
Proposed 3D Printed Design crafted from a composite from Mars. [2]
Proposed 3D Printed Design crafted from a Martian Ice. [3]
Current ideas that are being explore by NASA involve sending large 3D printers up to Mars that will print with materials sourced from Mars. More specific examples include a composite material made from martian regolith, or using ice found on planet [2, 3]. However, as we interviewed Dr. Michael Meyer, the lead Scientist of NASA’s Mars exploration program, it was highlighted that there are number of issues with these designs. Issues range from designing reliable material from components sourced from Mars to the cost of sending up such a large 3D printer (both in the production of such a large printer, as well as the actual cost per kilogram). Additionally, the materials sourced from Mars would most likely need to be supplemented with binders brought from earth, and could not be applied to interior design elements.
Our proposal to design a martian habitat from mycelium is therefore a strong concept, as it addresses many of the large concerns regarding habitat development on Mars, and bypasses the drawbacks of other proposed designs.
Instead of a large 3D printing machine, we would just need to send up a few spores of mycelium, a few supplemental nutrients, and a light-weight mold. Depending on the habitat’s design, we could either grow algae with carbon dioxide sourced from Mars or use martian regolith as the substrate for growth & binding. Furthermore, the mycelium has the potential to be genetically engineered to enhance its properties or have it produce other vital materials. It is also an extremely versatile material, and its mechanical properties can be manipulated. This creates the potential for it to produce everything from the exterior of the habitat to the softer interior products such as furniture and clothes"

Summary
This weekend we started classes in our university, also we had significant                                         advances in the verification of plasmid existence (project parts) in bacteria                                         colonies. We started production and purification of protein of interest. We had                                         an incident in the lab too, our centrifuge broke and the cellular lines died!
Dry lab
We tried to make a custom medium broth for collagen production and consulted                                         with a professor to reassure the calculous sheet was correct but the idea was                                         shut down because it could have had too many variables.
Wet lab
We started with protein production of protein LL37 of E. coli strains: Rosetta,                                         DH5a and BL21. The electrophoresis analysis in polyacrylamide gel of LL37                                         protein production was performed but no results were achieved, this could have                                         been due to lysis protocol, thus new purification protocols were revised. The                                         cellular lines of HaCaT and L929 had died because of a runout accident of CO2                                         master tank, producing acidification and loss of morphology, plans for                                         obtaining new aliquots of cellular lines started. The device BBCOL5 was tried                                         to ligate into plasmid pSB1A3, but no consistent results were achieved.
Week 31st

Summary
This week we had several team meetings to get some team building going and                                         continued the protein production for characterization. Also the first advances                                         of a complete hardware were finally achieved.
Wet lab
New protocols for purification of LL37 protein were done. RIPA buffer lysis                                         protocol was used but polyacrylamide gel analysis was not achieved because of                                         difficulties in visualization. We improved our polyacrylamide protocol and got                                         a new Coomassie solution given as a gift from one professor which really helped                                         us to visualize our gels more easily. For protein production analysis of the                                         project parts (BBLEP and BBTNC5), an induction curve was performed, in which                                         samples of each device transformed into BL21(DE3) were analyzed in a time lapse                                         of 9 hours after IPTG induction, taking aliquots of 1 mL per hour for                                         posterious protein analysis experiments, each aliquot was done by duplicated                                         and observed in spectrophotometer at OD600 to correlate protein production with                                         total biomass. Also we obtained new HaCaT cell lines.

NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," hazardous chemicals need special management.
Some labs implement strict regulation on hazardous chemicals.
Q9. What kind of personal protective equipment do you usually use?
The things used the most are: lab coats, gloves, and masks. Some labs also use goggles. In fact, there are indeed some students do experiments without any protective equipment. They told us they only wear gloves when using EB. That's a very dangerous habit. This equipment can lower the possibility for people from being hurt by the organisms or the chemicals they deal with.
Some labs require students to use personal protective equipment and put up reminders in the lab.
Initiate a reform in Nankai University
Faculty members are holding a meeting on the topic of hazardous chemical management in response to our advice.
We sent our findings to the president, and he attached great importance to our report. He asked for more details about what we have seen in the laboratories and told us to wait for their response.
Several days later, we received an email from his assistant. She told us that they have held a meeting to rectify and reform dangerous factors in the laboratories. She told us that we helped a lot in this work and the teachers will do their best to strengthen the management of the labs.
Integrating HP into our project
1. The experiment process
Safety has always been an important concern in our laboratory, both in project design and operation during experiment process. This year we used two kinds of Escherichia coli (DH5α in part construction and MG1655 in project). According to the official iGEM guidelines of Risk Groups, E. coli is categorized as a Risk Group 1 organism that ""do not cause disease in healthy adult humans"" when used properly. Also, the risk group level of E. coli is correspondent with our laboratory safety level (Safety Level 1). To make sure that everything is safe enough, we have seriously managed Individual Safety, Environmental Safety, Biological Safety based on project as well as Safe Shipping.
Individual Safety
1) All members participating in the iGEM project this year have taken safety training courses given by the department experiment center that we acknowledged general safety managements such as fire-fighting strategies, disposition of biochemical materials, proper usages of microwave oven, laminar flow bench and other apparatus.
2) All members have carefully read Safe Project Design, Safe Lab Work, Safe Shipment and other requirements proposed by iGEM Safety Committee. We filled up the Final Safety Form according to the real situation in our laboratory.
3) Nitrile gloves, masks, closed shoes were strictly required in laboratory to prevent potential threats of personal health.

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"532 as detergent and Reppal PES100 as polymer.
It has been reported that polymer can increase the efficiency of extraction and the system can be divided into two phases automatically without above cloud point. We used Reppal PES100 as polymer to do this experiment. However, it doesn’t work.
Formal experiment using Triton X-100 as detergent and HAc/NaAc as buffer.
The cloud point of Triton X-100 is 64-65 centigrade. We changed detergent and did this experiment again. We put the tubes in the heat block to make system separated. However, there aren’t any florescence in the detergent phase (the lower phase).
Formal experiment using Triton X-114 as detergent and HAc/NaAc as buffer.
The cloud point of Triton X-114 is 22 centigrade. We changed detergent and did this experiment again. We made the system separated at the room temperature, and used centrifuge to get a better separation. However, there aren’t any florescence in the detergent phase (the lower phase).
Summary
We used fusion proteins which are GFP-sJanus, GFP-sJanus-m, BFP-sJanus, BFP-sJanus-m, RFP-sJanus, RFP-sJanus-m, Cut1-sJanus, Cut1-sJanus-m to conduct this experiment. The results are as follows.
1.   The optimal volume of Berol 532 is 5% (v/v) of protein solution and temperature is 20 centigrade.
2.   The process of shaking is important. Generally, the speed of 300r/min working for 1h does work.
3.   The concentration of protein solution should be low.
4.   The optimal buffer is HAc/NaAc(pH=7.5).
In this experiment, we confirmed the strengths using aqueous two-phase systems and successfully separate the target proteins from bulk protein phase based on ATPS at a high partition rate. The most important is that we constructed a standard protocol to separate different kinds of proteins.
Design
This year, we focus on solving the protein purification problem in biological lab. As we talked about in the Protein Extraction Kit page in project description, we aim to replace the lengthy and expensive chromatography with Janus-based aqueous two-phase system. Our design shows many clever points.
Above all, we take advantage of synthetic biology, using the core of iGEM- BioBrick and RFC Assembly Method , to build a universal purification tag. This tag includes a linker containing TEV"
UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," In response to this we decided it would be best to regrow our colonies by making streak and index plates from the leftover colonies on our gibson pOPPY-UC19-yP and pOPPY-UC19-yXXU plates. With these newly grown colonies, we did a few more colony PCR reactions and still did not get any isolated bands.
At the end of the week, our sequencing results came. We observed that our gene fragments and homologous arms were not being inserted into the plasmid correctly. Each sample, although the right size, was incorrect and it seemed as if the plasmid was binding with itself. This led to more questions as to what went wrong. We first went back and double checked our design to make sure it was correct. It was. It wasn’t till next week when we figured out the issue.
Our colony PCR primers arrived, so we were able to check whether loxP was properly cut out using colony PCR. We made inoculations of E. coli carrying our pOPPY-XLR2-yX plasmid. We also made streak plates and liquid cultures using colonies from our previous round of YMC. We tested our “yeast miniprep protocol” using these liquid cultures, but received very weird (negative) DNA concentrations when we NanoDropped the products. We also intended to perform a miniprep on the E. coli carrying our pOPPY-XLR2-yX plasmid, but we had contamination in our negative control so we repeated the inoculations. These also ended up having contamination, so we asked our TA, McKenna Hicks, to give us a refresher on aseptic technique before repeating them again. We saw growth on our streak plates. We repeated the recircularization of pOPPY-XLR2-yX using site-directed mutagenesis, and plated transformed E. coli on LB/AMP to select for transformants.
After having a sufficient amount of our genes and having received our restriction enzymes (EcoR1-HF and Sca1), we were able to begin assembling our BioBricks together. We followed the protocols provided by iGEM for our restriction digest, ligation, and transformation. We began with the restriction digest protocol and adjusted for a lack of resources. Since we did not have the ideal buffer that iGEM recommended (NEB Buffer 2), we used the buffer we had in stock - CutSmart Buffer. One drawback of the buffer was its enzymatic activity of 50% for PstI, so to account for this, we doubled the amount of enzyme"
Toronto,2014,Team:Toronto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the overall proportion of mutants in the population.
In the kill switch scenario, the population of mutant cells increases quickly, so they are no longer susceptible to extinction by genetic drift. On the other hand, in the plasmid loss scenario, the number of mutants is kept low, so there is a greater chance for genetic drift to lead to extinction of the mutant allele.
The big-picture view of biocontainment
Ultimately, as noted by Paris Bettencourt's recommendations on biosafety , no containment system can be perfect.
In the case of our plasmid loss system, It is still possible that the mutant cells, carrying the engineered plasmid, could have enough of a fitness advantage to out-compete the wild-type individuals, who have lost the engineered plasmid. However, this outcome is no worse than the worst-case scenario of kill-switch systems. We expect that this worst-case scenario will be unlikely to occur, since plasmids impose a metabolic burden on their host cells. In addition. Even if the engineered trait do confer a slight fitness advantage to the resistant individuals, it may not be enough of a selective advantage to overcome the effect of genetic drift.
From the perspective of the fault-tree analysis proposed by Paris Bettencourt, our plasmid-loss system is more robust than the previous kill-switch approaches. While kill switches are only one mutation away from failure, our plasmid loss system tolerates mutations and reduces the chance of failure. Because of this, even if our plasmid loss system does not work 100% of the time, it is still an improvement to the overall safety of synthetic biology.

Then we selected the positive clones, incubated it at the tube, and measured the RFP intensity. Under the same condition, the fluorescence intensity of original promoter was 5000, and the PTet-1, PTet-2 and PTet-3 were about 200, while the selected No.25 was about 500.
Fig.2 RFP intensity measurement results. The original PTet has highest activity, while the strength of mutant PTet-25 is about 1/10 of the original one. Other mutants has considerably low activity.
Compared with the original promoter, the promoter activity after mutation was sharply decreased while the difference was obvious between the testing group (data over 200) and the negative control (data below 100). Since we employed PTet to control the expression of toxin proteins, it’s better that we can reduce the background expression as much as possible. The sequencing results confirmed the successful mutation of four mutants.

Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

A schematic phase diagram is shown here, with two regions: The upper region is representing a single phase of soluble molecules and the lower region is representing a two-phase coexistence of droplets and soluble molecules. Although the phase diagram typically shows just two parameters, this is just a slice of a multi-dimensional phase diagram that can include other parameters such as pH, or osmolarity.
Figure 4: Schematic phase diagram.
Eukaryotic cells possess non-membrane-bound organelles, a lot of them show an enhanced RNA and protein concentration and play roles in mediating RNA-protein complexes. Such organelles are generically referred to as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, e.g. the nucleolus. Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of RNA-binding proteins can phase separate. Those IDR phase separations are promoted by RNA, crowding agents, and low salts. A stabilization of the phase-separated droplets is achieved by the formation of amyloid-like fibers over time. In this process, IDR elements become less dynamic, which goes along with formation of fibrous structures.
It has been demonstrated that a single protein constituent can reversibly form membraneless organelles, both in vitro and in cells. The mainly proteinaceaous interior of membraneless organelles is partially excluding the bulk aqueous phase. Such organelles act like liquid droplets, being spherical with an internal mobility. The organelles enable a different solvent environment that causes an enhanced concentration of single-stranded RNA, while excluding double-stranded RNA. Phase separation of disordered proteins is a general mechanism for the regulated formation of membraneless organelles.
The disordered tails of Ddx4 proteins form phase-separated organelles both in live cells and in vitro. The Ddx4 proteins play a vital role for the assembly and maintenance of the related nuage in mammals, P-granules in worms, and pole plasm and polar granules in flies. In addition to a central DEAD-box RNA helicase domain that utilizes ATP to unwind short RNA duplexes, Ddx4 has extended N and C termini that are estimated to be intrinsically disordered. The Ddx4 protein shows conserved sequence properties which are responsible for the droplet formation: 8-10 blocks of changing net charge, while the positively charged regions show an over-expresion of FG, GF, RG, and GR motifs.

ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," 000 a.u. Therefore, we changed the RBS of INP-Annexin V and Annexin V to B0034. As can be seen in Figure 5 we can see a band at the expected 35.9 kDa. This confirms the expression of Annexin V in our cells. Even though the band is weak, which we expected for low expressed membrane proteins, it indicates that INP-Annexin V is also expressed, which can be seen with a band at the corresponding 70.4 kDa. To confirm that INP-Annexin V was on the membrane fraction we run both the unclarified cell free extract (called crude from now on) of each sample and the supernatant of the centrifuged sample. Annexin V is present in both fractions, while INP-Annexin V is only visible in the crude fraction (Figure 5), likely to be part of the membrane containing cell debris.
Figure 11. Western blot image of B0034-Annexin V and B0034-INP-Annexin. Samples of Annexin V and INP-Annexin V were loaded both with a low copy plasmid (pSEVA371) and a high copy plasmid (pSB1C3). Each time a sample of the crude and of the supernatant were loaded on the gel. Detection was performed with a monoclonal mouse anti-Annexin antibody with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody labelled with Alexa 488.
For the visualization of the Western Blot, we were forced to increase the sensitivity of the film a lot, which might indicate that the concentrations of the protein inside the cell are very low or that our primary antibody is not functioning too well.
INP-Annexin V externalization
Overview
After proving expression of our INP-Annexin V construct it is also crucial to test for it's functionality. We did so by using Protein G coated Dynabeads loaded with an anti-Annexin V antibody. The detailed protocol can be found in the experiments section.
We prepared two possible datasets:
Beads without loaded antibody. Five different conditions were compared:
INP-Annexin V-RFP in a high copy plasmid
INP-Annexin V-RFP in a low copy plasmid

For each construct, a threshold was determined to split the measurements into high-fluorescence and low-fluorescence cells (indicated with a red line on the figures below). The high-fluorescence sub-datasets were log10-transformed and a normal distribution was fitted. Mean and standard deviation for the log-normal distributions are reported below each histogram. The vertical red line indicates the threshold.
Figure 2: Histograms obtained from FACS measurements on strains with different plasmids containing GFP after the 4 promoters J23101, J23115, J23118, J23119 and the I20260 with J23101 followed by GFP. Mean and standard deviation is given in the histograms. The vertical red line indicates the threshold.
As we observe from these histograms the J23118 and J23119 are the strongest promoters. This is in agreement with the above described fluorescence measurement on the cell cultures. Here J23115 also induces the weakest signal.

British Columbia - 2012.igem.org
The Applications and Applicability of Engineered Microbial Consortia Our project sets a foundational advance by engineering microbial consortia with the purpose of distributing metabolic pathways to increase their efficiency, whereby they become more desirable from a biotech standpoint. We thus set out to find the following information from our industrial partners:
What are some potential industrial applications of engineered microbial consortia?
What advantages are there to employing biological methods versus current chemical methods?
How feasible is it to implement biological methods?
Are Research & Development sectors of current organizations/companies interested in pursuing synthetic biology options?
Our Approach Our team contacted Chevron and arranged a visit to the Chevron refinery in Burnaby, BC, Canada. We communicated with Chevron representatives to find out more about the existing methods of desulfurization and costs of refining crude oil. We connected with Alberta Innovates – Technology Futures (AITF) representative Karen Budwill and Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI) representatives John Vidmar and Nicolas Choquette-Levy to discuss the progress of our project and obtain some industrial insights.Industrial Insights
From our Chevron visit, we learned:
How refinery desulfurization works:
Sulfur-rich fuels are catalytically hydrogenated (hydrotreated) at high pressure (700 psi) and temperature (800 °F), creating H2S gas.
The H2S gas is absorbed from the fuel stream by being contacted with amines at high pressure.
The amines are then heated to release the H2S gas to the two-step Claus process.
In the first step of the Claus process, the H2S gas is partially combusted, creating water, elemental sulfur and sulfur oxides.
The Claus process's second step catalytically reacts the combustion products with more H2S, creating water and elemental sulfur with very high yields.
Industrial-scale desulfurization is massive. The diesel hydrotreater at Chevron Burnaby treats 18000 barrels of diesel fuel every day, removing 99.5% of the sulfur and taking it"

Regulations. We found that compared to the highly regulated clinical testing, our project may offer an easier and less controversial option for testing biofilms and anti-biofilm products.
Ethics. Public debates and the study of existing literature show the controversy around biotechnology and synthetic biology in particular. We discuss how the open-source and DIY mentality is double bladed: ease of access to technology can promote innovation and progress but raises complex security and safety issues.
Experts’ Opinion. To understand the context of biofilm industries and where does Biolink fit, we reached out to opinions of experts from biofilm research and industry. We received enthusiastic feedback about our idea, strengthen by a feeling of slow progress in biofilm industries.
The iGEM community is an excellent setting to show how our biofilm printer can be helpful in creating new competencies, when combined with other team’s projects. (For example, printing a molecular filter for water waste treatment with iGEM Berlin)
P&P Tool. To better understand the goals and direction of a project, one needs to take in account the views of people both inside and outside a project. We designed a tool that can quantify external opinions on a project and internal perception on goal clarity and teamwork.
Business Plan. A deep analysis of our project from a business and market perspective broadened our horizons. By positioning Biolink into a network of stakeholders - suppliers, investors, researchers, clients, competitors - we showed that our project has what it takes to make it into a real business. Moreover, we devised a short tutorial for future iGEM teams for writing a business plan - an essential, and many times overlooked, perspective that any team should have.
Outreach. We reached out to the public to show the opportunities of synthetic biology and see how they feel about our project. All quotes in our website are from interviews or questionnaire responses.
Regulations
We found that compared to the highly regulated clinical testing, our project may offer an easier and less controversial option for testing biofilms and anti-biofilm products.
This section first discusses synthetic biology regulations, and then details possible regulations of our project. Synthetic biology is a multi-disciplinary science that has seen much advance in past years. However, there still is some confusion about what regulations apply to the field, because Synthetic biology is a broad term. When one or more synthetic biology aspects are specified, discussions about regulation and safety are clearer.
Different regulations apply for different regions. In the European Union, the European Commission considers to apply the existing regulatory framework"

Philipp Boeing
I have been involved in iGEM at UCL since 2011. This year, apart from advising our undergraduate team, I wanted to try something new with iGEM E. I'm very interested in DIYbio, citizen science in synthetic biology and the lot - so being involved in Darwin's Toolbox excited me a lot.
Bethan Wolfenden
I am a biochemist by background, and I enjoy combining interdisciplinary science with different audiences. I believe experiential learning is the best way to get to grips with new subjects, particularly important emerging technologies like synthetic biology.
Tom Catling
I'm a PhD student in UCL's Optical Science Lab working on thin mirrors for x-ray telescopes. I enjoy making all sorts of stuff and met the other IGEM E team members through UCL's Institute of Making. Biotech is a really interesting field and I firmly believe in a technically and scientifically literate society, so I thought this project sounded very interesting.
Oliver Coles
I'm a PhD student in astronomical instrumentation, specifically focusing on optics, data analysis and target selection for future spectrographic instruments designed to probe dark energy. As a fan of the open source hardware and maker movement I'm excited to be able to work on a project to enable a wider group of people to have fun with biotech.
Desmond Schofield
I am a EngD student in the Department of Biochemical Engineering at UCL working on the production of a biotherapeutic protein for a novel cancer therapy. I enjoy interdisciplinary work and the application and commercialisation of scientific concepts. I am excited to be involved with Darwin's toolbox as it is a chance to expand the use of synthetic biology into new areas and gives me an opportunity to take a hands-on approach to bringing a technology to market.

Results & Discussion
1. Susceptibility to H2O2 in Escherichia coli
In the E.coli Pen, we utilized the hydrogenperoxide (H2O2)-responsive system of E.coli cells to make different colors. It is well known that H2O2 shows the concentration-dependent toxicity for E.coli cells. In order to determine the utilizable concentration of H2O2 in the E.coli Pen, we monitored the susceptibility of E.coli cells (DH5 Alpha) against H2O2.
<Experiment method>
The 1st day evening
Precultivation of DH5 Alpha cells
DH5 Alpha cells on a LB plate were picked up with the sterilized toothpick, inoculated into 2 ml of LB (amp-) medium in a test tube, and then precultured at 37˚C (overnight).
The 2nd day
Survival test
All of the precultured DH5 Alpha cells were transferred into 28 ml of a fresh LB (amp-) medium in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask.
↓ DH5 Alpha cells were cultivated at 37 ˚C until the optical density (OD600) of the medium became 0.4~0.6.
↓ The culture was equally dispensed (2 ml each) into sample tubes, and then cells were treated with various concentrations of H2O2 (final concentrations were as follows: 1 pM, 10 pM, 200 pM. 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1μM, 10μM, 100μM, and 1 mM) at 37 ˚C for 60 min.
↓ Samples were diluted by mixing 1 ml of fresh LB medium and 1μl of each sample.
↓ 10 μl of the diluted sample was spread out on a LB plate (amp-) and"
Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"reshold limited value figure 5: Permissible ultraviolet exposure these effects.The UV source that have been used in this project is a GW6 Sylvania, a lamp that emitt UVC at 253,7nm near the absorption's peak of DNA with an optical output power of 1,6W; to use it safely we built a box of mdf(medium density-fibreboard) that surrounds the lamp and using a diaphragm that allows passage only to the light absorbing the remainder. Moreover we insert in that box two pierced brackets, those permits to choose the distance between the lamp and the sample and then in accord with the Lambert-Beer law's the exposure time.
mdf box structure
Finally we embedded this structure in a polistyrene box for its handling and greater safety.(figure 6)
Gel matrix
Our project use UV light for its space selectivity, that gives the possibility to irradiate a target zone without interfering with the other. To do that we build a mold to make a matrix of agarose gel;this give us a square of 25mm side's with 16 cells inside where we can locate bacteria.
Once do that is easy with an optical mask, like those used in photolithography for electronics circuits, stimulate only the selected bacteria.To realize this device we use palsticard because it is very easy to shape and clean. The mold is made of two parts that will form a sandwich with the slide: one will create the shape  of the gel matrix the other is a cover that that will give the picture into gel .
The matrix is obtained through the pressure of the cover part over the mold part
and that is the result:

Project Description
Sections
Darwin is a software package to document changes to DNA which allows for easy, standardized, and collaborative editing on DNA data up to the genome scale. It builds off of tested and proven version control software, so the entire history of the tracked data is easy to browse and transfer. But Darwin is specifically focused on DNA data, speeding up the tracking process and offering significant security improvements from any current system.
Because Darwin uses existing version control systems, the majority of the heavy lifting is complete already; Darwin can be installed right on top of the existing software. Darwin's contribution is to parse and format the biological data so that it can be used more effectively with these systems. It uses a variety of heuristics to effectively split the data and granularize the changes made to produce change logging orders of magnitude more time- and space-efficient than any other method.
Current Status
The project in its current status can be found in its repository on github . Documentation on the produced software tool can be found on the Program page
The project description is split into four main sections:
Motivation
Process
Experimentation
Conclusions
It's important for teams to describe all the creativity that goes into an iGEM project, along with all the great ideas your team will come up with over the course of your work.
It's also important to clearly describe your achievements so that judges will know what you tried to do and where you succeeded. Please write your project page such that what you achieved is easy to distinguish from what you attempted.

SspB
SspB proteintargets proteins tagged with modified degradation tag, ssrA, and deliver them to ClpXP for proteolysis.  Modified ssrA tags are fused onto the 3’ end of a gene. In our project Hin protein is tagged with the modified ssrA.  Hence we will be able to control the degradation of Hin proteins by controlling the expression of SspB.The sequence is taken from E. coli strain MG1655. Genbank accession number is NC_000913.2.
The 498 bp long sspB CDS is amplified by PCR with dangling end primers with EcoRI-NotI-XbaI restriction sites at the 5’ and SpeI at the 3’. The resulting PCR product is cut with EcoRI and SpeI and inserted into a Biobrick compatible vector cut with the same enzymes.
Primers
We used the following primers to amplify SspB:
Forward primer: GATCTGGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGATGGATTTGTCACAGCTAAC
Reverse Primer: TGTGACACTAGTATTACTTCACAACGCGTAATGC
Ara Promoter/Operator
The purpose of this system is to enable us to control the expression of sspB, the degradation controller. In this way we have a third level of control over hin expression levels within the cell. The system is inducible by arabinose, therefore we can alter the arabinose levels to regulate hin degradation.
The 156bp long bindingsite_promoter_bindingsite_RBS  is amplified by PCR with dangling end primers with EcoRI-NotI-XbaI restriction site at the 5’ and SpeI at the 3’ and inserted into a Biobrick compatible vector. The sequence is taken from wildtype Bacillus subtilis.
Primers
We used the following primers to amplify the ara promoter/operator:
Forward:GATCTGGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAGCACAGCGTTCTTTGTAAG
Reverse:TGTGACACTAGTAGCCCTCCCGAATGTTGAG
SacA integration region
The SacA CDS codes for a dispensable protein, similar to AmyE, and therefore can be disrupted and used as an integration site without harming cell metabolism. When inserted into Bacillus subtilis integration vector, the sac region will provide a single crossover site copying the whole plasmid into the bacterial chromosome. The following sequencher diagram"

Miniprep of CB Bottom for ligation
We performed another miniprep on the CB Bottom plasmid, but this time we concurrently performed a miniprep on PZE22G that had been grown overnight in LB+Kan.
Miniprep results. PZE22G had excellent yields, while CB Bottom did not.
Because the yield of the PZE22G miniprep is in the range that we expect (100-200 ng/ul), while the yield of the CB Bottom miniprep is still so low, we concluded that our problem is likely due to the plasmid or LB+spec media. We made new LB+spec. In the future, we could also pick new colonies and grow them up in cultures.
We were planning on using the miniprep product in our ligation reaction. We originally thought that we would need 100 ng of DNA for the reaction, but then we were told that we could have as little as 20 ng of DNA. We decided that in that case, our current yields were sufficient.
Ligation of CB Bottom backbone and F1
We wanted to insert an F1 into a CB backbone today. Yesterday, we cut the CB Bottom plasmid, in preparation for the ligation reaction. Today we gel purified the product. It was difficult to tell exactly which band was the one we were looking for, so we cut out 2 just to be safe. Our gel purification yields were:
Top band: 23 ng/ul
Bottom band: 16 ng/ul
We attempted to cut the F1 oligo from the plate using Bsa1. Our product after cutting was 79 bp, which is technically smaller than the 100 bp minimum for PCR purification. However, we attempted the PCR purification anyway, because this cut-off is unlikely to be strict. We then ran a gel to see the band size of the product that remained. Because our first gel was unsatisfactory, we repeated the digestion a second time.
Attempt One:
Digestion reaction recipe:
2ul DNA
8 ul 1x BSA/Buffer 4 solution
0.5 ul Bsa1
PCR purification yield: 34 ng/ul
Our first digestion did not show any bands below 100 bp.
Attempt Two:
Digestion reaction recipe:
2ul DNA
1 ul Bsa1
50 ul buffer BSA
PCR purification yield: 33.5 ng/ul
We also kept a sample of unpurified PCR"

Overview
   - Assembled and sequence verified Venus cassette plasmid and pp2551 cassette plasmid
    - Assembled the multigene sensing assembly
    - Tested another version of the sensing assembly and demonstrated that it works
Production Circuit
Our team did not have an assay to get quantitative measurements concerning the production of L-DOPA in our production assembly. However, by itself, L-DOPA will oxidize to melanin. As a result, to get qualitative results concerning our production assembly, we grew up our production cells in LB media containing 5 mM tyrosine and 0 mM tyrosine and then observed if a color change occurred. The diagram above shows such a color change. Our production assembly did observe a similar color change, but the change in color was not very pronounced.
Sensing Circuit
We tested a sensing construct that was similar to our sensing construct in design but built with different methods and parts. Instead of Venus fluorescence protein, this sensing circuit expressed e2-crimson, and was inserted into a pMMB67EH vector, while in our sensing construct, the Venus gene was inserted into a pET28 vector. Both constructs were transformed into Top 10 E. Coli strain and used in the fluorescence detection assay. We found that the fluorescence intensity in the cell increased as the amount of L-DOPA in the media increased for the lab construct. However, we found that our sensing construct, in the presence of L-DOPA, showed increased expression of fluorescence when certain amounts of L-DOPA were present in the media. You can see a slight increase in fluorescence from no L-DOPA to 100 uM of L-DOPA. However, the data shows that a lower level of fluorescence was detected when 1 mM of L-DOPA was present, which is different than the predicted outcome. These data suggest that different combination of vector plasmid and E. coli strain might have a different effect on the inducibility of sensing construct. Therefore, further study is needed to find out the best combination of vector and E.coli strain for this sensing construct.

iGEM Dynamics: A Social Scientist's View
One evening in mid-August, a social scientist from IIT Delhi working on his PhD arrived on campus to discuss iGEM with us: having been exposed to iGEM through iGEM 2015's Team IISER Pune, Mahendra Shahare became fascinated with the concept of undergraduates working as a group on synthetic biology over the summer and presenting their results on an open, international platform. In fact, a section of his PhD thesis discusses iGEM as a vehicle to promote synthetic biology among young scientists around the world.
For over an hour, three members of our team discussed multiple facets of iGEM with him: the formation of our team, the development of our project, how we split up work among ourselves, our collaborations with other teams, our human practices activities, and how we interacted with our mentors and instructors.
Mahendra and Raj after a hot cup of coffee
The social aspects of science became quite apparent to us over the course of our discussion: iGEM had made us interact with so many groups of people — professors, mentors, instructors, industry, government officials, salesmen, HR representatives, sponsors, students, peers and the public — without us even realizing it!
Science is a social endeavor — more true today than ever, with the advent of the Information Age — and to truly develop as scientists, we must learn to embrace the notion that no man is an island. Our iGEM team, comprising students with different specialties and interests, is an excellent example of a social framework that allows science to progress one step further.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," system in VibriXpress will deliver a much higher amount of protein in a shorter time. This way we would like to speed up your scientific progress. In 100 years of research with E. coli, BL21 is not the only used strain with a T7 expression system. Strains like Lemo21(DE3) (commercialized by NEB) are designed for fine-tuning of T7 expression especially for difficult targets. This fine-tuning is achieved due to the variation of the lysozyme (lysY) level, a gene encoding a variant of phage T7 lysozyme. The T7 Lysozyme is an inhibitor of T7 RNA Polymerase (Moffatt & Studier 1987) , (Zhang & Studier 1997) . By reducing the basal T7 RNA Polymerase activity toxic genes can be expressed in the same cell under control of a T7 promoter. Because of its ability to inhibit transcription the T7 lysozyme is often used for controlling expression in systems based on T7 RNA Polymerase ( Studier & Moffatt 1986) .
In strains like Lemo21(DE3) the level of lysozyme can be optimized by inducing LysY with L-rhamnose to alleviate inclusion body formation or inhibitory effects from toxic proteins. In future, we will need to engineer this kind of specialized strains for troubleshooting as well in V. natriegens.
In addition, more research is necessary to study V. natriegens specific proteases, their function and their strength. Of course, we could not find an aspartyl protease similar to OmpT of E. coli, but this does not rule out that V. natriegens possesses other proteases that are crucial for protein degradation during overexpression. Finding highly active proteases and deleting them would further improve the amount of produced protein.
What about all the scientists that would like to use other expression systems than T7? As we mentioned before the T7 system is not always the first choice for protein overexpression. Other commonly used promoters like the synthetic trc promoter or T5 promoter are recognized from E. coli RNA Polymerases and do not require a genomic integration of a phage RNA polymerase (Erfle et al. 1985) , (Gentz & Bujard 1985) . We could show, that these promoters are recognized from the V. natriegens RNA polymerase as well Click here to read more about the different promoters , enabling you to use the potential of this impress"
METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," based on PartsRegistry Survey Results
First suggesiton is offering fartnership with Google for easy search     and founding a committe to enforce a standardized nomenclature for terminology     and parts registry entries.
We strongly suggest starting a forum on how to quantify the performance     of promoters and genes to bring an easy to measure standard for the     efficiency of the parts. Additionally iGEM should assume the responsibility     and provide the measurements for the each promoter and gene included     in the distributions. The second choice would beeven better in terms     of standardization as all the measurement will be performed by one center     under similar conditions and with experienced researchers, which will     allow user to compare and contrast the efficiencies of the parts more     accurately. We suggest excluding the parts not-working, low rated or     with negative feedbacks from the annual distribution plates but still     archive them and make their data available through the parts registry.     So the while the individuals labs are receiving plates with higher rated,     fully working parts for their projects, anyone who wants to work on     a more exotic part can search through the achieves and re-vitalize the     parts stored there. The challenge of re-vitalization of parts can be     encouraged as an collaborative effort. We are sure, all of us would     like to see gene-protein and pathway information if these information     was integrated into the database and offered automatically for each     entry in the database. We are planning to provide this information about     the parts to all parts registry users as a build-in option in the next     version of BioGuide in iGEM 2011.
Database Standardization
Two main focuses of our project was the organization of the available     information about Biobricks on iGEM’s website and development of a software     application to help synthetic biologists at the experimental set-up     level by providing all available construct combinations for any given     input and output relations ,which they can utilize for their own project.
Normalization and re-organization of the part information at iGEM’s     web site was needed in order to develop our application, which will     automatically search the possible construct combinations. For the organization     and analysis of the Biobricks, we used part info for Spring 2010 distribution.     The information on all three 384 well plates distributed by iGEM scrutinized     and checked individually to specify the standards available and needed.     iGEM is providing so many parts within a hierarchical way, but there     is no order in the information flow and no common standards. Furthermore,     the information bulk is being used in an ineffective manner. Some"

Introduction
The well being of others is an important factor in all scientific work.  Many scientific advances of recent years have been pioneered in order to improve the lives of those in the community, as well as across the world.  Synthetic biology is an emerging scientific field that may hold the key for a new frontier of technological advancement, but with a new field comes new safety concerns, new security issues, and an entirely re-inspired view on conduct both in and outside of the lab.
It is important to step back and look at the potential health and safety aspects of any synthetic biology project, in order to understand and improve our knowledge of basic biosafety and biosecurity practices.
Lab Safety
Our project involves live bacteria, and therefore, poses a threat to members of our lab if not proper precautions are not taken.  Our E. coli will have been designed to intracellularly produce antimicrobial peptides (AMP) upon entry to the small intestine, inducing E. coli cell death.  If some of our E. coli were to be accidentally ingested by a member of the lab, assuming the bacteria survive the acidity of the stomach, they would burst within the gut. Because the AMP in question is protegrin-1, which is derived from humans, it will not attack the membranes of the host’s cells; however, the destruction of E. coli, a gram-negative bacterium, will result in the release of endotoxins trapped within the membrane, potentially inducing septic shock.  In order to minimize the risk of contamination, gloves and lab coats will be worn at all times to prevent accidental contact.  Furthermore, we have received documents explaining our lab safety protocols in detail, and copies will be kept both in the lab alongside the copies we bring home.
Biosafety
The risk of releasing genetically-engineered microorganisms (GEMs) from the lab is a growing concern amongst synthetic biologists.  Upon accidental release, our E. coli would need to find food to survive in outside world, and since this strain is both non-pathogenic, as well as endemic to the human gut, the chances of it replicating uncontrollably outside the lab are slim, but not impossible"

Guanajuato_Mx,2016,Team:Guanajuato Mx#ResultsAndDiscussions#MolecularLab_-_-_TEXT.html," At the beginning we designed primers to amplify the lysozyme from leukocytes, we obtained RNA and then synthesized cDNA for using as template to obtain the lysozyme gene. Nevertheless, we were not able to amplify the lysozyme gene, so we decided to look for other options. Alginate is hydrolyzed by alginate lyase (Farrell and Tipton, 2012), one of the main component of P. aeruginosa biofilm (Tielen et al., 2013), but this  gene was not found in the registry. We analyzed the genome of one strain of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis AM65-52 (GenBank accession number: CP013275.1) and found a putative alginate lyase gene, so we designed primers to amplify this gene. It is important to indicate that there is no report of the cloning and characterization of an alginate lyase in B. thuringiensis. In this regard, we amplified for the first time a putative alginate lyase genes from a strain of B. thuringiensis, obtaining an amplicon of between 1.5  and 2.0 kpb in B. thuringiensis 4Q7 and B. cereus (Figure 2). We decided to continue working with amplicon of 4Q7 and it was ligated into the pCold to generate the pCold-algy and was transformed in E. coli. Also we sequenced the algy gene at Langebio, México. As pCold allows that alginate lyase be 6X His-tagged, we are in process of purification with Ni column to study the effect on alginate and P. aeruginosa biofilms.

But before any of the previously discussed possibilities can become a reality, we must continue to prove the current biosensor and make sure that it works as we expect it to. We encourage future iGEM teams to come up with new and novel implementations of this system and adapt our construction to their needs. We are confident that in the future, these new type of sensors and genetic constructions will be commonplace in the industry and will help in the development of new, powerful tools for the environmental, medical and industrial areas.

Results: In general, the Spinach2 without ligand dependency has the highest fluorescence. The results show that the c-di-GMP Aptamer Spinach2 emits fluorescence at 500 nm. Similar data was not observed by the c-di-GMP Mutant Spinach2 which means that a mutation changes the specificity of the aptamer.

Vector: digestion of PSB1C3 and PSB1K3 carrying I20260 via EcoRi and PstI
Insert: digestion of PSB1K3 carrying I20260 via EcoRi and PstI
Ligation with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs)
Required device 2, 3 and the 19 constructions for the entire Anderson library: promoters were inserted into PSB1C3 carrying E0240. Process is described on following figure 1.
Vector: digestion of PSB1C3 carrying E0240 via EcoRI and XbaI
Insert: digestion of PSB1C3 carrying K823012* and J61002 carrying J23100 to J23119 via EcoRI and SpeI

Photobleaching of GFP. Documentation of the decrease in fluorescence signal of GFP over time when irradiated with light of 367 nm (cyan) and 465 nm (dark blue).
Furthermore, there was no regeneration of the fluorescence detected for the samples bleached with UV-light after 12 hours while the fluorescence of samples irradiated with blue light returned back to approx. 98 % of its initial intensity in just 180 minutes.
Reversible photobleaching of GFP. Documentation of the decrease in fluorescence signal of GFP over time when irradiated with light of 465 nm (light green). Dark green: Regeneration of the fluorescence 180 minutes after the 1 hour irradiation process.
This indicates that there are two different bleaching effects of GFP occuring at the irradiation with blue light and with UV-light. The reversible bleaching with blue light is probably caused by common bleaching of fluorophores after long excitation times while the irreversible bleaching with UV-light might be caused by actual damage of GFP.

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ . The final result is the channel capacity.
Do our circuits work?
Yes, they do sense the input level of Dox concentration. The transfer curves of all seven groups are illustrated below. All values are in logarithm space. Note that for the convenience of plotting, the points where Dox=0 are plotted at Dox=0.01. (or the point will fly out far to negative infinity)
In the leftmost figure, EBFP2 without intein sequence show relatively low affinity and thus low expression level. Nevertheless, their leakage level is low as well, and Dox induction leads to approximately  fold change. As for the middle and right figures, both split EBFP2 with intein and intact EBFP2 have about  fold change when induced by Dox, but split EBFP2 have lower leakage level.
Meanwhile, if one half of EBFP is driven by constitutive promotor CMV, the leakage level remains the same but the induced multiple suffers. This is expected beforehand because with one constitutively-expressed part, the circuit can only sense the input with one half of the split proteins, thus becoming slightly less inducible.
Normalizing the curves lead to more interesting discoveries. Even though TRE-EBFP2N + CMV-EBFP2C leads to poor fold change, the transfer curve is significantly steeper when the dimerization process is reversible. This means better switch-like properties. With the presence of intein, the effect is weaker but still visible.
Normalize transfer curves to the range of 0 to 1, we can find that the shapes are different. Lines representing split proteins are later to rise and steeper.
If we normalize the initial EBFP2 level to 1, split EBFP2 with intein displays better properties than the other two settings. From fig. we can clearly see that it has the highest multiple among the three, even significantly higher than that of the intact EBFP2. The result shows that split proteins, with high binding affinity, can defeat original undivided proteins for their low leakage level and high induced multiples, that is, high sensibility to inputs.
How well do circuits perform as evaluated by channel capacity?
Seven circuits are evaluated in our experiment. Calculated channel capacities are displayed in fig.
Come on, this not as dizzying as it is at the first glance. Let’s look at it step by step.

Dry lab:
Now that the subject is defined, and that the bibliography is done, let’s prepare our constructions! What we have done:
selected and adapted genes
designed primers
ordered gBlocks
ordered the material (enzymes, kit…)necessary for the project
Wet lab:
Having a good control of the basic experiments, as enzymatic digestion or transformation for example, is important to ensure the lab work during the summer. We have done PCR, digestion, ligation, and transformation for clonings during a week, being supervised by PhD students.
Dry lab:
In parallel, we finished ordering gBlocks from IDT, and we refined the gene design.
Wet lab:
First of all, we had to digest the backbone pSB1C3, which have to received each of our parts. Thus we obtained high quantity of pSB1C3 plasmids with RFP insert due to cultures, and we purified and digested it with the enzymes EcoRI and PstI. As the gBlocks were received, we did PCR to amplify them and create a stock. Most of the PCR worked, but not all of them. Thus, we start trying to clone the good amplicons in the backbone pSB1C3, but it fail because of a lack of genetic material.
We asked to iGEM Munich 2012 to send us four shuttle backbones, that can be used in E. Coli as well as in B. subtilis. We amplified them and stocked them. In parallel, we have done petri dishes with several antibiotic resistances to have it in advance in stock.

Sequencing and improving part characterization, testing the entire project on chip and wiki
Elia, Lena, Lisa, Malek:
We sequenced the GamS that was inserted into the iGEM backbone to check if all was correctly done.
We decided to improve the characterization of the LacZ toehold in cell free medium, thus we tried out the system in various lysates.
John, Matteo:
We moved on to testing the entire project on chip. Expressing toehold on the chip using a substrate of β-Galactosidase. The whole system was tested in Top10-GamS and M15-T7 lysate. Unfortunately there was some leakage on the chip, ruining the experiment.
Tim:
Started discussing how pulldown sandwich assays should then include the flowing of lysate with toehold, to see if said toeholds could correctly be triggered by sequences present on positive pulldowns.
This week the entire team's focus gradually started shifting towards the elaboration of the wiki.
09/10/2017 - 15/10/2017
Gibson and transformation, amplification, testing software toeholds, repeating chip experiment and failing and wiki, wiki
Elia, Lena:
We did Gibson assemblies of GamS followed by the transformation of cells with the assembled plasmids. Failure was on the menu.
Lisa:
The amplification of the aptamer extended with a T7 promoter and complementary trigger sequence was the main focus of the week. However, said amplification was unsuccessful.
Malek:
The various toeholds generated by the software needed to be tested to confirm that it functioned correctly, and indeed it does. This week also included giving a hand with colony PCRs and PCRs for the Gibson assembly.
John, Matteo:
We repeated last week's experiment with a slight difference, a stronger buffer. This time we had signal everywhere, even where the trigger extended aptamer was absent.
With the wiki-freeze approaching the wiki comes more and more into focus.

Figure 9. Comparison of the interaction between the gRNA and the amplicon for the three different gRNAs we investigated: on the left the original gRNA, on the right two new designs conceived not to target the probe
Finally, we realized that the proportion of the MFE structure for probe 1 was significantly lower than the proportion obtained for MFE structures of probes from Qiu et al., 2018 (e.g. Probe 2,                               64.82%) or other probes we designed (e.g. Probe 8, 57.47%). Consequently, the proportion of co-existing single-stranded structures is supposed to be reasonably higher for Probe 1 than for Probes 2 and 8: this analysis indicates                               that by exploring our other probes, we can potentially improve on the sensitivity and specificity of our RCA+Cas12a assay.
*The total number of secondary structures grows exponentially with the sequence length, and can be estimated in approximately 1.8N, with N being the sequence length, not even considering possible tertiary interactions ( SantaLucia Jr and Hicks, 2004 ). Existing software are limited to produce all structures within a given energy range (e.g. RNAsubopt) or only few relevant structures                               (e.g. Mfold) ( Theoretical Biochemistry Group ). Providing the estimate of the effective concentration of ssDNA is our solution is therefore not possible, but we believe                               that the frequency of the MFE structure could still be a valid qualitative indication of the amount of (remaining) unexpected structures of our probes which might cause non-specific activation of Cas12a.
Conclusions/Improvements
We were able to understand the reasoning behind the probes for Rolling Circle Amplification of let-7a-5p from Qiu et al., 2018 and to rationally translate their design for Cas9 detection into our probes                       for Cas12a. We then successfully phosphorylated and ligated the oligonucleotides into our actual probes.
We were able to show amplification with different designs of our probes, both with agarose gels and with real-time fluorescence measurement with SYBR Green I. We also proved that the amplification was specific for our miRNA target,                       and proportional to the original concentration of miRNA.
Reproducibility of our successful result needs to be improved, and different hypotheses remain open and would need to be investigated to understand the reason for the occasional promiscuous activation of Cas12a in the presence of samples                       with no miRNA.

NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," The illness comes up repeatedly and the treatment cycle is long as well as expensive. Because it's a lifelong illness and you need to take a pill every day after being hospitalized. Better drugs like biologics are expensive, even up to about 10,000 USD a month. Less effective drugs are not covered by Medicare. Coupled with the repeated illness needs to be looked after by the family and society has brought a burden. The financial and mental burden of an inflammatory bowel disease patient is enormous.
Later, doctors also told us that there has always been a large number of patients who have got inflammatory bowel disease, while more than 20 IBD patients in a floor of this inpatient department. Crohn's disease primarily affects young people while ulcerative colitis occurs at all ages. Patients are more likely to choose medication and few will undergo surgery.
The interview exposed problems with existing treatments, such as the difficulty of effectively curing IBD for long. The rapid spread of inflammatory bowel disease is taking a huge toll on individuals, families and society. It also presents huge health risks, as more and more people are getting sick and the situation will only get worse if they are not dealt with in time. Patients and society are looking forward to the emergence of a new type of treatment. Our team should not blindly pursue curative effect when designing the scheme, but also consider the economic benefits and accompanying risks.
5 Vegetable Planting
In addition to IBD patients, we want everyone to have a healthier gut. So we're going to grow broccoli this fall. Thanks to the efforts of our team members, we successfully cooperated with the university to open up a small field of broccoli on the unbuilt campus wasteland.
Broccoli is not only our source of sulforaphane, but also an accepted healthy dish.We plan to distribute our broccoli to IBD patients, campuses and surrounding communities, hoping that people will pay attention to gut health and develop healthier eating habits.
Thanks for everyone’s time and support. We believe that more and more people will pay more attention to their intestinal health in the future and give more care and understanding to IBD patients, be interested in synthetic biology, and be willing to contribute to the cause of human health.

Furthermore, if role models and mentors around her were saying that it is impossible to do both and have a career, then we are left questioning again what can we do to change the attitudes of males and females alike? We need to emphasise that it is possible to have a family and a career and that higher positions in science aren’t just male roles. Dr Wilson highlighted for academic jobs in Bioscience at the University:
Thirty percent of the job applications are from female applicants, and about seventy percent of the applications come from male applicants.
We have to question whether this is symptomatic of inherent gender inequality in science, or if there are genuinely fewer women that want to apply for academic jobs in Bioscience at the University. Could this be due to a bias at the application processing stage of the process or is there some kind of unconscious bias involved that could be affecting this?
If you are seeing fewer seminars given by female scientists, if you’re simply seeing fewer female professors there than male professors, does that make you think that’s not me.
Dr Wilson highlighted that one of the main aims in the intermediate term for the Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity group was to improve the number of seminars led by women so that they can inspire more young female scientists into the more senior roles of academia. In the long run, he said
we’re just aiming to increase the proportion of female academic staff
. Dr Wilson emphasised that role models and improving confidence will significantly help improving the gender distribution at the University.
It’s a lot to do with role models and making sure there are excellent female role models out there who can show people it’s not just to do with stooped old men in long white lab coats
What is interesting is that whilst Dr Wilson stressed the need for more excellent female role models, Dr Sharon Dixon highlighted that it isn’t necessary to have ‘female’ role models as such, but to have good role models of either gender that the student or academic can relate to. What we have found through this series of interviews is that there are female role models out there, it’s showing them that they are the role models that is the difficult part. People have biases for what they think a role model is, similar to the unconscious biases of what a Professor is or a female academic is. Dr Wilson said
well it doesn’t surprise me that our young female scientists are perhaps less interested (in senior roles)
if the image we have of a professor is

Assembly Workplan: The Initiator
Because the initiator is one of the smaller constructs, we have decided to use this as an example to illustrate the utmost basic workplan in greater detail.
Starting Up
Hydrated parts: BBa_B0034, BBa_C0051, BBa_B0015, BBa_R0082.
Transformed these parts into DH5α competent cells.
RBS to BBa_C0051
Cultured cells that have parts: BBa_B0034 and BBa_C0051
Miniprepped BBa_B0034 and BBa_C0051
Digest with SpeI & Pst
Run on gel
Gel extract
Digest with Xba & Pst
Separate fragments through gel electrophoresis
Gel extract
Ligate the RBS and BBa_C0051 fragments together and transform on carb plates.
Depending on the outcome of visible colonies on the experimental and control plates, a PCR screening may be needed.
Assembly notes
It is most practical to cut RBS as a vector because RBS is less than 100 bp long as an insert, making it hard to see and extract on the gel.
The sticky ends from the XbaI and SpeI, when ligated together, will form an 8 bp scar.  Thus, XbaI and SpeI will no longer be able to cut here.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Modeling#CRISPRi_-_-_TEXT.html," after 3 hours, the number of number of sarA genes producing fluorescence could be assumed as constant. For this reason, we excluded time-points prior to 3 hours. We then converted from fluorescence units to number of fluorescent molecules using the quantization measurements provided by Wu & Pollard
and, using our assumption of a fixed number of active sarA genes, considered the relative change in number of molecules to be representative of the per-promoter rate.  We were interested, however, in the changes of concentration rather than the changes in the raw number of molecules. As the name suggests, Staphylococcus aureus are spherical in shape. Assuming that all S. aureus are spheres, the volume of the cell can be determined. The diameter of a USA300 S. aureus cell was previously measured as 1.1 μ•m
resulting in the overall cell volume to be calculated as 5.575•10-15 L. The number of molecules were thus converted to units of molar concentration in the cell, specifically nanomoles per litre (nM). The exponential fit used to find the rate constant is shown below:  This resulted in a exponential model a•ebt with a b rate constant of 0.0011 nM/min.

Hi, I am Ana and I come from Transylvania (Romania), which you might now from the movies as Dracula’s home (creepy, right?). Since moving to Aberdeen to        study Biochemistry with Immunology, I came across a lot of unexpected opportunities. In that sense, iGEM has been both a really intense and new experience:        great fun, brilliant instructors and tons of exciting experiments. As part of the team, I do a lot of wet lab-work (it relaxes me, as geeky as it sounds), I        am in charge of parts description and currently work on Antigen 43 (autotransporter protein) as a platform to express peptides on the cell surface of E.coli. I love being creative and coming up with new ideas. I am one of the optimistic members of the team and awkwardly enough, the one who will always get easily        excited (honestly, like a kid!) when experiments work as planned. I love Spanish culture, latino dances, travelling and teaching kids. If you don’t find me        in the lab, I might be on the dance floor!

Hi! I’m a third year Physics student at University of Aberdeen. I’m originally from a small town in Bulgaria, where my grandfather got me excited about        technology and engineering. I came to Aberdeen in search for a chance to meet and collaborate with people at the frontiers of science. So then, you can        imagine how I excited I was when I got offered to take part in the uni’s iGEM team and work on a cutting edge science project. So far it’s been amazing        working with everyone and trying our best at the world’s biggest problems. As per my experience with mathematics, problem solving and computers, I am mainly        involved in modelling and simulating our system in order to optimize the design and make it function as we want. Parallel to this, I’m building an optical        fluorescent detector to conceptualize our disease testing method. I’m also involved with the design of our Wiki and take part in the public outreach. When        I’m free from my duties, I like to travel"

It is easy for bacteria to lose plasmids because of the unsynchronized rate of plasmid replication, in other words, big plasmids are replicated more slowly that that of small plasmids, as a result, smalls plasmids have more copies and thus more likely to be maintained in one bacterium. Therefore, we had better insert big genes into E.coli genome in order to balance the plasmids length and give those plasmids comparative replication rates.

02. 2018 Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC)
We participated in the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) held by ShanghaiTech University, ShanghaiTech-iGEM. Through discussions with other iGEM teams from top universities across the country and communications with excellent iGEM seniors, we have gained a lot of suggestions about our project and innovative ideas about Human Practice. Furthermore, we also gave other teams feedback after listening to their presentations.
CCiC is an excellent platform for iGEMers to learn from each other. Every year, iGEMers from many colleges gather to introduce their projects, discuss their problems, ask questions and make suggestions to other teams, aiming to improve their project. Moreover, we acquired more information about After iGEM and the frontier of synthetic biology.
Figure 2. CCiC
We showed the audience and judges our project, CRISProgrammer, and then several teams expressed their interests in our design. During the questioning session and poster session, they also communicated with us. In the panel session, Dr. Xuan Wang asked us more detailed questions on the progress of our experiment and encouraged us.
In the poster session, we introduced our ideas to other teams. Other teams also shared their experience related to us.
We also invited Dr. Haotian Guo to give some advice. We introduced our subject and designing philosophy to him and hoped that he would comment and guide our topic. Dr. Haotian Guo put forward questions about the relationship between the amount of gRNA and the efficiency of dCas9 protein, which made us think deeply. In the communication with Dr. Xuan Wang, he expressed appreciation for our subject and suggested that we should focus on the achievement of the logic, pointing out that our ideas may solve ""the key issue in the biological laboratory"", and encourage us to continue to do this.

We created a “3-day plan” from 3A assembly through transformation and plating up cells to liquid media overnight cultures, miniprep kit extraction of plasmid and nanodrop concentration measurement, and finally electrophoresis gel screening of our newly made construct.
Discussion on human outreach was started.
Began talking to the SDU iGEM team on collaboration.
Discussed the creation of an iGEM Macquarie game.
Started planning for attending synthetic biology conference and ACUR (Adelaide).
Week 2 (10/7/17-14/7/17)
Dry Lab
India suggested the idea of a creating a game as her brother could help us out with that.
We got in contact with Associate Professor Joanne Jamie, an academic at Macquarie University, to gain more information about National Science Week and the university’s Orientation Day for our outreach possibilities.
She invited us to help out in the Chifley School Program (19th September) which we agreed would be better than the other two. We have a 1 hour time slot in which we can conduct wet and dry lab activities with gifted and talented high school science students.
The team was approached by Nebraska to fill out their survey.
Wet Lab
Checked lab supplies to ensure we had what we needed.
Became familiar with protocols we will be using.
Poured LB plates made up with each of the three antibiotics we will be using- Amp, Kan and CAM.
Conducted three transformations of DH5α cells with DNA plasmids of Fer, Hyd1 and HydEF.
These were grown successfully on plates.
Dived into our first ligation attempt for Fer/Hyd following our “3-day plan”
Results = no growth on the plates.
This lead us to testing all our restriction enzymes on familiar plasmids, which gave us a chance to pour our own electrophoresis gel, load and run it.
It was great to have Mike Gibbs, Dominic Logel, Thi Huynh and Ed Moh supervising and sharing their expertise.
Week 3 (17/7/17-21/7/17)
Dry Lab
Nebraska got back to us asking for collaboration: discussion of Australian policies in regards to synthetic biology.
In return we hope to get the survey results that we filled out to run our own questionnaire and compare Australian/International response.

We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has two chains, A-B-C and D-E-F. A, B, C bind with D, E, F, respectively. The products are A and C. First we mix chains and trees. Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. What compartment does the product locate in if the two product templates locate in different compartments? A reasonable solution is to halve the quantities of the product and add it into both compartments. Another problem is that the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. The source of the two problems is essentially the same: how to describe intra-molecular reactions in framework of MoDeL language definitions. At present, it is not supported. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans to refine our MoDeL language.

Performed a double dialysis
100g of PEG (10k MW) in 900 mL of water
loaded 10 mL of 3.7% w/v silk into dialysis cassette
note: when loading the silk, I accidentally applied too much shear stress -- I tried to inject while the needle still wasn't fully inside the cassette.

I didn't observe any particulates in the cassette, but it is possible that some small volume of the silk already sheared into beta sheets.

Module 1
Gastric Intrinsic Factor
Gastric intrinsic factor (GIF), trans-Cbl II, haptocorrin are protein that function to uptake, transport and store the vitamin B12. gif gene is located on chromosome 22. Gastric intrinsic factor consists of 399 amino acids residues in addition %15 carbohydrates content. Its molecular mass is 60-kDa according to gel filtration. (7)
Type II secretion System
Gram-negative bacteria have six types of secretion systems: type I, and type II secrete the protein in the extracellular space. Type I secretion system secretes the protein in a single-step whereas Type II secretion system uses two-step secretion. We use type II secretion system in our project. There are three different pathways in Type II secretion system: twin-arginine translocation (TAT), SecB-dependent and signal recognition particle (SRP). Different signal sequences are recognized by those pathways and helps to secretion of proteins through the periplasmic space of bacterium. Signal sequences are cleaved after the secretion. Proteins are folded while secreted extracellularly. Secretion from periplasmic space to extracellular space is unknown; however, different strategies were developed in laboratory such as co-expression of kil gene. (8)

Method
In the first stage of the project, the production of intrinsic factor protein is aimed. For the production of IF, which is a protein composed of 399 amino acids encoded by 1254 nucleotides, gif gene will be reconstructed according to the iGEM RFC [10] standard with OmpA secretion signal on N-terminus and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology Company as it will be contained in a cloning vector.
In the second stage of the project, recombinant IF protein is aimed to be secreted into"

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#TERRA Software_-_-_TEXT.html," the user would enter information about their experiment, such as the number of outputs and the vessel they plan to use. They would then configure each output by inputting which control syringes from the control syringe pumps actuate it. Lastly, the user selects the wells for dispensing on the table under Output Destination.
The feedback we received from the Harvard iGEM team and scientists in the lab, however, highlighted that it was difficult to use. The requested information was unclear and the format of the UI was confusing. In addition, initial users felt that the UI needed a slight “face lift” in terms of aesthetics. During the design process for the next iteration we decided to improve the UI by reducing the amount of information the user enters, adding a UI tutorial video, and additional focus on the UI’s aesthetics.
To do this, we first had to break down exactly what information the UI needed to gather from the user to run TERRA. This was important because it gave us an idea of how to restructure the UI and make it more efficient. We broke down the necessary input information based on key sub-functions TERRA executes to transfer the outputs of the user’s microfluidic chip into the desired locations on their vessel.

After aggregating the following information we identified user data that can be standardized to offload it from the user. The first and easiest fix was to have TERRA use tubing of known length, material, and outer diameter. In addition, the TERRA Adapter was standardized by characterizing each output in advance. By knowing the total number of outputs for the experiment, TERRA automatically configures the outputs with their respective control syringes. The user simply needs to ensure that the TERRA Adapter is connected properly to their microfluidic chip. Once inputs were offloaded, error-check functionality was incorporated to alert the user if inputted data is unfeasible or incorrect format. With error-check, the input fields are either highlighted red to prompt the user to change their input or to green to confirm that the entered data is in the proper format.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html," all engineered IndC construct bearing different natural and synthetic T-domains with four different PPTase expression constructs. To our surprise, the T-domains used not only determined general efficiency of indigoidine production, but also the efficiency of NRPS activation by the different activating PPTases.  In conclusion we were able to demonstrate, that it is indeed possible to replace single Domains from NRPS modules, while preserving or even enhancing its functionality. In addition, we established an approach for the design of synthetic T-domains and proved their functionality by introducing them into the indigoidine synthetase indC scaffold. Moreover, we established a high throughput protocol for circular polymerase extension cloning and transformation (Hi-CT) ( BBF RFC 99 ), which we applied for our domain shuffling approach. In summary, we created a library of 58 engineered indC variants. In addition we perforemd measurement of blue pigement production over time, which gave us novel insights in how NRPS domains should be designed, where the domain borders between different domains in a single NRPS module have to be set and which domains from respective NRPS pathways and bacterial strains can be used, when creating novel engineered NRPS pathways. We implemented our findings into the ""NRPS-Designer"" Software, so that the underlying algorithm for NRPS design takes into consideration the abovementioned findings (e.g. domain border setting) which are certainly crucial for successful in silico prediction of functional NRPSs.  Thereby, our project pioneers the research on high-throughput methods for creation of synthetic NRPS modules composed of user-defined domains. We believe that our findings will highly contribute to future development of custom NRPSs.
