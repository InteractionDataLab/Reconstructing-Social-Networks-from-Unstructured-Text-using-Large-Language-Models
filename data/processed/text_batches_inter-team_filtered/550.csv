Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#TestBench_-_-_TEXT.html," an automated 2D fluorescence analyser. We aim to be able to quickly measure the fluorescence emitted by our sensor cells and automatically analyze the emitted images with our software Measurarty. This will enabel us to reliably detect the amount of CFU (colony forming units) of the pathogens present on the sample. The device will have different Filters for different wavelenghts included to be able to analyze different fluorescent proteins at the same time.
To learn more about our device check out Cellock Holmes .
The software Measurarty
The third part of our project is our software Measurarty. The software will allow us to analyze the fluorescence emitted by our sensor cells in a more advanced and better way than just using a simple Treshold. We will utilize a modern segmentation algorithm in combination with further, detailed image processing algorythms.

To expand the thought of our project, we visited Tianjin General Hospital and interviewed doctor Hailong Cao. During the times, we are inspirited and come up with better ideas and results. These events change our way of thinking, and help us have more comprehensive conclusion.
Visit the anaerobic incubator：
Our project deals with the cultivation of anaerobic bacteria and related operations, however, no anaerobic incubator was used in the laboratory. In this case, we contacted the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology to visit and learn.
We started prepare for our project with confidence. We chose several anaerobic bacteria in our project, however, we lacked experience in culturing anaerobic bacteria. Therefore, we contacted Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology to learn the cultivation technique of anaerobic bacteria. After three days of study, we further perfected our experimental scheme and accumulated valuable experimental experience at the same time. The scientific spirit and thinking of the professors’ are worthy of our study as well.
We not only learned the method of operation of anaerobic incubator, but also learned a lot of attention of the cultivation of strains involved in experiments through the visit. Anaerobic bacteria are the most abundant bacteria in intestinal bacteria, and it made our project more prefect to be able to operate anaerobic bacteria.
The interview to Doctor Hailong Cao：
In order to make our project ideas more clearly, we went to Tianjin General Hospital to interview Hailong Cao, director of the gastroenterology dept. During the process of communicating with director Cao，He affirmed the important role of intestinal bacteria in the treatment of diseases. Although there are many detection techniques for intestinal bacteria, the biggest obstacle to intestinal bacteria research still exists. Our project will make sense in figuring out the role of a particular bacterium. His word made us become enlightened at once and gave us more inspiration. After we made our idea become truth, we visited Tianjin General Hospital again to show our achievements and to thank director Cao again for instructing our project.

UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile#Bactomithril#notepad_-_-_TEXT.html," us with a valuable gift: a plasmid to secrete ADF-3 in salmonella. With this plasmid we can obtain the sequence of the spider silk protein ADF-3.
April 2-8, 2012
We transformed the backbone pSB1K3, so that we could amplify it when our primers arrive. Later we made and ordered the primers for our next experiment: basically the same constructs as before (GFP Reporter Plasmid) but with ADF-3 instead of sfGFP.
Ulises met with Dr. Angélica Fierro, and she accepted to be our advisor in protein modeling! Besides, we contacted Cheryl Hayashi, a well-known scientist that works with spider silk (she even spoke at TED!) [link: http://www.ted.com/talks/cheryl_hayashi_the_magnificence_of_spider_silk.html ]
We asked her if she could send us the genetic sequences EF595245 and EF595246, but later we knew that those parts are not compatible with our purposes. They are fosmids and the silk sequence is only a small portion of those clones.  The fosmids are low copy number and difficult to propagate. Then, it´s  better to work with ADF-3.
Additionally, we wrote to Dr. Sang Yup Lee, author of one of the paper “Native-sized recombinant spider silk protein produced in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli results in a strong fiber”. They produced and spun into fiber a 284.9 kDa recombinant protein of the spider Nephila clavipes in E. Coli, and we asked if he could send us his spider silk protein. Unfortunately, we didn´t receive an answer. April 9-15, 2012 The School of Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile makes every year a fair of entrepreneurship and technological innovation called Ingenia. The deanship of the Faculty of Engineering is so interested in us that wants that we form part in a conversation table to spread information about iGEM and Synthetic Biology. We will have also our own stand in the fair! On Wednesday the whole team had a meeting with Professor Rodrigo Guitérrez, and our advisors Dr. Fernán Federici (Postdoc student at Cambridge) and Dr. Mónica Vásquez (specialist in cyanobacteria). We presented them our projects and advances. They suggested that we:

SDU-Denmark,2013,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour61_-_-_TEXT.html,", it is time to look at the big scale production. Going from erlenmeyer flask production to industrial production introduces new challenges. The design of the containers is to be tested: maybe the bacteria can all be in one tank, perhaps it is more efficient to have several smaller tanks. Next, staff is to be educated on how to treat the bacteria and extract the rubber.  When all the practical issues of implementation are settled, and the production has started, the fun begins: if possible, allow the rainforest to regrow. Otherwise, use the now redundant conventional plantations for new crops, giving a chance for local farmers to provide much-needed agricultural produce.

Introduction
In yesterday's lab session, the Metal Sensing Team attempted to digest the BBa_J33206 BioBrick within plasmid pSB1A2 with FastDigest restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI. It was our first attempt in using this brand of enzymes, which should have only taken 5 minutes to digest. However the digests didn't work and this was done to a couple of reasons: a) there was too much DNA to digest and b) even the 10 minute digestion period was not long enough.
In today's lab session the team will conduct a second attempt of the digests and hopefully analyse them by DNA gel electroph"

Mammalian cells
Mammalian cells are cells of higher eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cells have the ability to modify proteins post-translationally, and they contain a large number of membrane bound compartments such as mitochondria, endoplasmatic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus. Compared to microbes, mammalian cells are fragile, have a slow doubling time (app. 24h), and need complex and expensive growth media. The cells are also easily contaminated with mycoplasma, therefore it is necessary to work as sterile as possible, when handling mammalian cells (1). So what is the deal with these high maintenance cells?
Mammalian cell factories
Mammalian cell cultures represent a suitable and stable gene expression system and are often used as cell factories for production of biopharmaceuticals. Heterologous protein expression in an appropriate host is central in production of biopharmaceuticals. Heterologous proteins require complex post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, gamma-carboxylation, and site specific proteolysis, which only mammalian cells are capable of performing. Moreover, mammalian cells have the unique capability to authentically process, fold and modify secreted human proteins (1). Mammalian cell cultures are therefore widely used for production of therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, growth hormones, and cytokines used for a wide array of diseases(4). The effect of post-translational modifications are protein stability, proper ligand binding, and reduced risk of immunogenicity (2), and most of the therapeutic proteins approved and currently in development are therefore modified (3"

We thank Xiaowo Wang and Zhen Xie, PIs in Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, for their tutoring and providing bench space for wet lab.
We thank Lei Wei and Weixi Liao, PHD students, for their support on experiment design and modeling.
Team training and Project start
The students in the Tsinghua-A team came up from different majors. We took courses together and had special training in synthetic biology and bioinformatics. All of the designs, constructs, models, human practices and experiments presented in Tsinghua-A’s Wiki were performed by students of the 2016 Tsinghua-A team. The instructors and teaching assistance were providing feedback and advice about the experiments and models. And they also give us lab support and help with the presentation coaching. We are proud of completing the project on ourselves.
Our instructors teach a synthetic biology course and we start the course in September, 2015. It is a pity that the syllabus and course materials are not freely available online but we are lucky to take the course since we have learned a lot of useful knowledge. We started our brainstorming in January, 2016 and we start our project and do our experiments in February, 2016. We are glad to have an opportunity to do a complete project by ourselves and we have fun doing it."
Michigan,2018,Team:MichiganState#HP Survey_-_-_TEXT.html," 5, only 7% thought that genetically modifying bacteria instead of a plant was unacceptable. The other 93% were at least open to discussion and learning more. This is promising for the future use of our GM bacteria. From question 4, we found that people's major concerns with GMOs were the effect on the human body, and the effect on the environment. One benefit to our GMO is that people wouldn't actually be consuming GM crops, but rather crops grown with GM bacteria. This may decrease some of the concerns with the effect on the human body.
Conversation
Passing out surveys also turned out to be a great opportunity to discuss our project in depth with people who had filled out the survey. They were often interested to learn more, and we engaged in many interesting and thought-provoking conversations. Because of this, we decided to make a brochure that provided a basic overview of iGEM, our project, and we gave copies to interested participants after they had finished filling out a survey."

The positive side:
Most of them think the watering device is novel and easy to use, which is very convenient. In the northwestern China, areas are always arid, so they praised that the water-saving effects of our system are much better than any other irrigation methods. Also, they are touched by the integration of watering, fertilization and weeding of our device.
Areas for improvement:
Of course, as a preliminary design, our device also has some shortcomings. Like, for some deeper roots plants, the watering effect is not as good as to the shallow ones. And may be one field need several different size pipes to work together.
Conclusion
On the whole, they think this is a great invention. And they hope that our devices can be put into production in the near future and bring convenience to other farmers.
Overview
We designed a kit model for our Bio-pesticides application in future. The kit allows users to  to cultivate engineered bacteria for dsRNA production by themselves. It reduces the cost greatly and make the bio-pesticides have ability to compete with the chemical pesticides in market.
The device can ensure aseptic operation and can be reused.

During the summers of 2001 and 2003, a group led by University of New Brunswick ecotoxicologist Karen Kidd performed a study in which they spiked the water of a Canadian lake with the type of estrogen that is found in birth control pills. The purpose of the study was to determine how the hormone would impact the number of aquatic animals. The hormone was added at a level of six parts per trillion, which is similar to levels that have been found in treated sewage water. The male fish that were tested had some female sex tissue, regardless of size or type of fish. The lake’s population of the common Fathead minnow decreased from thousands to almost zero. The estrogen disrupted the minnow’s reproductive abilities so much that the population quickly plummeted.
Between 1999 and 2000, the U.S. Geological Survey sampled 139 surface waters throughout the U.S. Through this study, it was determined that 80% of those waters contained endocrine disrupting chemicals, most of them being estrogens.
In 2004, researchers collected and studied a sample of white sucker fish in Boulder, Colorado. The results of this study showed that there were five times more female fish than males, and about half of the male fish had female tissue. The entire population was sterile.

Impact on Human Development
A similar trend has been witnessed in human beings; factors such as lower sperm counts in men, lower testosterone levels than in past generations, rising rates of infertility, and more females being born than males, demonstrate that the estrogenic compounds present in our water supply may be harming the environment as well as human beings.
Research has not yet shown a direct link between our water supply and feminization in humans, but studies exposing trends of feminization may point to a need to look further into the issue. There is plenty of indirect evidence showing that estrogen in drinking water is impacting human health. Therefore, there may be a current need for more research on what estrogenic compounds, which are not currently filtered out of drinking water, is really doing to human beings and whether changes on how our water is handled need to be made.
While drinking bottled water or unfiltered tap water is deemed safe by policy controlling what water is safe for us to drink, US government and state policies do not currently require any testing or provide any safety limits for"

In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Description Alkl_-_-_TEXT.html,", the alkane may make its way to the cytoplasm. The outer membrane alkane channel protein(AlkL) we plan to use is derived comes from Pseudomonas Oleovarans.  However, there is one drawback with AlkL: when overexpressed, it is toxic to the host cell. As such, we will attempt to express it with different strengths of promoters and test the effect of AlkL toxicity on the host’s growth rate before proceeding. For more details, check out our parts or our results.
Figure 1. AlkL representation.
After successfully passing through the bacterial cell wall barrier, alkane can undergo degradation. Originally, it was thought that alkane degradation could only occur in the presence of oxygen. This was soon proven to be false: discovered in a bacterial species known as Desulfatibacillium alkenivorans AK-01 found originally in water contaminated with oil spills, its native alkane degradation can operate in anaerobic conditions. It is also able to metabolize the medium to long chain alkanes. This feature is key to developing the further step of electrogenicity in the MFC part of our project.
Desulfatibacillium alkenivorans AK-01 had its genome sequenced in 2012 and a theoretical model for its alkane degradation pathway involving 4 major enzymes was proposed, which we hope to use in the second part of our project. The pathway is as follows: once the alkane fragment enters the cell cytoplasm, it combines with fumarate under the action of alkylsuccinate synthase (ASS) to form 1-methylalkylsuccinate. Then, CoA Transferase adds a CoA group to it, producing 1-methylalkylsuccinyl-CoA. Afterwards, its C-skeleton is rearranged by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase to be converted it to 2-methylalkylmalonyl-CoA. Finally, it is converted to 4-Methyloctadecanoyl-CoA by Carboxyl transferase where a CO2 is removed. Upon reaching this stage of molecular rearrangement, the compound is ready to enter β-oxidation of the cell.
Figure 2. Alkane Metabolism pathway.
Our design incorporates the 4 above steps into Shewanella which is hypothesized to functionally metabolize alkanes. It is hoped that once the alkane can ultimately enter β-oxidation, it will subsequently enter the TCA cycle by the cell’s natural"

This composite part is for the expression of the fusion protein we designed, csgA-CBD. Expression requires a T7 RNA polymerase because of the T7 constitutive promoter. It is a csgA curlin precursor of E.Coli coding region linked to a Bacillus circulans chitin binding domain with a 6x polyhistidine tag.
CsgA has well documented amyloid formation behavior and is a main component of E.Coli biofilms, so we theorized that if it were fused to a chitin binding domain the resulting fusion protein would exhibit exceptional adhesive properties to chitin while also remaining cohesive with other csgA-CBD proteins. These traits are extremely attractive for use as a biological adhesive on mycelium substrates, as the fungal cell wall is largely composed of chitin.

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html,"oxide in the ink could be controlled, the carcinogenicity of Hydrogen peroxide still remained uncertain because Hydrogen peroxide was classified as Class 3 of Carcinogens[4], which might become a barrier for the spread of the tool. What’s more, there was also problems to use hydrogen peroxide to induce the color because the liquid leaked easily and was also to control the flow. However, in our project, we used light as input to induce the production of color, which was no harm for bodies, and the intensity and wavelengths of light could be easily changed using our projector. Using more convenient and safe input, we believed that the public would be more willing to interact with our bacteria, and enjoy themselves in the combination of art and science.
Another aspect we improved was that we greatly increased the controllability of our system. In the project of E.coli pen, the mix of mediums was used to generate new colors, which meant that new inks had to be prepared previously, and people can only draw one color at a time. Furthermore, as many kinds of fluorescence could not be excited in the natural light condition, people could hardly know the precise position of the lines they had drawn. We used projector to solve these problems. Our bacteria could mix colors and generate new colors in their cells, and the only thing we need to do to change a color was to change the light. Using a projector, the pictures could be precisely cast onto the plates and produce a delicate artwork. Our hardware was more like a printer while the hardware of KIT-Kyoto team was more like a pen. So it was a leap from ‘pen’s to ‘printer’s, and therefore, we can ‘print’ multiple colors and even a color spectrum at the same time, creating more colorful patterns.
Third, we provided various forms for the public to enjoy the combination of science and art. As mentioned in the wiki of KIT-Kyoto, we should “make the science and technology more accessible”. So we developed the principle from just pictures and created our project, which connected sound, light, color, and odor, to attract more people to get closer to the field of art and science.

For the same reason, they are difficult to modify further. While the work of a number of authors has shown the potential for peptide-based models to interact with human cells,9 the lack of any cross-linking means that they may not be stable under physical stress, an essential feature of any membrane material. Tanrikulu and Raines may have developed a cysteine-homocysteine system for intra-strand disulfide cross-links,11 but this too is best-suited for solid-phase peptide synthesis. Our approach works within a bacterial production system.

Experimental design
Collagen, Keratin, and Elastin
The bacterially produced collagen mimetic we designed draws from a few additional sources, wading into the uncertain waters of rational design in the process. Yoshizumi et al. were able to demonstrate the utility of a designed coiled-coil homotrimerization domain in assisting the folding of a bacterial collagen domain.12 Coiled-coil domains, the most famous example of which forms the fundamental dimer structure of keratin, are defined by a heptad repeat structure and can govern the association of anywhere between two and four proteins fairly easily;13 the example here was designed to form homotrimers which retained their structure above 90 °C.12 The authors evaluate the effect of different locations of this domain on the refolding of a single bacterial collagen domain, concluding that a single coiled-coil domain at the N-terminus is optimal for the most rapid and complete refolding.12 We created a close analog to this construct (modified for convenient PCR amplification) with a purification tag and submitted it as BBa_K2027007 .
This general approach might be extended to different coiled-coil and target proteins; in particular, the potential applications of an effective heterotrimerization domain are even more expansive. A candidate coiled-coil obligate heterotrimer with a defined orientation was designed in 1995 by Nautiyal et al., with all homotrimers and two-component heterotrimers made unfavorable by charge pair interactions.13 Full heterotrimers have a higher melting point (apparent Tm = 87.5 °C) than the next-most"

Case study 2
Research being conducted in universities across the globe has the potential to be the impetus for many of the private sector’s most innovative and successful technologies. Such research can help generate the building blocks for new commercial products, new products that can help the community at large and new patents that can be taken advantage of by the private sector. The relationship can begin when a private company simply provides funding for a new research product, or the relationship can begin when a university takes the current product or technology of a private company and provides modifications and improvements.
Arguably, the relationship has the opportunity to be so successful because of the different viewpoints, motivations and capabilities of the two sides - the private sector and the university. The private sector often has the means, typically in the form of capital or intellectual property assets, such as patents, to fund and begin specific research ventures and to provide the necessary equipment or technology. Universities, on the other hand, while not always having the means to conduct research on their own, possess the manpower, time, creativity and desire to conduct research and development that a company may simply not have the bandwidth or desire to direct its employees to conduct its own, all while bolstering their own prestige. Aside from the disparity in resources, generally, universities and the private sector also come to the table with different motivations. Specifically, the private sector is usually concerned with generating capital through the development of new products or intellectual property assets. Universities are often concerned with bolstering their standing in the creative community and their ability to attract new talent to build upon that standing.
The differences in motivation and resources may foster a creative relationship, but also presents a unique set of challenges for both of the players involved. Both companies and universities should take care to protect themselves before, during and after the relationship begins. Both sides often have intellectual property assets which they wish to protect. In order to begin a collaborative relationship, both sides often insist upon the a non-disclosure agreement - the mutual NDA. The agreement attached as Exhibit A represents a sample non-disclosure agreement with short explanations and suggestions that may hopefully provide a working understanding of the different facets of the agreement.
In addition to protecting information through the non-disclosure agreement, the two parties may want to both"

Workshop by Paulien Poelarends
09.08.2013
Paulien did her master thesis on last year’s iGEM teams and their way of communicating with the public and politicians. We have a wonderful afternoon with her, obtaining a lot by her workshop.
Protoplasts
08.08.2013
During this week we have prepared media and spores to make protoplasts. The protoplasts will be used for transformations. Until recently Novozym has been used to make protoplasts, this is not available anymore and some new protocols have to be used.
Lovastatin
06.08.2013
The restriction enzymes that we ordered last week have arrived. After a few attempts the sequences have been optimized and the G-blocks can be ordered. Also some Lovastatin has been ordered to perform some experiments with A. niger. Lovastatin may be fatal to cell growth of A. niger therefore experiments have to indicate whether A. niger is resistant to Lovastatin. Otherwise A. niger has to be transformed with the resistance gene from A. terreus.
Plasmids extraction with Kit
06.08.2013
Using GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit, we extracted the plasmids containing chromoprotein genes from DH5α E.coli and checked their concentration with Nanodrop 1000.
Expanding the database
05.08.2013
In order to expand the database, more information on secondary metabolite backbone enzymes from Aspergilli needs to be added. Luckily there is a recent publication on secondary metabolites from A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, A. niger and A. oryzae.

We                                 established three models, H2O2 Decomposition Model , Fluorescent Probe Model and roGFP2-Orp1 Michaelis equation Model , which can the convert                             the extracellular H2O2 concentration, fluorescence intensity of                             DFCH-DA probe and                             fluorescence intensity of roGFP2-orp1 protein into the intracellular H2O2 concentration.

This year, we created a detecting system for antioxidants. It is unprecedented to solve                             this difficult problem by synthetic biological strategy.
See                                 our results page. Our system gave a similar result to CAA assay in three selected antioxidant tests，which proves our system can detect the antioxidant in living cell successfully!
Special prize
This year, we want to fight for the Best Applied Design Special Prize.
Oxidation damage, aging and relative diseases are global concerns which highly relate to human health and the sole treatment is antioxidant. However, detection approaches to antioxidant are                         quite limited, especially those for the living-cells. Traditional methods focused more on                         direct redox reaction which may have non-proper navigation to living systems. Living cells are                         integrated with multiple natural anti-oxidant systems, including anti-oxidant enzyme system,                         reductive system, post-damage repair system and etc, which makes it sophisticated to evaluate                         real effects from exogenous antioxidant. The distinctions in living cells make some huge cost                         on dining antioxidant senseless. To solve this real-world problem, a corresponding “living                         antioxidant detection device” was built via synthetic biology manners this year. Yeast was set                         as our host cell as it can present a simple but accurate measuring platform for us. Then, we                         constructed multiple functional gene circuits to implement ROS regulating, endogenous redox                         reaction testing, feedback regulation and so on. Our goal is to make it easily, accurately,                         fast and economically to detect antioxidant, and contribute to world real feasible                         antioxidants.

1. Two meetup
Parisian meetup
For the first meetups, IGEM Bordeaux went to Paris. Arriving Thursday night we spend a great night with our friends before going on Friday attend the meetup organized by the great team of igem pasteur! The Friday morning we arrived in front of the base camp, no i should say the fortress of the team pastor. We were escorting in front of a great breakfast to give us the strength we needed to pass all these teams and present our project. This breakfast was also an opportunity to go spy the other teams to give us more stress, in case we would not be enough stress in front of the pomp of the places where we were. After a morning of presentation, we were able to fill our bellies with a feast worthy of kings. And exchange a maximum of advice around a round table that was not really round. In the afternoon we had the chance learn from the knowledge of different teachers and researchers of the Pasteur Institute. Thanks to this moment animate by the school of the pitch of Paris we learned better to express ourselves in front of an audience and thus to be clearer in our exchange.
This led us to meet again the next day to visit the city with other courageous teams such as igem Toulouse and igem marseille, and to undertake the long and endless quest for the little chapel aka ""the secret chapel"" that we have end up finding after having suffered losses (igem marseille). Here some memories It was definitely a wonderful human experience !
Meetup of Marseille
For the second week of August, iGEM Bordeaux went to the Mediterranean meet-up organized by iGEM Aix-Marseille Université.  The first day of the meet-up was quite hard for our team as some of us arrived in a bus at 5am. However, it was with a great pleasure to begin this meet-up. After the breakfast, the host team starts the presentation. After that we had the chance to present our project. It was interesting to have so many questions about our organism, Caernorhabditis elegans. Most of the people didn’t know this organism or how it can be useful, for genetic study. After us, it was a girl from iGEM technion team to present."

Achievements
Nobody can do science on their own, so collaborating is a necessity. We had a lot of contact with the other Dutch iGEM teams, via e-mail and at the different meet-ups we attended. Our biggest collaboration is with the team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, with whom we had a lot of contact in the past months. Furthermore we attended three international meet-ups, in Delft, Wageningen and Leuven, where we had a lot of good conversations about science, iGEM and life.
Collaborate
University of Nebraska-Lincoln
After the UNL iGEM sent around there iGEM survey, The Amsterdam team and the UNL iGEM team got into contact about combining their knowledge and explore the possibilities of a combined future application of their projects.  In this collaboration, the UNL iGEM team and the Amsterdam iGEM team joined forces to come up with a way to reduce methane emissions. Methane emissions have a huge impact on climate change. iGEM team UNL and iGEM team Amsterdam explored the possibilities of feeding fumarate to cattle, in order to reduce methane emissions. We can conclude that fumarate seems a promising molecule for this application. However, since the literature about the possible effect of fumarate is not consistent, the physiology of cattle opposes some challenges and the maximum fumarate yields in certain organisms under our specific conditions are not yet defined.  Actual empirical research must show if this promising route can lead to lower methane emissions and a more sustainable world!

Reducing methane emissions using thin air

Introduction
In this collaboration, we combine the knowledge on genetic engineering to produce fumarate (team iGEM Amsterdam) and the knowledge on the possible impact of fumarate on cattle physiology (team iGEM UNL). Together, we explore the possibilities of using microorganisms to produce fumarate in cattle intestine, to reduce methane emissions by cattle. We explore the possibilities of ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system and the hurdles to overcome with these strategies. As iG"

Plant Operations
To decrease the costs of production, we chose OEM for mass production rather than build a new plant solely for production. In this way, we won’t have to face or solve the problem of management and production.
Cost
In order to evaluate the commercial potential of our product, an analysis of the investment required and estimation of the ongoing production costs are necessary.
(This cost refers to the requirements for the production of device and consumables for the primary school in all cities in Taiwan.)
Capital costs
In the process of manufacturing the product needs:
1. Mass production of the product shell
2. Overall product assembly
3. Product packaging
We are using a foundry to reduce the cost of building a new plant and human management problems, and in the production of consumables. In part, we expect a large"

Key insight
Get an overview of potential users, and learn more about our stakeholders.
Map out potential users and talk to them. The people we think would have use of our project results would not necessarily say the same thing.
Consider the side effects versus the positive effects and based on that choose the application area.
An interview methodology is more flexible than doing a survey when exploring views of a small number of respondents.
Summary of Interview
We met with Rafael Himmelbach, a Coordinator responsible for Research and Innovation at Digital Life Norway with the goal of learning about gathering public opinion and other possible applications of our project. He advised us to get an overview of potential users for our project solution. He told us that usually, what we think some people may think and what they actually think is not necessarily the same. Therefore, it’s important to distinguish between what you know and what you just think you know.  It’s also important to understand users preferences and adapt a method to meet the needs of its potential users. Every application has its benefits and shortcomings, and we have to make sure that our method meets unmet needs while limiting its potential side-effects. He also advised us to make sure that we think about every possible effect our method can have on the environment, such as the effect a non-biofilm producing bacteria would have in a bacterial population consisting of other biofilm-producing bacteria. When assessing where the project can be applied, if it has more significant side effects than positive effects it would be wise to change the application area.
Regarding public opinion, he advised us to consider the interview methodology instead of a survey. Gathering insights with a survey is methodologically challenging and requires extensive testing of the questionnaire and the target groups. This is to avoid over-representing one group of people and to gather information that is useful.  The interview methodology is more flexible when exploring views of a small number of respondents. Following his advice, we decided to gather public opinion from interviews with people representing different groups of potential stakeholders.

This will require the L.A.S.S.O. hardware to be attached to the computer they are using. The Interface goes through the procedures for a test to be taken, instructing a test plate to be inserted into the L.A.S.S.O. containing just an E. coli sample with no sputum. This allows the L.A.S.S.O. to run a calibration test so it knows how much background light is present. Once the the plate is inserted they begin the test controlled through the Interface and a progress bar informs the user how long the test has left. During the test 10 readings are taken and averaged to get the final voltage level. Once the test has been completed they are informed of the base reading and prompted to enter the actual sample which contains the plate with our engineered E. coli system and the sputum. The user then runs the test again and the same procedure is followed, with every action necessary being prompted through the on-screen instructions built into the Interface. The new reading then has the base reading subtracted from it to give the final sample result. Through the use of calibration of known voltage levels for different bioluminescence levels based on bacterial load the result is obtained. The user, i.e. the patient, is then presented with this information. It is also sent via email to all the medical staff connected to the clinic that the patient attends. This simulates the automatic transfer of data to medical staff, reducing the chance of important information being delayed. The result is then stored in the Results table along with the date, and the patient's information is updated to show that the current date was the last time they took a test.
If a member of medical staff logs in they will see a completely different view. They will view a list of the patients currently attending the clinic they work at. The list shows each patient's name, the last date they took a test and the last time they were reminded to take a test (Fig 3.). The user can then interact with each patient in one of two different ways. The first is double click on the patient's name. This opens up the patient's profile, showing all their information. This includes a graph which details their test results over time. This section of the application simulates the use of an electronic patient record allowing the medical staff easy access to the information they need. The other operation the medical staff can carry out is select a “Remind” button, this sends an email to the patient to take a test"

COPPER BINDING ASSAY
To begin, our team determined the standard copper concentration curve by measuring the average absorbance of various copper concentration solutions, and determined that the standard curve is linear. We can then relate the absorbance to the amount of copper left in solution; therefore, we can determine how efficient the metal binding proteins are, how many ions can be removed, the protein activity, optimal concentration of binding and optimal time of binding.
Figure 4 - Graph of standard copper concentration curve. Measured standard concentrations of copper in solution to provide a frame of reference for future copper binding assay.
Figure 5 - Graph demonstrating the absorbance of the copper solution after CutA (copper binding protein) was introduced as a function of time.Measured absorbance over various time intervals and determined that the optimal time is 60 minutes, and the optimal concentration is 151mg/L.
We added the CutA protein to the copper solutions and left the samples for several time intervals. After the given time intervals, the process of salting out was used to aggregate the remaining proteins in the solution while they remained bound to the copper. Then, following centrifugation, we measured the absorbance of the remaining solution, making sure to minimize capturing protein from the sample.  At approximately an hour the absorbance was lowest in all samples demonstrating that the most copper was bound at that point. The concentration at 151mg/L seems to show the optimal amount of binding over time.  However, our data does not show a significant change in absorbance and therefore there is not a significant change in the amount of copper ions being bound by the protein . This is likely because there was not enough protein being introduced into the reaction during our assay. To validate this idea we created a model demonstrating the binding events in our assay. This model showed that insufficient amounts proteins were indeed the issue and is explained more in depth on the modelling page. (Click here to view modelling page)

The relationship between bacteriophage and bacteria is crucial to the implementation of our project. To demonstrate this relationship and help to improve our mathematical modelling, we completed a phage assay. We used a 96 well plate and filled various wells with a specific amounts of bacteria"

SYSU-Software,2015,Team:SYSU-Software#Vailidation_-_-_TEXT.html," that we conducted a PCR for all the parts that we used after the propagation of the plasmid by transforming them which are in 2015 distribution kit into E.coli. Besides, we sent samples of all plasmids for the sequencing. Afterwards, we performed a sequence alignment between the sequencing result and the sequence which is provided by the registry. However, we only found one third of the sequence matched the official sequence in the UVR8-TetR sequencing result. Therefore, we decided to change an input source.
How did our circuit work without the sunlight sensor?
We decided to use the toggle switch by using tetracycline as an input. In the toggle switch, tetR represses ptet, and tet inhibits this repression so that ptet works. With cI inhibiting pcI and tetR being unable to inhibit ptet, the toggle switch is switched to YFP state. As our data above shows, yellow fluorescence goes up.
Doesn't tetracycline kill your bacteria?
To prevent this, the ptet-RBS-cI-RBS-YFP-terminator circuit is constructed in tetracycline resistance plasmid backbone.
How to explain the difference between simulation and experiment data?
We can see fluctuation in the data of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th hour. This may be caused by random error of the plate reader. The data curve went more steadily from 5th to 8th hour than the simulate one. That's because we only used one tube of culture for measurement. Every time we took out 200μ culture for measurement, some of the bacteria were lost, and the growth were also paused for a moment due to the low temperature. This influence is especially obvious in the first few hours, but the two curves would finally be closer to each other. From 8th to 10th hour, the data curve rose much more rapidly because in this period, the lost of bacteria caused by measurement can be neglected. As there were less bacteria in the earlier period, the resources and space made it possible for bacteria to grow more rapidly.
Dry-lab Testing
We did some tests, including installability test and running test, on Windows and MacOS X, to supplement the installability test on Linux that have been kindly done by judges.

This is a composite part and a functional improved device for Part:BBa_K216005 . The Pyear promoter will be switched on under the presence of nitrate or nitrite, translating P2 ogr. The P2 ogr will cause inducible PF promoter to produce even stronger downstream PoPS. We attached a RBS for convince of registry users.
We ligated this part with a GFP+terminator.

Conclusion
As we can see from the graph, there is significant difference between NiSAP's response to nitrate(40mM) and Pyear+GFP's response to nitrate(40mM). After 3 hours in the plate reader, NiSAP's A.U. is nearly twice the magnitude of Pyear+GFP.
Background
Enhanced Sensor for Nitrite/Nitrate
This is a functional improved device for Part:BBa_K381001 . We replaced the original reporter gene GFP with brighter reporter gene sfGFP, in the hope to improve the sensitivity for the device to detect nitrite and nitrate.
Design
Results
Conclusion
We tested several environment for Pyear+sfGFP and compared it with Pyear+GFP. Our device compared with previous reporter Part:BBa_K381001 is significantly better in every aspect. Furthermore, the sensitive towards nitrite is greatly improved: just with a concentration of 1.5mM nitrite, sfGFP can give equal A.U. value compared with GFP device in 40mM nitrate. Furthermore, using sfGFP, we can draw distinction between 40mM and 20mM nitrate, previously not feasible with Pyear+GFP.
Expression Device
We constructed several genetic circuit expressing proteins. We submitted composite parts with part number BBa_K2346003 to BBa_K2346007 to the registry. See our performance(https://2017.igem.org/Team:HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou/Demonstrate) for more information.

Throughout these interviews and                     investigation, we've developed a profound understanding on the interaction between our project and the society, which in turn has enlightened the further study.
Public Engagement
During the summer vacation, our team members went to country schools in Ningxia and Jiangxi Province to promote the popular science of synthetic biology. Furthermore we successfully designed a series of educational lectures and open-laboratory-festival                     for high school students. As a team rooted in solidarity, we successfully collaborated with OUC, UCAS, UESTC, HBUT, ZJUT, HUST and took an active part the CCiC conference. Most importantly, we were the first iGEM team applying logical                     circuit to human practice. In order to intuitively demonstrate the core idea of synthetic biology and inspire people to participate in gene-designing process, we deigned e-SAM©, the first electronic-display system of synthetic biology                     based on SCM parts, and we drafted a detailed description of experiments that can be performed with it as well as suggestions for customers. We are convinced that e-SAM© system can greatly facilitate future iGEM teams to promote their                     ideas to public.
Social Activities
Biological safety is one of the major issues of consideration since the very beginning of our project. But in practice, fuzzy expression is inevitable in legal language. Therefore, we established a collaborating program with ZJUT to produce                     a manifesto, calling for laws to regulate the use of antibiotics and biotechnology.

It is a real pleasure for us to have prof. Zhu as our mentor. Pro. zhu has been instructing igem teams for over 5 years and he provided extremely helpful advice not only on how to build up a wonderful igem team, but also on how to design                     a feasible experiment plan and how to carry it on safely. Moreover, he introduced us to several scientific authorities.
Pro. Zhu made us fully conscious of the oncoming challenges in igem competition, for example, he emphasized the importance of maintaining a harmony relationship between teammates, which could directly decide the final results to some degree.                     As a result, we made great efforts to assure everyone at the proper position, which finally helped us to accomplish our project in turn.

USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Sup35 as translation release factor
When Sup35 is in prion state, it can propagate and transform nonprion-state Sup35 into prion state, so it can lead to a chain reaction and many yeast prions aggregate to form amyloid fiber. The gathering of Sup35 is an important property that can be used in our project.
Sup35's gathering is with the help of Heat Shock Proteins (HSP). HSP is family of proteins that are produced by cells in response to exposure to stressful conditions, like hest shock[10].
[Figure 3] The function of HSP104 on Sup35 assembling
When the yeast is exposed to heat shock, HSP104 will be produced. HSP104 can convert soluble nonprion-state Sup35 into prion-state Sup35 that nucleates over time. This nucleus then rapidly seeds further conversion and form amyloid fiber[11]. However, overexpression of Hsp104 resolves Sup35, eliminating [PSI+]. It implies that Sup35 aggregates at a temperature range. And we find this range, around 37℃~42℃[12]. What's more, protein denaturant Guanidine Hydrochloride(GDNHCL) can scatter aggregated Sup35, eliminating [PSI+][13]. So Sup35 is controlled by both heat shock and GDNHCL.
Thus, Sup35 has such three important properties: assembling, thermal control and reversibility. We take a fancy to these properties and plan to do something with that. We use the prion-determining region of Yeast Prion Sup35, that is Sup35NM, to construct an open tool box. We link Sup35NM to a gene of interest so that this expressed fusion protein gets the property of yeast prions. The gene linked to Sup35NM can be any genes of interest which are available in our system, so this tool box can be used to realize many functions.

The detailed description of how we want to proceed with a 4 monomer silk construct can be reviewed on this page .
The hybrid silk fibre
The idea of the hybrid silk fibre was to incorporate bacteriocins between silk monomers. From the literature, it is known that silk does not lose its function when other proteins are combined with the silk Gomes, S. C., et al. (2011). ""Antimicrobial functionalized genetically engineered spider silk."" Biomaterials 32(18): 4255-4266. . We also found that proteins incorporated in silk monomers does not lose their functions either Gomes, S. C., et al. (2012). ""Biological responses to spider silk-antibiotic fusion protein."" Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine 6(5): 356-68. . This is why we believe that if the bacteriocins were to be incorporated in the silk monomers, then both components would maintain their functions and thereby their effects. We are also interested in creating hybrid silk with more than one bacteriocin incorporated, to see if they have a better effect than single"

In iGEM we move from designing a desired behavior to instantiating the network in the real organism: a formidable challenge in interdisciplinary research and a very stimulating endeavor, in large parts thanks to a team of excellent and motivated students from different backgrounds.

To my point of view, the most interesting aspect of the iGEM project is the collective construction of a new way of doing bioengineering. The modular approach is clearly more efficient in terms of experimental effort and it also helps understanding how cellular functions are organized. Implementing new functions in bacteria should in turn help to build up more efficient ways to represent the living beings complexity. Besides that, I like  and challenges and iGEM is all of this.

I am a biology and immunology teacher at the Grenoble Institute of Technology-Phelma. One of the important points of my teaching is to train students to be able to work at the interface of different scientific disciplines. iGem is a very exciting challenge that plunges us straight into interdisciplinarity and puts teachers and students face to face with what we aim for in our daily work. Personally I worked in bacterial genetics during my PhD, a field I left some 15 years ago and which I am more than happy to work in again with our team.

Should We Engineer the Mosquito?
Creating the Curriculum
At the Southeastern Mini Convention our team, in collaboration with Gaston Day and East Chapel Hill High School, modified curriculum from the Building with Bio kit. The forum last year centered around Malaria. At the convention, one of the issues we discovered last year was that it was hard to get people participating in the forum to get excited about Malaria. While it is still a prevalent disease it was not something that we found easy to talk about. Therefore, we decided to adapt the material of the forum for a different disease. We decided to adapt the material for Zika. We chose Zika because it is a big problem and has been causing problems surrounding mosquitos and bees, we thought there would be more interest around the new topic.
With our idea, our teams set to work to update the curriculum. The original documents on Malaria can be found here . The documents we created can be found here:

After we created the new curriculum, we held an event hosted by scientists, graduate students, and Duke iGEM on campus to engage with the Duke student body on the topic of bioengineering mosquitos to combat disease. Science, economics, and ethics will be explored through interactive activities. Below are pictures from our event. Overall, we had a great time discussing these issues with our peers. Below are also reflections from team members as well as our guest speaker, Adim Moreb.
""I really enjoyed inviting my friends to the event and showing them the ethical aspects of our research project. In addition, our discussion of the role of the government in regulating bioengineering and gene editing was very interesting.""

Then, 10 different promoters with the same gene structures (Anderson’s prmoter + RiboJ + B0034 + eGFP + double terminators) plasmid were transformed in E. coli BL21. The bacteria was cultivated in 37 degrees, 220 rpm shaker overnight (14-16h). The fluoresence and OD600 were measured at the same time to exclude the error brought by the bacteria number.
The result shows that the protein concentration expressed by J23100 is about 10 times more than urate concentration in the gut, which is about 2000uM in bacteria cytoplasm. Detailed calculation process can be seen in modeling.
Fig.5 Relative Capacity of Different Promotors (J00 short for J23100, J04 short for J231004…).
However, the chassis expression ability should be considered. In our experiment, E. coli BL21 is the chassis for measurement. But E. coli Nissle 1917 is our final chassis, which expression ability is about 10 times lower than BL21 according to the eGFP fluoresence detection. And that's why we used J23100 to drive the expression of YgfU & pucL in our project in the end.
To conclude, according the relative capacity of promoters we determined, we selected appropriate promoter for the enzymes YgfU, pucL and 4.1.1.97. J23100 for YgfU & pucL, J23113 for 4.1.1.97.

The Issue
The price of insulin is too high for many across the globe.  For type I diabetics, who must take insulin every day to survive, and roughly 30% of type II diabetics, this issue constrains their quality of life. Worse still, diagnosis of diabetes is on the rise.
Currently 92% of the insulin market is produced by 3 pharmaceutical companies. In economics, this kind of market share is called an oligopoly. In these kinds of markets, generic or biosimilar insulins have a hard time breaking through, simply due to the enormity of market share that the other three own.
To make things just a little more difficult, clinical trial expenses and regulatory licensing means that very few small to medium sized manufacturing plants can enter the market. Because of these constraints, the insulin market has spiraled out, and as such, insulin is largely unaffordable and inaccessible across the board.

BACKGROUND
Rather than a single entity attempting to build a factory, allow individuals and businesses to  invest in the manufacturing of open-source medication. This could be done through a few other options, like designing a public stock exchange for investment into manufacturing plants. The scheme could provide a return on investment following drug approval, investors receive their money from dividends.
ISSUES
Individuals invest in a company based on the companys previous return on investment, otherwise known as dividends. For this business model to work, the return on investment that our investors would receive must be relative to the risks of the trials not working.

Calcium imaging.
Brought over 293T’s in a 6 well plate, which had been transfected with CatCh. Also had positive control cells on which we used ionophores. Used the Meaney Lab’s confocal and x-rhod1 dye. Media had 2mM Calcium.
1uM Ionomycin addition did not change x-rhod1 fluorescent intensity in Anthony’s neurons.
Also did not work on our 293T’s, but we had the problem of being unable to cleanly pipet the ionomycin into the 6 well plates because the wells we looked at with the scope became entirely blocked by the scope lens.
Illumination of CatCh cells with 476nm laser from confocal did not increase x-rhod1 intensity. eYFP expressing cells were identified, so transfection worked.
Will try again Thursday (9/22) and Friday (9/23) with larger plates, and possibly switch to FURA-2 and Avin’s laser if the confocal still doesn’t work.
Anthony is going to try further with x-rhod1 dye in neurons to make sure that the dye/laser parameters aren’t the problem. Will also attempt the co-culture experiment on these dates.

MOLECULAR MODELISATION
One of the main goals of our modeling work this year was to understand the structure of the curlin subunit protein, CsgA and it's behavior when engineered with a tag constituted of either six histidines (that we will call His1-tag from now on) or twice that motif (His2-tag), since such a peptide  is known for its nickel chelation properties. We then discussed over our results with the wetlab members to define a way to confirm the accuracy of our model, and so we were able to assess that, in accordance with litterature, the best position for the tag was by the C-terminus of the protein. We also determined that the His-tag was more likely to take floating conformation instead of folding itself around CsgA.
Methods
For a numerical molecular model, what is needed before anything else is the program that will be used. As far as we were concerned, we chose to use Sybyl-X, which we began to use this year, and offers a number of tools as well as powerful calculation algorithm. Then we had to find a file containing the structure of CsgA. Indeed, reproducing it from scratch only from its amino acid sequence would be close to impossible since what the program allows us to do is only theoretical, it cannot know the right conformation of a complex protein just like that. Thus you have to whether build the protein yourself, by specifying the sequence, angles and distances between amino acids, which will almost certainly result in failure for a protein as complex as CsgA; or you can provide the program with a pdb file, which is a file that gives the spatial coordinates of every atom in the molecule. However, curli are extremely"
Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Human Practices Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," the 2018 project. Lambert iGEM presented a proposal for the 2018 project in order to receive critical feedback from experts in the field. After hours of planning and brainstorming our design, we focused on how a lack of clean drinking water can lead to lower literacy levels.
Ms. McNerney and Ms. Zhang,  PhD students at Georgia Tech’s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, advised us to look into a toehold switch construct. This construct would allow for specificity, which would allow us to detect specific pathogenic cholera.
Dr. Mark Styczynski is an associate professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Dr. Mark Styczynski has been working with Lambert iGEM since 2012, challenging us to consider the different variables in our project design and to expand upon our perspectives.

Summary Points
Presentation in front of Lambert administrators
Informing the public about the prevalence of pathogenic cholera and the devastating effects
Emphasizing the positive correlation between lack of clean drinking water to decreased levels of literacy
Pressure on women and children in developing nations to obtain drinking water
Lambert iGEM was invited to present our 2018 iGEM project for Lambert administrators. We received and integrated feedback on our project by using the surveys that the Lambert administrators filled out.
Because Lambert iGEM presented the 2018 project in front of education experts, the team decided to focus how a lack of clean drinking water could lead to decreased literacy levels. Individuals living in developing nations walk, on average, 3.75 miles to fetch water. Women and children between the ages of 8 and 13 are often responsible for the task of collecting water. Due to the thousands of hours they have to spend annually hauling water, women are unable to get jobs or contribute financially to their households"

HKUST-Hong_Kong,2012,Team:HKUST-Hong Kong#Design Chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," flora in gut. In addition, since the exposure of BMP2 to normal tissues can induce adverse effects, integrating target genes into the genome can reduce the chance of spreading the Bmp2 gene through horizontal gene transfer and avoid non-specific drug release in gut.
Protein secretion.
Compared with E. coli, another commonly used chassis in iGEM, B. subtilis is preferred because of its reliability in secreting proteins directly to the extracellular environment. As a Gram-positive eubacteria, B. subtilis lacks an outer membrane, featuring only a 10-50nm peptidoglycan layer beyond its the plasma membrane.  Since we are aiming for bacterial secretion of BMP2 out into the digestive tract in the vicinity of colon cancer cells, this property suits our purposes well.
Peptide display.
Without an outer membrane, B. subtilis is ideal for displaying items on its surface. The cell wall of B. subtilis is the surface of the bacterium and contains approximately 9% of the total protein in the cell. The discovery and study of cell wall binding devices produced from cell wall bound proteins provides an attractive tool for surface display of peptide (Pooley et al. 1996). Aiming to display the tumor-binding peptide, RPMrel, on bacteria surface, we decided to take advantage of the cell wall display system, LytC, in B. subtilis. Thus, the ease of peptide display serves as one of our reasons to choose B. subtilis as our chassis.
Part of gut commensal flora.
B. subtilis does not only exist widely in nature, but also contributes to part of the normal flora in the gut (Collin and Gibson 1999). Regarded as a probiotic, it has been proved to have positive effects on patients suffering from functional abdominal bloating (Corazza et al. 1992). Using B. subtilis as our chassis will in theory mean we will not be introducing any exotic species into the gut.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," a                         system that’s overtaxed.” ( NY Times )
Considering the videos we have seen on line, these concerns are well-founded and because there is so much money at stake for developers, we felt that they might try to hide the consequences of their construction.  After engaging with several stakeholder groups (see our Human Practices section) we decided to use synthetic biology to 1) help alert residents in real time when sewage enters the canal and 2) find value in the current polluted state of the canal                     by mining the bottom sludge for novel organisms useful for decontamination of industrial waste.
Our project has two parts.
Biosensor for Sewage
Based on input from the residential community surrounding the canal, we attempted to construct three different biosensors for sewage based on quorum sensing or nitrogen sensing coupled to production of a colorful reporter. We tested one of our three biosensors in the lab and it performed as expected. In consultation with the Gowanus community, landscape designers, and homeland security experts, we brainstormed around a biosensor that could be immobilized within containers deployed along the canal, providing the community with a visual indicator of water quality.
Microbiome Mining
Genspace has an ongoing project to assay the microbiome of the canal bottom sludge. We took advantage of the protocols that had been developed for this project and collected bottom mud samples from 14 sites along the canal chosen for their different conditions. We used a protocol published by Dr. Sean Brady’s lab at Rockefeller University to safely generate high molecular weight DNA that can be queried via PCR and also used for eventual production of a cosmid library. The goal was to mine the canal bottom extremophile DNA for new and useful metabolic and detoxification pathways since the organisms thriving in pollution from coal tar, paint factory solvents, etc. might have evolved to metabolize toxic compounds and may be useful for remediation. We completed a proof-of-principle experiment by using degenerate PCR primers that recognize antibiotic synthesis pathways. Further mining via PCR will be guided by pathway analysis of next-gen sequencing data from the ongoing Genspace microbiome study.
Biosensor
Part selection and sensor design
Inputs: After the group decided to build a biosensor for sewage pollution in the Gowanus Canal, the next obvious question followed; How? Our first task was to identify detectable molecules the are characteristic of human waste to serve as inputs for our biosensor. Two inputs seemed to be good candidates:
1. Quorum sensing
We investigated two quorum sensing systems for this sensor: the N-Acyl Homoserine Lactone (A"

By comparison of the fluorescence levels it is possible to determine the incorporation efficiency of the generated synthetase variants.

B) shows the expression of the complete RFP-GFP fusion protein when cotransformed with an aaRS. C) shows the expression of the CFP unit of the improved part when not cotransformed with an aaRS. D) shows the expression of the complete CFP-YFP fusion protein of the improved part when cotransformed with an aaRS.
We liked this elegant solution which shows synthetase activity as well as synthetase efficiency. Our investigations revealed that there were some issues with the choice of RFP and GFP for the system, e.g. a high overlap of the absorption spectra and a low emission level. This can be improved by substitution with CFP and YFP (Figure 1). We constructed and characterized parts for this FRET system ( Ma et al., 2014 ) which leads to a more accurate distinction between the partial (CFP) and the whole (CFP-YFP) expressed fusion protein.
Short Summary
We designed the CFP-YFP test system ( BBa_K2201343 ) just like the RFP-GFP system and only changed the coding sequences of both of the fluorescent proteins.
First we compared the CFP and the RFP domain of the test system by transforming them into BL21(DE3) solely and performing absorption and emission measurements. We detected that the absorption and the emission maxima of the RFP are equal to the information of Texas 2014. Nevertheless, they are only 20 nm apart from each other, which lead to the first measurement problems. Furthermore we detected a second absorption maximum at 505 nm, not mentioned by Texas 2014. This excitation wave length was more suitable for RFP than 585 nm, but on the other hand very close to the absorption maximum of GFP (485 nm). As a result, heavy excitement and emission of RFP were observed as a byproduct of the GFP analysis. The absorption and emission maxima of CFP are ~ 45 nm apart and thereby very precisely differentiable. Nevertheless, we could detect that the emission signal of"
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#GM-Moss_-_-_TEXT.html," The enzyme should be able to degrade important hormones as 17-ß-estradiole or ethinylestradiole as well as the extensively used pain killer diclofenac. Laccases are secretory enzymes requiring an oxidized milieu for proper activity. Therefore we tried to express the laccase from Bacillus pumilus membrane anchored.
Figure 2: Successfully selected moss with membrane-anchored Laccase. GFP is fused to the intracellular part of the transmembrane region. Upper image: GFP-fluorescence; lower left: brightfield; lower right: GFP-fluorescence plus chloroplast autofluorescence.
Figure 2 shows fluorescence microscopy images of the receptor associated GFP. In comparison to other fluorescence images of trans membrane constructs the fluorescence at the membrane is ony slightly increased. This could indicate an inefficient integration of our construct into the membrane. Therefore we tried to determine if our transgenic moss is able to degrade substrate in vivo. Besides LC MS a suitable detection method for diclofenac is a competitive ELISA developed by prof. Knopp. This ELISA is by now commonly used for the routine detection of diclofenac in waste water.
Figure 3: Scheme of the performed competitive ELISA to determine the diclofenac concentration.
Figure 4: Measured standardization for diclofenac.
The function principle of the ELISA is as follows: a 96 well plate gets precoated with an diclofenac-OCA-conjugate at 4°C over night. After washing and blocking with 1% casein the competition reaction is initiated by the addition of a polyclonal antibody solution and the samples which should be quantified. The diclofenac present in the samples competes with the diclofenac-OVA-conjugate to be bound by the antibodies. The more diclofenac a sample contains, the less antibody binds to the plate surface. After a washing step a secondary HRP-labeled antibody is added to the plate. The read-out reaction is initiated by coating the plate with 1% H2O2 and TMB (3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidin). After 15-20 min. the reaction is stopped by adding 5 % H2SO4. The blue TMD with an absorbtion maxima at 650 nm changes to yellow with an absorption at 450 nm. The amount of TMB is detected by measuring the absorbance. The standard calibration graph for diclofenac concentrations of 10"

Casing
Construction:
As the device is being designed to aid in providing research, teaching and diagnostic labs with a cheap, DIY, cloud-integrated plate reader, our design criteria include:
Easily obtainable and reasonably priced materials
Straightforward build
Simple operation
A standard 96 well-plate was chosen to design the device around as it’s the most commonly available well-plate in the average microbiology lab.
LED and Photodiode Casings:
A casing was developed for the LEDs and photodiodes in an array that complements a 96 well-plate, such that each well has an LED above and a photodiode below it. These were designed using Autodesk Fusion 360 Software, as shown in figures 6 and 7.
Figure 6: LED casing as shown on CAD software
Figure 7: Photodiode casing as shown on CAD software
Exporting of the files from CAD to .step files, followed by conversion to a .stl file resulted in an ability to print the casings in blue and red PLA, using an Ultimaker 3D-printer as shown in figure 8. However, this can also be ordered from other 3D printing sources for prices from ~$18.60(£14).
Figure 8: Casings being printed in PLA using an Ultimaker 3D printer

When the casings are complete, as in figure 9, these casings containing the photodiodes and LEDs were able to simply slide in and out of the lower and upper layers, respectively, of the box. These are then retained in place for the duration of the readings.

High cost may be another drawback for the current available gene therapy.
About AAV
AAV, adeno-associated virus, is a common small virus affecting human and some other primates. It is famous for lack of pathogenicity and specific integration site in host genome, which bestows it many nominations in gene therapy.
Alipogene tiparvovec is a  gene therapy  treatment  for  lipoprotein lipase deficiency  (LPLD),  which can cause severe  pancreatitis . In July 2012, the  European Medicines Agency  recommended  it for approval, making it the first recommendation for a gene therapy treatment in either Europe or the United States. After the endorsement of  the  European Commission , Glybera (trade name for Alipogene  tiparvovec) becomes the first gene therapy treatment approved for clinical use in either Europe or the US.
Connection with our project
In our project we make use of the AAV as the carrier of the insulin gene, as well as other regulatory elements, trying to eventually recover the insulin expression inside patients’ bodies. It is based on the previous successful trials carried out for treating LPLD (lipoprotein lipase deficiency) with Alipogene tiparvovec (an AAV-based gene therapy).

Lund
This year (2017), Lund participated in the iGEM competition with their very first team. To set up a team and the structure around it, is a challenging task. We were happy to help iGEM Lund in their initial steps of establishing an iGEM team by providing templates for sponsoring contracts and for bylaws of an association. Furthermore, we have been in regular contact throughout the project to discuss project development, arising issues and how challenges can be solved.
Human Practices Handbook
After receiving feedback about how difficult Human Practices can be for someone not familiar with it, iGEM Stockholm decided to create a handbook to help teams to master their Human Practices. We thought that the best way to accomplish this handbook was to collaborate with previous successful teams. We reached out to all previous winners and nominated teams for Human Practices and asked them for their help. The teams we collaborated with was Stockholm 2016, OLS_Canmore 2016, Imperial 2016, Groningen 2016, Bielefeld 2015, William and Mary 2015, UofC_Calgary 2016, Cornell NY 2016, Paris Bettencourt 2016.

As is shown in the above passage, our goal is to ensure the quality of EVERY product that has our stickers on it and to substantiate the reliability of quality control. Above all, we are able to extend the monitoring process from manufacturing, transportation, and eventually to the customer’s hands, preventing the customer from buying, or using, defective products which are damaged or contaminated due to inappropriate transporting or storing conditions. The most attractive features of this bio-sticker are “long-term monitoring” and “cumulative, layered supervision.” The factors of harmful conditions accumulate, and as soon as they surpass the limits, they activate the color changing process in our stickers. The best part is, the basic material of this bio-sticker is E. coli, and since E. coli replicates itself extremely rapidly, the cost of the sticker will be considerably low. So, either replacing a sticker or adding a new one after each stage of the delivery process should still be cheap enough for the company or the consumer to afford, giving them extra incentive to use the product.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html,"% repression of PRM requires 15 times the normal lysogenic concentration. However, the mechanism of PRM repression is not result of only CI dimer binding in the OR3 site.
Dodd et al. (2001) showed that two tetramers at OL and OR sites form an octamer by looping the DNA ( ). They proposed that this DNA looping juxtaposes OR3 and OL3 sites and allows them to be linked by a CI tetramer. This, in turn, would silence the PRM promoter. Thus, the lambda repressor has three different states regulated by CI concentration: lytic (low CI concentration, PR is active and PRM is inactive), lysogenic (moderate CI concentration, PR is inactive and PRM is active) and repressing lysogenic (high CI concentration, PR is inactive and PRM is inactive). This is the underlying principle of our three-channel switch. In our approach, we regulate the CI concentration with blue light intensity and replace the cro and cI genes of lambda repressor with other genes of interest while producing CI elsewhere. This way, we are able to use the characteristics of the lambda repressor to construct the mechanism behind the three-channel switch.
.: Repressor protein CI forms dimers.
.: The OR1 has the highest affinity for the CI dimer which recruits another dimer to OR2 site. OR3 has the lowest affinity for CI and CI binds to it only in a high enough concentration.
.: Two tetramers at OL and OR sites form an octamer by looping the DNA. DNA looping juxtaposes OR3 and OL3 sites and allows them to be linked by a CI tetramer.
Hypotheses
The very first and critical assumption is that the concentration of CI would be controlled by light when it is put behind FixK2 promoter. Moreover, we assume that this effect will be more or less linear on the relevant region so that double light intensity leads eventually to double concentration. It is also very crucial that FixK2 promoter does not show significant leaky expression in absence of phosphorylated FixJ. We need to be able to keep the CI concentration low enough to keep the PR promoter active in the presence of strong blue light.
To better match the BioBrick standards and the idea about being able to ligate BioBricks together as is, we wanted to make our promoters unidirectional. The PRM and the PR promoters, however, point to opposite directions. This would require flipping the BioBricks added to the preceding strand or using reverse complement BioBricks. This would not be very convenient. Hence, we made"

This week we ligated the digested PhaC and PhaBA each into pET29b(+) vectors. After ligation, we transformed our cells and incubated the plates overnight. The next day we chose four colonies from PhaC and PhaBA-transformed plates to make overnight cultures and a master plate from.  We isolated the plasmid from our overnight cultures to perform a confirmation digest of the transformed cells. We performed double or single digests of the plasmids from miniprep to check that the presence of the insert within the vector and to check the directionality of the insert. The restriction enzymes and the respective sites and expected bands on the plasmids are shown below.

However, the pET29b(+)-phaC transformants did not match or show corresponding bands with the digests performed on a transformed vector. The results are shown in the figure below.

CRISPR/Cas9 key deletion
We successfully annealed the sgRNA of the message and the key. The ligation of these with the vector pJOE8999 failed. We managed to amplify the two PAM sequences of 700 bp of the B. subtilis genome. We attempted to amplify the tetR from its plasmid backbone, unfortunately the PCR failed. This subproject should be repeated from the beginning.
Read more about our CRISPR/Cas9 key deletion.
Decoy experiment
In order to test the efficiency of selecting the correct key spores from decoy we conducted flow cytometer measurements. Additionally we observed the selection efficiency with a microscope. For this experiments we used the BioBrick BBa_K1930006 sfGFP in pSB1C3. It could clearly be observed that the antibiotic selection was successfull. Though, the expected outgrowing of the decoy cells in order to hide the key-cells could not be observed. In the future this experiment should be repeated to find a concentration of decoy cells that outgrows the key cells. Also the experiment should be repeated while using spores instead of living cells to adjust the experiment to real life conditions.

MIC and MBC of ciprofloxacin.
The MIC and MBC of ciprofloxacin on wild-type Bacillus subtilis 168 were determined to be between 160-170 nM (MIC) and 180 nM (MBC). Subsequently, the MIC of E. coli top 10 and B. subtilis 168 carrying the qnrS1 ciprofloxacin resistance gene was determined to be between 1,000 - 2,000 nM, and 400 - 500 nM, respectively. This is a significant improvement in antibiotic tolerance when compared to the MIC values of the wild-type strains (100-130 nM for E. coli and 170-180 nM for B. subtilis). Finally, the MIC value of a B. subtilis 168 isolate resistant to ciprofloxacin (obtained via directed evolution) was determined to be greater than 20,000 nM, which is a huge improvement in ciprofloxacin resistance over both the wild-type strain, and the strain carrying qnrS1.

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation"

There are three kinds of module: loading module, elongation and modification module, termination module. Each module condenses and modifies one unit. Basic function of a module is to elongate the polyketide. So a module contains at least the domain KS, AT, ACP. The exist of DH, ER, KR might change the structure of polyketide. Some natural modules may contain unnecessary domain DH, ER, KR without any function. Loading module is the first module of PKS that starts the synthesis. Termination module only contains the domain TE that terminates the elongation of polykeitde. Both modules are connected by short adhesion or docking domains. Docking domain is a kind of connection which can arrange the order of module. It can direct the intermodular transfer of polyketide intermediates [13].
The formation of PKS requires for the reaction groups that come from coenzyme A. So that host should afford to synthesis the substrate. Suitable host can be chosen or engineered to provide the substrate. The substrate should be firstly linked to CoA that refers to as CoA-linked PKS extender units, which is building blocks of polyketide. The natural PKS utilize 18 compounds including malonyl-CoA,(2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, (2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA, and chloroethymalonyl-CoA and so on[14].
After the synthesis, the product may enter the steps of post-modification.
6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB), the macrocyclic core of the antibiotic erythromycin, is a complex product synthesized through the action of a 6-deoxyerythonolide B synthase (DEBS) by the soil bacterium S.erythraea. DEBS from Saccharopolyspora erythraea has served as a model system for discovering ways to engineer PKSs .The DEBS subunits are encoded by three contiguous erythromycin A (eryA) genes. The gene is divided into three genes, which are organized into six modules that specify how each two-carbon unit of the final product is assembled [15].(Figure2)

Furthermore, SpoOA will inhbit it’s own production this derepressing cassette 2 in such a way that the system, if left to its own devices in the presence of a suitable concentration of PlcR-PapR, will exhibit oscillatory behavior. SpoOA will be synthesized by Gene Art and will be codon optimized for Lactobacillus gasseri so as to ensure optimal production and expression.

Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#prueba pag_-_-_TEXT.html," represents the vector differential operator.
If the diffusion coefficient does not depend on the density then the equation is linear and $D$ is constant. Thus, the equation reduces to the following linear differential equation: $$\frac{\partial \phi (r,t) }{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 \phi(r,t)$$
also called the heat equation.
Making use of this equation we can write pheromones chemicals diffusion equation with no wind effect consideration as:
$$\frac{\partial c }{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 C = D \Delta c$$
where c is the pheromone concentration,  $\Delta$ is the Laplacian operator, and $D$ is the pheromone diffusion constant in air.
If we consider the wind, we face a diffusion system with drift and an advection term is added to the equation above.
$$\frac{\partial c }{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 c - \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} c )$$
where $\vec{v}$ is the average velocity that the quantity is moving. Thus, $\vec{v}$ would be the velocity of the air flow.
For simplicity, we are not going to consider the third dimension. In $2D$ the equation would be:
$$\frac{\partial c }{\partial t} = D \left(\frac{\partial^2 c }{\partial^2 x} + \frac{\partial^2 c }{\partial^2 y}\right) – \left(v_{x} \cdot \frac{\partial c }{\partial x} + v_{y} \cdot \frac{\partial c }{\partial y} \right) = D \left( c_{xx} + c_{yy}\right) - \left(v_{x} \cdot c_{x} + v_{y} \cdot c_{y}\right) $$
For determining a numeric solution for this partial differential equation are used the so-called finite difference methods. The technic consists in approximating differential ratios as $h$ is closer to zero, so they are useful to approximate differential equations.
With finite difference methods, partial differential equations are replaced by its approximations in finite differences, resulting in an algebraic equations system. The algebraic equations system is solved in each node $(x_i,y_j,t_k)$. These discrete values describe the temporal and spatial distribution of the unknown function.
Although implicit methods are unconditionally stable so time steps could be larger and make the calculus process"

Our project Abstract
The RENBO or THERMOGENIC RESPONSE NUTRIENT BIOSENSOR
To develop flexible and better sensors for environmental, agricultural and engineering applications are the aims of the UTP-Panama Team “SynBio Engineering Tool Kit”. In this way we work with Nitrate Biosensor (PyeaR - GFP composite) developed by Team BCCS-Bristol 2010, which expresses fluorescent signals upon nutrient detection, producing a high-resolution map of arable land.  To achieve this goal we use the collateral effect of the AOX enzyme (Alternative oxidase) mainly designed to generate heat in response to a cold-shock, using the hybB promoter. This effect increases the bacteria growth at temperatures below 20°C. Finally we design a prototype device with a better cold shock promoter (CspA promoter) developed by UNAM-CINVESTAV Team in 2010, in order to give our E. coli a “Intelligent Coat"", which means that not to only survive a cold-shock but to also still been able to keep up with his duties due to improve their expression mechanism at low temperature.
