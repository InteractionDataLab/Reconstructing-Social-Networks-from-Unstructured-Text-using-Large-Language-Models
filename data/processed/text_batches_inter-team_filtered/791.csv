Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," we shared protocols for protein expression and His-Tag purification and also collaborated on contacting industry partners relevant to each other’s respective projects. We reached out to waste management companies and thought leaders in Sydney for the Auckland team, and they reached out to horticultural companies in Auckland for us to get advice from!
NCKU-Tainan
The Tainan team had just recovered from Typhoon Megi not long ago, but that hadn’t impeded their work on a glucose biosensor for use in a diabetic context. We exchanged ideas about readout proteins such as our amilCP and their RFP constructs, as well as ideas about the actual biosensor design. We also discussed how we would market our respective sensors in an industrial setting which was very thought-provoking and inspiring!
USYD Primer Design App
We had a similarly great response from the iGEM community about our primer design app. We asked for DNA sequences and their corresponding primers to test the primer design app that we developed!

Toronto,2010,Team:Toronto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Recycling of the water back to the extraction process further concentrates contaminants as more waste material is added to the already contaminated water.  It has been estimated that over 1 billion m3 of tailings pond water will be generated by the year 2025.
They are composed of a wide variety of chemical toxins. Amongst these are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with Naphthalenes, Anthracenes and Fluorenes present at the highest concentrations. These compounds are toxic to the surrounding aquatic ecosystems, and have been shown to have an adverse effect on human health. PAHs are carcinogenic and are also known to have a negative impact on immune function, kidney function, liver function, reproduction and development.
Bioremediation
Bioremediation is the use of microorganisms to return the natural environment altered by contaminants to its original condition. It has been proposed as a possible method for the reclamation of land and water impacted by oil sands development. Although natural examples of these processes exist, they tend to be characterized by slow reaction rates and/or undesirable side reactions.
Over expression of rate limiting enzymes has enjoyed moderate success in overcoming some pathway limitations. However, because enzymes operate within complex, highly organized systems, there is increasing recognition within the metabolic engineering community that spatial organization offers an additional route for optimizing pathway efficiency.
Catechol
Pseudomonas putida, a microbe naturally present in tailings ponds, has the metabolic machinery needed to metabolize many toxins within the tailings ponds. This includes the capability to degrade certain PAHs in tailings ponds such as naphthalenes, anthracenes and fluorenes. These three major PAHs are degraded to form a common compound called catechol. However, this process is slow and inefficient. Since catechol is the common breakdown product in the breakdown of these PAHs, enhancing the breakdown of catechol may lead to an increase in the rate of PAH degradation. This project will look to evaluate how we can increase the degradation rate of catechol in order to achieve faster PAH breakdown.
The metabolic network present in P. putida for degrading catechol is highlighted by the black box in Figure 1.   ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ko00362+C00090 ).
Figure 1.  The degradation of catechol (ortho cleavage pathway) leads to common cellular metabolites, acetyl-CoA and Succinyl-CoA , through the action of five enzyme catalyzed reactions in Pseudomonas putida"

SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Investigation_-_-_TEXT.html," order to meet the needs of the public about knowing knowledge about prevention and control more accurately, we went to Shenzhen Nanshan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention to interview Xu, who has many years of experience in prevention of pests。
Through an interview with Director Xu, we know that the government has always been responsible for the cleaning of the streets. In addition, they will regularly go to the community to teach people to kill the cockroaches effectively. In the interview, they also admitted that the use of chemical methods to kill is indeed a little unfriendly to the environment. But compared with other methods currently on the market, improved chemical reagents are relatively safe and the most efficient. In addition, Director Xu gave us advice on our project. We hope that we can ensure the controllability and efficiency. At the same cost and effectiveness, the CDC is more willing to use a more environmentally friendly biological method to eliminate cockroaches.
Our project is to use Metarhizium anisopidae as fungal insecticide, and mainly for family, so we want to design a product based on the characteristics of cockroaches and Metarhizium. In the first version of the box, we did the relevant experiments and found that the efficiency of this box is not good.
The cockroach can't go inside the box smoothly, we need to make further improvements. We learned that Professor Zhongkang Wang from Chongqing University has made great achievements in the research on Metarhizium. He also has a  company in Chongqing, which is also a research institution for Metarhizium. So we came to Chongqing University and visited Professor Wang.
First of all, Professor Wang says that the design of our box is unreasonable. It is too difficult for cockroach to enter the box,and the box itself is not very attractive. Then he simply described the habit of cockroach. He said that they like to climb slopes,  harbour in gaps and live in dark environment. Then he said that powder of Metarhizium isn't as convenient and effective as emulsifiable powder he recommended in the company. Emulsifiable powder can be well-attached to the non-woven fabric, and a small amount of oil can be added to make the emulsifiable powder adhere better to the cockroach surface and infect the cockroach.
In the afternoon, Professor Wang took us to visit his factory. He briefly introduced the fermentation process of some fungus. After listening to the introduction of our project, he thought highly of this . If we can manufacture it, he can help"
Worldshaper-Nanjing,2017,Team:Worldshaper-Nanjing#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," help of the Internet, we were able to let our research heard.
On July 7th, our first article was born on Wechat official account ""WorldshaperNJ"". In this short passage, we explained who we are, made a brief illustration of our project, and expressed our concern about the environment and the future ahead of us. Since then, as our followers began to increase, we have updated much writing involving the progress of our project and explanation of many basic experimental skills. For instance, we demonstrated theories behind abstract words like plasmid extraction, carbon capture and storage and polymerase chain reaction. In addition, we also posted our questionnaire to acquire a better understanding of the public’s awareness of greenhouse gases along with other issues as indicated in ‘survey’ section. Some of the articles or videos portrayed our hard yet fulfilling lab life and our human practices in various places.
'Looking back at these passages, I can clearly recall the moment when I was sitting in front of the computer, scratching my hair only to think of a joke or pun to keep people interested in our articles. Revealing the secrets of science to the public is not a piece of cake, because science can be boring sometimes and nobody likes to spend his time reading through a tedious essay. That is why the job of human practice is important, for it allows people to stay in touch with science, which is changing at a rapid pace.' said Muchen Qi, the team member in charge of maintenance of our official account.
By writing these articles, we wish in heart that the readers can understand the work we are doing and the importance of it. We also want people to always possess a curious mind towards science and technology. Last but not least, we hope that the public can be more aware of the danger hidden in carbon dioxide and give a helping hand to mother Earth.
In addition, we also hold lab tours to those who were interested in biology and wanted to learn more about synthetic biology and iGEM. We were very lucky to find ourselves among these biology enthusiasts and introduced them different procedures and equipment as well as our project.

Human Practices
It is not enough to be compassionate. You must act.- Dalai Lama
Introduction
Human Practices for us means to show our project to the public, our excitement for it and to encourage as many people as possible to think about and participate in the discussion regarding synthetic biology and the various aspects linked to it. At the same time, it also means to get external input on how to further improve and adjust our project, solve problems and work together as a team effectively and having fun on the way. On the following page you will see what we have accomplished throughout the year. We hope you will enjoy reading!
Integrated Human Practices
This year we chose a project which contains a highly potent neurotoxin: the botulinum toxin - shortly botox. It was inspired by the paper “Engineering Botulinum Neurotoxin C1 as a Molecular Vehicle for Intraneuronal drug delivery” by Prof. Dr. Ichtchenko who showed that three amino acid mutations reduce the toxicity of botulinum toxin C so far to be considered as safe and to be taken from the list of bioweapons. Because of the detoxification we thought it should be possible to work in S1 laboratories and thereby fulfill the iGEM lab safety guidelines. We had to overcome a few obstacles before we were able to do so. For this purpose we stayed in contact with experts of botulinum toxin throughout the year and accompanying to our project. We gained a lot of important knowledge and invaluable advice from the correspondence in this research field. It also offered us the opportunity to modify certain parts of lab work and the chance to restructure our project. Due to the advice of experts like Dr. Binz we learned a lot about how to handle toxic substances in the lab and came up with a safety concept. Through interviews with politicians, medical doctors and scientific researchers who gave us constructive feedback and some new insights we got to reevaluate the potential of our project, possible areas of use and smart additions to it.
Our guideline for working with future projects of potentially high risk
Identifying Risk Factors
After we found our project we knew there would be difficulties concerning safety and handling since botulinum toxin is one of the world’s most toxic substances, listed as a potential bioweapon. As we tried to discover how we could work with it nonetheless we came across the possibility to insert specific mutations which render the protein atoxic.  Because we new, that there is a working group in the in Institute"

Accordingly, Omomyc works as a suppressor of Myc/Max binding to E-box elements and leads to a suppressed activation of artificial E-box promoter elements. In the past it was shown that Omomyc can selectively trigger apoptosis in cells overexpressing Myc, however the exact mechanism remains unclear. Researchers proposed that this happens through the transcriptional repression of specific genes. Through its ability to induce apoptosis in cells overexpressing Myc, as various cancers do, Omomyc may be subject to new therapeutic opportunities in the future.
Assays
HBit Nano Glo
To evaluate whether small peptides can be delivered into a neuronal cell via BoNTC, we expressed HiBit in frame with the light chain. This peptide is part of a split luciferase and  has a very high affinity to the 18kDa LargeBit (LgBit) (for further information on the HiBit nanoluciferase visit the protein constructs page). The functional luciferase produces a strong luminescence signal at very low concentrations (> 1pM) that can be detected in a luminescence assay. Since we faced multiple complications in the purification process, we first tested all purification fractions on HiBit concentration by adding the luciferase substrate and LgBit to 50µl protein fraction. The resulting luminescence was quantified in a TecanM200 Infinite Pro plate reader showing that HiBit still binds to LgBit when fused to BoNTC and is not impaired in its luciferase function. Further the highest concentration of BoNTC-HiBit was found in the wash fraction 1 (Figure 1) which is why we decided to use this fraction for the following evaluation of BoNTC’s shuttle efficiency in our cell culture model.
Figure 1
Figure 1:  HiBit Nano-Glo luminescence assay in five different protein fraction of the purification process. 50µl of each purification fraction was incubated with 0,5µl LgBit, 50µl reaction buffer and 1µl Nanoluciferase substrate for 15 minutes at 4°C. Values are presented as relative luminescence units (RLU).
The cell based luciferase assay was designed in a way that BoNTC-HiBit is first incubated with the cells for a 60 minutes duration to allow endocytosis. The cells are afterwards rinsed two times with PBS to remove residual"

We can also make pENTR5-CMV glycerol stocks
Bacterial Cell:
Lux cells that didn’t glow were not a result of the “destroyed” operon, they should be fine if we continue to grow them but under different conditions (the Cambridge iGEM team suggests that the cells be grown at 30C)
Can we put CHR2 in bacteria (especially because ours is human optimized)
Gaussia and manually inserted coelenterazine is the fastest way to show that this project is feasible.  –Arielle Clynes
We want to figure out what types of control handles that we have: need to figure light/time scale by characterizing gaussia and the coelenterazine that we have and what concentrations of each that we need.
We haven’t done anything with the biobrick aequorin; we only have about 4ng of it.  It is worth PCRing.
What is our end goal with the bacteria?
They can be the sender cells
Good to compare the intensity of light given from the lux brick vs. what we are using

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". Yin also introduced the history, composition and approval process of the Chinese Hospital Ethics Committee to us. When we talk about the current ethical situation in China, we find that the lack of cross-disciplinary talents is one of the major reasons that leads to issues in medical ethics. Humanists show their ignorance of medical knowledge, while physicians lack ethical literacy and critical thinking. While law is the lowest bottom line for developing technology, ethics makes the ever-changing technology responsible for the world. We take this opportunity to review the purpose, design and execution of our project through an ethical perspective. The STEP system is designed to treat tumor, which is the second leading cause of death in the world; we hope that our system can be good for the world. In the experiments, we think that cell and molecular cloning experiments are not mature enough to reach phase where use of mice is possible as we don't want to hurt innocent mice just to produce good-looking data. We hope that the input of scientific research resources can bring real results. Medical ethics have been neglected for too long in China. Under the guidance of Dr. Yin, we improved experimental design and execution and wrote a paper on the ethical issues of Chinese tumor immunotherapy, hoping to arouse more ethical awareness of scientific and clinical researchers to make our investigation more responsible for the world.
Jun Yao Associate Professor, Law school of Fudan University Expert in Health Regulations
Is there a lack of regulations concerned in China? Yao was graduated from Shanghai Medical College and later changed his major into law. He has years of experience in dealing with law problems with hospitals, patients and the health administrative department. He was just compiling the book Medical Law when we arrived at his office. After consulting literature, we found that there are still problems about the cellular immunotherapy in China, such as undefined supervisor, ineffective measures of standardization and so on. And that's why we are here to consult him. According to Yao, there is not a single organization that has gained permission for the clinical application of cellular immunotherapy, and all are still at the stage of clinical trial. Therefore, as far as medical organizations are concerned, they are obligated to report their cases to the health administrative department and obtain permission, inform patients of the potential risk and outcome of their experiment without charge. As for China Food and Drug Administration(CFDA)and National Health Commission，they should establish a sound legal system to supervise the whole process from research and development to industrial production and clinical application comprehensively. In addition, he also called for the emergence of cross-disciplinary talents in medicine and law. Yao made compliments on our attention we had paid to relevant laws"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," University of Melbourne 2016 iGEM team, who focused on targeting students in the final years of high school. Given the local context of a changing high school syllabus in the New South Wales state this year, this proved a logical focus for our team. The session we chose to run was based on enzymes, which are integral to our project, but are also important more broadly within society. This allowed us to present on a topic of relevance to synthetic biology, aligning with the major focus of this workshop - to inspire student interest in the field of science as a whole4. Not only was this topic in the new education modules, but it also conformed with the theory that successful biotechnology education requires presenters to focus on the basic concepts of biology5 - of which enzyme properties is arguably one.
Having decided this, we were able to get in contact with the Year 11 Biology teacher at Roseville College, a Sydney girls’ school, whose students had chosen to do enzymes for their depth study. This teacher was also a former iGEM-er!
On the day
UNSW iGEM created and ran a ‘University Biology’ taster workshop for a group of students from a Sydney girls’ school (Roseville College). The day included presentations from the team, hands-on experiments and handouts, in order to engage the students in stimulating conversations about enzymes, synthetic biology, and university life more generally.
The excursion started with presentations from the team to teach the students about more advanced enzyme concepts, like inhibition, before diving into some hands-on practical work. This included teaching the students how to use air displacement micro-pipettes, a piece of equipment they could not access at their school. These skills were used as part of an investigation into the digestive function of lipase, which was then linked back to nutrition (and other school modules) that they had previously studied. The team ended the day with a discussion of genetic engineering, particularly with regards to the use of genetic switches, by providing the students with Pichia Pastoris plates to observe. These plates had genetically recombined lipase activity, and were able to illustrate to the students how methanol in the plate media could switch on lipase activity.
As the students left, they each received an envelope detailing a different one of our team’s favourite enzymes, with an image and short description. Their teacher had previously informed us that each student had to be very familiar with one enzyme for a depth study, and so we provided them with information on a range of enzymes that were likely novel for them.
Outcomes
The session was a generally positive experience, with"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Ideas and Mechanism_-_-_TEXT.html,"cer DAPG with the repressor will lower the it’s affinity to bind to the operator sites of the promoter, in turn activates promoter transcription. Second,  according to Brynne et al. (2014), the response functions of phlFp is comparable to tetp, as a result, it is possible to fine tune the strength difference of the promoters using different strength of RBS.
2. tetp
The tetp module consists of a Tet repressible promoter upstream of the CDSs of phlF and lacI, which are then followed by the reporter gene, mtagbfp. When tetp is actived, the two repressor proteins, PhlF and LacI will be expressed along with the reporter gene, mtagbfp. This results in the repression of the two other promoters in our system, phlfp and lacp.
Creating a reproducible Tristable Switch with distinct signals is another goal we would like to achieve this year.  As the three states are interconnected with each other, high level of stochastic noise could possibly lead to indistinct signals and thus disrupt the stability of our genetic circuit. As a result, the tetp we used is an improved version with minimized background expression. With this, we hope to minimize the number of variants that may affect the stability of our genetic circuit so as to achieve the goal mentioned previously.
3. Reporters
We have used three fluorescence proteins, mRFP, mTagBFP and sfGFP as our reporters to indicate the signal outputs generated by the Tristable Switch. As the result, overlapping in the excitation wavelength of the fluorescence proteins should be minimized.

Wiki Update
Calm before the storm… The deadline for the wiki freeze is approaching fast. Although it seems as if not much has happened with                                                     the wiki, behind the scenes a lot of work has been done.                                                     The past month a template for all our major pages has been programmed, so that the final text can be easily inserted when ready. For navigation purposes these templates also include an                                                     automatically                                                     generated quick-navigation, soft-links and even a few custom                                                     designed icons. As soon as the text is done for a page, it will be - in theory - just a case of copy and paste and all will be done. Let’s hope the iGEM servers will not give in under the pressure                                                     of                                                     over 300 teams uploading files at the same time…

I will be working on the ""back end"" of the program, while she works on the ""front end."" Already, we have multiple carousels working properly, with the ability to switch between them using arrow keys, an underlying tree structure, and anchors which indicate which carousel is selected. Now, I am going to be working on adapting code from a previous Wellesley project, MoClo planner, to work in Unity, so that my team can use this code in our project. The code is intended to poll the iGem parts registry, and return information on a selected part dynamically.
July 19
Getting that code to work was harder than I thought it would be, but it's finally nearly working perfectly. I had to change a few outdated ways of polling websites which were used in the previous design, change the directory to which the code referred (the site is now parts.iGem.org, rather than partsregistry.org), and fix a particularly nasty bug which generated far too much text per site (it was difficult to identify the error, as the program froze and crashed with each run). There is only one step left now - finding a way to get the ""usefulness"" field to poll properly. The html code surrounding this data varies, which makes it difficult to find a consistent way to identify this field. Hopefully, I'll come up with something next week.

2. If the external pH=2,5 and internal pH begins pH=4.2 ± 0.1. GDAR system will activate for acid resistance.
3. GadC is a transmembrane protein. The external pH begins to change from neutral pH to acidic pH, C-plug (is GadC’s subunit) will open. Then glutamate will take inside.
4. Glutamate in cells convert to GABA by GadB/C that’s glutamate decarboxylase isozymes These steps are as follows:
*This step contains pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzymes that replace the α-carboxyl groups of their amino acid substrates with a proton that is recruited from the cytoplasm.
*HCl that diffusion from outside dissociates H+ and Cl-. This H+ is used and CO² is released by the agency of GadA/B isozymes than this is the last stage of glutamate changes to GABA. Besides this is the most important and the last step for acid resistance
5. If H+ leaves HCl it is staying back Cl and it will be export from the transport of chlorine channel.
6. The emitted CO² is taken out by diffusion.

In this section, our aim is to synthesize the TlpB protein in our E.coli so that It can penetrate the stomach mucus layer, where our pathogenic bacteria, H.pylori, resides.
Tobenhance the production of our protein TIpB, we aim to assemble our TIpB gene with T7 promoter which is a fast and strong promoter whilst designing our parts.
To control the system, we decided to add a Lac Operator, where LacI protein can bind, between TIpB gene sequence and promoter. We searched for an expression vector which includes Lac Operon and found that peT45-b has the properties.
When ordering our genes we added RFC10 prefix site to 3’ end and RFC10 suffix site to the 5’ end of TlpB gene and also added BamHI and XhoI restriction site sequence on the Pet45-b for cloning.
We planned to clone TlpB gene we ordered as described above to the Pet45-b vector with using BamHI and XhoI enzymes.
When this cloning is achieved succesfully, there will be a construct which has the order T7 Promoter-Lac Operon (LacO)- HisTag-TlpB and also there are"

Below is a chronological journey through our experimental progress.
April
4/1
First iGEM meeting - Discussion of team progress and possible projects to perform for iGEM.
4/15
Meeting with potential on campus collaborators to discuss CBCR background and field.
4/29
Team agreement to base our summer research focus on CBCR expression in E. Coli and Bacillus. We decided that this would be an ideal project for our group because there are already a few experts at UC Davis on CBCR’s, among the feasibility and compatibility of using CBCR’s as an iGEM summer research project.
May
5/10
Meeting with on-campus collaborators to learn more about CBCR background information. Met with a researcher named Nathan C. Rockwell who is an expert on CBCR’s and have published multiple papers on how CBCR’s work through our institution, UC Davis. l
5/11
Meeting with MARS scientist to discuss industry needs and concerns with dyes as food colorants. In the process of these interviews, we discovered that we do not need to worry about having our cells autolyse because the MARS industry has specific machines already in place to control for this. The industry standard for organism-produced dyes has been Spirulina, therefore we decided to keep our workflow in Bacillus and E. Coli similar to Spirulina so our fits into the existing industry framework .
5/13
Explored iGEM prior art and discovered that only 20 teams have ever utilized the CBCR complex, 11 of which were biosensors, and 9 were to influence cellular function. No teams have ever adapted CBCRs for any form of use in food. Previous iGEM teams have also not attempted expression in Bacillus, let alone, produce CBCRs in a concentrated form.

Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team
The spores containing deactivated versions of cwlD and sleB/cwlJ
Prof. Anne Moir from Sheffield University kindly sent us spores, containing deactivated versions of the genes cwlD and sleB/cwlJ. These are genes that allow germination, which we plan to disable for use as our metal container.
The two eppendorf tubes containing the spores have been placed in a yellow box (labelled ""iGEM Sporulation Tuning Team 04/08/09 JM/JH"")in the fridge and are:
HC401 (FrpC2, cwlJ:: Kan, sleB-lacZ Ery R)
AM1877 (cwlD,Cmr, trp C2)
In the protocol given to us by Prof. Moir, there are two methods (Methods A and B), which can be used to recover the cwlD spores. However, neither give complete restoration of germination.
Currently we have no method for restoration of the sleB/cwlJ spores.
The same protocol is used to recover the sleB and cwlJ spores.
Referring to Prof. Moir's protocols, Method A is a fast method which results in partial germination of approximately 0.1%. Method"

Firstly, I tried to use PCR amplify (annealing temperature 60℃) each hybrid promoter that we ordered from IDT. But only BBa_K1913026 had been amplified correctly (Fig.2) after PCR-clean-up (102.1 ng/ μL), I digested it with EcoRI and PstI 1 hour and ligated them with pSB1C3 vector 2 hour. And transformed it into DH5α cell and got the plasmid finally (40 ng/ μL). In order to get other hybrid promoter by using PCR, I diluted DNA solution of IDT 10 times and used it to do PCR again twice, but the bands were still weak(Fig.3). Secondly, I transformed BBa_K1491009+BBa_M0050, BBa_K515005+ BBa_M0050 and picked up colony from the plates and checked the correct inserted part by using PCR. And then culture them over night and purified plasmids (76 ng/ μL, 149.6 ng/ μL). And the sequencing results of these two construction were correct. Last, after I got the plasmid of BBa_K1491009+BBa_M0050, I digest digested it with EcoRI and SpeI 1 hour as well as BBa_P0440 and BBa_P0412 with XbaI and PstI 1hour. and ligated them with pSB1A3 vector 2 hour. Then I picked up colony from the plates and checked inserted parts by PCR and cultured the correct strain(Fig.4). After plasmid purification of these two construction (mRFP+P0440 117.6 ng/ μL, mRFP+P0412 93.2ng/ μL). And also the sequencing results of these two construction were both correct. In addition, I cultured riboswitch strains contain BBa_K1913008 and BBa_K1913009.

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Sense_-_-_TEXT.html," phosphorylating a response regulator protein (Stock et al. 2000). This activates the response regulator (which we suspect to be EtnR1), enabling it to perform its effector function. In most cases, the response regulator is a transcription factor (Stock et al. 2000).
EtnR1 has DNA-binding and kinase domains and EtnR2 has a MEDS domain.
From protein domain analysis and searching of protein databases, EtnR1 was found to have a helix-turn-helix domain near the C terminus which is a DNA-binding motif commonly associated with negative repressor transcription factors in prokaryotic systems. EtnR1 was also found to have a kinase domain near the N terminus, which is commonly linked with activating/deactivating phosphorylation marks. EtnR2 has a MEDS domain, which is commonly associated with a substrate sensing-role, being found in methane-sensing for methylotrophs and methanogens.
Experimental Aims
We had a twofold curiosity to understand and characterise the EtnR1/2 system better, and also utilise it as ethylene-responsive circuitry. In order to do this, we needed to:
• Test recombinant expression of EtnR1 and EtnR2 in E. coli.
• Characterise the interactions between ethylene, EtnR1, EtnR2 and the putative promoter
We would first determine whether the BL21 DE3 strain of E. coli. could support the expression of our two mycobacterial genes. After confirming expression of EtnR1/2 and affinity purification, we can decipher the precise protein-DNA, protein-protein and protein-substrate interactions that make up our system.
This would serve as a proof of concept for a novel regulatory mechanism of ethylene degradation in Mycobacterium NBB4 and other mycobacterial strains.
Figure 4. Experimental characterisation of EtnR1 and EtnR2 interactions with ethylene, the putative promoter and each other. The various assays that would be used to characterise each interaction are listed in the boxes on the right.
Expression Constructs
Figure 5. pET28c construct with main characteristics: IPTG-inducible expression, N-terminal His-Tag for affinity purification.
We selected pET28c to use for the expression of our mycobacterial proteins as it was available in the laboratory and contained an N-terminal His6-Tag independent of insert, meaning that we could proceed to protein characterisation following expression with the same construct. pET28 also has"
ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," to span the ODE system, we employ rules-based models. For this methodology, we define seed species and rules on how they can interact. In practice the software Ru2ren (to be published by Christian Mayer ) then generates the system of coupled ODEs.
As an input to the decoder, we use a combination of ab initio constants from our photoconversion model and a mechanistical model of the receptor mode of action, parameters from literature and assumed respectively desired parameters. Given such models and parameters, the biological implementation can then be optimised.
We first analyse the separation (dynamic range) and timescale of UVR8 dimerisation/dissociation: UVR8-only
Having demonstrated a realistic time frame for production of the protecting substance PABA, we continue to model the decoder in a more complex processing circuit:

→ Yes. We focus on the availability of an ingredient of date rape drugs. This potential misused has been evaluated carefully. The benefit of the published knowledge outweighs the potential risk, because we found the critical information already published and easily assessable. Therefore, our knowledge provides protection by creation of a biosensor and raise of the awareness of the potential danger of date rape drugs.
In case of collaboration, does the sharing of devices or information create the potential of misuse?
→ Sharing the device does not contain the risk of misuse. Sharing the information contains the same risk as publication of said knowledge.
In case of potential risk, did you initiate oversight or seek ethical/legal council or advice?
→ Yes. We contacted the ethics commission of our university and the iGEM safety committee. Unfortunately, no advice could be given by our ethics commission. The iGEM safety committee agreed with us, that the information we provide is already published and easily accessible and therefore does not contain a risk that would justify the restriction of publication on our wiki.
How were your concerns addressed in your project?
→We addressed the dual use issue and biosecurity concerns in a detailed analysis as proposed here. We propose the integration of biosecurity measures for further teams. We educated ourselves about the laws and regulations. We discussed the concern with our advisors and instructor. We decided to conctact the ethics council at our university and the iGEM ethics committee. We applied additional biosecurity measures to the substance of possible biosecurity concern.

The report (“Dual Use - A report by the Team iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2015”) the Team iGEM Bielefeld CeBiTec 2015 has submitted in the context of the iGEM competition, as an aspect of their synthetic biology project, is in my view an innovative contribution that will help promote the aim of the iGEM to foster conscientious members of the synthetic biology community. Several surveys over the past ten years have clearly documented that the majority of scientists involved in modern life sciences work do not devote a great deal of active consideration to questions of biosecurity, mainly because they have little awareness of possible dual-use implications of their work.

The story so far
Our device is going to be implemented for individual testing on tropical diseases. We have considered three different scenarios that illustrate the modularity of our device: a neglected, long-known epidemic (HAT), a recent outbreak (Zika virus) and a relatively new disease which might cause an outbreak in the future.
But how can we approach these three scenarios the best? Should we focus on one, or is it possible to tackle all three of them at the same time?
Experts at Rathenau Institute
Guide to the Integrated Human Practices
We talked to several experts at the Rathenau Institute about our project. They advised us to get into contact with end-users, as well as NGOs, and to take advantage of the expertise present at the Wageningen University & Research (WUR). Moreover, they suggested we specify the disease we are tackling and which population is most affected. Other experts agreed that a clear, coherent idea is needed for people to understand the aim of the project. This way, we can combine both specificity and modularity of the device.
We talked to:
Within the Rathenau institute we talked to dr. Dirk Stemerding, assistant professor at University of Twente, expert in biotechnology and society.
Wieke Betten, PhD student at Athena Institute (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam), expert in bioethics and the sociology of science and technique.
Marjoleine van der Meij, PhD student at Athena Institute (VU Amsterdam), expert in science education, bioengineering and communication design.

Comprehensive Environmental Assessment
Introduction to CEA
As scientists, we are often inclined to reduce complex procedures down to simple, step-by-step protocols. Assessing risk and evaluating environmental impact are no exception; our first instinct this year was to create a universal checklist of regulations that every environmental iGEM project could fulfill in order to ensure environmental safety, the idea being that we could easily and systematically find answers to questions of environmental safety in scientific literature. However, upon speaking with Dr. Christina Powers, a biologist at the US Environmental Protection Agency, and further exploring the concerns relating to our own project, we decided to adopt a new approach to issues of human practices: Comprehensive Environmental Assessment (CEA).
CEA differs from traditional methods of risk assessment by recognizing that risk assessment is fundamentally a decision-making process in which scientists, experts, and the public should be engaged. The goal is to foster transparent discussion and use collective judgment to evaluate limitations and trade-offs in order to arrive at holistic conclusions about the primary issues that researchers should address in their research planning.
CEA & Synthetic Biology
While the Environmental Protection Agency primarily uses the CEA approach for nanomaterials, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., recently launched efforts to lay out a framework to apply CEA to synthetic biology. This groundbreaking project set out to assess the CEA approach’s relevance to synthetic biology, in anticipation of the growing demand for synthetic biology-based solutions to global issues. They arrived at the conclusion that scientists should focus on four major areas of risk assessment: altered physiology, competition and biodiversity, evolutionary prediction, and gene transfer.
The Woodrow Wilson Center’s Synthetic Biology Project recommended that CEA be applied to more developed projects that were approaching field deployment in order to evaluate it as a risk-assessment approach for synthetic"

DESCRIPTION
CRISPR-Cas9 System
Introduction
By creating a modular plasmid that is compatible with the BioBrick standards and that is able to replicate in both E. coli and Y. lipolytica, the entire biobrick registry has been made available for use in Y. lipolytica. However, one important aspect of industrial-scale protein expression is the stable and homogenous expression of relevant pathway genes. In production organisms with multi-enzyme pathways there is often a need for accurate control of the expression levels of the associated genes, both in terms of promoter strength and copy numbers 11 . Plasmid based systems for the expression of heterologous genes are widely used, but offer limited control of copy number and in many cases show notable segregational instability even during growth in selective media. Therefore, it is often preferred to integrate the genetic pathway of interest into the genome of the production organism of choice to ensure long-term strain stability and homogenous expression of pathway genes 11 .
The CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized the way in which model organisms can be engineered. In addition, it has made genetic engineering applicable to a wide range of organisms that were previously considered to be uninteresting for cell factory purposes, largely because the genetic engineering tools for these organisms were under characterized. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is ideally suited for the integration of heterologous genes in production organisms, as it relies on Double Strand Break (DSB) induction and its subsequent repair by homologous recombination (HR). In addition, almost any sequence of interest can be targeted with the most commonly used Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes 12 . The basic mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 is illustrated in Figure 8, for a more detailed overview the reader is referred to Nødvig et al. 12

The displays really fascinated the kids and students, especially the fluorescent bacteria!
Contacting Teachers and Schools
We got in contact with many teachers and schools to promote the writing competition. We also wrote articles for Science Resource Newsletters sent to teachers to try and increase the awareness of our project.
Collaboration
University of Melbourne
In preparation for promoting the competition, we contacted the University of Melbourne iGEM team to see if they would like to collaborate.  As part of their outreach, they decided to create their own informative video about Synthetic Biology for high school students, including a one minute feature about Strange Nature!
To see the video, follow this link here
Result
In total, 32 entries were received from all around Australia, ranging from as young as grade 8, up to year 12 students. The best pieces we received demonstrated they had done some research into what Synthetic Biology actually is and the possibilities this new field can bring. The vast majority of submissions we received were incredibly positive about the technology and in many submissions the level of excitement conveyed was incredibly encouraging.
To go beyond simply giving a prize for the ""best"" piece we are providing feedback for each submission to correct some mistakes and also to start a discussion on their topics. We believe that this would help to create a healthy dialogue between interested members of the public, and the research scientists behind the technologies. Many pieces only considered the positive side of an advance, such as in vitro meat, while not addressing the negative problems. Our aim was to encourage students to consider the future of Synthetic Biology and through their submission and the feedback we provide it is our belief that we are prompting them to broaden their thinking of the advances which may come in the future.

To prove our concept that:
(1) We can make the bacteria sense the plasmid numbers.
(2) The in-promoter will respond differently to different signal which                         can reflect the plasmids losing on different levels. This way, our system can                         control the plasmids numbers above a threshold.
We designed two parts. One of them is to prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration. The other one is to prove the inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
Plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration
Because of the difficulty of controlling the number of plasmids, we can only choose some typical copy numbers of plasmids in our system.
The copy numbers are shown in the table below:
Table.1 The copy numbers of different plasmids.
We also constructed the gene circuits containing constitutive promoters with                                 different strengths to express the inhibitor. By this we regulate the threshold                                 of plasmid numbers to meet different needs.
Fig.1 The device constructed to express the inhibitor with a constitutive promoter.
There are four promoters with different strengths and two kinds of RBS we have chosen:
Table.2 The strengths and efficiencies of different promoters and RBS.
Meanwhile, the RFP used to replace the inhibitor protein can directly represent the                                 concentration of the inhibitor in the cell. We separately constructed these circuits on different vectors which have different copy numbers.
At first, we use the modeling to explain the relationship of the concentration of the inhibitor and plasmids number like the curve below under a certain condition
In the wet experiment, after the same amount of time, we will measure the RFP intensity to get the data which can describe the relationship between the inhibitor concentration and the plasmid copy numbers.
The strength of J23106 is stronger J23116, we can clearly know the inhibitor protein have a positive correlation with plasmids number.
This way, we verified that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration on the plasmid vector.
The inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene
In order to know the relationship between the inhibitor and in-promoter, we use the arabinose induced promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor. So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the"

Evaluation
Finally, in the evaluation stage we deploy our refined software tools for use in the wet-lab and evaluate overall user satisfaction regarding the software tools created.
Usability and usefulness: we conducted testing with the BU and MIT teams as well as with Wellesley biology students. We used various quantitative measures (e.g. time on task, subjective satisfaction) and qualitative indicators (e.g. user collaboration and problem solving styles).

5)  Restriction Site Highlighting
The  Enzyme Library contains a list of restriction enzymes that you can search for in  the sequence.  You can select each  enzyme individually, search for them by name or sequence, or select a  pre-assigned group of enzymes.  Let's  try selecting the standard four BioBrick enzymes [EcoRI, PstI, SpeI, and XbaI]:  you can do this by selecting them manually or by going to ""Select by  Group"" and picking the ""BBa Enzymes"" group.  Select the ""Highlight Enzymes"" button, and open the Sequence View window, but don't close the Enzyme Library  just yet.  You should see new orange  highlights in the sequence corresponding to the selected restriction, and just  like features, running the mouse cursor over the highlights shows the  corresponding restriction enzyme. [Clotho supports multiple highlighting, so  you may see features and restriction sequences overlapping one another, and in  that case both names will be shown].

Native anaerobic stability of nitrite in E. coli
Contents
1 Description
2 Methods
3 Results
4 Conclusions and Discussion
Description
The aim of this experiment is to characterize the conversion of nitrite to ammonium in wild type E. coli under anaerobic conditions.
The experiment was performed by adding three different concentrations of nitrite to a medium with a growing native strain of E. coli. The concentrations of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrite (NO2-) were measured every 20 minutes and the experiment lasted for 3 hours. Also two controls: with biomass only (no nitrite) and without biomass were analyzed in order to exclude any external influences on the nitrite conversion.
Methods
The experiment was performed on July 26th . The procedure is based on the Experimental protocol .
Results
Mg of Nitrogen (as Nitrite or Ammonia) per litre measured for varying concentrations of Nitrite added at t=0.  All experiments were performed anaerobically.  Samples were measured every 20 min for 3 hours.
Conclusions and Discussion
Under anaerobic conditions, nitrite is consumed and converted to ammonium.  Since we want to convert the nitrite to nitrous oxide, a functional prototype will require either that the pathway to nitrous oxide be designed to outcompete this pathway, or that this pathway that consumes nitrite be knocked out (and the transformants grown in a medium containing plentiful ammonium so they do not need to synthesize it).

OUC-China,2018,Team:OUC-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a part of our human practice.
2. Integration
By establishing models and molecular predictions, OUC-China constructed a toolkit and named it MINITOE FAMILY. The toolkit can regulate the expression level of targeted gene in a gradient form.
2.1 Integration with labs
""Your hairpin mutant is very conservative. Only a pair of base mutation will not achieve your idealized effect. You can try more bases modifications."" Professor Liang, who studies the range of mutations nucleic acids for about twenty years, gave us some advice on the hairpin mutation.
Having accepted his suggestion, we expanded the range of base mutations, from a pair of base mutation to two or more pair of bases mutation, from the bases mutation on the stem to the bases mutation on the loop. Indeed! Expanding the range of mutations showed us a better expanded expression gradients, which formed a useful toolkit ""miniToe family"" by combining different hairpins with Csy4 mutations. Initially, professor Liang doubted whether crRBS and RBS can be separated after the interaction with Csy4. He was concerned that the cleavage of Csy4 and steric hindrance was not sufficient to break the hydrogen bond between base pairs. But his concern was broken by the expression of fluorescent gene.
Fig.8 We expanded the range of mutations to get a better expanded expression gradients.
""A great idea! It will be better if you can regulate the expression ratio of more than one gene. So your application range can be wider."" said Professor Du of the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Du ever changed the intensity of RBS to achieve different expression levels of the target gene. So we went to Beijing and consulted some question of our project with him. He gave an example of our project application. The traditional way is to knock out a gene then observe different performance of the organism, and your experimental results can be used to explore the effect of different gene expression levels on the function of organisms. Indeed! Inspired by Teacher Du, we considered applying the MINITOE structure to the regulation of gene expression in polycistron expression systems.
Fig.9 Professor Du helped us analyze our project in Institute of Microbiology.
Fig.10 Du said, ""Your project can be used to explore the effect of different gene expression levels on the function of organisms""

Result
We first selected the mutations within the 5Å distance of active site, altogether 33 kinds,                                 and then used point mutation to conduct molecular cloning operation. Next step was to synthesize                                 the acrylic acid using the whole cell catalysis and determined the acrylic acid yield by                                 HPLC. The results are as follows:
In these total 33 mutations of mutational sites, there are 11 mutations' acrylic acid yield higher than that of the wild                                 type, which indicates a higher activity. The highest mutational site F438M presents a yield                                 11 times the wild type. Therefore, it is valid and tangible for us to implement AEMD to design                                 the mutational sites!"

iGEM started as class at MIT in 2003, evolving into an international competition. Today at Srishti we're launching iGEA, - The International Genetically Engineered Art competition - the art and design sibling of iGEM.
Powered by synthetic biology, iGEA explores how this emerging technology can be used for art and design purposes.
DNA parts submitted by teams to the Parts Gallery - an Open Source biological media library - may be used in new art and design works, and even by scientists...
We are an open source platform created to enable artists and designers to find new uses for synbio, to create new discourse about the science, and for implementing and exhibiting your creative projects at the interface of art and science.
Yesterday, we spent the afternoon designing the new competition, the awards and rules.
The Awards
Best Ecosystem
Best New Emotion
Best Social Critique
Best Pop-Culture
Shooting Star (short-lived, burning bright)
Remix Culture
GRAND PRIZE: Gestalt Award
Critics Choice for Visual Aesthetics

iGEM and IIT Madras
IIT Madras has had a very successful history at previous iGEM competitions.   We started participating in 2008 and in our very first iGEM, the team managed to secure a silver medal with two prestigious awards for ‘Best Foundational Advance’ and ‘Best New BioBrick Part or Device, Engineered.’  We backed our highly promising debut at the competition with another silver medal at iGEM 2009.  The 2010 competition saw us rise to the zenith of our capabilities and the team managed to bag IITM’s first gold medal at iGEM.  The legacy continued in iGEM 2011 as IITM received a ‘Safety Commendation’ and the award for the ‘Best New BioBrick Part, Natural’ in the Regional Jamboree and ultimately, another gold medal at the World Championship held annually at MIT, USA.   Undergraduate students from the Department of Biotechnology (IITM), year after year, have shown that they have the quality and the enthusiasm to compete and succeed at the highest level and we really wish to continue the legacy of our institution this year as well.
About the Project
IIT Madras has had a very successful history at previous iGEM competitions.  Shiga toxin is a deadly toxin secreted by Shigella dysenteriae and other shigatoxigenic bacteria. These bacteria inhabit the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract of cattle and produce a biofilm on the walls of the tract which is essential for the secretion of the toxin. According to statistics, more than 1 million people have been killed by the lethal toxin and many more have been infected. There is no established cure for this harmful toxin till date and this motivated us to come up with a feasible solution to this global problem using synthetic biology.  Our idea mainly focuses on: Inhibiting biofilm production. Neutralizing the already produced toxin.  For the first part, we have identified a compound, indole-3-acetaldehyde (I3A), which is a potent biofilm inhibitor. We plan to express the compound by engineering the I3A-producing genes into our host system (E.coli).  For"

Attitudes towards creating a               wiki
According to our survey, most teams (51/66) find it difficult or tedious to create wiki with high quality, especially in very limited time. We also counted the number of word used for writing the wikis in the past 4 years, the average number of word in these wikis is 9531 (HTML tags, javascript and css files are not included, code can be seen on GitHub ). As you can imagine, this needs a huge amount of work! So, we’d like to make some changes.

Online Collaboration
A typical iGEM wiki can be divided into no less than 8 sections                 (like the home page, project, safety, team, and so on). Under                 each section, there are a lot of issues which you want to                 present. Just like the ‘Project’ section, you may                 need to tell others about your background information, design,                 etc. Tedious as it is, we, the same as other 61 teams (61/66),                 believe that collaboration can improve the efficiency of                 creating a wiki. Flight iGEM provides you an online platform, in                 which you can collaborate with your teammates, so every teammate                 can create page and edit them at any time or anywhere. To avoid                 version conflict(covered by others’ edition), we mimic the                 concept of SVN.

Flight iGEM Magic
About half of iGEM teams (32/66) we surveyed hold the opinion that                   creating a wiki requires superior skills in programming, which leads them to feel hard about it. Among 66 teams surveyed by us, the average time used in writing their wikis is 75 days. However, with Flight iGEM, we only used about 10 days to complete our wiki. So, we sincerely                   invite you to click the right arrow and discover what giant                   changes Flight iGEM can make.

ABS as a polymer can take many forms and can be engineered to have many properties. In general, it is a strong plastic with mild flexibility (compared to PLA).
It's strength, shapeability and higher temperature resistance make it often a preferred plastic by engineers and those with mechanical uses in mind.
ABS can be smelted down and recycled very easily provided it is available in suitable purity. Sorting methods do exist to separate ABS from mixed wastes with high efficiency.
Polylactic acid
Figure CAMOUFLAGE CHAMÄLEON: Lewis structure of polylactic acid.
Created from processing any number of plant products including corn, potatoes or sugar-beets, PLA is considered a more 'environmental friendly' plastic compared to petroleum based ABS.
When properly cooled, PLA seems to have higher maximum printing speeds, lower layer heights, and sharper printed corners.
PLA is biodegradable, having a typical lifetime of about 6 months to 2 years until microorganisms break it down into water and carbon dioxide.
To assess the issue of possible growth retardation, we cultivated E. coli with each material and compared the measured growth curves to a control cultivation without addition of plastics.
Figure BRONZE NARWAL: Testing of ABS and PLA plastics for biocompatibility. Both plastics were added to E. coli cultivations and growth was monitored. The resulting growth curves were compared to wild type curves to determine a possible alteration in growth behaviour.
The results shown in in figure LILA PAVIAN and figure UMBRA SEEPFERDCHEN demonstrate, that both ABS and PLA are biocompatible. Also, all brands of polysiloxane except B1 and the rubber are suitable as gasket material.

Digestion Protocol
One or more restriction enzymes are used to digest                         the DNA, resulting in either non-directional or                         directional insertion into the compatible plasmid. DNA                         was obtained after doing athe Miniprep (Plasmid DNA                         Mini Kit I Spin Protocol). For carrying out the                         digestion to check if desired fragment is inside the                         plasmid it is necessary to mix up the followingnext                         components in a 200 ul Eppendorf.

The desired insert size for the clone                         library determines which enzymes are selected, as well                         as the digestion conditions. Generally, once the mix is                         done, it is necessary to incubate it at 37°C at least 1                         hour.

Agarose gel electrophoresis
Prepare Agarose gel
Agarose gel is used in a concentration of 1% to                             separate medium size fragments. The gel is made                             with agarose powder, TAE buffer 1X and ethidium                             bromide. It is necessary to adjust the amount of                             agarose to get the desired gel concentration. For                             example, with 1g of agarose / 100 mL of TAE 1X, the                             gel concentration will be 1%. The ethidium bromide                             concentration is 1:1000 in TAE Buffer (In the                             previous example, 1 μL is needed).

Testing chassis survival in sugar water
The final BeeT product will be applied using sugar water, which is transported into the hive by worker bees. This means that our chassis needs to be able to survive in a nutrient limited environment, which does have a high sucrose content. In order to test this, we simulated a sugar water environment and tested whether bacteria can survive it. The result of this was that our chassis bacteria, Escherichia coli , was able to survive up to at least an entire day in the sugar water. This means that the bees will have at least 24 hours to pick up some of our BeeT.
The modeling results from the metabolic modeling project only showed what would happen in the time period of 90 seconds to 90 minutes after being put in the sugar water. Because of this, more evidence was needed to see what would happen to the E. coli in the sugar water for the time scales we are interested in. We know the"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Market#_-_-_TEXT.html," During this process, the water becomes contaminated with fine silts alongside many highly toxic chemicals, making it unsafe to return to the environment. The potential toxicity from oil sands processed water (OSPW) has led to Alberta’s zero discharge policy. All oil sands tailings water must be stored in a contained environment (known as a tailings pond) where the fine silts are settled out so the water can be reused in oil sands processing streams. In the longer term, the water is stored with the goal of eventually remediating the toxins so that the site can be reclaimed.
Today, 200 million litres of contaminated tailings water is produced every day. These tailings ponds of contaminated water cover over 176 km2, an area 50% larger than the City of Vancouver. They are expected to reach 250 km2 by 2020. Holding 840 million m3 of water as of today, this will expand their volume to 1.2 billion m3 of water (Comprehensive Guide to the Alberta Oil Sands - May 2011). Every effort is made to reuse the water in the processing cycle, however it contains highly corrosive contaminants (naphthenic acids for example) that result from the extraction process and can cause corrosion damage to equipment that can lead to expensive repairs and costly shutdowns. In addition, these tailing ponds have been found to seep into the surrounding environment, releasing toxins into nearby rivers which harm wildlife and contaminate ecologically sensitive areas.
Stemming from concerns for environmental contamination, monitoring of wastewater and the surrounding environment is mandated by the government. Through the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan released in 2011, the number of ground & surface water quality and soil testing sites along rivers & ecologically sensitive areas is set to double by 2015, with more remote testing sites to be introduced. In this plan, costs for sampling are shared unequally between government and industry players.
Large oil companies generally hire environmental monitoring and consulting companies in order to do this testing. These groups either collect and test samples themselves or have samples from many waste streams shipped to a central facility for testing. These companies are actively searching for better technologies to rapidly detect toxic compounds in process water alongside existing soil, surface water, and groundwater testing. With more remote testing sites being introduced, they also require more portable technologies and are poised to be one of the largest customer bases for our technology. The environmental sensing and monitoring market is growing substantially. In the United States, it is expected to reach $15.3 billion by 2016 (BCC Research).

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#CraigNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," slightly more complicated design.  After clicking the ""Test Design"" button, the GUI produces a table displaying the results.  This can be seen below.
The first column of the table shows each part permutation.  If an input is found which creates this configuration, then that row of the table is updated with the following information: the actual configuration of the parts including which parts are complemented, the series of input invertases added which led to that part permutation, and the length of the input vector that led to that permutation.  In this example, we see that every part permutation row is filled out with this information, and thus, every part permutation can be made given the design.  This is made even more obvious by the bright green bar below the graph which indicates that a complete set of permutations can be generated.  If our design was not successful, our table and graph would look something like the following.
It is also important to note that if the ""Auto Input"" box is not checked, the input text area becomes available.  In this area, we can enter which invertases we would like to permute as inputs.  For example, if we only wanted to see which part permutations could be made with invertases 1, 2, and 3, in this text area, we could enter ""1 2 3"".  Given this input, the tool tests every permutation and combination of these three elements only.

b, The                                     result of single bacteria colony PCR after optimization. It’s clear that the length                                     of PCR production is less than 2kb.
c, The result of single bacteria colony PCR                                     after                                     optimization. It’s clear that the length of PCR production is less than 2kb.

The 12 lane is negative control which                                     undergoes the PCR without template. The 13 lane is positive control using the wild                                     type bacteria as template.
e, The recombination colony is obviously lower than                                     2000bp and has non-specific band at 1000bp. The wild type’s specific band is at                                     2000bp and the non-specific band is at 700bp.

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#fluid game_-_-_TEXT.html," you win this round. If you win three rounds, then congratulations, you win the game!
    OK, Let’s Begin to learn how to play it!
    Before each game begins, You can input the number of each bacteria.
    Then you can press “Start” to begin this game.
    Now, they begin to kill each other, and the number of them is displayed at the top.(The numbers are showed logarithmically. For example, when the length is 10, the number of bacteria is 1010. If you do not want to wait for too long, you can press ""Fast"" to accelerate the process)
    After each round, you can click the button ""OK"" to play the next round or you can click the button ""Quit"" to exit the game.
III Game strategy
    Although we cannot figure out exactly how the initial numbers determine the result, we do find out some rules. Here are some of them and hope that they can help you to win.
    Because farmers provide nutrients for both sides, they have no effect in each side in terms of nutrients. Farmers only play a role in counting the total number of bacteria. Take this into consideration when you are placing farmers.
    Warriors can attack enemy, which is beneficial for their own side.  When the number of our warriors is bigger than AI's, and the number of our beggars is less than AI's, we will be more likely to win. The mechanism of winning is that our bacteria will keep growing faster.
    Because beggars do not have any production, they grow the fastest. When the number of warriors of both sides is closer and the number of our beggars is bigger than AI's, we will be more likely to win. The mechanism of winning is that the number of our beggars will be far greater than AI's.

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," American one, and there are far fewer localized hospitals; instead, most medical analysis happens at large, centralized government labs. They saw great value in the digital health platform as the Indian government has recently embraced the “digital era” and are pushing forward with a grant of $100,000 to support our research going forward.
Takeaway:
Talking to Mr. Kumar and the individuals who part of the Social Alpha team opened our eyes to some of the challenges of having a social venture. They helped dissect the anatomy of a good business idea and then gave us the chance to explain ; after talking to them, we realized that we would have to tweak our go-to market strategy in India by either partnering with the government or plug directly into Indian pharmaceuticals’ who could serve as channels of distribution. In addition, our team decided to take the step of putting together a policy framework about the steps that policymakers and scientists can make in order to bring better-quality diagnostics to the areas that need them the most.
Dr. Mike Pellini, Section 32 and Former CEO of Foundation Medicine
In order to get a thorough assessment of our clinical and financial validity, we turned to Dr. Mike Pellini, a venture capitalist here in San Diego. We had the chance to sit down with him and give an informal pitch that laid out the existing problems in cancer diagnostics and bottlenecks in liquid biopsy and how our innovation in the lab directly addressed those concerns. He appreciated the modularity of our approach, telling us that as a potential investor, his primary concern would be the ability to enter adjacent markets . Because he is an investor in Freenome, which would be our most significant competition in the space, he was able to answer some of the deeper questions about liquid biopsy and the direction of the industry. He also really appreciated the stakeholder-focused approach that we took, and eventually provided us with his personal testimony, which we have included in the Entrepreneurship section and landing page of the wiki.
Takeaway:
Although most of the feedback we got from Dr. Pellini was positive, he did mention that to take our idea to market beyond the scope of iGEM, it would be essential to come up with a pricing framework and a successful business model that leveraged our value propositions. He validated our price point of $250 and gave us most of our current information about the healthcare reimbursement strategies, and also encouraged us to focus on performing some TAM, SAM, and TM calculations. All of these calculations are included in our business plan on the wiki, and we have also attached our pitch deck."

Construction of delivery vectors for miniTn7BB
In order to propagate the miniTn7BB-Gm minitransposon and to facilitate further genetic manipulation and transfer to the target strains for transposition, we decided to construct two different delivery plasmids, based on the vectors pUC18Sfi (Herrero et al., 1990) and pUC18R6KT ( Choi et al., 2005 ). pUC18Sfi is a pUC18-derived cloning vector harboring an ampicillin resistance marker, a high copy number mutant pMB1 replication origin and the pUC18 multi-cloning site flanked by two SfiI restriction sites (Figure 2,A). Because of its high copy number and its ability to replicate in any E. coli strain and in other enterobacteria, pUC18Sfi is suitable for maintenance of miniTn7 transposon derivatives, and for simple plasmid preparation and genetic manipulation. pUC18Sfi can be used to deliver transposons by transformation in bacteria in which it does not replicate (i.e., non-enteric bacteria), but not in the enterics. pUC18R6KT is also a pUC18-derived ampicillin resistant vector, but it harbors the low- to medium-copy number R6K replication origin, which is dependent on the presence of the replication protein π, and is only replicative in a small subset of E. coli strains engineered to express π (typically from a specialized λ prophage named λ-pir). Genetic manipulation of pUC18R6KT-derived plasmids is more cumbersome because of its lower copy number and the requirement of specific E. coli strains, but their major advantage over pUC"

3 Social Aspect
Human Practices
A thank-you card given to us by the girls from DiscoverE.
The focus of GENOMIKON, from the beginning, was to empower anyone to try synthetic biology for themselves. This tool kit introduces synthetic biology and delivers hands-on molecular biology education in a novel and concrete way.  GENOMIKON is bound to instill excitement and creativity in high school classrooms. Our goal was to create a comprehensive kit for the rapid and effective construction of plasmids using limited and affordable technology.  In this way, GENOMIKON is readily accessible to public educational institutions.  However, GENOMIKON will never be able to teach anyone if it never makes its way into classrooms. With this in mind, we decided to address this issue by incorporating human practice elements into our projects.  In particular, we investigated the market in which GENOMIKON would enter and invited middle school girls from DiscoverElle and high school students into our laboratory to learn about synthetic biology and participate in an experiment using GENOMIKON.
Distribution Plan and Market Analysis
With our goal in mind, we investigated exactly how GENOMIKON could be placed in high schools across the world and incorporated into grade 12/senior curricula.  To address the issue of accessibility, undergraduate students from the University of Alberta's School of Business created a hypothetical distribution plan and market analysis designed to bring GENOMIKON to the market.  This model is aimed to educate students across the world on the science behind and potential of genetic engineering.  GENOMIKON will only be an effective teaching tool if it reaches students.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," will only rely on literature findings.
OmpA itself is a major protein that can be found in the outer membranes of most gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli. It will signal and facilitate E. coli to secrete enzyme more efficiently, in this case, laccase.
 
Figure 1. Average fold change of enzyme secretion of E. coli using OmpA.
 
Figure 1 shows that the average secretion efficiency of E. coli using OmpA can be increased by 3% during the first hour of incubation, and the fold changes by 2.11 within the first 20 hours [3]. Here, fold change indicates the relative values of the yields or secretion efficiencies of constructs from OmpA Sp divided by native Sp [3].
Since we want to try to put the OmpA sequence before the laccase sequence, We try to collaborate the data obtained from Figure 1 with the available characterization result of the laccase we are using on the iGEM Registry for BBa_K863006 [4].
 
Figure 2. Comparison of activity expectation of BBa_K863005 with (orange) and without (blue) OmpA with ABTS as the substrate.
 
Figure 2 denotes the estimated activity with ABTS as substrate. Here, the measurement of 308 ng ECOL (BBa_K863005) was done in pH 5 at 25° C (Bielefeld, 2012). The 8mM concentration of ABTS was assigned to be substrate saturated. The bars on the right indicates the assessed amount of oxidized ABTS when ECOL is ligated with OmpA.
This figure helps our team to be aware of the overall impact of OmpA to the secretion of the laccase enzyme.

Synthetic Biology is the engineering of biological entities to perform novel and desirable functions. Synthetic biologists already make use of computational resources to a large extent which can be seen by the software tools such as CLONEQC, Biskit and Internet based repositories such as the MIT Biobrick library at http://partsregistry.org/Main_Page . In both Systems and Synthetic Biology analysis consists of researchers taking the outputs from some software and feeding it to the inputs of other software. This pipeline or workflow can be computerised by using software such as Taverna . Research into the application of computerised workflows to Synthetic Biology has revealed the paucity of published material in this area. Therefore, this has been identified as an opportunity for research and possible development of tools, which could greatly enhance methodologies and workflows in Synthetic Biology. We show how an e-Science approach, i.e. the utilisation of advanced computing resources and technologies to support scientists, benefits the Synthetic Biology engineering process. We further propose a development life-cycle and show how this approach can improve the design of synthetic biological entities.

Idea and plan
iGEM has a lot of wet lab work concerning cloning of plasmids into bacteria. Therefore, our team decided to design a cloning robot, which gives significant reduction in time and manpower.
The robot is designed to perform a cloning cycle. Design thoughts included different possibilities in the movement of the pipetting head and an easy mobility of the whole device. The modular design of our robot secures the mobility of the device. A solution for the realisation of the pipetting heads was found in the new forms of 3D-printer heads.  We could make a concept model for our pipet robot, as you can see above. Unfortunately, due to difficulties in finding an appropriate working place we were not able to go on with our project and we could not realize our pipet robot.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

This is justified since the caracteristic time of diffusion of AHL between the outside and the inside of a cell is short compared kI and kdiff. We end up with this equation:
In Hasty et al., kI is taken to be 0.06, which value we kept. Then, kdiff would have had to be determined experimentally. Instead, we followed Hasty et al.'s demarche, making the computations with some ""reasonable"" values.
The synthesis of LuxI.
Above, we introduced directly the concentration of LuxI without giving more details. However, we need to model the production of LuxI to calibrate the counter. This means modelling how the bacteria evolve in the device and how they react to arabinose.
Arabinose is modeled simply in the model with a diffusion equation:
with the boundary condition at the border between the device and the tunnel corresponding to: a positive value if a pulse is being sent, and 0 otherwise. Thus we get the profile of arabinose independently of everything else, except the pulse itself. kA was chosen arbitrarily (but close to values for similar molecules found in the literature) to be 10-5 mm2.min-1 . The pulse of arabinose in the channel corresponds to a concentration of 0.04%, which concentration was used in the lab.
To trigger the production of LuxI, a bacteria needs to be exposed to a minimum concentration Cc of arabinose for at least Tc minutes. For the sake of the simulation, we chose values for which we knew that recombinations would happen, here Cc = 0.001% during Tc = 1.5 min.
Our devices have several sizes, however one device will not ever host more than 2.105 cells. We can indeed approximate the maximum number of bacteria as the ratio between the volume of a device and the volume of a cell. Moreover, considering both populations, switched and unswitched, we will consider the bacteria are in exponential growth, and their excess is evacuated through the path to the tunnel. Therefore, we need a model for the behaviour of the bacteria (movement and birth/death) that allows us to deal with a few cells (when we have a few recombinated cells for instance) up to more than 105 cells. An individually-centered model would be computationnaly inefficient, while a continuous model would perform wrong computations for small numbers of bacteria.
Birth and death happen randomly, but we know how often they happen in average. We will describe in the next section the algorithm we used"

chiA and chiB devices were cloned into E. coli strain BL21 and I repeated the colony PCR for the chiBA device with Q5 polymerase as OneTaq may not be able to amplify such a short insert. The colony PCR showed transformants with the right insert size, so these were used for plasmid purification, plasmids were verified through sequencing and also cloned into BL21.
All devices were cloned into pSB1C3 and verified through sequencing. Additionally, they were digested with EcoRI and PstI and ran on gel to verify insert sizes (Figure 9). Only the chiBA device could not be sequenced for unknown reasons; I performed plasmid purification twice and sent it for sequencing, but both times the sequencing failed.

Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.

We did some unseccessful growth curve experiments, but gain a lot of new infomation about our final constructs. The experiments showed again that bacteria carrying the final constructs can grow on a low level on medium containing ampicillin without inducing the ampicillin resistance by respective HSLs. But we figured out how to deal with this problem: We have to add the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid to the culture broth to inhibit the antibiotic resistance just enough to allow for bacteria with induced resistance to grow, but prevents growth of non-induced cultures. Thus the next step for us is to determine the right beta-lactamase inhibitor concentration for our experiments.

Cultivation was carried out in four 500 mL non-baffled flasks with 75 mL 2xYT medium with Ampicillin. In two flasks N-3-oxododecanoyl-HSL was added. Ideally  the flask without N-3-oxododecanoyl-HSL would not show any growth in the beginning until the antibiotic has been depleted. The N-3-oxododecanoyl-HSL in the other flask should induce the quorum sensing controlled ampicillin resistance. Unfortunately all cultures were growing equally fast from the start so the experiment was aborted.

We could see the FIFO in a more convenient manner with the assembly of two class II promoters associated to different fluorophores. Then we could observed two kinds of fluorescents in One Cell along time.  One problem that could occur is the interaction between the different fluorescents proteins due to the cross-over of their emission and excitation spectra and moreover in our final system that count three fluorophores.
emission and excitation spectra of ECFP, YFP and mRFP
The choice of ECFP, YFP and mRFP is based upon this consideration and upon the order of appearing in the FIFO. Indeed by putting the mRFP in last position, we improve the visualization of the FIFO like the maturation time of the protein is about of one hour.
We thank a lot Arnau Montagu, advisor of the iGEM Valencia Team. He advised us, after his team had troubleshooting with fluorescence, to take care about spurious FRET. This phenomenon occurs even with non covered fluorescent spectra when the concentration of two fluorophores is sufficient so they are enough closer to induce some FRET. But it could happen at lower concentration than 40 μM.

Few approaches have been thought in order to create the oscillating module. The pTet/TetR system that allows us to precisely control the inhibition of TetR on the Tet promoter. Another system use the natural inhibition of OmpR and of EnvZ via OmpR.

Abstract
We further developed ""Dr. E. coli"": our project of iGEM 2010. Last year, we showed that Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) works in E. coli by injecting GFP into RK13 cells. T3SS is a syringe like organelle found in bacterium such as Salmonella which uses it to inject virulence effector proteins into a target eukaryotic cell. We think this system can be applied to direct reprogramming of somatic cells among many other things.
We tested T3SS performance and tried to make it more convenient. For this purpose we designed a plasmid backbone which can instantly produce ready-to-inject fusion proteins from ordinary biobrick part. Using it, we tried to further characterize this system by injecting a library of protein domains.
In Science Gallery we exhibited awesome photographs related with biotechnology in public. We tried to catch the pedestrians’ interest in current synthetic biology and explore their thoughts.

SRSF1 has more nitrogen contents than wool and casein. The serine contents and phosphoserine residues characterized in SRSF1 are also greater than casein. Based on the analysis, the novel fire retardant protein, SRSF1, theoretically, could have better effect than wool and casein.

We got the plasmids of SRSF1 gene encoding SR protein and SRPK1 gene encoding protein kinase to phosphorylate SR protein from the lab of Dr. Woan-Yuh Tarn.
 
First of all, we cloned SR gene and SRPK1 gene onto the standard BioBrick, pSB1C3. Then, SR and SRPK1 genes were transferred to the commercial expression vectors of pGEX-2T and pET-29b, respectively, which have strong expression ability through IPTG induction process.
 
All the constructs have been confirmed by colony PCR, restriction enzyme check and sequencing. (For more detail, please see here )
SR/pGEX-2T: the GST-fused SR gene is driven by Ptac promoter, which is regulated by LacI repressor and induced by IPTG The vector is ampicillin resistant and has the origin of replication from pBR322.
SRPK1/pET-29b: the SRPK1 gene is fused with 6XHis tag at the C terminus and is driven by Pt7 promoter, which is modified to be regulated by LacI repressor and induced by IPTG. The vector is kanamycin resistant and has the origin of replication from ColE1. The genes carried on pET-29b vector has to be expressed in E. coli BL21 strain which has T7 RNA polymerase.

We transformed E. coli BL21 with the following groups of vectors and made stocks at -80°C:
1.SR/pGEX-2T plus SRPK1/pET-29b (for phosphorylated SR protein expression)
2.SR/pGEX-2T with pET-29b empty vector (as an unphosphorylated SR control
3.SRPK1/pET"
Sorbonne_U_Paris,2018,Team:Sorbonne U Paris#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," produce sugar in large amounts. Microalgae‘s photosynthesis uses sunlight and atmospheric CO2 to accumulate sugar in its stored form: starch. By using a photobioreactor for the containment of the algae in the oceans, sugar production would not compete with arable lands.
Impact of Monocultures on the Environment
For purposes of clarity, some important impacts that monocultures have on the environment are listed hereafter:
Soil erosion due to irrigation, wind and harvest[1][3][4]: Where irrigation application is inefficient or rainfall is high, water withdrawal is generally coupled with the loss of valuable soil from the farm.
Soil salinization and acidification[1][5]: Salinization of soils typically results from over irrigation or inadequate drainage. Acidification is largely due to the use of inorganic nitrogenous fertilizers such as urea and ammonium sulfate. Under high rainfall conditions nitrate leaching occurs, which also promotes acidification.
Water use[1][6]: Sugar cane ranks among a group of crops noted for their significant water consumption (along with rice and cotton). High water withdrawal is generally coupled with the run-off of polluted irrigation water containing sediment, pesticides and nutrients.
Use of chemicals[1]: The use of herbicides in sugar beet cultures is among the highest as compared to other crops. Inorganic fertilizers typically supply nitrogen, phosphorus and/or potassium in the mineral form. Environmental impacts generally arise because the nutrients in the fertilizers are not entirely taken up by the crop but move into the environment. The overuse of fertilizers on cane or beet crops is typical of farming in general.
Discharge of mill effluents[1]: In some countries with weak environmental laws, a tremendous amount of matter is released straight into the streams. Cane mill effluents tend to include heavy metals, oil, grease and cleaning agents.
A sugar factory that mills 1,250 tons of sugarcane daily uses 151,000 liters of water per hour and releases 30,000 to 75,000 liters of liquid, solid and gaseous waste.
Production of Sugar in marine environments by our modified Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
Why an algae?
As a photoautotrophic organism, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has the ability to fix carbon through carbon dioxide uptake and a source of light.  Its metabolism can also be autotrophic, heterotrophic or mixotrophic. All of these characteristics explain why it is an interesting chassis in comparison to other classical model (bacteria or yeasts) which always need an input of energy such"
NKU_China,2017,Team:NKU China#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," with the result characterized by RFP FI． The results we get shows that under the standarlized protocol , different devices behaved differently and  more functions can be  inferred from special phenomenons. Firstly we felt it was harder to transform plasmid with device 1 and 6,which was confirmed by JLU.NPU also reported difficulty on device 4. Then the index to measure-FI shows that positive control is not always the highest.This time device 2 made it. Finally about describing the results,we think it would be better if the  Fluorescein Standard Curve and microbes with GFP are in the same buffer like PBS to make errors from backgrounds least.It's also a good idea to give the equation turning FI of GFPs into their concentration."

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#SinceAmsterdam_-_-_TEXT.html,", complete BPA degradation by E. coli carrying <partinfo>K525517</partinfo> compared to <partinfo>K525512</partinfo> as observed during our cultivations . The fusion protein between BisdA and BisdB improves the BPA degradation by E. coli. Introducing a polycistronic ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase gene into these systems does not lead to a higher specific BPA degradation rate. The rates are a bit lower, though. The effect that the BisdA | BisdB fusion protein is more efficient than BisdB when expressed polycistronically with BisdA can still be observed in this setup. The cultivations with the expression of the fusion protein FNR | BisdA | BisdB differ from the expression of the other BPA degrading BioBricks. The BPA degradation rate is concentration dependent which is typical for enzymatic reactions but was not observed in the other cultivations. In addition, the growth was faster and not diauxic. The maximal specific BPA degradation rate of this BioBrick is higher than the observed specific BPA degradation rates in the other cultivations. But due to the dependence of the BPA degradation from the BPA concentration the BPA degradation with this BioBrick is not as efficient and not complete. Anyway, the fact that this BioBrick is working, is impressive.
S-layer
Purification
The purification strategy could be accelerated by using a His-6-affinity tag and is more simple and pure now.
Scheme of purification strategy for SgsE (fusion) proteins with His-tag:
By fusing the SgsE | mCitrine with a C-terminal His-6-tag the S-layer protein could be simply purified by using a denaturating His-tag affinity chromatography. This purification strategy has the advantage that no time-consuming and complex inclusion body purification and filtration is necessary to decrease the amount of native E. coli proteins. Additional to the simplification, a higher purity of the S-layer protein could be reached.
This purification was made using the SgsE fusion protein containing an N-terminal mCitrine for identification and a C-terminal His-6-tag. The SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 11) and the fluorescence (Figure 12) in the collected fractions showed that the majority of fusion protein was eluated with a imidazole concentration of ca. 50 mM. There was also fluorescence  measurable in the flowthrough and wash fractions. This indicates that the used 1 mL HisTrap FF crude (GE Healthcare) was"
