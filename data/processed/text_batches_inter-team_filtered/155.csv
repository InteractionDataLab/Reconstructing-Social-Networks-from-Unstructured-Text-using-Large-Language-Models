The sample on the bottom row verifies the functionality of the calcein AM staining of living cells.
CONCLUSION
To minimize the risk of any cytotoxic effect of our bacterial lysate on the HeLa CCL-2 lc, we decided to use 10% (v/v) of the bacterial lysate for the upcoming experiments.
Phase III - Demonstrating azurin's killing ability
Applying Azurin-Rich Lysate to Different Mammalian Cell Lines: Azurin Killing Curve
OBJECTIVE
This was a milestone experiment in our work, as we wanted to assess the cytotoxic potential of azurin-rich bacterial lysates on p53 (+) and p53 (-) cell lines. Literature suggests, that the main mode of action of azurin against tumors is via stabilization od p53 protein [1] . For this reason HeLa CCL-2 lc was a suitable candidate for our experiment as it consists a p53 (+) strain and additionally has been well-examined in our project (good lysate tolerance and reliable cell viability assay). Moreover, the HT-29 p53 (-) negative cell line was also tested using the AM-calcein vaibility assay, in order to examine the effect of azurin against p53 (-) cancer cell - lines.
PROCEDURE
For the two different cell lines (HeLa CCL-2 lc and HT-29), cells were seeded in triplicate samples in a 96-well  plates with initial concentration of 100'000 cells/mL. After 24-hour growth the cells are incubated with increasing amounts of azurin-rich lysate in order to assess the effect of the different azurin concentrations on the cancer cell growth. The concentration gradient of azurin-rich lysate was achieved by mixing azurin-free and azurin-rich bacterial lysate in different ratios.  Simultaneously, cell samples were also incubated with 10% of PBS and also with 10% of azurin-free lysate. These negative control samples allowed us to check for any other cytotoxic effect  stemming either from nutrient depravaion or native bacterial proteins. Moreover, cell samples were also incubated with 1 mM of 5-fluouracil allowing us to test the functionality of our staining assay."

However, if one simply picked the most common codon for each amino acid, the rate of translation would be extremely fast across the entire gene. This may lead to subtle characteristics of translation being lost. For example, it has been suggested that in certain regions of the gene, the source organism may ‘choose’ a short run of rare codons, in order to slow down translation in that region. This slowing of the emerging polypeptide from the ribosome has been suggested to facilitate the correct folding of the heterologous protein and/or allow time for the insertion of essential co-factors [19]. These regions of ""slow"" translation, may occur in loops between different domains of the protein. It may be therefore important for certain genes, to maintain this pattern of fast to slow translation in the target organism.
“Gene Synthesiser” is a java application that makes this possible by enabling codon usage pattern matching. The application analyses the patterns of codon usage of the gene that one wants to express, in its native organism and generates new synthetic DNA sequence, optimised for the codon usage of the new target organism, yet matching any patterns of rare to common codons. Gene Synthesiser utilises codon usage data for over 35000 organisms. [20] .

We also designed a number of mobile applications (Apps). With the development of smart phones, there is now a demand for simple efficient programs that can aid carrying out everyday tasks.
The Lazy Scientist
The Lazy Scientist is a translation tool. The app has a number of functions including DNA to amino acid translation, back translation, reverse, complement and reverse complement. The app also contains a genetic codon lookup table allowing all corresponding codons for an amino acid to be looked up. The app is available for free in both the iPhone App Store and the Android Market.
Gene Slicer/Gene Cutter
The Gene Cutter (iPhone app) and The Gene Slicer (Android app) are DNA cutting tools. The apps have two functions to help restriction mapping of nucleotide sequences. The apps are able to search a sequence for a specific enzyme and can also return a list of enzymes not present in the sequence. The app is available for free in both the iPhone App Store and the Android Market.
To date there have been over 1500 downloads from all over the world. Making apps will increase the accessibility of synthetic biology, allowing scientists to have portable tools to aid them in synthetic biology wherever they are.

Music Video
One of our simpler collaborations included making a 15 second segment of a music video to the song “Moves Like Jagger” by Maroon 5, which was called ""Moves Like iGEM."" The song lyrics were modified by Tec CEM iGEM 2018 and sent to all participants. A total of 27 teams from around the world filmed their respective segments and sent them in to be compiled into a whole music video. Our lip-syncing abilities were put to the test!
Shanghai
Our collaboration with the Shanghai Tech iGEM Team began when we were interested in obtaining a part from their 2016 research team. We eventually decided to steer our project in a different direction that didn’t require their part, but our relationship and informational collaboration with their team grew. As both of our teams were working to edit the E. coli genome, we shared papers and methods that we were either attempting or came across during our searches. The Shanghai Tech team was interested in replacing an origin ribosome site with a designed orthogonal ribosome, and they wanted to utilize the lambda Red system. We suggested the No-Scar method utilizing CRISPR-Cas9. In return, they shared information regarding the CAGO technique which also utilizes CRISPR-Cas9 and lambda Red. This collaboration was very helpful in expanding the knowledge base of both of our teams."

Transcriptional regulator HucR is from d. radiodurans strain, belonging to MarR family of transcriptional regulator. This transcription factor binds a single binding site in the promoter region Shared by both genes through high affinity, inhibiting its own expression and the expression of adjacent uric acid enzyme [4]. The transcription regulator HucR binding site is called hucO. HucO is the common sequence of HucR and uric acid oxidase promoter in radioluccus resistant coccus. When uric acid was not present, HucR protein bound to hucO and blocked the binding of RNA polymerase to block the expression of related genes. In the presence of uric acid, the binding of HucR protein to hucO was inhibited by uric acid molecules, so that HucR protein could not interact with hucO, thereby activating the expression of related genes.
We also added Uric Acid Transporter (ygfU) after HucR sequences, making our sequences more sensitive to Uric Acid concentration.
Cell osmotic peptide selection:
We decided to use 4 kinds of cell osmotic peptides (TAT, cyclopeptides [5], HIV osmotic peptides, R8) to carry out the experiment of urea oxidase penetrating intestinal wall cells, and use caco-2 human colon cancer cell lines to carry out the experiment of cell osmotic peptides, and culture caco-2 cells on transwell membrane. After the cells have grown into a dense layer, DMEM culture medium containing urate oxidase with osmotic peptide is added to the membrane to determine the content of uric acid oxidase below the membrane, so as to judge the effect of different osmotic peptides.
Among the four selected cytoosmotic peptides, cyclopeptides were found in reference 5 to deliver phages from the intestines of mice to the blood of mice.
Microbial population control system:
In order to prevent the excessive growth of our Nissle escherichia coli in patients' intestines, disrupt the balance of intestinal flora in patients and affect the physical health of patients, we decided to set up the quantity control system of bacteria flora. We refer to the 2016 imperial flora control system, using lasR induced e. coli secretion of N - acetyl homoserine lactone, when the concentration of N - acetyl homoserine lactone after more than a threshold, Las lasR activates expression promoter downstream genes.

COLOR CODE PROTEIN EXPRESSION BY VIRAL VECTOR DELIVERY
Viral vector auto-replicative capacity and cell-to-cell movement convert this strategy into one of the best strategies for high protein expression and yield production. Thus, we developed our proof of concept for this approach using the Tobacco etch virus (TEV) as a vehicle for the transport of the color inducing protein Rosea 1 (Ros1). This protein, Rosea 1 is an Antirrhinum majus transcription factor and it has been reported as an ideal visual reporter gene. Following the experimental design , different N.benthamiana plants were infiltrated with A.tumefaciens culture carrying a TEV vector with Ros1 insert.
Figure 12. Images obtained two weeks after infiltrating A.tumefaciens carrying a PVX vector with a Ros1 insert inside it.
Conclusion: As shown in Figure 12, the suitability of plant viral vectors as color inducing system vehicles was demonstrated. Furthermore, the viral vector’s systemic movement was proved since the agroinfiltration was performed in old leaves while color change was observed not in the old leaves but in the younger ones.
CHROMOPROTEINS
Chromoproteins suppose a simple and effective way of inducing different color changes in a desired organism. Its implementation in our circuit, would confer it with versatility, facilitating the creation of a color code system. However, to date, a color change in plant organisms has not been reported.
In order to expand our Color Code System, we propose using chromoproteins since their absorbance spectrum is in the visible one and non-special equipment is necessary. Amil CP, AmajLime and eforRed (BioBricks supplied to the Registry by Uppsala iGEM team between 2011 and 2013) were codon-optimized for Nicotiana benthamiana in order to make its expression easier.
Conclusion: Unfortunately, no color change was observed after infiltrating A.tumefaciens culture with the different chromoproteins (AmilCP, AmajLime and eforRed) either with their E.coli codon optimized sequence or with their plant codon optimized. Future experiments could be carried out after adding a chloroplast location sequence to these proteins. The transport of the chromoproteins to the chloroplast may help to their correct folding since its redox"

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Communication work_-_-_TEXT.html," Our paintings are incredibly popular and have provoked discussions with us about our project and SynBio as a whole. Our paintings were displayed at the European Jamboree as part of ATOMS Turkiye iGEM's SynArt exhibition.
A vignette of all of our bacterial art.
The Scream, a masterpiece, clearly depicts an individual on a pier with a haunting expression with a heady back drop of a yellow and red sky. Reforging this painting with bacteria has created 5th rendition of this magnificent work of art. Originally painted in 1893 by Edvard Munch, The Scream characterised a tempestuous time in art as a precursor to the advent of Expressionism. As such, it is perfectly placed to represent the potential power of SynBio to revolutionise the modern world, and this in and of itself represents the verve behind team Plasticity to add value to waste with our MAPLE system.
Claude Monet's San Giorgio Maggiore, depicted by highly cultured E. coli. San Giorgio Maggiore is an island in Venice, best known for the prominent church that sits upon it. In 1908, Claude Monet produced this impressionist painting. It was originally received with great awe due to the vibrancy of the colours. Similarly with the bacterial copy, it also shows great vibrancy of colour, courtesy of the GFP in the bdh2, which appears yellow and the RFP present in the stress response sensor, providing the red pigment. Indeed the radiance of the sunset is reflected magnificently in the calm waters of the Laguna Veneta.
To the left is depicted Hokusai's world renowned masterpiece, the Great Wave of Kanagawa. The painting depicts an enormous wave off of the Japanese prefecture of Kanagawa. The key difference here is the presence, or lack thereof of Mount Fuji, which has been swallowed by the ominous blood red sky that overshadows the entire scene. The work was produced during the Edo Period of Shogunate rule, sometime between 1830-1833 and does not constitute a painting of a deadly tsunami as many people commonly assume.
Painted by Vincent van Gogh in 1889 with oil on canvas, Starry Night depicts a night scene from Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. We can see here clearly the glowing crescent moon high in the sky, hovering over the deep blue hills beyond the town.

Two different effects were assessed: To determine the inhibitory effect on biofilm formation, cell lysates  were added to the cultures immediately and analysed after incubation in conditions encouraging biofilm formation. To determine biofilm dispersal, cel lysates were added to established biofilms instead. Generally, lysates of untransformed cells were used as negative controls to exclude unspecific effects and gentamicin (30 μg/ml) served as a positive control.
Step 1 - Demonstrating bacteriolytic and biofilm-dispersing activity
Lysostaphin
Our combat protein lysostaphin has shown positive results with both methods and was especially effective towards S. aureus. Figure 1 shows the result from the Kirby Bauer test where halos are visible. The induced cells shows a larger halo than the non-induced cells, indicating that lysostaphin is capable of lytic activity.
Figure 1. Kirby Bauer Test of lysostaphin on E. coli TOB1.
In our biofilm assays both soluble and insoluble fractions of lysostaphin-containing cell lysates displayed a clear inhibitory effect (Figure 2) Lysostaphin also effectively dispersed the pre-existing biofilm, as shown in the Figure 3 - the effect could even be observed by the naked eye. More of these results can be seen in the lysostaphin Results page .

The degradation constant of mRNA:

It was assumed that the RNA degradation rate does not change no matter of the folding pattern. The degradation constants was calculated with the same method: Other degradation constants:
The average E.coli division time in M9 minimal media is about 67 minutes: (BNID 107132, Milo et al., 2010. )
µ=  (ln⁡(2))/(67*60)=1.7242*10^-4 s^-1
According to the iGEM registry, the half-life of the GFP (BBa_E0040) is about 33 hours:
kdP=  (ln⁡(2))/(33*3600)=5.8346*10^-6 s^-1
The E.coli growth in length in the lag2 phase is approximately 15% (Alon et al.), which would result in an approximately 15% increase in volume. The linearly approximated μ for the interval (~5.4 hr) is therefore:
(1+μ)^(5.4*3600)=1/(1+0.15)
μ_l2=-1.6554*10^-5 s^-1
Rate of protein production:
For the Smu THF riboswitch with a chimeric metE platform, the folded form of RNA produces about 30% of the amount the unfolded form does (Batey et al., 2011). For the L. casei one, it was suggested to be a little above 25% (Leigh, 2015). Therefore, it was assumed that it would be:
kB=C*kA
Where C ≈ 0.3 for the B9 Riboswitch with metE expression platform. (Batey et al., 2011). It would vary significantly by riboswitches, but insufficient data were found for most of them, so 0.3 was used.

Database
Based on more than 20,000 biobricks in the iGEM Registry, we integrated multiple databases and created a brand-new database, BioMaster, to enlarge the amount of biobricks’ information. In order to describe biobricks more accurately, we choose to integrate some experimentally verified or highly reliable large databases such as Uniprot, String, EPD, etc., which also ensures that the data in our database is trustworthy.
Fig.1.Database integration
Data Collecting
We discovered that many biobricks in the iGEM registry only contains limited sequence information because of the lack of basic information and unclear description, which makes it quite hard to find other related information of one biobrick. So, we decided to use method of local sequence alignment based on BLAST to compare with all sequences in other databases. We located all component of the biobrick and provide more detailed information.
BLAST is developed and maintained by NCBI, which is one of the most famous tools in the field of nucleic acid and protein sequence alignment. As a comprehensive tool for multiple platforms, BLAST has a directly available version of the web, as well as a self-contained, efficient and flexible local version.
Fig.2.Expand information by BLAST
To analyze large amount of sequential data more efficiently, we choose BLAST+2.7.1 in the local version as our tool. With the aid of BLAST, we can quickly compare two sequence files locally after we get necessary data from iGEM registry and other databases waiting to be integrated.
In order to filter out high-confidence matching sequences as much as possible, we take two steps:
1. Filter a large number of duplicate matches and homologous sequences through a python program, leaving only one best match for each matching segment.
2. We randomly select a part of the matching sequence through preliminary screening and judge the correctness of the"

About The University of Melbourne
Located in Melbourne, Victoria, The University of Melbourne was founded in 1853 and is Australia’s second oldest university. The university is consistently ranked among the leading universities in the world, with international rankings of world universities placing it at number 1 in Australia and number 34 in the world (Times Higher Education World University Ranking 2013-2014).
About The 2014 Melbourne iGEM Team
The 2014 Melbourne iGEM team consists of 19 highly-motivated undergraduate students and 1 postgraduate student from a range of disciplines, including biochemistry and molecular biology, chemistry, chemical engineering and bioengineering. The team’s academic and research credentials are well-tested. This year, the team comprises three of The University of Melbourne’s Chancellor’s Scholars (top 0.1% of all Australian high school students) and several team members with research experience at Melbourne’s high-profile research institutes, such as the prestigious Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, and The Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute. The team is supervised by Associate Professor Heung-Chin Cheng, Associate Professor Paul Gooley, Associate Professor Neil O’Brien-Simpson, and Dr. Angus Johnston. The Melbourne iGEM team was founded by a group of enthusiastic and motivated students in 2013. The 2013 team played a key role in establishing the foundations of this year’s team and generating this year’s project. Unfortunately many of the 2013 team members could not continue their work for iGEM in 2014, so credit must also be given to Pedro Avellar Costa, Michelle Tie, Georgina Panshem, Morgana Cerqueira, Jeong Yoon Esther Kim, Winnie Tan, Hannah Nguyen, Mary Teo, Cathy Pitt and Joyce Kant.

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," down at either stage (testing or diagnosis).
The list of numbers written down can be mixed up, resulting in the diagnosis being matched to the wrong cow.
We aim to reduce error as much as possible, to avoid healthy cows being culled and infected cows being left in the herd.
We aim to help these problems by devising both a new test and a new method of testing. The testing methods contains both a prototype for the test and a method for the test.
Our new test
Our test has fewer steps and should be fairly quick and easy in comparison with the current test. First, the cow arrives through a press, it’s blood is quickly drawn into the test tube, the tube is then labelled with the cow’s ear tag number, and the cow is released. The risk associated with getting the blood is also reduced as the crush prevents the cow from kicking backwards. It also lets the vet stand to the side of the animal when gathering the sample. After a few hours, a diagnosis can be made from the labelled test tubes. As a result of this,  the only possible error source is from incorrect labelling or contamination.
Once the RNA associated with a bTB infection has been detected, a reporter gene is expressed. We wanted this reporter to be immediately clear and visible to any untrained personnel eg. fluorescence was unsuitable as the equipment required to visualise fluorescent proteins is expensive, requires training to use, and is not portable.
Firstly we decided on a simple colour change using chromoproteins. However, taking into consideration the nature of the sample - blood - we were unsure as to whether a colour change would show through the dark colour of the blood. This could be solved by centrifuging the blood and testing the plasma, which has much less colour, so would interfere with the chromoproteins to a much lesser extent. However, we were adamant that our test should require no technical knowledge or equipment, so we have came up with several other possible solutions which we are unable to test due to time constraints:
Using a metal strip which the chromoprotein could aggregate around, causing a colour change to the strip which could then be removed and examined.
Using a paper-based system, where a drop of blood could be placed onto a cell-free piece of paper and a diagnosis could be made.
Using an enzyme indicator - eg. an agglutination assay.
Our New Method
Not only is the current test for TB outdated, but so are current methods of testing. Currently the cows are recorded using ear tags, these are either plastic or metal, and attached to the cows ears. There are normally two"
Linkoping_Sweden,2018,Team:Linkoping Sweden#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," students about what being an engineer means, and how diverse that role is so more people might become interested in pursuing a career in engineering.
During the spring this year Engineers Without Borders in Linköping hosted a tour of the campus for secondary school students. The tour aimed at inspiring young students to pursue a higher education, and to show what you can do during, and after your studies. As this fitted well with our goal to reach out with our project we got to be one of the stops on the tour. At our stop we held a short introduction into the field of synthetic biology and our project, focusing on the diversity of the field.
The Summer Week - Sommarveckan
Another way for us to reach out to the public and to inspire people to become more interested in science was to participate in an event called ""Sommarveckan"". Sommarveckan is an annual event organised by Linköping University. During this event secondary school students get to come to the university for a couple of days to try out scientific experiments and to learn about the mechanisms connected to the experiments they perform.
Leading up to the event we planned an experiment themed ""Discovering chemistry"".
This resulted in a lab where the students got to extract DNA from a kiwi fruit. After the experiments we talked about what one does with the DNA after it has been extracted. Based on what the students had done in the lab, we then supervised a discussion on synthetic biology and showed what we were doing in our project. Hopefully, this helped spark an interest in science and in wanting to learn new things.
Kalasmottagningen
Kalasmottagningen is a welcoming fair for new students at Linköping University where they can meet and join different student organisations. This gives a brilliant opportunity for new students to get introduced to the student life. This year about 8 000 students attended and LiU iGEM had a stand at the fair.
Through this event we got the opportunity to talk to a lot of new students, organisations and companies about LiU iGEM, iGEM and our Synthetic Biology project at the convention.
TEDx Norrköping
TED-events are incredibly popular and it is a great way of spreading a message worldwide. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that brings people together to share a TED-like experience.  According to us in LiU iGEM this was a way to both inform and being informed as well.  By getting invited by the local team of TEDxNorrköping we found a golden opportunity to let the public hear what we want to convey."
NYC_Wetware,2011,Team:NYC Wetware#Deinococcus#Cell Damage_-_-_TEXT.html," a hydroxyl radical through the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron by means of hydrogen peroxide.
Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH· + OH−
The ferrous iron is recycled by hydrogen peroxide.
Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + OOH· + H+
The hydroxyl radical is very reactive, and can cause damage to DNA and proteins by reducing them. In addition to producing a hydroxyl radical, ionizing radiation produces many other reactive, potentially damaging molecules, including ·O2- (Superoxide).
Non-ionizing radiation, such as UV radiation, can directly rearrange a molecule’s structure, leading to base damage as well as single strand breaks in the DNA. However, Non-ionizing radiation doesn’t produce the reactive molecules, because it doesn’t remove electrons from molecules. Therefore the only damage is through rearrangement of the structure of DNA and proteins.

Cellular Protection
The cell has various mechanisms for protecting itself.
(1) Increasing Mn/Fe ratio
The cell is able to limit the number of free radicals produced by limiting the exposure of iron, a player in the Fenton reaction. The production of hydroxyl radicals, outlined in the Damage section, by the Fenton reaction, leads to cellular damage, both in the destruction of DNA and in the incapacitation of proteins. To limit the occurrence of the Fenton reaction, the cell replaces Fe with Mn in what would otherwise be otherwise Fe-cofactored enzymes. This adjustment of the Mn/Fe ratio protects the cell from oxidative damage.

(2) DNA Repair
1. To Base Damage
The cell employs an enzyme, DNA glycosylase, to remove the damaged base. AP endonuclease cuts the DNA backbone, essentially forming a Single Strand Break. DNA polymerase then resynthesizes the base. The single strand break is repaired as in Step 2 (below).
2. To Single Strand Breaks
A nick in the backbone of a single strand can be easily ligated by DNA ligase.
3. To Double Strand Breaks
One of the primary methods of repairing double strand breaks is known as homologous recombination. The broken DNA fragment is connected to a complete DNA strand by a junction (a “Holliday junction.”) The DNA repair mechanism restores the damaged"

Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the sequencing analysis provided a comprehensive picture of pathogens contained within EMS vehicles. This information could be used to provide a baseline measurement of the vehicle microbiome, followed by subsequent sequencing to monitor cleaning habits over an extended period of time.
Pathogen Detection
We have described an approach to provide a comprehensive picture of the vehicle microbiome. However, a rapid method is required to monitor the cleanliness of EMS vehicles on a more frequent basis. One potential tool would be an antibody based detection method, such as an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). In general, antibodies could be raised against specific targets of interest (i.e. surface proteins of pathogens identified in the sequencing results) and used to develop a specific colorimetric assay. First responders could then swab a surface and use this assay to easily and rapidly observe a color change to identify if the pathogen was present. Given a certain threshold, in the case an opportunistic pathogen was detected, the necessary steps would need to be taken (i.e. use a different cleaning product or conduct a more thorough clean) to ensure the vehicle was acceptable to use.
sdAb Library Design and Selection
One issue with using antibody based detection methods is the cost and time associated with developing antibodies to bind to specific targets of interest. As this was not feasible for our project, we decided to explore an alternative approach using single domain antibodies (sdAbs), derived from camelid heavy chain antibodies and consisting only of the variable heavy chain domain (VHH). Specifically, we chose to rationally design and select for sdAbs in E. coli, reducing the time and cost associated with production. Additionally, these synthetic libraries allow for an assortment of variants to be selected for, increasing the possibility of a strong binder to be identified.
Prior to our library design, we developed a sdAb database to provide a repository of publicly available sequences. This database would offer a resource for researchers to easily identify sdAbs that bind to specific targets for a variety of applications (link to database). Informed by our database, we performed a bioinformatics analysis and sequence alignment using a subset of sdAb sequences (~40 sequences) [3]. The primary sequence of sdAbs is characterized by constant framework regions and variable complementarity determining regions, where the variable regions convey specificity for binding to diverse targets. From the sequence alignment, we could identify commonalities between sdAbs and identify highly conserved amino acids at specific positions in order to reduce our sequence search space. Similarly, for amino acid positions that are more variable only the residues most likely to occur at this position were tested for rather than using all possible 20"

When presented with the “International Genetically Engineered Machine” project, I first imagined it as an immense and boundless project.  But presented with the idea that the SDU-Denmark team had come up with, I became fascinated – could it be possible that they could generate a biological system, which could end up having a huge affect on the treatment of bacterial infection, just by an idea, some parts and a few months?
As pathogenesis and stress tolerance are main topics of my own research project, in which I am focusing on the virulence and stress response of Listeria monocytogenes, I use many of the molecular methods that the iGEM team are working with. Therefore I am very pleased to have the opportunity to help our team by assisting them in the lab.

Synthetic Biology presents an interesting challenge to apply reliable protocols from molecular biology to alter and control the functionality of complex living systems.  The results of such endeavors are far from predictable and give scientists a realistic perspective on the interconnectivity, programmability, and complexity of living systems.  This is an exciting time for students interested in living systems to try to reprogram them in specific and quantifiable ways.
As an associate professor at SDU, I am primarily interested in developing laboratory models of complex systems that have life like properties.  This is done through my participation in the research center called FLinT (fundamental living technology).  Currently my research lies in physics and chemistry, but my interests are based in biology and evolution.
The team of students here came together under common interest, self organized and effectively initiated training in Synthetic Biology at SDU.  It is a pleasure for me to support their initiative, energy and curiosity.

XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"W method (illustrated in detail in the promoter part) to calculate the similarity between the RBS sequences and the Position frequency sequences, what is different from the promoter is that, the spacer length between the SD sequences and the startcodon and the start codon itself both act as constraints in locating the SD sequences, which is confined to 3-16 bp and ATG/TTG/GTG. And similar to the prediction of promoter strength, the spacer length between the SD sequence also contributes to the RBS strength, the optimal spacer length is 7 bp, and the spacer score is calculated using the same algorithm applied in the promoter part.2 The weight of the influence of the spacer on the strength isderived from the algorithm to predict the promoter strength, in which the weight of the total MSS and the spacer is 0.29:0.71, and since in promoter the total MSS is the sum of two motifs while the SD sequences is only one motif, the weight between the MSS(SD sequences) and the spacer is 0.29:0.355.

Future work
Due to scarcity of experimental data, the relative weight of the SD sequences and the spacer length used currently is roughly determined which may undermine the accuracy of RBS strength prediction. For further improvement of our program, we'll try to obtain more reliable experimental data to accurately determine the weight used in our algorithm and hopefully elevate the accuracy of RBS-decoder.

Meeting with Avi
This week, we went to talk to Avi Robinson-Mosher, a researcher at the Wyss Institute at Harvard.  We're working through the designs for the electronic lab notebook, and we aren't sure what our future plans for it are.  It's possible that we could design something that would only be useful to our iGEM teams, because that's the people who we see all the time, but we want to design something that will be useful to a wide variety of users.  To that end, we showed it to Avi, who comes from a computer science background but is now doing biology research.  He talked about the uses that he has for a notebook, and it was useful to see the differences: he sees a great use for the protocols that he needs on a daily basis, but doesn't need to add information to his notebook throughout his day, preferring to enter his data in the evening.  He also uses a wiki at the moment, so it's an interesting exercise for us to think about the benefits that our system can provide over the system that he uses now.

∴ Rate of protein production = 0.020 ÷ 4.25x10-3 = 2.2/min
PUR degradation module
The reaction equation of the PUR degradation is:
[Polyurethane]+[PudA]= 4 [ethylene glycol] + 4 [polyisocyanate] + [PudA]
Assumptions:
We assumed 1 mole of polyurethane dispersion can produce 4 moles of ethylene glycol.
The molecular weight of a single polyurethane monomer is 470 g/mol whereas the molecular weight of the polyurethane dispersion is around 2000 g/mol. [14] Therefore, the short-chain polyurethane consists approximately 4 monomers. 4 molecules of ethylene glycol will be produced by degrading one chain of polymer.
We also assumed a simple Michaelis-Menten mechanism for PudA
""[PudA]""is the concentration of the PudA enyme whereas ""[Polyurethane]"" is the concentration of the polyurethane. The kinetic parameters are defined as below:

[16]
Comamonasacidovorans
Assumptions:
1. The kinetic parameters of PudA are not from the strain E.coli K12 MG1665 we are using. So the assumption here is that the kinetic property of pudA in E.coli is close to that in Comamonasacidovorans
2. Considerations of temperature change and PH change are not included in the model. Therefore, the assumption is that they remain constant during the degradation
Secretion module
The efficiency of Secretion is assumed to be 90% secretion over 2 hours. [17] The rate of secretion in the model is therefore:
rate of secretion = 0.9[concentration of PudA]/120 (mM/mins)
Simulation Results and Industrial Implementation
The simulation result we worked out is especially related to the industrial degradation SRF which we aim to achieve a high degradation efficiency. According to the data we estimated for the percentage Polyurethane in SRF, we have about 5% Polyurethane contained in the waste. Therefore, in the model, we assumed"

6/24 I did further research on SBOL, and how the form of SBOL would fit into our tool design.
6/25: everything in the widget for G-nome Surfer Pro is finally hooked together!  Now we need to implement actual sequences…
Over the weekend: I need to do some background research on AutoCAD and GenoCAD, and find information on the company Ginko, which may help us pursue the QR code idea.  Also, I need to do background research on GeneDesigner and see different existing designs for primer designers.   Furthermore, I need to look into Spectacles, and see the important features of Spectacles.  I need to start working on related works for a paper Orit is putting together! Also, need find out the size of tuberculosis plasmid backbones that may change how they are rendered on the widget.
6/27: BU comp team comes to visit.  Presented GnomeSurfer to them, as well as progress so far.  Presented paper prototype for the  notebook design.  Questions from today’s session:
Brainstorming on the LabBuddy/ electronic notebook system: where will it live?  What will it do?  Will it be an iPad/iPod/Android application? Can the notebook be monitored by the supervisor?  Can students use it as a data-collector, or as a sketchpad?   How will the information for the electronic notebook be organized? Talk about designs for PermuteTrumpet, Primer Design too!  Need to read further on invertases…  When it comes to gesture controls…. Kelsey and Consuelo are looking into Kinect.   Can we create a primer design as intuitive as the Cambridge 2010 design?  The BU team as split into teams, with Janoo on Puppetshow/Notebook, Craig on invertase/ Permute Trumpet design, Jenhan on a primer designer, and Chenkai on working with the wet lab in using the robot.

UiOslo_Norway,2016,Team:UiOslo Norway#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," interesting question from the audience, and important experience by presenting our project. Good luck this year winner, iGEM Leiden, with hosting NiC next year!
Norway iGEM Conference
We initiated a mini-conference with the second Norwegian team, iGEM NTNU, 23-24th September. The conference was held at the Science Library at University of Oslo. We presented our projects in front of three judges that provided us with valuable feedback before the giant jamboree in Boston.
The Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board attended our conference and we are scheduled to appear on their GENialt magazine website. We hope this is a beginning of a new tradition that the Norwegian teams of next year will honor and bring to the next level.
Collaboration with team iGEM NTNU
After learning more about each other project we were interested in figuring out how we could help each other out. We discussed at the Norway iGEM Conference about how we further could collaborate and both teams were interested to see if the results could be generated in another lab.
We transformed TOP10 competent cells with plasmids (1-4) provided by the NTNU team. Preferably we should have transformed DH5α cells to meet NTNUs wishes, but we did not have these available in the lab at this point. We got instruction to plate the transformed cells on LB agar plates with ampicillin added. Unfortunately, not all transformations grew and we ended up with bacteria transformed with plasmid “1” and “4”.
Experimental setup:
The NTNU team gave us guidelines of how to conduct the experiment.  Grow overnight cultures with LB medium, ampicillin and one bacteria colony at 37°C. Transfer the overnight culture to different incubation temperatures (30,37 and 41°C) and 200 rpm. This correlates to the experiment start point at 0 hours.
Check if there is any color change in the different temperature settings
Results:
We did not observe any visible color change in any of the different setups with either plasmid “1” or “4”.
Team iGEM NTNU also helped us out by performing an experiment with our protocol regarding use of Nitrocefin to test ampicillin-resistant E. coli and regular E. coli without any antibiotic resistance. During our experiments, these bacteria have been our positive and negative control, respectively. By following our protocol and filling in a provided excel-sheet they provided us with data that resulted to this graph. Although operating with different scales, the data provided by the NTNU team shows the same trends as our data indicate. The"

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

Start of IMAC Purification
4mL of lysate was added to the resin saved from last time's run through of batch purification. However, due to a miscommunication, the resin from last time was suspended in strip buffer instead of 1X binding buffer. The resin was not re-charged yet with nickel and therefore unable to function properly. The lysate, diluted in 1X binding buffer, was added to this ill-prepared resin, and the supernatant collected after the first centrifugation, fraction 1, appeared extremely green. The resin was white instead of the usual blue, indicating that the resin beads were not charged and therefore unable to bind Histidine-tagged proteins like our Tamura. The supernatant was still collected into a tube. The resin was washed thoroughly with about 10mL of DI water, spun for 2 minutes at 700g and 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was collected and discarded. Next, the resin was charged with about 10mL of charge buffer, fully incorporated by spinning on a rotary spinner, and then centrifuged for 2 minutes at 700g and 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was once again discarded. Finally, 10mL of 1X binding buffer was added to the resin, and the same process of incorporation and centrifugation was carried out.
The lysate, diluted in 1X binding buffer, was re-added to the freshly prepared resin, and batch purification proceeded as usual. However, after the first centrifugation step, the resin appeared white and the supernatant appeared blue. This qualitative observation was unprecedented. The resin was no longer charged and the nickel beads had somehow spun off and became incorporated into the supernatant instead. The Falcon tube's contents were vortex-ed  and re-spun on a rotary spinner. We tried centrifugation two"

Calibration
To experimentally measure the standard speed of the inflow, Rainbow beads (SPHEROTM Rainbow Calibration Particles, diameter: 6um) were dissolved in the cell culture medium. A series of pumped flow rate (5ul/min, 15ul/min, and 45ul/min) were applied to generate a steady fluid flow. The exposure time was set to 100ms (one representative image is shown in Fig. 4).
Fig. 4 The bead trace in the fastest microfluidics channel with the pump flow rate of 5ul/min
By using our custom MATLAB program, the ratio of maximum flow velocities were calculated as 13 : 100 : 978. The absolute speed with pump speed of 45 um/min is shown in Fig. 5.
Fig.5 Maximum velocities in each channel with the flow rate of 45ul/min
Code & Details
Simulation
To further validate our design, we also performed the simulation using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to confirm that the field in microfluidic channel satisfies our expectation. FEM is a method for modeling and simulating physics-based problems. It divides a large problem into smaller elements, these smaller elements will be solved separately and then be assembled backed to the original model. A collection of smaller elements is called a “mesh”, the “mesh” is constructed by numerous elements, the smaller the size of the element is, the finer the “mesh” is, and the more accurate will the result be. The final geometry set up can be seen from below (Fig.6). [8]
Fig.6 Final geometry setup
We calculated the velocity magnitude distribution was under different pumped inflow rates (5μL/min, 15μL/min and45μL/min). Results of maximum velocity and shear force that applied on the bottom matched the mathematics perfectly (around 80: 10: 1 in all the conditions, shown in the table below Fig.7).

UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"1C3 . Last time, when I tried, seemed all positive but the sequencing revealed just empty plasmids, so we were quite concerned about it…cross fingers…
I came back to the lab just in time to check the sequencing results of our final construct Cherry-Venus with both mutations and the prefix-suffix…. They were all perfect except for a really unexplainable mutation right in the EcoRI site of the prefix (that was part of the primers) common to all the colonies sent!!!!! It was unbelievable!!!! How could it be? The chromatogram wasnít so good, because we had to use a primer that was quite far from the interested region…
Immediately we set up a screening digestion using EcoRI and XhoI (that has a site after Venus) but the gel showed just the band of the entire vector! Noooooo!
We were stunned and desperate, and we didnít believed that: we made another screening digestion in the same way and left it O/N.
Even the morning after the gel presented us the deep nothing… We spent the rest of the weekend thinking if it was worth to go on.
Week 10 (07/23 – 07/29)
One realization makes my Monday bright: in the chaos of the Tradegy we didn’t realize that the colony sent for sequencing was the negative control: the vector seemed shorter, and since we can’t see it on the sequencing, I decide to drop the Tragedy colony. Haha.
Sequencing results are back to complete the ones we only had half, telling me the colony I’m using is good.
I have now enough data from growth curves and serial dilutions, so it’s time to see if the proteins are actually working, beside being produced (as growth curves and dilutions suggest.. we can’t tell it for sure until we make a protein gel or have the Gibson’s construct to test).
What I’m doing is a Ninhydrin test on the samples after 4h, 8h or overnight      to see if there’s Cysteine in the medium, the final product of CysE activity.      We find an old paper by Gaitonde et al. describing the protocol.  In this test ninhydrin is solubilized in a solution of glacial acetic acid and concentrated hydrochloride (it takes 20 minutes even at max speed vortex). You add the reagent to a cell sample + glacial acetic acid at 1:1:1 ratio. When heated at 90 degrees Celsius the color changes to a pink/purple in about 2"

Tokyo_Tech,2010,Team:Tokyo Tech#Project#wolf coli#lacIM1_-_-_TEXT.html," induces the overproduction of LacI protein that represses the GFP expression, the repression by LacI protein can be inhibited with IPTG induction.  Therefore, we expected the occurrence of GFP expression in the presence of both arabinose and IPTG. However, there is no expression of GFP in the presence of both arabinose and IPTG. This result indicates that the amount of IPTG was not sufficient to inhibit the repression by overproduced LacIWT.  In contrast, when there is only leaky expression of LacI protein without arabinose induction, addition of IPTG could fully inhibit the repression by LacIWT and the GFP expression occured. From this result, we concluded that the overexpression of LacIWT inhibited the expression of GFP even in the presence of IPTG induction.
Conclusion
From the results, we confirmed that LacIM1 shows weaker repression comparing to LacIWT.  We characterized LacIM1(BBa_K082026/BBa_K395400), which is key part of building the “Wolf coli” system.
Materials&Methods
Construction of E.coli strain DH5α
In order to characterize LacIM1(K082026/K395400), LacI Mutant, we constructed BBa_K395401 combining I0500 and K082026(K395400) on pSB1A3 and used BBa_I20260 as a positive control and used promoterless gfp on pSB3K3 as a negative control. Furthermore, we constructed BBa_K395402 combining I0500 and BBa_I732820 on pSB1A3 as a control experiment. As a GFP reporter, we used BBa_I7106 on pSB3K3.  In order to measure the function of LacI proteins, we introduced BBa_I7106 (lacI+pL-rbs-GFP-ter) on pSB3K3 and BBa_K395401/BBa_K395402 into DH5α.

Implicit Association Test
What is an IAT?
The implicit association test (IAT) is a psychological tool for determining implicit (subconscious) biases towards or against opposing categories (Gray and Bjorklund, 2014). It runs on the theory that the more closely two things are already neuropathologically linked in someone’s mind, the faster they are going to respond when those two things share a response key on the keyboard (Gray and Bjorklund, 2014). For example, often people will respond more quickly when words concerning insects share a response key with negative words, pointing towards a possible bias against insects.
What are we doing with it?
Waterloo’s iGEM is hoping to utilize this tool in an effort to better understand the public’s biases and reactions towards the field of synthetic biology. We would like to see what words, if any, people have an implicit bias against or towards. Once we know the words will most likely elicit a negative reaction, we can work on finding and using alternate words to better introduce the public to synthetic biology ideas and projects.
How does it work?
The task itself is fairly simple; five “blocks” or sets of 30 words that the participants have to sort into their categories using the “E” or “I” keys on the keyboard. In our study, participants will be asked to sort synthetic biology words such as yeast and amyloid, while sorting traditional technology words such as computer and tablet into their own category. They will also be asked to sort negative and positive words, such as anger or laughter. The most interesting portions of the task are when two categories share a response key. For instance, when negative and synthetic biology share a key, and traditional technology and positive share a key, faster responses in this block could indicate an implicit bias against synthetic biology. With the data generated, we can tell which synthetic biology words"

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Modeling#bdsf_-_-_TEXT.html," changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

We have looked into several different MRI reporters and consulted professor Markus Rudin , an expert in molecular imaging from the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at ETH Zurich. We considered reporters based on chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) [5] , iron-based and enzyme-based reporters. [3] After consultation with professor Rudin and careful consideration, we chose to work with a ferritin-like bacterial protein, bacterioferritin. Features of bacterioferritin that influenced our choice include: [6]
superior sensitivity,
the lack of a need to supply an exogenous substrate for contrast generation since iron is endogenously available and
the fact that it can be easily overexpressed in E. coli. [7]
In general, ferritins are iron storage proteins found in different species. Through ferroxidase, they convert iron from its toxic, ferrous state (Fe2+) into a non-toxic, ferric state (Fe3+). When present in its ferric state, iron acts as a paramagnetic agent and causes a shortening of the transversal relaxation (T2) in MRI. Depending on the concentration of iron, this can lead to a visible change in contrast. [8]

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#MutationModel_-_-_TEXT.html," described a rational in-silico homology modelling procedure. Our goal was to determine the specific mutations of an Esterase enzyme, which would slightly adjust the wild type Esterase enzyme’s catalytic activity. First, we have determined the possible locations of the binding pocket and active center by performing sequence alignments. Secondly, we assessed the possible structure of the esterase by comparing it to the structures of closest neighbors. Then, we have added synonymous mutations in the binding pocket in order to slightly change the catalytic activity. Finally, we have experimentally tested the esterase mutants, and showed that they indeed had adjusted catalytic activities.

What we did
Short description of our work, our results and our supporters
The creation of certain constructs was necessary for our two systems for cell selection by means of apoptosis: “Cut’N’Survive” and “Jump-Or-Die”. We searched for sources of the DNA sequences we needed and found several supporters which are listed below.
Most genes and promoters were amplificated via PCR with overhang-primers with the BioBrick prefix or suffix. If the sequence contained a EcoR1-, Pst1-, Xba1-, Spe1- or Not1- restriction site, we used mutagenesis primers and fusioned both DNA parts by fusion PCR. All PCRs worked out, even the fusion PCRs.
The length of the PCR products were tested by agarose gel electrophoresis. We tried to sequence our PCR products, but obtained poor results and resorted to sequencing the plasmids.
In parallel, we made competent cells and multiplied ccdB (death gene)-vectors with different antibiotic resistances. All components were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The samples were cleaned with a PCR clean up kit or dephosphorylated to reduce false ligations.
We ligated our constructs and several interim stages with the 3A-assembly according to our schedule. The ligations were transformed to E.coli DH5α strains and selected by antibiotics. Afterwards, some colonies were picked and we tested the insertion of the construct by colony PCR.
If the colony PCR resulted in bands of the right size, we extracted the plasmids from overnight cultures and sequenced the samples with forward and reverse BioBrick primers.
Unfortunately, not all BioBricks were cloned succesfully. However, we were able to produce 4 BioBricks, one of which represents a full construct while the other three are intermediates. The system wasn't completed on time, so we weren´t able to test them in eukarytic cell lines.
Besides, we found out that the CMV-promoter we ordered from the BioBrick registry ( BBa_J52034 ) was in fact a lacI gene, which resulted in the"

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Project#Biosensor#PromoterCharacterization_-_-_TEXT.html,") adversely affects the growth rate of bacterial cells. Actually, the hypersensitive switch behavior is postulated to arise from the unusual metal binding mechanism of MerR. Therefore, the molecular basis of the hypersensitivity switch will be discussed thoroughly in Bioabsorbent part of our wiki.
Aiming to analyze the PmerT promoter further, construction of merOP libriay (Random mutagenesis of the merOP) was also conducted.
Previous footprint studies [Lee, et al, 1993, Park et al, 1992] had suggested that there are three distinct domains within the palindromic merO. Mutants in domain I, which consists of the four highly conserved inner bases (---GTAC---GTAC---) of the seven-base interrupted dyad, generally allow constitutive transcription at PR. Mutants in dyad domain II, which located on either side of domain I, are semiconstitutive but support additional Hg(II)-induced open complex formation at PTPCAD (Fig. 5). In our project, we planned to analyze the behavior of merO thoroughly, and it could be expected that mutation at the dyad sequence would change the Ka of MerR-DNA interactions. Thus we mutated the semiconserved sites and left the conserved sites constant.
Fig. 5 The feature of MerR binding region, merT promoter. Semiconserved(alterable) sites are marked by blue box, conserved sites by red box, and start condon by green box. This dyadic region is located between the -10 and -35 hexamers of the structural gene promoter, PTPCAD, which is divergently.
The approach was generally based upon degenerate primer PCR, with the combination of a ‘DNA shuffling’ procedure, that was performed on the target DNA sequence; the resulting library of variants was then screened for the desired feature, and selected isolates are subjected to a repeated procedure.
We performed a degenerate primer PCR on the merTPCAD wild-type promoter region of the alterable sites.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," target sequence for the TALEs. This would allow us to detect a greater breadth in the strains of E. coli that we can detect.  Finally, he put us in touch with E. coli vaccine manufacturer BioNiche, who gave us some great insight into the applications of such a sensor as we explain more in depth on our Informed Design page. Importantly, Dr. Armstrong also offered to provide us with DNA to test our final system, which would be critical once a final prototype was developed. Although this would get around our problem of not having the shiga toxin gene, this still left the issue of our positive control unsolved. After some thinking, we identified a small, 18-base pair region of the gene that we could use for this purpose. Based on our TALEs, this should be enough to see binding, however such a small fragment of the gene would not pose toxicity concerns to the public.
Assessment of Accuracy
Outside of safety for the tester, we also wanted to consider one other aspect of safety: safety for the industry. When talking to the feedlot, they brought up the issue of false positives. Although any false positives would hopefully be caught during factory screening, they would have the potential to devalue the cattle that they were found in. This would pose economic risks to not only the feedlot, but to other parties in the chain, including the consumer. In order to mitigate this risk, our test, when and if it reaches a commercial stage, would need to have an absolute minimum rate of false positives. This was part of the reason that we chose to use an in-vitro system, as we hoped that it would decrease variability and improve the robustness of our test.
Although false negatives are also very important, as they would lower the overall quality and reliability of our final product, they would not necessarily pose any new safety risks, as our system is designed to work in parallel with current industry practices. Regardless, we included a line for negative controls in our strip to verify the accuracy of each individual test. This negative control line would contain a sequence of DNA that is not homologous to our stx2 target. If a colour change was observed on this line, this would indicate our system is non-specifically binding to incorrect nucleotide sequences, indicating a problem. In order to have a quality product however, the rate of false positives and false negatives will need to be assessed.

Error Prone Polymerase I - BBa_K2082106
Integral to our project is the directed evolution of our Evobodies. To continuously introduce new Evobody variants with potential   binding capabilities into the population we used the in vivo mutagenesis capabilities of the error-prone polymerase I BBa_K2082106 .
This enzyme replaces the normal polymerase I under certain conditions ( further information ) and introduces a high amount of mutations   inside our Evobody coding sequence. In because the mutations are more frequently inside our Evobody sequence and rarely inside other   genomic proteins this in vivo mutagenesis approach circumvents the main problems restraining in vivo mutagenesis: the   unintentional mutagenesis of essential proteins of a bacteria.
By adding BBa_K2082106 to the iGEM parstreg and characterizing it we hope   to give coming iGEM teams the possibility to easily optimize their proteins by means of directed evolution in vivo.
Characterization
We characterized the error prone polymerase I by performing reversion assays , thus quantifiying the mutation rate.

2. Promoter exchange
The purpose of the promoter exchange is to fine tune the expression of Glutamine synthetase (GLN1) and Acids Quinidine Resistance (AQR1), which is an amino acid transporter [16], with the aim to increase the production and excretion of glutamine.
This is done in the strain S.cerevisiae IMX581, which has CRISPR/Cas9 integrated in its genome [17]. The plasmid pMEL13 from the same paper is linearized with PCR with primers in Table 13 prior Gibson assembly with a gBlock (ordered from IDT) containing the gRNA targeting the promoter region of GLN1 or AQR1, along with flanking regions of 50 basepair overlapping to pMEL13. The gRNA was designed with an online tool at Benchling.

To exchange the promoter, the assembled pMEL13 was co-transformed with a linear DNA fragment containing the new promoter and homology regions to knock out either the promoter of GLN1 or AQR1, which was generated through PCR with the primers in Table 14. As overexpression of GLN1 might lead to glutamate auxotrophy [18], the results of the promoter study will help guide the choice of promoter for GLN1

Interlab
Overview
This year is the 5th installment of iGEM’s interlab; a powerful joint venture undertaken by hundreds of iGEM teams to gather data with the hope to create tools to help future iGEM teams as well as the the Synthetic Biology community as a whole.
Across Synthetic Biology a commonly used method to test biological constructs is to tag them with fluorescent proteins such as GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) and then measure their fluorescence on plate readers. This fluorescence can then be correlated to the rest of the construct but currently it is difficult to compare this data with other labs due to different units. It is the focus of Interlab to attempt to combat this by developing a detailed protocol that allows the measurement to be made in absolute units, therefore allowing comparison between all labs. This year, we attempt to assist in this by answering the following question:
Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?
Currently, Fluorescence, being an aggregate measurement over the whole population of cells, is normalized by number of cells to find a mean.. This is done by also measuring the the absorbance or optical density of the cells at 600nm (OD600) which is then used as an approximation for the cell population size. However it is the accuracy of this measurement which causes too much variability in measurements between labs so we are looking to develop a more direct method to measure cell count, formally Colony Forming Units (CFUs).
Experiments
2 Orthogonal approaches:
Converting between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads. Silica beads the same size and shape as E-Coli cells should act in the same way when used in absorbance measurements. Hence by using known concentrations of silica beads, we can accurately convert cell OD600 measurements to cell concentrations and hence cell counts.
Counting colony forming units (CFUs) from the sample. Since a colony on a plate"

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," labelling of GMO products. The European Union, Australia, India and Indonesia all require the packaging of such products to be bear the label “this product contains genetically modified organisms”, although exceptions do exist in the form of medical products (in the European Union) and foods produced by animals fed with GMO foods (in Australia). Japan and Korea follow a percentage scale, with GMO labelling required if a product contains more than 5% and 1% genetically-modified ingredients respectively.
*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*
There are no requirements for labelling products that contain GMOs.
In Canada, under the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada. The Standards Council of Canada has taken in the Voluntary Labelling and Advertising of Foods That Are and Are Not Products of Genetic Engineering. This states a requirement to label food that may potentially cause health and safety risks and well as have any considerable changes in nutrition and composition. Thus, there are no policies put in place for the mandatory labelling of foods detailing if they’re genetically modified unless there are reasons to do so such as a potential health and safety risks. Many food products might not be directly genetically modified but may contain ingredients such as corn or soy which have been genetically modified. To know if a food or its ingredients have been genetically modified, one would have to contact the manufacturer.
Final consumer packaging or pre-packaged products containing GMOs should be labelled: ‘This product contains genetically modified organisms [or the names of the organisms]’. This does not apply to medical products.
Under the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, it is a legal requirement for any food products derived from GMMs be labelled with the words “genetically modified” to ensure that consumers can make informed purchasing decisions. However, an exception to this is any foods produced by animals fed GM products which are not required to have this label.
Currently, if the product is made of a GMMs plant/seed or if the final product contains any traces of a GMM used as an ingredient, the package must have a symbol “T” of transgenic (figure below) on its package and the words “This product contains [name of the organism] transgenic.” However, the Congress and the Senate are currently voting on a project that modifies this law to remove the “T” symbol and leave the words “This product contains [name of the organism] transgenic” only if 1% or more of the final product has been genetically modified.
Any product made for human consumption that has different nutritional characteristics than conventional ones due to its genetic modifications must be clearly labeled as GM.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the other 15 linkers were disastrous. Only 2 of 15 linkers, ord1 and ord3 were ok. In most of the cases, completely different overhangs had ligated. Because of this bad ratio, we decided not to sequence further clones. We also decided not to retry the Golden Gate assembly, because their would not be enough time to screen all linkers anyway.
Since we did not have any bad linker yet, we decided to use standard biobrick cloning to switch the backbone of bad1 from pSBX4C5, which caused expression problems, to pSBX1K3.
Cloning for bad1 was finished
Starting a new project for circularization of a protein. The requirements were:
Easy to circularize
Cool and useful application
Good chances for increased heat stability
The aim of this project is to circulate Xylanase to increase its stability against heat, pH shifts and exopeptidases. Xylanase was amplified from the genome of Bacillus subtilis 168 with primers that fit our circularization standard. These primers include BsaI recognition sides which enable golden gate cloning.
For different constructs were amplified:
Xylanase with a His tag that fits in the circularization standard.
Xylanase for our standard without His tag.
Xylanase that fits in our standard, but contains mutated C-extein residues. Cysteine of the C- extein which is essential for the intein splicing reaction is mutated to Glycine. This construct serves as negative control
Xylanase that fits in the biobrick standard
The constructs were cloned in the circularization standard, which itself is not yet proved for functionality.Sequencing is still requested.
Our aim was to insert the xylanase gene into the circularization standard plasmid. Since the xylanase gene contains a BsaI site, this was (is) not a trivial task. It was hard to find colonies that were not red (a mrfp selection marker was replaced by the insert). We really hope for positive sequencing results.
A first attempt to get linear xylanase by simple biobrick cloning failed.
The sequencing results for circular xylanase with his6 tag and the version with a mutated c-extein were positive. The Golden Gate assembly of circular xylanase without his6 tag had to be repeated. This time it was succesful.
Primers were ordered for linear Xylanase controls with his6 tag (functional control) and his6 tag + exteins (control for gel).

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the free radical called superoxide (O2-), which is a by-product of the respiratory cycle in every aerobic organism. The unregulated presence of this oxidative agent could lead to substantial cell damage. Fortunately, there are ways to prevent this damage. The antioxidants are reducing agents capable of limiting this damage through the passivation of important biomolecules. One example of these agents is the enzyme Superoxide dismutase (SOD). The mechanism of SOD is based on the partitioning (dismutation) of the superoxide into an oxygen (O2) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) molecule. Considering this information and as a way to prevent the harmful effects of ageing, we propose a novel gene therapy based on the regulated expression of SOD on respiratory cells.
We have design a 3rd Generation Lentiviral Systems for our gene therapy. We would lentivirus, a type of retroviruses which store their genomes as RNA to reverse transcribe it later to DNA. The DNA is incorporate into host cells’ genome. The use of lentivirus as the vector of the gene therapy give the opportunity to integrate large amounts of cDNA (~ 10 Kb) into the host genome, the virus can be used in animal models since it avoids the immune response and its rate of transfection is very high which is relevant since many important cell types are highly resistant to transfection.
This strategy known as Transient tripartite transfection requires three different plasmids:
Transfer plasmid: contains the genetic material of the genetic therapy, in this case Superoxide dismutase (SOD) + GFP, which it would be integrated into the host genome through the long terminal repeats (LTRs)
Packaging plasmid: Contains the HIV-1 core proteins. HIV derives its virulance from 9 genes, however just the main three are necessary for conserve its high transferability (gag, pol and int)
Envelope plasmid: determines the specificity of the virus, it contains the envelope of another virus (non HIV-1), normally VSV. Determines the specificity of the virus: what types of cells can be infected by the virus, etc.
The only plasmid to be inserted in the host genome it would be the one containing LTRs: the transfer plasmid that contains the Superoxide dismutase (SOD) + GFP. The sequences of the vector require extra security modifications to avoid the dangerous formation of viral particles packing viral genomes which could be produce by recombination of the different plasmids or with genes already present in the genome host.

Figure 18. Aachen 2015’s rotor with a pan-head bolt installed (left) and our rotor with a flat-head bolt installed (right). The choice of bolt for the Aachen rotor was arbitrary and is for illustration purposes. Their wiki simply instructs one to use an M3 bolt there.The flat-head bolt is flush with the bottom face of the rotor. The height of our rotor’s base was thickened slightly to accommodate the countersinking feature.
Design improvements
When we recreated Aachen 2015’s pump, we discovered that no matter how carefully we mounted the rotor onto the shaft of the stepper motor, one screw head would always drag along the pump plates, implying that the rotor was tilted at an angle.This caused the pump to have insufficient torque to move the media through the silicone tubes.
The screw attaching the rotor to the stepper motor shaft is a flat end screw, and the rotor should not be tilted at an angle. Troubleshooting further would yield diminishing marginal returns, as other possible sources of error such as inaccuracies in 3D-printing would not be within our power to resolve. Moreover, the angle was very slight and otherwise undetectable by visual inspection. An obvious solution would be to decrease the height of the central rotor column, and then shift the entire rotor assembly upwards, but this would not be ideal. As the load moves further along the shaft, the angular deflection of the shaft increases. While the increase in deflection would definitely be negligible in this case, such a solution would be bad design practice. Hence, we elected to countersink the bolts because this approach allows us to easily visually inspect the rotor to ensure clearance between it and the faceplate of the stepper motor.
However, a flat-head bolt of equivalent size could not be countersunk directly into the Aachen design as there was too little material remaining to hold the bolt in place. We then simplified the rotor base, and thus produced what you see in Figure 17.
Our second modification was to add material for the fastening screw. Even the 2017 Aachen team acknowledged that a drawback of the 2015 team’s design was the instability of the bolt and nut combination fastening the rotor to the stepper motor shaft (Figure 19) [57].
Figure 19. The wall separating the fastening nut and the shaft was less than 0.5mm thick. When we attempted to 3D-print the Aachen 2015 rotor, our 3D printer was not precise enough to produce such a thickness, or rather, thinness. We expect that even if the 3D"

Hi to all of you!!!
I’m Feriel (alias Fifi) from Joseph Fourier University where I’m finishing my Master in Nanobiotechnology. Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated by what Life Science might achieve, especially by designing new living processes that, I’m sure, will really cause major scientific advancements in the future. So when one of our teacher mentioned the possibility to join Grenoble iGEM team, it immediately excited me and I was determined to  participate! This competition is definitely a unique opportunity to learn about life science, experience new things, meet other people and work in a team, all at the same time! An exceptional adventure in few words! Apart from iGEM, I like to cook Kessra and Boureks (Algerian specialties)… I had to talk about food!

Naicolette: ""Human Practices are possible, cause as there are smart ideas to do projects, there are smart ideas for their application, too. Among these applications we find both excellent and versatile uses and non-beneficial uses. Then, we need a good guidance to these ideas, not only between team members, but for those one are surrounding us (Reminding that we are living entities forming a system - society - and somehow those actions that we take affect others, starting a chain reaction).
- To achieve that orientation we need to know what we do.
- A right orientation is a good basis on which we'll put the know knowledge.
- That orientation is the key for an adequate thought or reflection.
- With this we'll make better ideas and more probabilities of a positive development - in every way - on all synthetic biology projects that we do.
It should be noted that it's not just for synthetic biology, but all other branches of biology and by extension, in all the sciences.
Without anything cited previously it would implicate potential hazards (greed, accidents, ward, vices, diseases, emergence of bad philosophies and other degradation of human behavior).""
Alicia: ""This projects take into consideration strongly an ethical and social part, since they are developed by scientists with a conscience about humanity and society. They recognize the importance of informing society about the projects they develop and giving them the opportunity to take part in the decision process on topics that can change their lives and the way we live today. They get the chance to provide new ideas and applications to projects and their development. Besides, it is extremely important to create conscience on researchers about the work we are doing. They emphasize the fact that we are using all the tools available to benefit people, keeping always high safety levels. Some mistakes can be fatal, so they educate researchers to avoid this kind of situations.""
José: ""Throughout time man has wondered why his surroundings and because it has certain capabilities that other living beings do not possess. What distinguishes us from other living beings is our ability to reason and to create things, many of these good and necessary for humanity and other compromising our existence. That is why HumanPractices necessary to achieve find your way to improving our society where (in this case synthetic biology) to help us live better and get away from the potential risks if they fall into the wrong hands can happen.""

b) Comparing aptamers with antibiotics Better in stability and affinity; more extensive and more sensitive targets.
Conclusion:
     The members of Group 8 told us the definition of aptamer and biosensor, and introduced the project of Professor Zhaoyong Yang's group. Whereas they found that aptamer biosensors and synthetic biology had little conjunction. At present, aptamer biosensors are usually selected in vitro, such as attaching on surface of an electrode.
     If we want to do research about aptamer biosensors in vivo, there will be two ways:
1) Construct them in microbe, and let them transcribe single chains for making biosensor. But single chains are not stable. So this plan needs further research.
2) Select aptamers we need in vitro then transform it in vivo, meanwhile its function of sensor should be maintained.After discussion, we thought both of the two means are of great difficulty. The members of Group 8 can ask Teacher Wang and Professor Yang for help that seeking for the bonding point of aptamer biosensors and synthetic biology or Biobrick.
After the brainstorm meeting this week, members from different groups still keep doing paper research. Group meeting was held every week during which group members could share their ideas and disscuss their project. Finally, group 2's project 'cell display' stand out from the rest due to its fancy idea. We constructed and characterized our device over this summer so you can see the wonderful E.lumoli now.

U3’ represents the budget constraint for increased income, and U3 represents the budget constraint for fixed income and price changes. The substitution effect is from E1 to E2, and then to E3, the consumption of other commodities has not changed, but the number of visits is increasing, indicating that the health status is reduced or the income is used in the direction of treatment. This is because the income is more used. Come to buy a doctor. In summary, the graph shows that changes in visit costs and or changes in income will change the number of visits.
Fig 2. The demand curve
Assume that at two different times, in addition to health conditions, all other aspects of the consumer's economy are the same. At the equilibrium point E, he is very healthy, and when E' indicates that he is ill, the whole health condition is relatively poor. Changes in health status will affect Allen's preference for visits and other commodities, as reflected by different indifference curves and points E in different physician health maps.
As shown in the figure, at the equilibrium point of illness and non-illness, his visit has the same marginal replacement rate as other commodities. This means that prices, income levels, hobbies, health conditions and other environmental factors can affect the consumption of medical services.
Fig 3. Relation between price and amount of need
When health is used as a consumer product, income is positively related to health; as an investment, income increases and consumption decreases.

We took the J61002 plasmid from the registry, containing ampicillin resistance, RFP and a ColE1 replication origin (medium copy number). By PCR, we then added the pTet promoter in front of RFP. Finally, the pTet-RFP and the backbone (plasmid without RFP) were assembled using the Gibson method . This was our first successful Gibson assembly.

Details of the parts assembled:
J61002 backbone: from Arkin lab ""J61002""
Terminator B0014: from the Registry ""B0014"" (sequence copied into our plasmids)
Ptet promoter: B0040 from the Registry ""B0040"" (sequence copied into our plasmids)
RBS: B0034 from the Registry ""B0034"" (sequence copied into our plasmids)
RFP gene: sequence from J61002 plasmid ""J61002""
The product of this assembly is the J61002-pTet-RFP 'backbone' plasmid. It contains an ampicillin resistance gene, a middle copy-number p15A origin, as well as RFP repressed by Ptet. You can access the complete sequence of the plasmid here . This plasmid is used as a template for the second step of assembly, in which the LacI inverter and reporter genes are introduced.
This plasmid is used in our  first readout system, both with the wild-type TetR and with mutants. For the results of this readout system, please refer to this page.
Second reporter - J61002 Plac-RFP
The second step is to add the RFP reporter gene under Plac promoter in the J61002 backbone. Let's run through the elements one by one. We need:
The backbone, containing the replication origin and Ampicillin resistance
a pLac promoter...

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," output. They used this concept to design a three-input heavy-metal biosensor, which produced a signal only in the presence of mercury, arsenic, and copper (Figure 1). One cell type in the community used a genetic AND gate to activate the expression of luxI in the presence of arsenic and mercury. LuxI synthesises the quorum sensing molecule 3OC6HSL. A second cell type in the community used the same genetic AND gate to produce red fluorescent protein (RFP) in the presence of the HSL and copper. It was proposed in this study that this approach could lead to easily customisable and modular biosensors. While this design does allow the biosensor to be customised to some extent (e.g. the PhrpL-rbs30-rfp construct could be replaced with a PhrpL-rbs30-sfGFP construct), the individual parts are still coupled tightly together on the same DNA molecule, and mostly still within the same cell. Additionally, this design only allows for the design of biosensors with AND gates, and there is no capability to add additional signal processing modules into the system. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that the principle of making biosensors multicellular and modular is both possible and useful.  We drew inspiration for our project from this paper and extended their concept with the idea of an off the shelf set of module components, enhanced separation of the design through systematic analysis of previous configurations and the idea of using different ratios of cellular components to optimise the sensor response characteristics. We also included the idea of a cell-free adaptor system.
Quorum sensing mechanisms
In the Sensynova framework, two quorum sensing (QS) mechanisms are employed; the LasIR system and the RhlIR system. Both systems are acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) based systems found in gram negative bacteria; specifically the Las and Rhl systems were orignially characterised in Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a regulatory mechanism for virulence factors (Pearson et al. 1997). The mechanism for the Las QS system is shown in Figure 2. The mechanism for the RHL system is identical, except LasI is replaced with RhlI (which produces C4-HSL instead of C12-HSL), and LasR is replaced with RhlR (which is activated by C4-HSL and activates transcription from the PRhl promoter).

Overview: our journey outside the lab!
Our multidisciplinary approach: Silver medal
Brainstorming approach
The idea of our project was conceived after the biggest cholera outbreak in Congo this year. Indeed this scourge is transmitted annually through wastewater during monsoons season and there is no way to end it, but to establish                 a sewage system throughout Africa. Cholera causes severe dehydration by vomiting and diarrhea and can be fatal if prompt management is not performed. Therefore, we directly contacted the Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross Association who were on site to set an angle of attack. We wanted current epidemics data and we aimed at targeting a real problem! Following this, we imagined a way to neutralize the bacteria. We hope to find a                 solution that would make the water drinkable and once this water has been used, it would treat the already contaminated water, thanks to the remaining plasmids.
Our colleague Sara, medical student and iGEMer, went to Benin, West Africa, for collecting data on epidemics and helping local populations! More info in our “INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES PART”
For our neutralizing approach we first thought about a phage-based system. We were followed and supported by Jean-Paul Pirnay, from the Royal Military Hospital Queen Astrid in Brussels. Belgium is the leading country for                 the phage therapy in Europe and actively participated in the PhagoBurn project. Phages are among the most amazing tools to fight multi-resistant bacteria! This prompted us to put the antibiotic resistance at the center of our                 project!
We established a good partnership with the Military Hospital and they will later test our system on their V.Cholerae strains.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,".  Will be ready to innoculate some liquid cultures tonight around 5 pm or 6 pm and grow them up overnight for making glycerol stocks.
Unfortunately, the plates for our new shuttle vector and promoters were spread far too thick to achieve colonies.  Will try to restreak them tonight with hopefully better results.
Primer design:
Due to the palindromic nature of the enzymes that flank a Biobrick part, all primers that contain these sequences will have some degree of self-complmentarity.  This may or may not present a problem.
We are discussing the issue of where to put the binding sequences on each promoter.  It appears that for all activator reporters that we received, the binding sites come right before the promoter, which is mCyc.  However, for all repressor reporters, the binding sites appear to come in the middle of the promoter.  Since our system incorporates a combination of both, we will have to consider where the optimal placement of the binding sites should be. This will likely require a literature search on our part.
We also devised another test (Test #1.5) to conduct after we have done Test #2.  This test will involve two mutually-repressive constructs, only one of which is under control of an inducible promoter (PMET25, perhaps?).  This test will occur only after Test #2 because Test #2 will tell us which repressor/activator pair we require in order to get good competitive binding.  Then we can choose a different repressor to be the second construct in Test #1.5, which will require a different fluorescence.  This Test #1.5 will be a closer approximation of constructs Z and Y from our final design, which mutually repress each other.
Amp stock solution: 1.0010 g  in 10 mL to create 10 mL of 100mg/mL ampicillin stock solution.  Put them in 1 mL aliquots and froze them at -20 degrees C.  Add 1 mL for 1 L of media, or 1 uL for each mL of media.
Also, restreaked the promoters and shuttle vector.  Note the attempt at a new streaking technique:  Use a loop to collect a small sample of cells.  Then rub the loop holding cells back and forth (along an imaginary horizontal line) at the top of an agar plate.  After doing this, using the loop, draw a short vertical line down from the newly deposited cells. * Turn the loop over so that you can use a side of the"

Collaborations
Berlin Charité
The Berlin Charité Team is working, like us, on toehold switches and using cell-free expression systems. We had several skype      calls where we exchanged our knowledge about toeholds and how they are designed, as well as cell-free     expression systems and how to lyophylise them.
EPFL iGEM provided Berlin with a protocol and advice on how to produce      their own cell lysate and how to supply it with energy. Berlin Charité provided us with additional knowledge on how to freeze-dry our     lysates and systems including the subsequent rehydration of the lyophylised components.
We also collaborated on implementing our toehold designer. Berlin Charité provided     us with their understanding of the in-silico procedures of creating a toehold 1 2 ,     which was crucial for the software correctness.
Oxford, UK
This year's Oxford iGEM team is also working on a cell-free biosensor.    We had the pleasure of meeting them in Cambridge at the OpenPlant forum where we   started our collaboration. During a skype meeting we exchanged some feedback on our projects.    Afterwards, we provided them with a protocol and advice on how to produce their own cell lysate    and how to supply it with energy.
City of London School for Boys, UK
CLSB also worked on toehold switches like us. During a skype meeting and several   mail exchanges, we talked about the design and specificity of these RNA switches. We helped    them overcome their problem with homologous miRNA. Based on that, they designed a second series    of toehold switches which are better suited for clinical use"

We intend to participate in the meetup of German iGEM teams in Marburd. Tobias S. will organize the registration. Furthermore, we want to present our team at the “Göttinger Altstadtlauf” and the sports competition “DIES” from our university.
May
Week 1:
No wet lab work done.
Week 2: IF, LK, NE, TS, GH
Test transformation:
The previously prepared cells of our production strains were again tested for electro competence. The protocol was slightly changed using SOC medium instead of LB-medium and incubating the bacteria at their temperature optima (R. planticola: 30 °C, others: 37 °C). However, the cells again did not grow, showing that they were not electro competent.
Week 3: NE, TK, GH
Preparation:
For the following week, large amounts of media had to be prepared.
 Week 4: NE, GH, MS, AB
Competent cells:
The preparation of competent cells was repeated for S. blattae and R. planticola. The cells were again incubated at their respective temperature maxima.
For Wet Lab:
ordering the designed constructs for the Vitamin B12 synporter from IDT, who sponsor iGEM teams with synthesizing DNA sequences
design of primers, which can be used to amplify the constructs that were synthesized by IDT

Website:
developing a website based on WordPress, which gives information about our project, the idea behind it and the iGEM competition in general
16/05/09:
Wet lab:
The transformations need to be repeated, because they did not work. We might need to adjust the protocol.
Additionally, the competent cells need to be checked for electro competence.
Dry lab:
We will use snapgene to design our vectors and primers.
Human practice:
For the Master Information Day at our university we need to prepare a poster to present our project and the iGEM competition to future master students.
Furthermore, we need to work on the presentation for the “Bio & Brezeln” event at the 26th of May.

Abstract
From July 16th to 17 th, We held a lecture entitled ""Contemporary introduction to synthetic biology"" with corresponding garden party and exhibition in order to help high school students make a better understanding of synthetic biology and genetic engineering. Thanks to the summer camp hosted by Xiamen University, thousands of high school students from Fujian province took part in our activities related to our theme. On the one hand, we let the high school students have a better understanding of our project and iGEM via the lecture. On the other hand, we expected our elucidation expressed how much genetic engineering contributes to our daily life in food, energy, material and so on. These students are just like seeds we sow to help synthetic biology and genetic engineering well understood by the public. What's more, we designed a special series of cards with the theme of synthetic biology for the garden party. We plotted and organized the whole HP together with iGEM-XMU software.
Lecture
What is synthetic biology on earth? Most people will present a confused expression when hearing this subject. Before the lecture we made a survey, finding that in fact nearly 100% of the respondents didn't understand the meaning of the term. Fortunately through our lecture, we got our audience across to the basic principle and a general situation of synthetic biology. The lecture was held in the chemistry lecture hall, Xiamen University on July 7th. There was no empty seat in the hall. Lots of students even stood the whole lecture. The lecture has five parts, including introduction of synthetic biology, iGEM, iGEM-XMU , iGEM-HS program and our following activity——garden party.
Synthetic biology is a newly-developing subject. Our iGEM-XMU team used simple words with vivid pictures to illustrate the generation and development of this discipline. What's more, we introduced some basic"

NTU-Singapore,2018,Team:NTU-Singapore#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," for help in ligating and cloning this fragment into a vector, so it would be easier to amplify and proceed for their assay.
Figure 1.  PCR Result of HT1 and HT2 from UI_Indonesia indicating non-specificity in amplification
How We Helped?
One of our team members Angelysia Cardilla managed to meet up with UI_Indonesia in Jakarta, Indonesia, to discuss about our projects and get to know more about each team's project. In the session, UI_Indonesia also passed us with the gBlocks that they wanted to clone. 
Figure 2.  Meetup with UI_Indonesia
We cloned the HT1-HT2 fragments into the pcDNA3 backbone. Firstly, we kept all the gBlock fragments in the TOPO clone vector before amplifying them. We found that amplifying from TOPO template could lead to higher yield and efficiency. We designed some Gibson primers to combine the two fragments into the pcDNA3 vector. There were a total of 4 primers that we used to do Gibson cloning, HT1 F, HT1 R, HT2 F, and HT2 R. To check if the cloning was successful, we did colony PCR. We also confirmed the successful cloning of HT into pcDNA3 by sending the plasmid for sequencing. The sequence below shows the conjunction of the vector backbone and the HT construct, and the part that is not highlighted is pcDNA3 which has Ampicillin resistance as selective marker. 
Figure 3. Sequence of HT in pcDNA3
As they had faced difficulties in cloning these constructs and such problems may arise again in preparing for part submission, we proposed to them to help to move HT fragment into BioBricks compatible vectors. We cut both the backbone and the plasmid pcDNA3-HT1-HT2 to get the insert with restriction enzyme EcoRI and PstI. Afterward, we ligated them and transformed into competent cells, cultured them on the plate with CML resistance. The correct insertions were confirmed after colony PCR with VF2 and VR primers which are shown on the figure below. All the colony we picked showed correct band size, indicating successful results. 
Figure 4. Colony PCR of psB1C3-HT 
Anticipating other possible difficulties they might have in preparing for part submission, we further offered to help them to remove prohibited restriction sites on the final plasmid and made the plasmid BioBricks compatible. In the end, we submitted their constructs on their behalf as  BBa_K2607001  "

questions
Week 5-6:
As we developed our concepts certain questions kept coming up for us:
How could we use the process of generating simulations to expose new ecosystems to lead to additional research questions and concepts?
What concrete/real projects and behaviors could we use to make an interesting/engaging combination? environments/narratives surrounding existing synthetic biology projects, like electronics into gold, or glow in the dark [insert animal] ect. what happens when you combine these and they exist together in the same place? bacteria spreads.
How can we manipulate time? Could we expose future implications from this and design new questions/systems/objects ect. based on a simulation? set real world behaviors to live and exist in a digital environment at human scale?
What are the rules of the worlds that we are simulating?
Using / starting with UNITY/GAMING ENVIRONMENT can we simulate existing synthetic biology projects created in the lab and release them in a simulated ""living"" world?  Does this help complicate the discussion around synthetic biology projects? What if that project is released into the wild? What are the unexpected new ecosystems / environments / sites / and interactions that would be generated through this simulated evolution?
concept development
Week 6-7:
Imagine huge bodies of water, giant ponds and lakes and just below the surface are trillions of organisms working 24/7, eating plant life and producing gasoline. - George Church, envisioning future synthetic biofuel production.
We developed a concept focusing on previous work in genetically altered algae for the use of biofuel production. what if people had their own fuel source, like their own pools of fuel producing bacteria in their back yards? Pool at the center, a source - an ecosystem (thinking about animals drinking from the watering hole but cars doing this but around pools)
Pools, private, public, community pools, water parks, hot tubs, oh my...
What are the degrees of quality? - abundance, obsession, need of fuel in connection with water + cars + LA.
Would LA be the most powerful? an energy epicenter?
What are the demographics of pool owners? 43,000 pools in the L.A. Basin, the average size was about 16 by 33 feet. Beverly Hills had the most pools per capita."
