UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Teaml_-_-_TEXT.html," I was ready for anything and everything. However, iGEM at UC San Diego this year caught me by surprise. Before I get into the summer's surprises, I'd like to thank our sponsors. Without generous support from Synthetic Genomics and the San Diego Center for Systems Biology, none of this would have been possible - their support gave UCSD students a chance to experience a genuine research experience in an interdisciplinary and collaborative setting. I had an excellent summer designing the project with the undergraduates, teaching them, and working with them. I think UCSD's first iGEM team has managed to impart useful lessons to all those involved, and I'm highly hopeful a second team will follow next year.
Even as an iGEM veteran, the amount of work involved in coordinating this project and mentoring each of the students was quite unanticipated. Fortunately, I had quite a bit of help. I'd also like to thank my fellow mentors, Ben, Justin, Ryan, and Andreas, for helping out and stepping up as needed. Each one of them selflessly gave their time to give patient guidance for the undergraduates. Barry Demchak, Kei Ono, and the rest of the Cytoscape group gave us some great technical advice that really helped to make sure that the team took the most effective software development strategy. Other individuals that gave us some great advice include Jason Kreisberg and Prof. Todd Coleman. Risa Shibata and Anna Lu also deserve a lot of thanks for their invaluable help with logistics and making sure that we could fly to Boston and be at the Jamboree. So I'd guess the amount of work involved in iGEM was ultimately balanced by the amount of support we received.
As the project is finally wrapping up, I'm amazed at how much the students were able to accomplish in the past few months. Many of our students had little exposure to coding, and I'm glad that iGEM at UCSD was able to help them grow into proficient and innovative programmers. On the other side of the coin, we had a few computationally oriented students who managed to leverage synthetic biology concepts to help build a project that everyone on the team can take pride in. I think the project was very ambitious in its design, and I was definitely surprised when all the pieces finally clicked together. I think this was due in no small part to the leaders that emerged from amongst the undergraduates. Without the motivated students involved in this project, we would not have even gotten halfway through the project. Each of the students who worked hard on this project should be proud of themselves.
Overall, I'm very"

We found a new team—USTC 2018! At the end of the term, the new team members gathered together in                       the 363 lab, where we will start and finish our project this year. The old members shows fresh                       men how to do molecular experiments and edit gene. Wow, we are just ready to make some amazing                       things.
February
All the members are divided into different groups before winter holiday                       begins. The Group leaders pick some excellent project done by other team for new members, which                       make them know the project in the iGEM competition. Then, it’s time for us to think and put                       forward a project ourselves.
        
March
It’s surprised that we have came up with so much novel ideas during the                       brainstorm. All the ideas are so interesting that it’s hard to choose one. So We do research in                       project groups to get further information about each projects.
And here are some ideas that hopefully may become candidates for our project.
brainstorm
Nicotine-degrading bacteria
The treatment of Lime concretion black soils
Using Vibrio anguillarum to treat biofilm
Eliminate mercury pollution in nature
A bacterium capable of extracting a plasmid by itself
The self-evolution of bacteria
Helps remove scars from bacteria
JS: Project—From putting forward to giving up
April
We meet once a week and arguing fiercely for the different project. At the end                       of this month, We have selected three candidate projects.
1.Using the QSI system to manage the problems bringing by biofilms
2.Treatment of tobacco waste
3.Governance heavy metals
So we divide team members into three groups again to determine our final                       project.
        
May
We registered the team on the 2018.igem.org and everyone join in the team                       USTC! We really make more research about the three projects and we are confident that we will get                       good results this year for all the projects are amazing. But we need to make a decision as soon                       as possible because of time constraints.
And we begin to make pre"

Joe really is Mr. Congeniality. As our ""HR Guy"" he has really gone above and beyond all of our expectations. Throughout the project, Joe was our public voice and was in charge of all external relations such as collaborations, looking for sponsorship and even managing our Twitter account. In addition to public relations, Joe was also heavily involved in lab work. He assisted David in developing our silver stain protocol and helped develop our experimental design with Mattéa.
A day without our friend Joe is very quiet, and almost lonely. His presence (and sneeze) fills the entire room with a kind of light and positivity that many people lack or take for granted. Joe has the ability to see the silver lining in the darkest storm cloud and for that, we are very thankful. Thank you, Joe! May your beard grow strong and great.
Abbie Gottert
Abbie is one of the most caring, friendly and empathetic people you will ever meet. Between assisting with Logo and Banner design, reviewing the literature, helping Johannes out with the policy and practices, and assisting with lab work, she finds the time to have a full time job and maintain a balance between them. Always concerned with the well being of the group, she goes out of her way to make sure that everyone stays healthy, happy and mentally sound.
Thank you so much, Abbie. Although you couldn't be with us all the time in lab, we always knew you were there in spirit - whether it be a GIF image sent in chat or popping in in the late afternoon after your other shift. ""Good friends are like stars, you can't always see them but you know they're always there."" Abbie is our good friend and has been a shining star in our team.

Kevin Setzer
Throughout the summer, Kevin was extremely busy working full time while also helping out our iGEM team. Though most of his contribution was done outside of NAIT, we could not have grown into the team we are today without Kevin Setzer.
Kevin mostly worked with Joy in the coding and designing of Team NAIT's Wiki sites. He was the bug exterminator, the very necessary second pair of eyes involved in editing all the HTML, CSS and dreaded Java that coded our wiki. Additionally, Kevin also helped in the post-production processes of our 3D animation (i.e: After Effects and Photoshop editing). When he could, Kevin also came to the lab to help prepare reagents"
Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story#Osamu_-_-_TEXT.html," as a doctoral student. Prof. Hirata knew having a doctorate would double my salary at Princeton. I was completely surprised, and I accepted his offer with thanks. I applied for and received a Fulbright travel grant, which provided me with various experiences unavailable otherwise.
On August 4, 1960, Akemi Okubo and I got married in a traditional way, arranged by a match-maker. Akemi was a graduate of the Pharmacy Department where I worked. On August 27, I left Yokohama on a ship bound for Seattle, along with more than 200 other Fulbright fellows and students, but Akemi could not accompany me due to a visa problem. The day was my 32nd birthday. Since that voyage was the last Pacific cruise of the ship Hikawa-maru, the pier was filled with people (Fig. 4). Thousands of colored tapes connected people on the boat with well-wishers on the pier. I will never forget the scene when the ship started to move, and the tapes broke and then fell. After traveling by rail across the United States, I arrived at Princeton on September 17, 1960, and stayed at Dr. Johnson's house that night. The next morning, Dr. Johnson offered to help me find an apartment. We saw a newspaper advertisement for a room for rent, and we stopped at the house. A man responded to the doorbell, but he quickly shut the door when he saw my face. It was a clear case of racial discrimination that I rarely encountered.
Figure 4. The ship Hikawa-maru leaving Yokohama on August 27, 1960. This photograph was taken by the author on the ship.
On my first visit to Dr. Johnson's office, he took out a small vial containing white powder, and said ""This is the freeze-dried light organs of the luminous jellyfish Aequorea, and it should emit light when mixed with water."" We went into a dark room and tested it, but we could not see any light. However, he enthusiastically explained to me that Aequorea were very abundant in Friday Harbor, Washington State, and that they were brilliantly luminous. Then he asked if I would like to study the bioluminescence of this jellyfish. I answered, ""I will be glad to do it."" Thus, we decided to go to Friday Harbor the following summer.
During my first few months in Princeton, I extracted and purified luciferase from dried Cypridina. I was surprised at the large quantity of dried Cypridina that was"

An understanding and consideration of the public perception of our work is crucial to the success of advancements in synthetic biology. Successful and positive public relations are vital to ensure that our research and its applications are not dismissed in amidst sensational reporting, or under- or over-played causing mistrust or fear. Ultimately, without public support and education, products and services built using this new technology may not be developed and released for use, forfeiting a multitude of potential benefits.
Directly as a result of the human practices section of the iGEM competition, much data has been collected gauging public opinion. This, combined with other studies, indicates the status of the field in the public consciousness and highlights work that needs to be done to educate and inform people further.
As the purpose of our public information leaflet is to consider the effect on local communities to the release of our organism, we have attempted to glean a better understanding of the opinions held by non-experts, by also considering the role of the"

Protocol Model Development
Prior to beginning the development of ProtoCat 3.0, we did research                   on currently used protocol models. We began by brainstorming with members of our team who had                   lab experience to get a foundation upon which we could improve. We tested the robustness of                   this initial model by trying to represent the protocols uploaded to ProtoCat 2.0 with our new                   model, tweaking and updating it along the way. Once we felt our model could adequately handle                   the protocols we anticipated in ProtoCat 3.0, we met with our adviser, Dr. Santiago Schnell,                   and ran our protocol model by him. Taking his feedback, we went back and further refined our                   model to the one that we use in our current implementation of ProtoCat 3.0.
Standard Protocol Format
Standardization in synthetic biology has gained a lot of traction,                   such as the BioBrick and Registry of Standardized Biological Parts. However, the procedures                   used to generate them tend to be diverse in nature, with a bacterial transformation                   protocol likely requiring different information than a ligation protocol. Online protocol                   repositories must account for such differences when creating their data models, which will                   usually require either a simplified model (such as solely text-based) or a more arduous                   upload process. These different models become a problem when trying to share protocols between                   the repositories, because the formats that the protocols are stored in are not compatible and                   require an external conversion tool to get from one format to the other. In order to begin                   working towards a standardized protocol format format, we reached out to OpenWetWare and                   Protocols.io, two well known protocol repositories. We have began discussing how we will                   reconcile our respective protocol models in order to get the best protocol model. The first                   steps have been taken to build a cooperative relationship and create a standard protocol that                   will help make protocols even easier to use, test, review, and design.

It was a very good way to practice for the Jamboree and present a more defined project and first results. iGEM Pasteur, IGEM IONIS, iGEM Savlay, iGEM Evry and iGEM UPMC and us were present. We were the first team to present, at 9:30 in the morning, and ended with an interesting session of questions and answers, the public raised very good questions for us to think about, for our presentation and our project's progress. A jury evaluated presentations and gave us good advice on our to present better and told us what part of our project to better linked with the rest. It was an interesting first test at presenting and sharing results, the only drawbacks being hat at this stage of the project we did not have that much to present.
Teams had lunch together and enjoyed a drone demonstration, a very agreable addition to the Meet-up! We realy enjoyed ourselves this day and enjoyed exchanging with Paris team and learning about each other's project and progress.
Figure 4 Festival du Vivant. The Festival vivant is a event organised to learn about synthetic biology and have an informed debate on the future we wish to build with this technology. This event gathered start ups, iGEM teams, designers and artists who presented their projects and their vision of the future synbio can inspire.  During this event we had a stand in the Village des Initiatives, Initiatives village, in which we presented our project and answered questions on iGEM and synthetic biology. We also pitch our project during a conference held for this event in an amphitheater.
Eventually on the last day, we co-animated a workshop on the future we can imagine with synthetic biology with Frédéric Tournier, Professor at the Université Paris Diderot, and Philippe Deterre, biologist at CNRS. This workshop was attended by 20 people with different backgrounds and of different ages

OUR LECTURE IN TUST
Tianjin University of Science and Technology is a key university in Tianjin, China, which is famous for its excellent fermentation engineering and food engineering subject. Some years ago, some professors and students of TUST decided to set up a iGEM team and participate in the iGEM competition in the future. This summer, a sophomore student and a graduate student from TUST came to Tianjin University and study the basic knowledge about iGEM and synthetic biology and help our experiments in protein modification part. They told us about the enormous difficulty they are facing in team establishing process and we shared our experience and gave several suggestions to them. Before they leaved us, they invited us to give a speech in their school after summer vacation. On September 27th, five members of our team went to Teda campus of TUST and gave a speech about how to set up a iGEM team and what could a iGEMer receive from this competition. Almost all the seats were occupied by listeners. Since the iGEM competition is almost a band new term for most students in TUST, many of them showed great interests and talk with us enthusiastically. We gave them a plenty of suggestions according to the experience of our project, and offered encouragement to the students there. We continued our communication online by using a popular Chinese social network Wechat. They will recruit members this semester and decided to register a team next year.

We then column purified the BamHI/KpnI digested pA13BE, after which we set up an overnight ligation with pA13BE and pC13F to create the part pC13BF.
Today, we set up an overnight ligation to create the part pC13BF.

Today, we miniprepped pC13BN colonies, submitting all for sequencing. We also miniprepped and ran PCRs of pC13BD (#’s 1-5), pC13CV (#’s 1-5), pC13DJ (all except 4), and pC13DP (#’s 2,3). Additionally, we remade liquid cultures of ‘’PpkiA’’ and ‘’TxlnD’’. The cultures made on 10/2/13 had not been miniprepped and had to be thrown out because we had to prioritize preparation for the regionals competition. We also gel extracted ‘’PpelA’’ from the BamHI/KpnI digested pA13BE for another ligation with the BamHI/KpnI digested pC13F. This method of ligation was pursued because the ligation done in the traditional manner on 10/7/13 did not seem to be successful.
Colonies of pC13BN were miniprepped and submitted for sequencing, and creation of pC13CQ was confirmed by sequencing.

Genomic DNA of cultured Plasmodia
Our primers were first established with synthetic DNA templates. Apart from that we urged to figure out if our primers work for the detection of real Plasmodium DNA. We did not want to work with the parasite itself to exclude the risk of infection. This is why we reached out to laboratories who work with cultured Plasmodium who could provide us extracted DNA that we could use for our experiments. This led to collaborations with the Center of Infectiology and Parasitology in Heidelberg (AG Portugal) and the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Tuebingen (AG Kreidenweiss) who provided us genomic DNA of their cultured Plasmodium strains."

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into"

Michigan,2012,Team:Michigan#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," the students, teachers, and our team! It was unfortunate we only had two days with the students, but we are sure that the. At the beginning, the students shared the same common misconceptions as the general public did regarding synthetic biology. For example, when asked “what does synthetic biology mean to you?” we encountered the typical answer of “creating frankenstein!” or “creating something from foreign things”. It was interesting to hear their responses, but we redefined synthetic biology for them. During the lab sessions, we guided the students through the many advantages and examples of synthetic biology by experimenting with the potential applications of GFP. During our session of discussing possible applications of pGLO, it was amazing to see how quickly the students learned from our synthetic biology lecture and started thinking critically of what it means to do synthetic biology. Our survey of the 48 students showed a significant amount of the students interested in joining the iGEM at the high school division and would more likely to talk about what they learned about synthetic biology with their friends, family, and teachers.
FUTURE DIRECTION:
Teaching and advocating synthetic biology does not end after the two day campus. Our team has been invited to the local high school in the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan called Skyline High School to participate in their local science fair and mentor students about synthetic biology techniques. Their science fair will be hosted in the winter semester (January or February 2013), so it is unfortunate we do not have any information to share with the iGEM community at this moment. However, we believe we have built a strong connection with the high school students at the camp. We intend to continue this collaboration with WISE again in the summer of 2013 and recruit high school students on to our team help mentor them through laboratory techniques and regulations. We feel it is crucial to integrate the young generation into our project because they would be at the heart of a dynamically growing field of synthetic biology. Education and advocacy for this field is not a simple task that can be done overnight. We must invest in long term goals and continue to share our enthusiasm the public, especially the young adults.

Biosafety vs. Bioethics - Who Cares and What is the Difference?
WE CARE… At the 2014 DTU iGEM team we believe that it is our responsibility as researchers to ensure that the Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) we create and handle on a daily basis do not cause any harm to the health of people nor harm the environment. Synthetic biology offers a lot of great opportunities, but also includes handling of different hazards that the scientists need to be aware of to be able to minimize potential risks. We have therefore considered both the biosafety as well as the bioethics of our project. We have chosen to distinguish between the two according the the definition given by the World Health Organisation:
Biosafety: “The prevention of unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release, whereas biosecurity is the prevention of loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release of pathogens and toxins.”
Bioethics: ‘’The study of the ethical and moral implications of biological discoveries, biomedical advances and their applications, as in the fields of genetic engineering and drug research.’’
Below, we have explained how we have implemented safety in our daily wetlab work to avoid any release of GMOs, hazardous chemicals etc., as well as to ensure the safety of the researchers (ourselves) when handling the biological as well as chemical agents. If you want to know more about our considerations on bioethics, please visit the Ethics section .
How We Handled the Safety
When carrying out an experimental project, safety precautions regarding the work routines in the laboratory need to be considered to avoid personal injuries or leakage of (potentially) dangerous biological or chemical agents to the environment.
All members of the team that have been actively involved in the laboratory work have received a general safety instruction to the laboratory, in which we have carried out the main part of our"

Smearing bands
Too much DNA has been loaded to the slots; the applied voltage has been too high. The gel looks smeared at all, you might touched the gel directly with your hands.
The gel was melting
Even old lab veterans sometimes use water instead of 1-fold TAE to dissolve agarose. You should also regularly refresh the TAE buffer inside the running chamber.
Further information concerning the HDGreen® Plus Safe DNA Dye
Security precaution
Ethidium bromide is commonly used to stain nucleic acids in molecular biology laboratories. However, this agent is highly mutagen and therefore considered as hazardous. As alternative staining method we use HDGreen® Plus Safe DNA Dye. According to the manufacturer (INTAS) this dye does not contain substances which at their given concentration, are considered to be hazardous to health. Nevertheless, this dye stains DNA and every DNA staining substance should be treated carefully and only with gloves.
Disposal considerations
The waste must be disposed of in accordance with federal, state and local environmental control. Therefore, the gels are collected in a container next to the imager.
Purification of DNA fragments
PCR purification kit
The Material
DNA product(s) or linearized plasmid(s)

The Procedure
Add an equal volume of CP Buffer to your DNA solution. For fragments < 200 bp add 3 volumes of CP Buffer for better results.
Transfer the mixture to a spin column and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. Discard the flow-through and add 750 µl CG Wash Buffer.
Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm, discard the flow-through and repeat the steps 2 and 3 once.
Centrifuge again to dry the silica membrane 2 minutes at 13,000 rpm.
Put the column into a labeled Eppendorf reaction tube, add 30 - 50 µl of water (not less than 30 µl) on top of the silica membrane, incubate for 5 min at room temperature and elute the DNA by centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. Please keep in mind that you have to add less water if you want to elute the DNA from a restriction analysis! Always check the purified DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis to make sure that you did not lose the DNA. Determine the DNA concentration and the purity.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," the aspired structure. But can we print several layers on top of each other without great losses in precision, thus: how thick will the lines be? To answer this question, we printed lines of one, two and three layers in triplicate using our Biolinker and measured their thickness using a microscope (10x).
Adding a second layer of alginate on top of the first layer lead to an average increase of line thickness of 7%. The addition of two layers increased the line thickness by 21% compared to a single layer.
3. The syringe pump
Depending on the volume and supplier of your syringe of choice, the inner diameter varies strongly. This however is an important input parameter for the syringe pump to control the rate of bioink extrusion to a constant flow rate. The inner diameter usually can be found on the supplier’s webpage. We found a flow rate of 100 µL/min to be a good value to start experiments. Minor adjustments might be necessary depending on the exact velocity at which the tip moves across the biopaper. For our experiments, we were using a Harvard Apparatus ‘11’ Plus (70-2208) syringe pump.
Design and Integration
Engineering bacteria to form a patterned biofilm
Setting out with barely more than the idea of connecting cells to form a patterned biofilm, we had to think about how to engineer our bacteria to reach this goal in the most efficient way. As the first step, we started to think about possible designs of our biobricks.
Clearly, since CsgA is the protein monomer for amyloid nanowires, this gene will be on our plasmid. But which promoter to use? Inducible or constitutive? A constitutive production of the protein monomers would lead to a premature formation of nanowires which could eventually lead to clumps clogging the tubes and leading to losses in precision. For this reason, we chose an inducible Rhamnose promoter. However, coming to this realization we concluded that we also need a CsgA knockout strain to conduct our experiments with. Finally, for an efficient optical assay of our biofilm product we decided to incorporate fluorescence in the form of GFP or RFP inside of our cells.
However, next to the protein creating the nanowires, many others exist which are important: CsgB is a membrane protein which functions as the anchor on the cell and triggers the aggregation process of CsgA to a nanowire. Presumably, depending on the level of expression of these membrane proteins we can influence the amount of connections per"

In addition to collaborating with college teams, the Duke iGEM Team played a direct hand in starting and mentoring the 2012 North Carolina School of Science and Math (NCSSM) highschool iGEM Team. One of Duke iGEM's undergraduate members, Peter Fan, co-founded and co-lead the team as a senior in high school after participating with Duke iGEM 2011. Peter and his research partner, Aakash Indurkhya, applied for grants to fund the team, presented the 2011 Duke iGEM Team's research project to their student body in order to generate interest, and provided mentorship. The NCSSM iGEM Team performed spectacularly in their first year and earned the title of 1st Runner Up (2nd Place overall) and honorable mention for best new biological part--natural at the 2012 iGEM HS Jamboree.

SynBioDay
In Tuebingen, there is a strong green/ecological movement. This leads to general scepticism against bioscientific research. Therefore we wanted to inform Tuebingen's population about genetic engineering by participating in the SynBioDay. The SynBioDay is an annual activity by the German iGEM teams where we try to explain the pros and cons of synthetic biology to the general public.
On a sunny Saturday morning, we pitched our tent at Tuebingen's market place in the historic centre. The booth was decorated with posters about synthetic biology and our current project. Additionally we offered little sweets to attract bypassers.
Our aim was to convey basic knowledge about DNA (“What happens when I eat DNA?”, “What is a gene?”), to give information about methods used in molecular biology, and to discuss the pros and cons of genetic engineering.
In order to achieve these aims, we had prepared a little quiz about DNA and molecular biology. Many bypassers stopped at our booth, participated in the quiz, and asked questions about synthetic biology or our project. Interested people came with a broad variety of background knowledge: Our booth was visited by an emeritus physics professor, a biology student but also people with no scientific background. Largely, our project was seen positive, as people appreciate a better blood supply for transfusion, even if this is achieved by using genetic engineering.
Special attention was paid to animal experiments; also there were critical questions concerning the release of genetically modified organism to the environment. We could assure the people that we have only used genetically modified bacteria and that precautionary measures were taken to avoid bacteria escaping our lab.
All in all, we can say that"

Another colony was taken in order to streak another ampicillin plate (Amp Res) plate, inoculated 12/09/15. The plate was placed in 37 oC incubator. The Amp Res plate was used as it was observed that MtrCAB was not growing initially on chloramphenicol plates. It was discovered that the anchor used was not infat chloramphenicol as originally thought. It was ampicillin resistance. Therefore as of 14/09/15 MtrCAB was grown on amp plate with what appears to be positive results- 5 colonies. The colonies have yet to be tested further for positive confirmation.

British_Columbia,2014,Team:British Columbia#ProjectBiomining_-_-_TEXT.html," Our synbio solution involves the use of small surface heptapeptides and octapeptides, which have previously been demonstrated in M13 bacteriophage by Curtis et al. to selectively bind to chalcopyrite(3). Three peptides, labelled WSD-1 (TPTTYKV), WSD-2 (DSQKTNPS), and WSD-3 (DPIKHTSG), have been identified for binding. However, operating with bacteriophage is not feasible for large scale operations in mining as it is difficult to scale up titers to compensate for the smaller surface area available for binding in bacteriophage. Our idea is to operate these peptides in bacteria which have a larger surface area and are much more responsive to stimuli. These peptides must be accessible on the surface. Therefore, we have chosen Caulobacter crescentus as our chassis given that it contains a S-protein layer in which we can express our peptides. A developed kit for protein secretion and display of peptides on the cell surface S-layer in Caulobacter crescentus (via cloning to the S-layer gene sequence) can be found within Caulobacter S-layer Kits .
Figure 1. Curtis et al. screened a random heptapeptide library through a series of ‘biopanning’ assays for peptides that could be expressed on M13 bacteriophage and selectively bind to chalcopyrite. These peptide-containing bacteriophage have the potential to be utilized to separate chalcopyrite from enargite in ore slurries.
Figure 2. Our project adapts these chalcopyrite-binding peptides (WSD-1 (TPTTYKV), WSD-2 (DSQKTNPS), and WSD-3 (DPIKHTSG)) by cloning them into the S-protein layer of Caulobacter crescentus.
Our solution: Mineral Separation
As a proof of concept, we have chosen to express these peptides to selectively bind to chalcopyrite, which will then fall out of solution by aggregation using two interacting coiled-coil peptides expressed on the S-layer of Caulobacter crescentus. These coiled-coil peptides (K-coil: BBa_K1189012 , E-coil: BBa_K1189013 , K-coil-His: BBa_K1189010 , and E-coil-His: BBa_K1189011 )were constructed by iGEM Calgary 2013.

Once the box is assembled apply the sticky rubber sheath where the top of the box will be placed. The chamber must be hermetic at normal atmosphere pressure but should have the possibility to create a small opening when you inject compressed air.
Drill two holes in the metal cap of the jar, and place a O-ring in each hole. Gather some charcoal from the last barbecue, and crush it with a mortar and pestle. Pour the crushed ashes inside the jar, and screw the cap to close it.
Finally, cut the plastic tube in two pieces depending on your needs. Connect the first from the compressed air source to the jar and the second tubef rom the jar to the chamber.
Black crust formation.
work under fume hood and wear double gloves
Wet marble pieces with distilled water and place them into a beaker. It is preferable to leave the marble in water for 24 hours prior the experiment.
Fill the beaker until the marble pieces is submerged roughly by half.
Fill another beaker with sulfurous acid, and pour some on the surface of the marble piece too.
Place the beakers inside the camber, and cover the box with the top plexiglass panel. Place a weight on it to keep it down when you will inject air inside the chamber.
Inject compressed air for 2-3 seconds, you should be able to see ashes entering the chamber.
Repeat this step twice, every 72 hours.
At the ninth day open the box and collect the marble pieces. They should be covered in black crusts. A solid layer of gypsum and ashes may also form above water surface, and that can be used for tests too. Dry the marble samples.
16. APPLICATION ON THE STATUES
Jelly MOPS:
Gel is freshly prepared prior to every application.
6 g/L agar is added to  MOPS medium and heated in the microwave until dissolved.
Cool the gel on ice.
Add antibiotic, arabinose and/or IPTG.
Whipp the gel using an egg beater or similar tool to incorporate air bubbles in the gel matrix.
Bacteria preparation:
Grow bacteria in MOPS following our standard protocol.
After the bacteria are induced (i.e. arabinose and/or IPTG).
After 3 hours of induction, spin down the bacteria and discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the bacteria in freshly prepared Jelly MOPS and apply them on the statues.
Cover the gel with rice paper pre-rinsed in PBS.

Why do we apply HCC ?
Our business plan!
Our communication with a cancer patient!
An interview with a doctor
Date: May 24th，2018
When choosing the disease to apply our project, we initially decided to target at liver cancer. In order to understand current treatment of liver cancer, we interviewed Director Zhou Guoping of Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. Director Zhou Guoping has decades of clinical experience in the treatment of liver cancer. He introduced us to the situation of liver cancer in China, the characteristics of liver cancer and treatment methods. The interview excerpt is as following.
[Read more]
Q：We understand that most patients with liver cancer are already in the advanced stage when they are diagnosed. Is it true in your experience? Does this mean that most patients with liver cancer are difficult to cure and they have been sentenced to death?
A: The incidence of liver cancer has always been very high in our country, especially in men. Because of the high incidence of hepatitis B in China, the incidence of liver cancer is relatively high. Liver cancer in China has a lot to do with hepatitis B. When someone is diagnosed with liver cancer, the mortality rate is really high. It is rare for the patients to be diagnosed with small tumor which means the diameter of the tumor is less than 3cm. The survival rate of patients with small tumor generally is quite high. However, they are often diagnosed at the middle or advanced stages. The cancer can bring many other problems, such as ascites, jaundice, etc. which causes difficulties in treatment. At present, the best treatment for liver cancer is surgery, but most people can not undergo the surgery.
[Read more] [Backwards]
Q：What kind of treatment is currently used in clinical practice?
A: Because most patients lose their chance of surgery, and the recurrence rate of this kind of cancer is really high. At present, chemotherapy is commonly used. The chemotherapy efficiency of liver cancer in the past is very poor. In the last two years, it was slightly improved due to technology improvement. In addition there are embolization treatment and targeted therapy, such as sorafenib. However, according to the score system we use now, in fact, the use of sorafenib in the advanced stage have barely any effects, like a comfort treatment."

Collaborations.
It's not all a competition.
Interlab University of Pittsburgh University of Georgia
A core value of iGEM is collaboration. A core value of the CMU team is to help others in whatever capacity we are able to, whether it be with our equipment, knowledge, or filling our surveys. In the spirit of this, we’ve collaborated with several iGEM teams. Read about our efforts below.
Interlab Study
The interlab study is an international collaboration across all iGEM teams who chose to participate in the study. The goal is to obtain fluorescence data for three different genetic devices expressing GFP. We want to see the correlation between the values obtained for the genetic devices expressing such GFP and whether the measurement for such a synthetic biology protocol is consistent across all iGEM teams since the same samples were used.
iGEM Teams
University of Pittsburgh
We provided the data from last year’s estrogen sensor. They wanted to use an estrogen-sensitive T7 RNA polymerase which the CMU iGEM team designed in 2014 in order to activate transcription of a reporter gene in a cell-free extract. They want to generate freeze-dried cells on paper for easy transportation and detect presence of estrogen in water after freeze drying the cells. In the presence of estrogen, the synthetic T7 RNA polymerase will initiate transcription of a reporter construct. In addition, we met up with each other to give a short presentation to the TEC-Bio team at the University of Pittsburgh. After detecting the estrogen, we assisted them in modeling their freeze-dried system allowing them to produce a useful system.
University of Georgia
The University of Georgia invited us to a collaboration effort to obtain mCherry fluorescence readings for an archaeal RBS (ribosomal binding site) library they prepared. They studied this in order to control protein expression. Since there are not many tools involved in studying archaea, they wanted to collaborate in order to promote the utilization of methanogenic archaea modeling this behavior after interlab in order to analyze their measurements obtained from the study. In addition, they want to add on to the E.coli Interlab by adding another specimen to be used. The collaboration allowed them to assess the reproducibility of the data in various labs around the world and develop a"

Achievements
Purification of Cas13a
The purification protocol we used to purify Cas13a is based on the protocol described in Gootenberg et al. 2017 (find the Cas13a purification protocol here ). During purification, SDS-PAGE analysis was done to check for presence and purity of Cas13a (Figure 7).
Figure 7: The difference in expression between the bacteria cultures before and after induction with IPTG (BI and AI). The intensity of the bands around 140 kDa show a clear difference before and after induction, which mean that the induction was successful and that the size of the translated protein is right.
B: The presence of proteins in the different purification samples. This gels shows the presence of proteins in the supernatant (SN), the first two washing steps (W1 and W2) and the five elution steps (E1-5). It can be seen that clear bands around 140 kDa are present in the elution steps. Also, some fainter bands at different heights can be seen in the elution steps.
From these results we can conclude that Cas13a is expressed in significantly higher quantities after induction with IPTG (although there is some leaky expression). Furthermore we can conclude that purity of the product is increased using the different purification steps that were done.
Proof of Cas13a collateral cleavage activity
To assess the collateral cleavage activity of the purified Cas13a, we first made use of the fluorescence assay as described by Gootenberg et al. 2017 . For a description of the RNase alert assay ( Thermo Fischer Scientific, 2017 ), see the Cas13a design page. Reactions with Cas13a were performed with and without target and crRNA (Figure 8).
Figure 8: The fluorescence of RNase alert over time. Fluorescence indicates for Cas13a activity. It is shown here that there is only activity when both crRNA and target RNA is added to the solution. Values reported here are the measured values of which the blank (only RNase alert)"

Magnetic Receiver
Background
To transform the electromagnetic signal into thermal signal, we need to set magnetic nanoparticles in E.coli, which can absorb energy and heat, just like receiver to receive electromagnetic signal. We decided to use iron contained ferritin as the endogenous nanoparticle.
Ferritin is composed of 12 or 24 subunits, and in coming together they form a virtually spherical and hollow shell with an internal cavity that can accommodate up to 4500 iron atoms[1]. The iron is stored in the form of ferrihydrite iron cores normally that with superparamagnetic properties [2].
Superparamagnetic nanocrystals have the ability to serve as colloidal mediators for heat generation, so it is the ideal property we want to identify in our bio-mineralized bacteria[3]. Actually, the iron contained ferritin has been reported to generate heat in response to electromagnetic signal. [4]
Besides, ferritin is an outstanding choice because of many advantages such as instability, safety for chassis and easiness of magnetic core synthesis rather than magnetosome and metal binding peptide.
We chose FtnA, ferritin from bacteria, which composed of 24 identical subunits Ftn [1] to serve as mag-receiver. It has a suitable size of 12 nm in diameter and its central cavity is around 7.5 nm in diameter (Fig.1) [5]. We’ve built a model to predict the heat producing efficiency of ferritin FtnA.
Fig.1. Schema of ferritin.
Process
To get a FtnA ferritin with superparamagnetic nanocrystals and make this core heat, we need to do following process:
Fig.2. This flow chart shows the process to construct a mag-receiver.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"iotin mesh is only used to give the cells initial mechanical stability until they can start to divide and differentiate. From this imput we came to the idea that it would be a great point for our bioprinting approach if we could dissolve the synthetic tissues upon addition of a substance. We found this substance when we read about biotinidase, which is an enzyme that recycles biotin, which is quite value vitamin for mammals. As it cleaves-off biotin molecules from proteins in the blood it is also capable of dissolving our bioprinted tissue as soon as it is added to the petri dish with the synthetic tissue. In our Linker Chemistry subproject we then developed extended linkers that were expected to be easier or harder to cleave by the biotinidase. This approach was successful and we found two additional linkers that are easily accessible by means of organic synthesis and the biotin-valin-NHS linker proved to be much more resistant towards biotinidase cleavage.

The insignificant differences in growth rate of bacteria treated with various lactate concentrations indicated that RIOT sensor using lldRO1-J23117-lldRO2 promoter ligated with strong RBS designed by team ETH_Zurich 2015 was not sensitive enough to detect small changes in lactate concentration in the tumour microenvironment.

D-alanine auxotrophic mutant bacteria were transformed with plasmids containing ALR sequence under the control of RIOT sensors with strong or medium RBS.  Their overnight culture were spun down and resuspended with M9 minimal media without D-alanine supplement. Then, they were subjected to different treatments: without and with addition of D-alanine supplement (50 μg/ml) and with addition of lactate of 10-4 to 10-2 M. Their OD600 readings were measured for 6 hours. LN of OD600 readings reflects the bacterial growth rate.
Since RIOT sensor 3 and 6 contain a constitutively expressed promoter, they served as positive controls for Alanine Racemase expression.

Northwestern,2018,Team:Northwestern#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Chicago, IL. Her research interests include the epidemiology and control of antibiotic resistant pathogens in healthcare settings. She has been a member of the CDC-sponsored Chicago Prevention and Intervention Epicenter team since 2006.
Dr. Hayden’s journey with working with infectious diseases began in 2009 when a patient with CRE tragically passed away at Rush University while she was on call. Though CRE and MRSA were not prevalent yet, some of the first cases to be seen were in Chicago. Through her work in the field, she realized that these diseases were remaining undiagnosed in many health facilities. She also realized that the control of antibiotics were being conducted ""selfishly” and  facilities would set up protocols to protect their own facilities. One of the main programs at the Epicenter is to aid surrounding facilities in developing protocols that will protect them all from the wide spread of antibiotic resistance.
Dr. Hayden emphasized how there are many different methods to protect the population from antibiotic resistant bacteria diseases that stem from them. From good hygiene practices, to using gene sequencing to track the origins of resistant microorganisms, to antibiotic stewardship, she provided many examples of ways to make a difference.
Dr. Hayden stressed that innovation is the way to go if we are planning on finding a replacement or something to go in conjunction with antibiotics. She mentioned that our research seemed promising but reducing overuse would also be vital.
Takeaway: Dr. Hayden really ingrained in us the idea that there are many ways to battle this problem. Dr. Hayden pressed that a novel intervention is needed and commented that we are heading in the right direction."

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#pages#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html," photocaging, has already been used to control degradation or nuclear accumulation of proteins [8] [9] .
As in LOV photocaging inhibition is not achieved by merely blocking an active centre but by completely hiding the whole binding partner we assessed the latter strategy as the most promising. Because of the C-terminal location of the J-alpha helix, the place that photocaging takes place in, an intein that is hidden within the LOV domain and splices off a fused protein without creating a significant scar needs to be a C-intein. It has been suggested that the length of the caged peptide itself determines the success of the photo caging [10] . Thus, we extensively screened the literature and discovered a set of only six amino acids long C–inteins.
S11 split inteins
Interestingly, there seem to exist only very few inteins with small C-terminal halves. The shortest and therefore most suitable  were the S11 split inteins, engineered and thoroughly, but solely described by Lin et al. [11] . S11 inteins are engineered from mini-inteins, meaning that, unlike most other inteins, they do not have an internal homing endonuclease domain. Naturally, they are not trans-, but cis-splicing inteins and their crystal structure reveals twelve β-strands. To gain very small C-terminal split inteins, they were artificially separated between the 11th and 12th β-strand resulting in a 120-160 aa N- and 6 aa C-intein. We decided to use the Ssp DnaX, Ssp GyrB and Ter DnaE3 inteins since there properties were promising i.e. they showed the highest splicing activity.
Cloning and Methods
Rational Design of inLOV constructs
Initially a screening for the caging of three different S11- inteins, namely SspDnaX, SspGyrB and TerDnaE-3, at various positions within the J-alpha helix of the LOV domain was planned (Figure 2). The best split fluorescent protein was thought to provide an easy read-out for the best combination of caging position and C-terminal split intein. Unfortunately, we encountered many problems: the assembly construct with two insertion sides in which the LOV domain ought to be embedded for an easy exchange of caging positions via golden gate cloning was not ready at this time point. Secondly, a screening for the best split fluorescent protein turned out to be more time intensiv than expected.

Safe Project Design
In Cearll’s Secret project, we used bacteria and mammalian cells.
Bacteria
The bacteria used in all experiments are classified as biosafety level 1 organisms. These cells are used for plasmid construction, transformed with circular plasmids and ligation production as well as Biobricks editing. To minimize the contamination risk in bacteria, we used only 2 types of antibiotics: Ampicillin for selection of plasmid construction and chloromycetin for Biobricks construction. As a result, the bacteria remain sensitive to other antibiotics. If bacteria from our experiments are accidently released, they most likely fail to proliferate competing with other naturally occurring and better adapted bacteria in the environment.
Moreover, we used competent bacteria in our experiments only as an amplification tool (DH5α) for our plasmids, with all of the transformation completed inside the clean bench (Fig. 1). The promoters we used are human promoters, thus not likely to translate and express in other bacteria. But even if the plasmids are transformed to other bacteria and translated, the proteins encoded in our plasmids are harmless, because the channels can only be activated in lab as natural sound and stress are much smaller than the threshold. We use well-established protocols under proper guidance and safety management. The criteria are same with what are required for biological research projects of all the labs in SUSTech.

Cells

Why Do We Need Maxicells?
Bacteria and other unicellular prokaryotes may seem somewhat insignificant in the ecosystems we see around us. How can something so small have any influence on the               hugely complex multicellular life sharing the environment? We (think we) know all about the bacteria involved in the nitrogen cycle, carbon cycle - bacterial species that we know have a               direct affect on the anthropogenic sphere. But what about microbial species that are not directly involved in these processes, should we be concerned about the effects that human activity               have on them if it will have no effect on us? The answer is YES.
Recent studies in metagenomics have revealed a complex network of dynamic interactions in microbial communities. Species that               were previously thought to be unimportant have been found to impact these processes by providing services to those species performing the key, central reactions. With this knowledge it is clear that any human activity, such as environmental release of reproductive micro-organisms that interfere with natural ecosystem dynamics, can have unknown, possibly long-lasting effects on the biogeochemical cycles which are necessary for life on Earth. It is therefore imperative that any Synthetic Biology venture intended for environmental release should not have any undesired effects on the local ecology.
We considered the possible reasons for why environmental release is so dangerous, and decided that there were two main problems which must be overcome:
The possibility that our released strain could proliferate uncontrollably
The risk that genes from our strain could escape by horizontal gene transfer and provide a competitive advantage to native prokaryotes
Both of these outcomes have to potential to alter the balance of ecosystem interaction networks, which could have a myriad of unforeseen consequences.
In order to tackle the first problem, and to a large extent the second, we first looked at minicells: cells generated after abnormal septum formation during replication due to misplacement of the FtsZ ring - leading to the production of small cells that do not possess a chromosome.

Finally, the reporter gene currently present in the promoter probe plasmid mRFP, was been replaced with a sfGFP coding sequence. As the sfGFP coding sequence is a significantly shorter than its predecessor, therefore allowing for a faster transcription. This gene sequence also produces a brighter fluorescence than mRFP, with emission wavelengths of 509 nm, interference that can arise when using techniques such as plate readers from high cell density (wavelength of 600 nm) samples become less likely when compared to the emission wavelength of mRFP (584 nm).

Characterisation
To test the functionality of the improved promoter plasmid probe, a sample of the synthetic promoter library produced in this project was assembled into the plasmid using BioBrick assembly. The resulting colonies were miniprepped and insertion was confirmed through sequencing.
Conclusions
Though the insertion of the promoters were successful into the promoter probe plasmid, due to time constraints, we lacked the time to further characterise this part into the Sensynova platform within the lab.
The new improved promoter probe plasmid, part BBa_K2205026 was submitted to the registry for further work and characterisation by future teams."

SEAP that was secreted into the culture medium leads to a colour change from red to yellow after addition of pNPP (chromogenic substrate) by its phosphorylation.
First we generated a coarse pattern realizing that scattered light also reached wells that were close to the illuminated ones, leading to an unclear pattern. However, the rough shape of the desired pattern is discernible (Fig. 3A, B).
Since it was essential to completely prevent light exposure on covered plates, we tested 96 well plates with optically separated wells. We could generate patterns with sharp contours (Fig. 3C, D).
The colour change of pNPP in cell culture medium could be measured at 405 nm in a plate reader. Setting a distinct threshold made pattern recognition easier.

Cold shock RNATs.- cold shock RNATs also depend on the dynamics of the folding of different loops, but in contrast to heat shock RNATs, the conformation that prevents the binding of the ribosome is found at high temperatures, while at low temperatures, the RNAT folds into a conformation that allows for the ribosome to proceed. An example of a cold shock RNAT is the element found upstream and inside the coding region of E. coli gene cspA.
Synthetic RNATs
The discovery of new RNATs has relied on a mixed approach that involves bioinformatics and experimental validation, as well as approaches that involve mutational libraries, synthetic constructions and directed evolution. Likewise, de novo designed synthetic RNATs have been proved to regulate genetic expression at different temperature ranges. Successful approaches are based on structural design of sequence loops that mask the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence inside the RBS.  Specifically, Neupert et al. (2008) achieved to build simple RNATs that consist of a single small stem-loop structures containing the RBS and blocking the SD sequence. Additionally, 2011 iGEM team BYU_Provo also worked with the design of synthetic RNATs, managing to select sequences sensitive to narrow temperature ranges.
Our project builds upon these two works to prove that RNATs can also be employed to effectively regulate the expression of transcription factors in synthetic circuits. Even when the naturally found RNATs usually regulate the expression of transcription factors, the synthetic constructions made so far have focused mainly on the characterization of the effect of a given RNAT by placing a reporter protein (LacZ or a fluorescent protein) directly downstream. On the other hand, our proposal points at possible applications for the circuit topologies that would be made feasible through the combination of transcription factors and temperature sensitive translational regulation.

Our genetic circuit combines two synthetic RNATs and three transcription factors, through which we intend to gain temperature-mediated control over the transition of three discrete states, signaled by the expression of distinct fluorescent proteins. The figure below shows the topology of the proposed circuit. 
At temperatures below 32ºC, called state 0, no reporter protein is produced. Above 32ºC,"

In addition to this, new receivers of Bja (Lindemann,2011), Aub (Nasuno,2012), and Rhl (Pearson, 1997) were created for testing. This was done by having a promoter from Lux and combining it with the specific regulator gene binding domain (Scott,2016). In addition to the inducible promoter, we also rearranged to order of our two part receiver system. The regulator and GFP were originally in that respective order. However, in our new receivers that orientation is switched. This was due to finding a leaky expression due to transcriptional read through of the receiver. By swapping the order, we can optimize the sequence to avoid transcriptional read through in our reporter gene.
Some broad descriptions of experiment ran are testing concentration of N-acyl homoserine lactone, testing combination of different senders, and testing induction and diffusion rates with senders and receivers.

Lost in Translation
This exploration in our missing mCherry gives other QS related experiments an explanation for possible mCherry disappearance and allows an opportunity for a possible solution to non-inducing senders. This process is vital due to the cultures being used are neighboring colonies from the same transformed agar plates. There were no prior issues that could lead to this lack of expression , thus giving us an increases a need for a possible revelation to this mystery. This experiment can lead to possible reason why there is no mCherry in random cultures, what this lack of expression means senders, and possible solution to fix this lack of expression for future ventures.
The motivation for this side project is to determine whether or not AHL synthase is being produced in correspondence to mCherry. mCherry was used within the sender systems to indicate if the AHL synthases are being produced. The senders are used within our quorum system to produce AHL synthases, which produces AHL signals that then go over to the receiver system described up above to bind to the regulatory proteins to attach to the receptor binding site in the inducible promoter to initiate transcription of the GFP."

Practices and Policies
There are much more to a good iGEM project than the work in the lab. An important pillar in the foundation of iGEM is also to raise public awareness of synthetic biology. In aim to do so we gave a presentation at the Danish Youth Association of Science (UNF) annually Biotech Summer Camp, regarding synthetic biology, iGEM and some ethical concerns.  During the presentation we asked what their opinion was on the discussed topics. You can read more about our visit at the UNF ‘s summer camp under Education .
The youth are one of our  outreach target groups. We hope that the young generation can provide the public with some new aspect on the use of synthetic biology.
To reach out to children, we have authored a children book. This book provides teachers and parents a good basic tool for educating children in Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). To read more about the creation of this unique book and to download our own free copy, please go to A Children’s Book .
The different between right and wrong is important to keep in mind when working with living organism’s DNA. A big part of our project have"

- This equation gives the % bound by activator as a function of activator concentration. - after Hill equation modification, the system behaves like a switch - In addition, we also need to model the diffusion of blood and GFP in the bacteria culture
Cell–free mechanism:
- For hospital use, the blood must be processed through a cell-free system to give an accurate test result, as well as the bacteria to reduce the risk if they leak from the container ( after the cell-free process, the bacteria are not able to reproduce) - separate certain organelles from whole cells for further analysis of specific parts of cells - in the process, a tissue sample is first homogenised to break the cell membranes and mix up the cell contents - homogenization is intensive blending of mutually related substances or groups of mutually related substances to form a constant of different insoluble phases - homogenate is then subjected to repeated centrifugations - each time removing the pellet and increasing the centrifugal force - Separation is based on size and density, with larger and denser particles pelleting at lower centrifugal forces. In the separating order in actual application: Whole cells and nuclei; Mitochondria, lysosomes and peroxisomes; Microsomes (vesicles of disrupted endoplasmic reticulum); ribosomes and cytosol.
Filter/semi-permeable membrane for the blood cells: RBC: 7-8.5 μm neutrophil: 10-12 μm eosinophil: 10-15 μm basophil: 10-12 μm monocyte: 14-20 μm lymphocyte: small: 6-8 μm, medium 9-12 μm, large: 13-20 μm taurocholic acid molecule roughly 0.4 nm - therefore, if the hole diameter of the filter is set to be at about 2-5 nm, all the blood cells can be filtered
Human practices (with help of LSE BIOS): A. why biosensors ? - possible to construct - has a potential market
- B. human practices 1. bio-safety - cell-free system to stop the bacteria from reproducing if there is a leakage of the sensor device - (unpredictable) mutation must be carefully prevented during the engineering part 2. bio-security - the access to DNA sequences and other genetic information must be controlled - “garage biologist” - the restriction to synthetic biology knowledge is not the way to prevent bio-terrorism, the"

The first system we talked about was a two-plasmid repressor system which produces β-galactosidase in the presence of DAPG. This system is optimized for cell free expression, so we decided that we should utilize the plasmid backbones in MetaSense. To do this, we simply would need to amplify the backbones using PCR while also taking out the promoters and reporter gene. Then, using Gibson assembly, we would be able to clone in promoters that contain a binding site for chromium/lead regulated repressor proteins, as well as an output gene.
To first show that these backbones are optimized for cell-free protein synthesis, Adam suggested that we adapt the plasmid backbones to sense AHL. This system is similar to the DAPG sensor, except that it produces an activator protein and the presence of AHL is required for the activator to bind to the promoter, resulting in a GFP output. Again, to create this system we need to clone in the pLux promoter and LuxR repressor gene into the backbones of the DAPG sensor.
Ultimately, Adam provided crucial insights into cell-free protein synthesis and certain aspects that affect its quality. Given these insights, we adapted MetaSense to include a two-plasmid system that will provide better results than other systems, thus improving the quality of our design.
Interview with Dr. Alam
To finalize our project idea as well as go over some design specifications, we interviewed Khalid Alam, a postdoc at Northwestern University.
Initially, we talked through our ideas for possible projects, and he suggested that we go forward with hexavalent chromium and lead sensing. The reason for this is that it has a local impact; hexavalent chromium and lead levels in Evanston, as well as the greater Chicago area, are above the EPA deemed limits. Additionally, U.S. Steel has contributed significantly to this issue through their dumping of a large amount of hexavalent chromium into Lake Michigan.
After deciding to focus on chromium and lead sensing, we started to define our end goal. One of the main aspects that we wanted our project to incorporate is citizen science. To do this, we must design a sensor that could be distributed for use by citizens. As a result, we decided that our end goal should be a paper-based sensor because it will allow for citizens to easily test their water, thus increasing their involvement in citizen science. The paper-based nature of our product requires that we work in cell-free, which offers many advantages over in vivo sensing. One such advantage is that while working in cell-free, we don’t"

INTRODUCTION
In the past iGEM competitions, human practice was always the vital and indispensable element.As a group of creators, we devoted ourselves to producing a practical and effective Bio machine.To achieve that tough goal, we need to not only spend a ton of time in the lab but also do something relative to the society which will be our target consumer and real beneficiary.Therefore, we took some actions .we designed the questionary and gave them out on the website and different communities to see whether people were interested in our project.To find out the existing questions among the sweeteners found already and to improve our project, we interview some relevant authoritative experts.Besides, market demand and trading policy are also significant for us to know about and that’s why we went and discussed with Sixin Wang, the chief engineer of SdicZhongluFruitJuiceCo., Ltd(the NO.1 company that focuses on producing concentrated apple juice) and some of the bosses in the COFCO (the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food suppliers in China ) right after we finished our original plan.In the later period, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to have a large scale conference to popularize iGEM and collected the critical advice so that we can be improved.On the final stage, we met the bosses of COFCO again and we were proudly encouraged by them and they believed that we were likely to be successful in the future market.
QUESTIONARY
During we were sending out the questionaries on the website and communities, we realized that different people prefer various flavors, but most of them still were the fans of sweetness which make people feel happy and warm. According to what we found,  there is an excellent opportunity  for us to research the sweet food.Prior to we design the specific plan, it is necessary for us to learn about the existing questions relevant to the sweeteners that have been observed already.
INTERVIEWING THE EXPERTS
After we interviewed the specialists who are famous in the food and sweeteners area, the current situation of sweeteners was getting clearer in our mind.Generally"

Recovery of DNA was low (12-30ng/uL). Never the less we tried to clone the Gel-Purified, dephosphorylated pSB1C-Backbone, which was a kind gift from iGEM Potsdam. Ligation was performed using Quick Ligase (NEB) with a Backbone:Insert Ration of 1:1 and 1:3. Subsequent transformation into ultracompetent DH5a-Cells and growth on Agar plates containing Chloramphenicol did not result in any colonies.
For direct cloning into pSB1C using tailed primers, we designed primers introducing XbaI to the 5’ end and SpeI to the 3’ end of the PCR Product. For forward primers two variations were designed to speed experiments up:

FW2: XbaI.T7.6NT GCCGCTTCTAGAGCGAATTAATACGACTCAC

Inserts were amplified using Phusion DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher) and cleaned up using ZymoClean™ PCR CleanUp-Columns (Zymo Research). Purified PCR products were digested using SpeI and XbaI for 1 hour (all restriction enzymes and Cutsmart Buffer were purchased by NEB).Following heat inactivation at 80°C for 20 minutes the PCR product was purified as described above. The pSB1C-Backbone was cut using the restriction enzymes SpeI and XbaI. To decrease the chance for re-ligation of the vector, we dephosphorylated the vector backbone using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (NEB). The digested and phosphorylated backbone plasmid was run on a 1% agarose gel and the aprox. 2.2kb band was cut and purified using the Gel Extraction ZymoClean Kit (Zymo Research).

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"crRNA] \end{split} \end{equation}
The total mRNA of the recombinase has two forms, $crRNA$ and $RNA\ duplex$, resulting in another equation: \begin{equation} [crRNA]+[RNA\ duplex]=[mRNA_{Cre}]. \end{equation} Then we have  \begin{equation} [RNA\ duplex]_{st}=[mRNA_{Cre}]\cdot\frac{[taRNA]}{K_m+[taRNA]}, \end{equation} where $K_m=\frac{k_{-2}}{k_2}$. So the protein production rate depends on not only the concentration of its corresponding mRNA but also the concentration of $taRNA$. This translation process with post-transcriptional control can be described by \begin{equation} \frac{d[Cre]}{dt}=K_{tl}\cdot [mRNA_{Cre}]\cdot\frac{[taRNA]}{K_m+[taRNA]}-K_{P}\cdot [Cre] \end{equation}
2.3 Processes related to AHL
In this section, we describe the 3OC6HSL synthesis,  degradation and regulation. 3OC6HSL, a kind of AHL, is enzymatically synthesised by LuxI proteins from some substrates. Here, we use AHL to refer to 3OC6HSL.
For simplicity, we assumed that the amount of substrates is sufficient so that the 3OC6HSL synthesis rate is proportional to the LuxI protein concentration.  And the degradation of 3OC6HSL can be divided into two parts. With the help of the AHL-degrading enzyme, AHL-lactonase (AiiA), the AHL can be degraded at a high rate, since the complex of AiiA and AHL is more easy to be degraded. Also, the AHL itself can be degraded at a lower rate.
Besides,  AHL can regulate gene expression by binding the protein LuxR.
The complex can activate luxpR promoter and repress luxpL promoter.
Although the binding events about AHL can be described by some differential equations, we apply QSSA when we focus on the gene expression process, because the timescale of these binding events is much less than the timescale of gene expression. So the change of AHL and AHL-LuxR complex over time can be described by differential equations: \begin{equation} \begin{split} &\frac{d[AHL]}{dt}=k_3\cdot"

Every seminar, we all aimed at one topic such as team building, connection the “Dry” and “Wet”. We have made great achievements and summary plenty of useful tips for new iGEM teams to learn and follow. Also，we attended the 6th China Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation Forum to interview some specialists about synthetic biology and our project.
(Talk with Team Chang Gung University )
A.Meet-up with iGEMers in Taiwan
Our team member Roderick paid a visit to Hsinchu in Taiwan in July 2015 for an academic exchange with iGEMers from NCTU. The agenda is about the talent education of NCTU-Formosa.
(Pose with Prof. Chen and Team NCTU-Formosa)
In the aspect of team building, we can learn much from the method practiced in NCTU-Formosa’s recruiting and selecting talents. Generally speaking, there are three steps in their team building.
1.Every fall semester, Department of Biology offers the course “Introduction to Synthetic Biology”. Before the course is open to the students, the professors will inform them of the knowledge and the iGEM to draw attention of the students.
2.At the beginning of the course, the class will be divided into many groups. The professors will teach the basic knowledge and practice of Synthetic Biology meanwhile the teaching assistants will teach the method of literatures searching and reading. During the course, the students will be required to read the former projects and present what they have learned.
3.At the end of the semester, every group will be asked to do a final report and present it. The format is that every group should put forward their creative idea and primary plan. Afterwards, some best students will be selected according to their academic performance.

Promoter design
For the rational design of a responsive promoter construct several preliminary considerations have to be done. The first question which needs to be addressed concerns the inducibility of the pathway of interest. Preceding experiments revealed that for VDR (vitamin D receptor) as well as for SREBP (sterol regulatory element binding protein), convenient conditions and treatments exist under which each pathway can be exclusively activated without killing the chassis, that is in our studies the transfected cells. For further reference about induction conditions refer to Material and Methods . After deciding what kind of TFBS is to be included appropriate consensus motives where TFs would presumably bind on had to be selected. Reliable consensus motives can be deduced from matrices provided in the TRANSFAC database. In case of several different binding matrices, we chose the longest motive which contains the most definite bases [19] . Focusing from now on only on VDR and SREBP we created the frequency distributions of the TFBS occurrence for both TFs based on HEARTBEAT (see Fig. 3 and 4). As mentioned above the basic assumption of our model is that most transcription factors exhibit a spatial preference for binding to the DNA which includes not only the binding sequence and the distance to the TSS but also the mutual distance between potential TF pairs. Based on this concept we specified distance of the pdf-maxima to the TSS for both VDR and SREBP. Subsequently the binding motive is embedded into the artificial promoter around the position where the majority of binding sites are located in natural promoters. With this idea we created first a series of synthetic promoters in which we differed only the number of binding motives positioned around the pdf-maxima. For all sequences designed for VDR, see HEARTBEAT_VDR.pdf . For all sequences designed for SREBP, see HEARTBEAT_SREBP.pdf .
With a second series of artificially designed promoter sequences we tried to answer to what extend further auxiliary TFBS affect the binding activity of VDR and SREBP. Therefore we plotted the frequencies of all TFBS which are co-occuring when VDR or SREBP is present in a natural promoter sequence as well (see Fig. 5 and 6). For SREBP ZF5 was also present with a relative frequency of 60%. In case of VDR, AP-2 co-exists in 48% and WT1 in 54%"

Public engagement
“Because science is prevalent in all facets of our lives, the science-society relationship is complex, and there are many ways to approach it. The relationship can be constructive, tension-filled, or everything in between. Interaction between interested stakeholders is critical to finding common ground on scientific issues affecting society. Public engagement can provide a constructive platform for public views to be combined with scientific expertise in decision-making contexts.”
AAAS – Center for Public Engagement with Science and Technology
Public engagement in science is a multifaceted issue comprising: education on ongoing research and its applications, open dialogue, and decision-making regarding policy, funding, and the application of new technologies. During our summer, we decided to focus on public education, and also had forays into deepening ongoing dialogue regarding synthetic biology.
IGEM.TODAY
At the beginning of our iGEM experience, we – like many other new iGEMmers – browsed the wikis of other teams to see what they had managed to develop. We found the availability of information and their stories exciting, but the density of information was often intimidating. In addition, the long form writing made them time consuming to read, and the focus on results often removed us from the experience the team had. We love the wiki format, and find that it’s a great way to learn about a project, when you really want to know everything, but we felt a need to address the wiki’s limitations. After all, someone from the public who wants to learn about synthetic biology will more likely want to learn about that team’s experience and have an overview of that team’s work before deciding to take a deep-dive into their project.
It was with this in mind that igem.today was born, forming the centerpiece of our human practices efforts. igem.today is a media platform dedicated to iGEM. Through this platform we hosted media from different iGEM groups, as well as surveys that we created and that were sent to us. Excitingly, we were able to post interviews and project descriptions for nearly one tenth of all iGEM teams, and reached over 2000 visitors in September alone! We participated in an incredible amount of dialog"

Characterization of Tec Chihuahua’s BioBricks
We characterized Tec Chihuahua’s BioBricks (T7 promoter + RBS) + (epsE) + (T1 terminator), which can be found here as a whole [BBa_K2471002], the individual parts being (BBa_K525998) + (BBa_K143032) + (BBa_B0010). This was a relevant collaboration that will allow the team to report an essential feature of their part. The collaboration developed as follows: On October 15th Tec Chihuahua shipped the BioBrick to us. They shared us protocols to characterized by SDS-PAGE. Once the results were obtained, they were shred with the team for their evaluation and report. The complete protocol including the results can be seen below. Tec Chihuahua Collaborations

Collaborations
We believe that collaboration leads to development of the innovation and its full acceptance and use. Therefore, we collaborated with two other iGEM teams: TU Delft and Groningen . During this process, we learned a lot about their projects and helped each other out with experiments and ideas. The beauty of this is that we got some valuable input from both teams. Here you will find more details of these two collaborations!
Delft
The team of TU Delft has been working on the creation of a biolaser in the form of a a biosilica-covered cell expressing fluorescent proteins. The biosilica-layer traps some of the photons sent out by fluorescent proteins that can be used to excite other fluorescent proteins. This leads to increased overall fluorescence intensity in the cells. We measured some of their strains in our plate reader.
During our own project we have worked with the microplate reader extensively. We tested eight different constructs in a"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html," and in Airens experiment the signal raised 28.6 ± 3.1 % respectively when compared to a reaction were RraA is not present ( Airen, 2011 ).
The reason for this effect is investigated in detail in Airen, 2011 . The shape of the fluorescence signal curve when RraA is present (green dots) indicates that the protein acts as stabilisator in our reaction. It is likely that by reducing RNase E activity, the rate of mRNA and rRNA degradation is slower.
If one is interested in obtaining high amounts of protein via CFPS, the addition of RraA – or similar positive effectors – is definitely recommended.
This experiment demonstrates how versatile CFPS can be. You can simply add an external molecule to the reaction and analyze its impact on protein yield. Although the reason why a substance is beneficial or disadvantageous may remain unclear, the experimenter has free access to the reaction. Less time is needed in this case when compared to in vivo optimization ( Sun et al. 2013 , Takahashi et al. 2015 ).
Positive Effector RraA – at a glance
We optimized our extract by adding RraA to the cell-free reaction. The protein is useful in CFPS because it can inhibit the RNase E activity in the extract, which thus leads to a final output signal that is about 33% higher. The coding sequence of RraA and a protein generator to produce His-tagged RraA has been send to the parts registry (Biobricks BBa_K1758120 and BBa_K1758122 , respectively). iGEM teams as well as labs that deal with E. coli cell-free protein synthesis have now the chance to use these biobricks for protein production optimization.
CFPS on Paper
As depicted above, we established a robust cell-free protein synthesis system for the production of sfGFP in our lab. The previous reactions were mostly performed in 364 well plates, so to test if our cell extract worked on paper we proceeded with using different papers as base for our reactions.
CFPS on Paper – Experimental Setup
We prepared various paper discs with a diameter of about 6 mm using a punch. The CFPS reactions were prepared according to protocols at 15 µL scale, and were then applied onto the paper. To keep track of the reaction, fluorescence signals were measured with Tecan plate reader as previously described.
We compared our CFPS setup with commercially available S30 T7 cell-free expression system. To do this, the manufactors protocol was scaled down from a"

one arrives at the well known Michaelis-Menten rate equation
\[ \nu =  \frac{\nu_{max} C_s}{K_m + C_s} \]
where \(K_m\) is an equilibrium concentration given by
\[\  K_m=\frac{k_{-1}+k_2}{k_1} \]
\(C_s\) is the substrate concentration and \( \nu_{max}\) is the maximum rate given by
\[ \nu_{max} = K_2 C_E(0)\]
It should be noted that of the two model parameters, while \(K_m\) is an intrinsic constant, \(\nu_{max}\)depends on the initial enzyme concentration \(C_E(0)\).
Since the rate of product formation \(\nu\), equals the rate of substrate consumption.  \[ \nu = \dfrac{d}{dt}C_p\ = -\dfrac{d}{dt}C_s \]  It can be seen from the equation that when  \[ C_s = K_m \qquad \text{      }\qquad \nu = \frac {1}{2} \nu_{max} \]

Abstract: “Our project aims to design a genetic device able to count and memorize the occurrences of an input signal. We achieved this by utilization of auto-inducing loops, that act as memory units, and an engineered riboregulator, acting as an AND gate. The design of the device is modular, allowing free change of both input and output signals. Each increase of the counter results in a different output signal. The design allows implementation of any number of memory units, as the AND gate design enables to extend the system in a hassle-free way. In order to tweak bistable autoinducing loops we need a very fast and robust method for characterizing parts. For this we have created a genetic algorithm that will enable us to find parameters of the parts used in the design. It also allows the combination of data from multiple experiments across models with overlapping components.”

Abstract: 'Essencia coli' is a vanillin producing bacterium equipped with a control system that keeps the concentration of vanillin at a constant level. The showpiece of the project is the feedback mechanism. Vanillin synthesis is initiated by irradiation with blue light. The preferred concentration can be modulated using the intensity of that light. At the same time the bacterium measures the amount of vanillin outside the cell and controls its production to maintain the set point. The designed system is universal in nature and has therefore potential benefits in different areas. The concept can easily be applied to other flavours and odours. In fact, any application that requires a constant concentration of a molecular substance is possible.

After normalizing on coppers influence to the cell extract these differences were even more obvious.
To summarize
Our copper sensors in vivo data show that detection of different copper concentrations is possible. The fluorescence levels differ clearly between different induction concentrations. As shown above higher copper concentration, higher the fluorescence signal. Therefore the concept of our sensor is functional even if the concentration needed for induction are to high to reach sensitively concerning the WHO guidelines for copper. Our sensor has been tested in vitro as well. For copper we tested our original CopAP construct without a T7 promoter in front of the inducible at first.  After realizing that the sensor shows the right tendencies but the general fluorescence is quite low we created an inducible promoter under the control of a T7 promoter to use in CFPS. Fluorescence levels of this device showed the same tendencies as the one without but were higher fluorescence’s, which helps detecting it.

Lead
Lead is one of the most frequently used metals. Therefore, lead is found in many different parts of the environment (World Health Organization (WHO): Fact sheet number 379, Lead poisoning and health). The contamination of drinking water is often caused by obstructed pipes. Long time absorption leads to adverse health effects in most organs in the body (EPA Health Effects: How Lead Affects the body). The main targets are the nervous system, brain and liver. These damages can finally cause death. The World Health Organization recommends a limit of 10 µg of lead in 1 litre drinking water (WHO: Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, fourth edition (2015)).
