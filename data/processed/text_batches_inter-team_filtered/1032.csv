Changing ZF binding site
We are trying to use MAGE, but the palindromic structure of the weak promoter gave the oligos ridiculous secondary structure, so we don't expect this to work. Instead, we are going to use lambda red to switch out the current kan-ZFB construct in the cells with a new construct containing a tetracycline antibiotic cassette and ZF binding site. By tying the ZFB change to cell survival, we hope to have greater efficiency.

Phosphatase of newest cut backbone
We used the following recipe to perform a phosphatase reaction on the backbone we cut yesterday with Bsa1 and Xba1:
45 ul DNA
1 ul phosphatase
5.1 ul buffer
We ran the reaction for an hour and heat inactivated the enzyme at 65* for 20 minutes. We then performed a PCR clean up on the product, with a yield of 52.6 ng/ul.
Ligation of CB bottom and library
We used the following recipe for the ligation with the insert:

Description
Inspired by the Georgia Tech zinc biosensor, the Lambert High School iGEM Team studied protein degradation to enhance the development of modern biosensors. Today, biosensors are complex biological systems that provide a more reliable and affordable alternative to expensive diagnostic tests. However, in many biosensors, the overexpression of one pigment over another can result in inaccurate readings and subsequently faulty diagnosis.For example, in the hypothetical biosensor X, the system is designed such that it will express purple when the concentration of X is less than 4ùûµM, orange when the concentration of X is between 4ùûµM and 6ùûµM, and red when the concentration of X is between 6ùûµM and 10ùûµM. However, due to leakiness that may exist in the system or fluctuations in the affinities of the biosensing promoters, the purple reporter is overexpressed, as evident by the figure the below.
To address this issue, the Lambert iGEM Team devised a ‚Äúswitch‚Äù - a genetically engineered construct that degrades SsrA-tagged proteins upon induction by IPTG. Ultimately, our main goal was to quantify the relative strength of degradation and subsequently further characterize a known protease system.
In bacterial cells, SsrA is a monocistronic gene that codes for a specialized strand of RNA known as tmRNA; tmRNA is responsible for rescuing ribosomes from abnormally truncated mRNA templates that lack terminator codons.
This process is the SsrA-tagged degradation pathway, whereby tmRNA binds with the ribosome and cotranslationally adds a degradation tag to the defective mRNA strand, hence marking the nascent polypeptide for degradation. (Tao et. al., 2015) In effect, this degradation tag, called the SsrA tag, serves as protein quality control in the cell by preventing the accumulation of aberrant and incomplete proteins. (Keiler et. al., 1996) These tagged proteins are then transported to some protease by a bacterial adaptor. In E. coli cells, SspB is the bacterial adapter that transports tagged proteins to the ClpXP protease. Because this pathway is the most common form of proteolysis in prokaryotes, we decided to exploit this pathway to control the"

Part I ‚Äì Alkane Degradation
First and foremost the organism will have to be able to degrade oil. Oil consists of various hydrocarbon types and sizes, and for this challenge we decided to start with alkanes. There are a number of microorganisms that are known to degrade alkanes, and of these, genes from three different organisms will be used for the conversion of short chain alkanes, long chain alkanes and long chain alcohols and aldehydes, the latter two being intermediates of the long chain alkane degradation pathway. For the further degradation we will rely on the in-house genes of E.coli such as the Œ≤-oxidation pathway.
Read more about Alkane Degradation .
Part II ‚Äì Sensing
In order to have efficient cell growth, it is important to develop a system that activates gene expression at the optimal moment in time. An alkane sensing mechanisms described in literature will be adapted and incorporated using the BioBrick¬Æ format. This system will be coupled to the ‚Äòin‚Äêhouse‚Äô catabolic repression system (crp) generating energy efficient cell growth under glucose conditions as well as produce enzymes for hydrocarbon degradation when needed.
Read more about Sensing .
Part III ‚Äì Survival
Hydrocarbons and salts in too high concentrations are known to be toxic to cells. It was found that organisms that are naturally hydrocarbon tolerant produce chaperones that maintain the cellular activity. There are also numerous organisms that can live in salty environments. By using genes from these organisms we hope to create BioBricks¬Æ that will facilitate salt tolerance as well as hydrocarbon tolerance.
Read more about Survival .
Part IV - Solubility
Oil and water don‚Äôt mix; the low solubility of hydrocarbons in water very likely could form a challenge for a hydrocarbon-degrading organism. To overcome this challenge a BioBrick¬Æ will be made containing genes encoding for an emulsifier that will increase the solubility.
Read more about Solubility .
In summary, this approach will enable efficient hydrocarbon utilization under non-standard conditions. The chassis, in the form or BioBricks¬Æ, will facilitate the construction of strains with sustainable applications in the fossil fuel industry.

These were all digested at 37 degrees C for 10 hours, heatshocked at 80 degress C for 10 mins, and then held at 4 degrees C using the thermal cycler.  The amounts of DNA included in each reaction were calculated precisely based upon concentration of the miniprep and the desired amount of DNA to give a molar ratio of 3:1 for insert to vector (thus, the mass of each part was normalized to its length).  These calculations are included on a spreadsheet.

Need to run a gel of restriction digest products from last night, with the hope of extracting the results.  Took a picture of the gel.  Saw clear bands around 2000-3000 for the activator parts, which is expected.  Cut these out of the gel.  Also saw a distinct band for the PSB1AK3 restriction digest slightly larger than 3000.  This corresponds to the known length of this plasmid of 3189 bp.  Did not see bands for either mZifA or mGliA, though this could simply be due to the fact that the gel was not run long enough to show resolution for pieces of DNA as small as these (318 bp and 422 bp, respectively).  Attempted to re-run the remaining gel after extracting the other parts, but this did not show any results.  Will thus have to redo these restriction digests, as all 30 uL from last night's reaction were run on the gel.

After plasmid purification (102.1ng/ŒºL) I sent it to sequencing, And its sequencing results were also correct. Secondly, I purified plasmid of BS-yxjA with BBa_P0440 and BBa_P0412 (52.4 ng/ŒºL, 78.4 ng/ŒºL) and I digested BBa_R0010 with EcoRI and SpeI as well as  BS-yxjA- P0440 with XbaI and PstI and ligated them in pSB1A3. I transformed ligation products into DH5Œ± cell cultured overnight then I picked up colony from the plates and checked inserted parts by PCR and cultured the correct strain(Fig.11). After plasmid purification (102.1 ng/ŒºL) I sent it to sequencing, And its sequencing results was also correct. Secondly, I design three primers that can bind to the middle of BBa_K215108. And sent these primers to sequence BBa_K215108. Then I got the correct sequencing results of the whole sequence of BBa_K215108. In addition, I tried to use PCR to add NehI restriction site on the both side of Chitinase A and B (BBa_K1913000, BBa_K1913001). The annealing temperature of both reaction were 63‚ÑÉ. Only ChiA had been amplified, but for ChiB it still could be amplified, even if I tried to used different annealing temperature or DNA polymerase. Then I digested ChiA and BBa_K215001 with NehI 1 hour, and ligate them for 2 hours. Then I transformed it into DH5Œ± cell cultured overnight I picked up colony from the plates and checked inserted parts by PCR and cultured the correct strain(Fig.12).

Expression without Cloning!
A key advantage of cell-free systems is that they allow expression directly from linear amplified DNA rather than from a bacterial plasmid. This enabled our overall part design scheme of  IDT synthesized G-blocks containing each of our AMPs between our desired 5‚ÄôUTR and Terminator, allowing us to express these AMPs after a single round of PCR with overhanging primers containing promoter regions. This schema allowed us to test numerous AMPs as well as GFP and methionine aminopeptidase under the control of two promoters without having to go through the time consuming process of cloning a bacterial plasmid for each expression construct.
This allows for an extremely iterative design process where a part can be conceived of, a G-block synthesized, a PCR amplification performed, and a part tested in a cell-free expression system within a matter of two weeks.
Experimental Plans
We set out to answer key questions concerning what level of complexity of AMP could be produced in our cell-free system. We also wanted to discover whether or not we could rescue AMP function through treatment with methionine aminopeptidase in the case where a non-canonical N-terminal methionine was added to the peptide as a start codon for expression. AMP effectivity is gauged via bacterial killing effectivity measured by OD600 growth curves or various other assays. Our experimental design would then be to test our panel of AMPs across promoters and in the presence or absence of methionine aminopeptidase also produced via cell-free reactions. Pardee 2016 reported that the AMPs that they produced in cell-free reactions were equally viable in purified and unpurified form, therefore purification was a step that we avoided in order to create a streamlined workflow directly from synthesis to amplification to expression to characterization.

Unfortunately, no band was observed that corresponds to the dxCas9 fragment in pACYCDuet-1_Linker-Tn5. Also, no band was observed that indicates integration of Tn5-Lin into pACYCDuet. The bands are at the same height as the positive control pACYCDuet-1, meaning that no insertion has taken place.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

This includes the ‚Äú6th CeBiTec Pupil a number ofs Academy‚Äù, ‚ÄúTeutolab Biotechnology‚Äù, the street science festival ‚ÄúGENIALE‚Äù and through collaboration with the biotechnological student‚Äôs initiative btS e.V.
Best Measurement
Our toolbox for the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids provides innovative new methods for the characterization of all protein encoding parts. With the help of non-canonical amino acids, the subcellular localization of a protein can be investigated. Measurement of intramolecular distances, protein immobilization light regulations and modification enables sophisticated characterizations of parts.

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Results#Scaffold_-_-_TEXT.html," Although there are many variables which need to be optimized, there was cleavage of the scaffold seen most distinctly in wells with WT PUF-PIN and when both proteins, WT & 6-2/7-2, were present. There does not seem to be much activity of the 6-2/7-2 PUF-PIN protein (as seen in well 3 & 7), but that could be attributed to the fact that WT PUF-PIN was present in 6 fold greater concentration. The high background and speckles across the gel were most likely due to fiber particles falling off the paper towel used to clean the glass slides for casting the gel. It also seems that, contrary to literature, MgCl2 proved to work better than MnCl2 as ions for the endonuclease due to 6-2/7-2 PUF-PIN showing better cleavage in lane 7 than lane 3. Further optimized endonuclease assays with equal protein concentrations and MgCl2 will be ran to prove PUF binding specificity due to the present data not allowing for such a conclusive statement to be made.
The endonuclease assay in Fig. 7 showed promising results of specific PUF binding. There was cleavage of the scaffold seen most distinctly in wells with WT PUF-PIN and when both proteins, WT & 6-2/7-2, were present. 6-2/7-2 PUF-PIN showed equal efficacy in cleavage, yet there was smearing of RNA which might suggest unspecific cleavage and 6-2/7-2 PUF binding. From this observed effect, it could be said that certain derivatives of PUF are more specific to their designated binding sequence than others. In order to make this a more conclusive assay, a negative control such as the non-specific endonuclease (PIN) by itself  should be used as comparison to endonucleases bound to PUF. However, due to the endonuclease being non-specific and data showing presence of single bands, not smears, it can be said that PUF provides specificity to these otherwise non-specific endonucleases and specifically binds RNA.

We made a lecture of 4 hours on molecular biology and synthetic biology. For students to easily understand, we effectively utilized visual materials, for example CGs that was broadcasted by NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation). We also had a discussion time with students. It was an exciting seminar.
The contents of the lecture are below:
„ÉªAbout GFP ( its contributions to biology by visualizing molecules and cells. Hot topic of 2008 Nobel Prize )
„Éªbasics of molecular cell biology (about DNA, the central dogma, etc)
„Éªan introduction to Synthetic Biology
Open-source project of Our Research
In addition to the iGEM official Wiki, we built an official Website in Japanese. This is caused by an idea, open-source of our experiments. We assure you that this leads to scientific development by abandoning intellectual property rights as possible and offering information quickly to many researchers.
This weblog carries possible every contents on our experimental notebooks. This open-source enabled us to deepen exchange between internal and other teams and have information in common. Besides, we became be able to search quickly past experiments and take part in an active discussion on the web.
Writing and Handing out the Journal for Young Researchers
With Tokyo-Metropolitan,We write articles on iGEM in the journal ‚Äúin-cube"", which is published by Leaveanest, a sponsor for UT-Tokyo and hand out them to students. This journal is the free paper for many people; undergraduate, graduate students, and young researchers. We placed the introduction of iGEM and outlines of internal teams‚Äô projects here.  To carry these timely articles in this journal will lead to raising our profiles, and we expect a lot of outstanding students to join us in the near future.(We‚Äôll continue these activities.)

iGEM-Team FAU_Erlangen
For the Erlangen - Team we translated a text into Austrian dialect. They used this text as subtitle for their project video on youtube. Therefore, they sent us a text in English and we translated the text into Austrian-German. In addition, they implanted an Easter egg of our team into this video. (Perhaps you will find it)
Austrian Slang Translation
Original Text: Life itself depends on a huge variety of enzymatically catalyzed reactions. For example, in your liver, multiple enzymes break down the polysaccharide glycogen into its better processable subunit glucose-6-phosphate, which acts as an essential energy source in the body.
In general enzyme cascades can be imagined as various process steps in a company. Think of every enzyme as an employee in an office. When an order is placed, a chain of process steps is triggered, leading to the eventual fulfillment of the order. The first employee fulfills his task and then passes the order on to the next employee in the process chain, who passes it on to the next and the next‚Ä¶ and the next‚Ä¶
Unfortunately, the office layout is not optimized and we have long pathways between the different office rooms. This leads to significant delays.

Thus, the cleaving system goes to work and         the bad Cholerae die! (To know more on our system mechanism, please visit our project mechanism page.) Once the         Cholerae and its presence-sensing-signal died out, the probiotics return back to [mode 0] and stop releasing         phages.
POPULATION LEVEL SIMULATION
We use GRO - The cell programming language, a shareware developed by The Klavins Lab at the University of Washington.
Green population := the probiotics (at time 0, population = 36)
Black population := the pathogens (V. Cholerae) (throughout the simulation, population = 36)
Blue signal := signal emitted by the pathogens, indicating its presence (at time 0, population = 15)
Pink signal := the phages emitted by the probiotics, carrying the CRISPR plasmid
POPULATION LEVEL RESULT
The delay in signal disappearance indicates the significance of choosing appropriate phages        for the delivery system with appropriate speed, effectiveness, specificity, and degradation rate.

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#testing#project#hprac#1_-_-_TEXT.html," expression patterns of this engineered pathway? Will it interfere with other functions of the cells? Functionality can be altered depending on the position of the construct within the chromosome. This is our first forthcoming research priority: determining any potential adverse effects of chromosomal integration, carrying it out, and thoroughly testing the functionality of our new engineered strains.
Competition & Biodiversity
A second concern is that engineered strains could possibly outcompete wild-type species in the environment and pose a threat to biodiversity. Our first line of defense against this possibility is physical containment: the inlet and outlet of our current prototype are equipped with 0.2 ¬µm filters, effectively eliminating the possibility that our engineered strains may interact with natural organisms. However, imagine that there could be a mechanical error: physical breakage of the device, slight discrepancies in filter pore sizes, et cetera, that could leave a slim possibility that our strains could come into contact with natural species. What then?
To answer this question, we return to the altered physiology of our strains: the primary distinguishing characteristic to note is that the cells cannot carry out the wild-type levels of anaerobic respiration unless they are induced. This means that in situations where oxygen availability is limiting, and toxins are not highly prevalent, our strains are less able to compete than wild-type Shewanella; this is our second line of defense. S. oneidensis is native to freshwater ecosystems in our area, so our strains should not be disruptive to biodiversity. In addition, we have observed that inserting the nah operon into cells seems to significantly increase their doubling time, so our salicylate reporter strains would be even less able to compete than our arsenic reporters.
However, what happens in the case that oxygen availability is not limiting? It is probable that our current engineered strains would be able to survive and thrive in aerobic conditions, and live alongside wild-type Shewanella. We need a third line of defense for this situation, a modification that would prevent our strains from being able to survive outside of our physical device. For this, we propose auxotrophy: in a truly field-deployable device, we would use a strain that had a gene for a key metabolite knocked out, so that the strain would rely upon supplementation of this nutrient in order to survive. We would then supplement this metabolite inside of the device, so that our strains would function properly within our device. If the bacteria were to somehow escape, their functionality would be severely impaired by the lack of nutritional supplementation, and they would be quickly outcompeted by wild-type strains.
This brings to the table a second research priority"

Synthetic Biology at UCLA
Synthetic biology is the creation and manipulation of living organisms to accomplish a defined task.  The principles of engineering and biology have converged to form its basis. As a unique and emerging multidisciplinary field, there is incredible scope for education and advancement.
Through a vast field, synthetic biology has taken roots at undergraduate institutions around the world  in the form of a competition: International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM). iGEM offers undergraduates  the opportunity to conduct original research, design new biological systems, and share those results with a  community of schools, laboratories, research institutes, and industries. The iGEM community looks to help in advancing the developing field of synthetic biology with the goal of fostering scientific research and education among undergraduate students.
As members of UCLA's Synthetic Biology Club and iGEM team, we are excited to see where the field of synthetic biology, and the iGEM competition, can take us!

We collaborate with Team NJU-China for help of part construction. Though we have achieved tangible results of antibody responses, the lab in the Center for Disease Control does not provide additional Biobrick parts construction due to the Chinese laws. Plus, we didn‚Äôt receive the official kit until early September. So we turned to Team NJU-China for help. After the discussion about the project, we decided to use psb1c3 as the Biobrick assembly plasmid. In addition, they helped us to design and build the primer of our parts as follows:
Moreover, they let us use their facilities and labs for further experiments. Without them, Biobrick parts could never be constructed."

Additionally, quorum sensing factors play a role in activating bacterial responses such as biofilm production and food rot.  Biofilm production can contribute to pathogenicity of bacteria by the formation of safe and nutrient-rich havens for bacteria populations to grow.   Biofilms are made up of a hydrated matrix of polypeptides, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids that serve as a protective barrier and microenvironment for microbes (Nijland et al., 2010).  In order to study how to inhibit these pathogenic effects of quorum sensing, we utilized a system that would respond to quorum signals and was safe to work with, as an alternative to pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, we characterized the model quorum sensing system of Aliivibrio fischeri (VF), which luminesces in response to AHLs.
VF is a gram-negative bacteria that is a biological model for both quorum sensing and bioluminescence research. This rod-shaped bacteria participates in symbiotic relationships with various marine organisms, most notably the bobtail squid. The squid hosts the VF in an internal light organ and utilizes the light emitted by the bacteria to hide its shadow in shallow waters, therefore avoiding potential predators.  We decided to use VF WH1 strain as our model organism because it has a LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing system that it uses to detect the concentration of AHLs and it responds with luminescence at a visible wavelength when the threshold level of AHLs is reached.
When LuxR detects AHLs, it activates the rest of the Lux operon. The Lux operon (below) consists of five essential genes: LuxA, LuxB, LuxC, LuxD, and LuxE.
LuxC, LuxD, and Lux E form the fatty acid reductase enzyme complex that synthesizes fatty acid aldehydes with acyl-CoA as the starting substrate. The three gene products form a complex conglomerate (below) to increase kinetic efficiency.
LuxA and LuxB form a dimer that reduces O2 while oxidizing the aldehyde and FMNH2. This oxidation produces the blue-green light (~490nm). Another representation of the overall reaction is shown below:
Additionally, it has been shown that the LuxG gene product increases brightness by functioning as a flavin reductase (Nijvipakul et al., "

Plug 'n' Play Assembly Standard and BioBricks
We believe that the restriction-enzyme based assembly methods have too many drawbacks for creating advanced synthetic biology - especially in higher eukaryotes as mammals and fungi. Therefore, we have developed a novel assembly standard called Plug 'n' Play  with DNA based on uracil-specific excision reagent cloning. The Plug 'n' Play assembly standard allows construction and customization of multi-part devices fast and easy.
In combination with our new assembly standard, we introduce a novel approach for the principal of BioBricks. Our vision is that each iGEM team receives a kit containing ready to use PCR products of every single BioBrick. These BioBricks are ready for assembly by just performing a USER enzyme reaction and subsequently a traditional E. coli transformation. Hereby, the cumbersome process with restriction enzymes and ligases is avoided. This further allows time to be spent on creating innovative ideas within synthetic biology, leaving more time for characterization of BioBricks and creating innovative Genetically Engineered Machines.
The Plug 'n' Play  with DNA kit contains pre-produced PCR products and back-up plasmids for each part in the kit. So far the Plug 'n' Play  with DNA kit contains 50 BioBricks and 21 plasmids for mammalian cells and Aspergilli.
How it works
PCR products are first mixed together with USER enzyme. The USER enzyme generates a single nucleotide gap at the location of the uracil in the PCR product thereby generating a 8-9 bp long complementary overhang. These overhangs can anneal each other to form a stable hybridization product. The nicks in the assembled plasmid are repaired by E. coli.
As proof of concept of our assembly standard, we designed a reporter system for Aspergillus nidulans and mammalian cells. The figure shows an example of"

Fig.4 Highly specific recognition and covalent conjugation with Spychatcher and Spytag.
We used this feature of Spytag and Spycatcher to design a handy tool for protein purification. In the magnetic bacterium AMB-1, Spycatcher-Mms13 fusion protein is expressed and the Mms13 part can tightly associate with the Magnetosome. As a result, the Spycatcher in the fusion protein is anchored in the Magnetosome, which can be isolated from AMB-1 bacterial through sonication and centrifugation. Due to fast growing and easy genetic engineering of E. coli we utilize it to produce recombinant proteins of interest with a Spytag at either the N- or C- terminus. To easily release a captured recombinant protein, we add a cleaving site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease between the protein of interest and Spytag. Now the isolated magnetosome linked by Spycatcher can be used to specifically bind to the Spytag tagged recombinant protein in bacterial lysate of E. coli. After Spytag and Spycatcher form an irreversible covalent bond via spontaneous isopeptide linkage, they can be brought down together with the Magnetosome in a magnetic field. Extensive and stringent washing can be applied to remove proteins of nonspecific binding and the protein of interest can be released by cleavage of TEV protease.
Fig.5 Steps to purify protein in a new way
One caveat in the design above is that the TEV protease is still present in the final elution of the recombinant protein. The following two strategies can be used to circumvent this problem.
First, in the design shown above, we can express a TEV protease-Mms13 fusion protein in AMB-1; thus, the TEV protease can be easily removed after it fulfills its task. Second, we can use a self-cleavable sequence, intein, to replace the TEV site. In this case, the recombinant protein can be released by DTT(DL-Dithiothreitol)-mediated cleavage.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," still unknown. What's more, a protein in MoDeL may have different protein chains and it is more complex to determine the overall rate. In the demo database, we assume all proteins with no parts in bound state have a uniform degradation rate. Proteins with more than one chains are considered stable and non-degradable. This idea could be applied easily by writing reaction templates in MoDeL format. The reactant is a general species template with only one substituent-type part (ANYUB) of type ForwardProtein (no reverse reactions happened here). It is similar for degradation of mRNA molecules. Only mRNAs with single chain degrades at the same rate.
For reactions of dilution due to reproduction of cells, quantities of species decrease in a similar way to degradation. The rate of dilution is also similar to the reproduction rate of E.coli:
<math>k_{g}(1-C_{E.coli}/C_{max})C_{species}V_{Flask}</math>
where we only replace the second <math>C_{E.coli}</math> with concentration of species in dilution. To apply this idea, we only need to construct a species with only one substituent-type part (ANY) of no specific type and it will be matched to all species. Among them, only species bound in compartment E.coli will be diluted.
Replication of plasmid DNAs is not as easy as reproduction of living cells in two aspects: first, plasmid backbone with the same replication origin could be found in many species in the system because the original transformed plasmid backbone may bind with other compounds or proteins to form complex; second, the replication of original transformed plasmid DNA molecule tends to be repressed by all species including the same replication origin. However, E.coli cells do not have any effects on the reproduction of other E.coli cells. MoDeL language perfectly support this idea by separating the template reaction into replications and repressions. The first part describes the exponential amplification of plasmids with reaction rate <math>k_{g}C_{plasmid}V_{E.coli}</math>, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the replication rate of a certain plasmid, <math>C_{plasmid}</math> is the concentration of this plasmid, and <math>V_{E.coli}</math> is the volume of E.coli cell. The product may be different from the reactant. It is possible because the reactant may be a complex, such as complex of LacI tetramer and plasm"

CoCHR is the channelrodopsin in transgenic AWA. In order to express CoCHR in AWA specifically, we express CoCHR through the linkage to the AWA cell-specific promoter odr-10. Thus, when we shed ~470nm excitation light to transgenic C.elegans, the activated AWA is able to cause obvious response such as body swimming towards. While wild-type C.elegans not behave abnormally under the same stimulation. Whether the certain neuron is activated or not is indicated by GEM-GECO, a calcium indicator. In short, we established a light-sensed AWA controlling system, so as to utilize this part to manipulate the activation of AWA, establish the response to input stimulation. The merit of CoCHR is its sensitivity to light which is five-times than formal ChR2. Thus, the low intensity requirement prevents the cross-activation of Crimson(Chlamydomonas noctigama channelrhodopsin). Chrimson is another integrated channelrhodopsin in AWB. (Moreover, in order to indicate where the target neurons are. We also construct a fusion reporter protein called mCherry. At the same time, the fusion protein is allowed to estimate the expression level of CoCHR.)

Universal mCherry coding sequence of three introns for capacity of expression in C.elegans. MCherry is a commonly used reporter. Since ordinary mCherry may not have high expression in C.elegans, artificial introns are inserted in the constructed plasmid [2] . We can obtain ord-10::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::mCherry transgenic offsprings microinjection. MCherry driven by promoter ord-10(Part:BBa_K2492004) indicates the position of neuron AWA. Moreover the fluorescence of mCherry aids the imaging for the neuron AWA pattern. The intensity of fluorescence reveals the expression level approximately.

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"To expand the idea further and to make the system more universal, a level of modularity was desired, therefore the production organism should be interchangeable. Different species of microorganisms relevant to the field of industrial biotechnology was therefore be made compatible with the system. In this way, the system becomes more flexible and the organism best suited to produce the desired product can be applied.
Lab scale to large scale
Moving from a lab setting into a large-scale industrial process is a long road to say the least. To help us consider the possible issues that may arise with a future scale-up of our project idea, we consulted several experts within the field of industrial biotechnology and microalgal research. Carl Johan Franz√©n, associate professor at the biology and biological engineering, and industrial biotechnology departments at Chalmers university, provided insight into some of the technical issues that might arise. Dr. Eva Albers and Dr. Joshua Mayers, researchers at the biology and biological engineering, and industrial biotechnology departments at Chalmers university of technology with focus on algal biotechnology, provided great insight into some of the considerations needed for large scale cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms.
One of the main technical issues discussed were product separation which would increase in cost due to the lower cultivation density resulting from a photosynthesis based system. The increased cost may however be offset by the absence of cost for a sugar source for the production organisms. To study this further a more complete life cycle analysis is needed to evaluate the cost offset this will result in. This should be one of the main tasks for a continuation of the project to see if the resulting system would could be commercially viable.
The issue of product separation is also related to the problem of water use, since cyanobacteria do require large amounts of water to grow. Since freshwater is also a limited resource on our planet a saltwater living strain may be the better choice for a photosynthesis based culture system. The use of seawater does however bring with it other problems such as salinity and contamination risks and might not be a good choice for a co-culture system specifically, but may be suitable for general culture of phototrophic microorganisms. Since photosynthetic organisms require sunlight for conversion of CO2 into more complex carbon sources, the day-night cycle also becomes an issue. The flow of carbon will decrease or cease completely during nighttime unless artificial light is used. Due to the cost of energy, using artificial light for a large scale cultivation system is not viable.
To achieve a productivity level that is as high as possible increased levels of CO2 is also needed. The co-culture system itself could provide this since"

Doctors‚Äô View on Current Situation
Lung Cancer
‚óè Early diagnosis is vital for lung cancer patients as only detection and surgery in the early stage can hold the possibility of cure. However, 2/3 of the patients are diagnosed too late and have already lost the chance of being cured. These un-surgery cases can be called as advanced lung cancer.
‚óè Now numerous people blame the cause of lung cancer on environmental problems, but even in a good environment condition, the incidence of lung cancer is equally high. To some extent, it can be said that the leading cause of lung cancer is smoking.
‚óè According to statistics of 2012, incidence of lung cancer has now made top of all cancer incidence in China, especially for male. Obvious correlation can be observed between smoking and lung cancer. And terribly, lung cancer maintains high mortality rate. The five-year survival rate of clinical lung cancer (i.e., the probability of the patients who still alive five years after diagnosis.) is approximately zero.
‚óè Lung cancer patients stand for unbearable and excruciating pressure both physically and psychologically. There are also some severe complications along with lung cancer, resulting in plummeted life quality after the illness. For example, advanced patients may experience struggle when breathing, chest tightness, persistent cough, and that lung cancer can also be transferred to all other parts of the body, such as brain, bones, causing severe pain, intracranial hypertension, weakness and other symptoms.
Current Treating Situation
‚óè There are 3 main treatments for advanced lung cancer: chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy.
‚óè Before targeted drug therapy, advanced lung cancer patients have an average survival period that is no more than one year, and that with other means of therapy (e.g. Radiotherapy), the period can be extended for only 2 to 3 months. Chemotherapy certainly lead to a plummet of life quality of patients. Finally, most patients lose confidence and Survival consciousness during their cure.
Figure 5. Interview with doctor
Doctors‚Äô view on the 4 treatments
‚óè In the past few decades, molecular targeting drugs visibly elongated the patient's survival periods and improve the disease control. Recently, the so-called ""four carriages"" of cancer treatment are surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and molecular targeting drugs.
‚óè Among the treatments of lung cancer, surgery is generally practiced on early patients. The early diagnosis rate of lung cancer, however, is relatively limited because all tumors had no specific symptoms at early stage. Therefore, rate of patients who are able to be performed surgery also take a minor part. To make matters worse, cancer"

We were using 1510 V and 1 ¬µl DNA for transformation. The DNA was just added to the cells and gently mixed by stirring it with the pipette tip. The protocol used was the one from Andrea Meyer. Of the 1 ml SOC culture, 50 ¬µl were spread out directly on Agar plates. Rest was spun down (2000 rpm, 1 min) and pellet was resuspended in 100 to 150 ¬µl. Subsequently, 50 ¬µl were spread out.

Week 1: May 12 - 16
This week we spent most of our time doing a literature search on potential systems to recognize DNA sequences. One potential system included homologous recombination - homologous sequences being a) the PCR-amplified target pathogen DNA and b) a specific region of genomic (or plasmid) DNA; homologous recombination would activate a genetic circuit leading to expression of a reporter. The other potential system would be via cis-repressed mRNA - mRNA would become ‚Äòreadable‚Äô (i.e. repression would be released) upon hybridization with the complementary target pathogen DNA sequence. We also looked at potential promoters for B. subtilis that are repressible, as well as  potential reporters, such as chromoproteins and enzymes which produce coloured products, to use in our reporter system.
We were also able to clone several iGEM registry parts (RFP, eCFP, GFP, YFP, pTetR, pLacI, RBS, RFP-generator, and a ‚Äòdouble terminator‚Äô). RFP, eCFP, GFP and YFP were cloned to be used as reporters. The pTetR and pLacI were cloned to be later used as binding sites for our reporter system.

Helps to preserve marine ecosystems that play a significant role in our effort to restore our planet's climate and mitigate the environmental impact of the human activity-pharmaceutical consumption.
Biotic Blue is an innovative solution with high added value that contributes to decoupling pharmaceutical consumption, an indicator of economic growth, from environmental deterioration.
By having lower energy needs than the competitive solutions, Biotic Blue contributes to more efficient energy usage.
Biotic Blue is an environmentally sound technology derived from a developed country and can be transferred and diffused to developing countries in order to counter the emerging problem of aquatic pharmaceutical pollution.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," this, was through education. So, in     collaboration with ScienceLinX, we organized a day at the     betafaculty. On this day 115 high school students came to visit us     at the campus to learn about our project and about synthetic     biology. We did not only invite students with an affinity for     biology, but all kinds of students. We did this because we strongly     believe in the cooperation between fields to make projects stronger     and to provide a fresh view on problems.
The students and chaperoning teachers attended a lecture in     which they learned the basics of synthetic biology, followed by a     lecture about our own project. Herein we stressed the fact that we     are a very diverse team and that students with almost every     background can contribute to the iGEM competition. The discussions     following this lecture did not only prove the interest that the     students showed in the project, but were also very helpful to us.     These lectures pushed us to explain our project as clearly as     possible, while still including enough detail to stay true to the     complexity of the project.
In addition to the theoretical lectures, we gave the students some     experience in a real lab. Because we only had one hour in the lab,     we decided to do some bio-art. This would teach them how to     work with an inoculation loop and agar plate and to give them nice     visualisation of lab work with bacteria. Dr Jan Kiel kindly     provided us with different coloured micro organisms. Because we     worked with different strains that had no antibiotic resistance, we     taught the students how to work sterile, by using a flame.
Besides these general educational activities, we wanted to go a     little more in depth with some of the students. Therefore we     invited some high school students to do their practical work for     their high-school thesis, and learn some basic cloning techniques.     Because we only had a few days, we could not go through the entire     process of bio-encryption. But they had some interesting sub     questions we could answer. A few students were interested in which     organism to use. To investigate this we cloned sfGFP in both Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. We found that E. coli was     harder to work with, because it does not have natural competence.     Both E. coli and B. subtilis showed fluorescence, which means that     the students succeeded in their first cloning!

Improved gene circuit
I Introduction
¬†¬†¬†¬†As stated in the Orthogonality test in experiment part, we failed to find the orthogonal gene circuit of the two warriors. We can just determine part of the two warriors as follows (Fig.1). From the experimental results(See details at Orthogonality test ), we know that warrior II just response to C4HSL secreted by warrior 1, but not 3OC6HSL secreted by himself.
Fig.1 Gene circuit designed from orthogonality test results
¬†¬†¬†¬†However, we cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter we put inside warrior I.What can we do to construct an orthogonal gene circuit?
Note: In this text, we mean the same when we refer to response intensity of AHL promoter and killing effect of warriors, that is to say, if the response intensity of promoter to AHL secreted by warrior A inside warrior B is high---A may equals to B, it means that the warrior A can be effectively killed by warrior B and vice versa.
II Design of orthogonal gene circuit
¬†¬†¬†¬†The problem now becomes how to block warrior II‚Äôs response to C4HSL secreted by itself. An intuitive answer to this question is that we could let C4HSL inside warrior I specifically stimulate the expression of an inhibitor, and then the inhibitor can inhibit the promoter of LacI.
¬†¬†¬†¬†Considering this design principle, we designed the gene circuit of warrior I and warrior II as follows.(Fig.2)

Tongji_China,2017,Team:Tongji China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM has been in China for ten years, and many of the first iGEM contestants have become excellent synthetic biologists. Some of them came to the conference to share their iGEM and scientific research experience. CCiC Organizing Committee set up speeches, posters exhibitions, academic salons, panel sessions and other different activities, the atmosphere is really great. Here we also had the opportunity to talk face to face with King L. Chow and Kenneth Oye from the iGEM Headquaters. At the meeting we showcased our project: Ignis Fly, and shared not only just our project itself, but the opinions about SynBio and biology researches with the other teams.
What an amazing experience!
2nd Open Night Live
The 2nd Open Night Live also called Tongji iGEM x Fablab Shanghai Open Night. It was held to showcase the iGEM teams in Shanghai and to give people an opportunity to exchange ideas with different iGEM team members. It has been an honor for us to invite Fudan, Fudan_China, Shanghaitech, STJU_BioX_Shanghai and ECUST to our Open Night Live.
We were delighted to find out that there were many college students watching and expressing views. Some of them also made a few suggestions on what more our project could do, and we added the parts we thought were reasonable. There was a symposium among iGEM teams after the Open Night Live where we exchanged ideas. We also set up a live webcast and gave Open Night Live to iGEM teams in other areas. It's really an unforgettable experience that we meet members of other iGEM team directly and interact together with more iGEM teams on the internet!

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn‚Äôt get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

Human Practices
Neil Gershenfeld, a physicist who is the director of the Center for Bits and Atoms, said that the improvement in the capacity to read and write biological genes has given rise to the possibility of ‚Äúspectacular advances,‚Äù like the ability to use a computer to design a complete genome, output it, insert it in a cell and in effect create life from scratch. - NY Times
It is clear that the field of synthetic biology has made leaps and bounds in recent years, from the introduction of genetically modified food to the cellular production of polymers with incredible tensile strength. What Gershenfeld is stating in the above quote is that previously, to make a significant contribution to the field of synthetic biology, there was a certain element of trial and error. What does this gene do? How does it interact with other species within the cell? How can I make my output more efficient and effective? And the biology community has come up with significant answers for each of these: gene sequencing and indexing to understand gene presence and function, documentation of chemical interactions, and investigations into crosstalk and modeling of the in vivo cellular environment.
SBiDer is the spectacular advance to which Gershenfeld is referring. Our application allows synthetic biologists of all levels to contribute in a significant way and to develop their ideas and streamline the synthetic design process. SBiDer is built upon the established body of work in the field of synthetic biology to not only simplify the design of biological circuits, but to increase the ability of users to visualize their circuits in silico. By simplifying the design and visualization process, our application allows users to explore the myriad of papers that compose our database simultaneously, without having to traverse typical scientific jargon that usually precludes young scientists from fully fleshing out their ideas. In this way, SBiDer has opened the field of synthetic biology for users of all levels, from high school freshmen to private investigators.
By opening the field to aspiring synthetic biologists and decreasing the time between idea conceptualization and wet lab production, SBiDer has removed the barriers of entry into the world of synthetic genetic production, thereby not only establishing a comprehensive database of operons and their interactions with one another,"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html,".  We are continuing to gain more knowledge of Maya, Autocad and Matlab we will be prepared to create quantitative and visual models. This week we also started looking into mathematical modelling for biological systems and gaining background knowledge in the field through literature. In particular, we looking into basic definitions, process of modelling, relation between state variables and description methods, time constants for cellular processes, fundamental of enzyme kinetics, cell division and growth. By studying and learning proper methods of quantitative analysis we will be able to directly perform this aspect of modelling when our system is ready.  We began brainstorming what important aspects of the project we can quantitatively model and what would be useful to help us in the initial design phase.  As of next week, a proposed sensor will be chosen and then we will resume our process with the Arduino Uno microcontroller and writing programs to control the device as we will be able to select a sensor based on our reporter.  Additionally we researched the potential of using a voltage or current sensor with the device and are currently looking into this option.
Week 6: June 9th - June 13th
This week we contacted two microfluidics experts to get insight on this topic and to answer some of the questions we have. Dr. Karan Kaler replied to us saying that he is away at the moment, but will be back in July and will be willing to meet up with our team to assist with the project. He said that their research lab is currently utilizing droplet based microfluidics for the detection of human pathogens using chip based real time qPCR technology developed in their laboratory. He thinks it may be relevant to us and suitable for us to explore. This week we also continued working with Maya and Matlab software. Dave submitted a request so we can get SimBiology toolbox for Matlab that will be very useful for quantitative modelling. We also got the 2013 version of Autodesk Maya instead of 2015 so that we can get ePMV plug-in that can be used for modelling and animation purposes.
After installing the software, we watched tutorials to get familiar with how the plug in works. Unfortunately, so far the tutorials we found were not very useful, so we will continue to look for more resources. Also, we reviewed the process of transformation and watched existing animations so we can create our own transformation animation in the near future for the purpose of practicing our animation skills. We also found an online written tutorial for Autodesk for Maya which is so far the best teaching resource for Maya. It explores the functions through practical step-by-step examples. It also includes a tutorial on Dynamics and a variety"

Prof.Jun YU Interview
Nowadays, the society tendency is that science and art are considered more and more split, which led to a narrow and limited situation. If we are determined to bend this tendency, we must think carefully about how to balance the relationship of art and science in our project. This led to our interview with Pro. Yu from BIG. As the chief scientific advisor of Art and Science Research Center, he indicated that we should explore the novelty and the unique art value of our work, both scientifically and artistically.

Discussion with Art & Science Research Center
Art & Science Research Center is the first non-profit association of art and science research center in China. Aiming at ‚ÄúPromoting change through cross‚Äù, AS Research Center integrates creation and communication. By means of innovative science and technology also avant-garde artistic creation, they promote the popularization of scientific knowledge and the high cross-integration between different subject fields.
Introduced by Prof. YU, we invited artists from Art and Science Research Center to explore the unique art value of our project. We appreciate sincerely for their advice and guidance in this pioneering field. They invited us to their center. We were deeply impressed by their significant work in inaugurating the age of Science Renaissance. We invited them to be our advisor, hoping to have further collaboration with them.
They were quite interested in our project, while they also pointed out the significance of the interaction with the public practically and more importantly, emotionally. Collaborating with them, we came up with the presenting form of story-telling deriving from Oscar Wilde‚Äôs story, The Nightingale and the Rose, which easily rises the audience‚Äôs emotional sympathy. Also, choosing the rose as the symbol of our story, for it is well accepted as the symbol of love and art. Blending emotional art value with scientific work indeed bring the soul to our project.
Key points:
Interaction
Storytelling and emotional sympathy
A typical symbol for wide popularization

Figure 7. The paths we travelled by train throughout The Netherlands to engage in discussions with people.
‚ÄúIf blood testing necessary that is just the way it is, the testing is just inherent to sports and as an athlete all you want is to be in the competition so you have to comply. ‚Äù
According to Brodie, the pressure to perform well is ‚Äúreally tough‚Äù. He can imagine young athletes being vulnerable to people approaching them with gene doping opportunities. It was only in lectures of his sport related University study program that he first learned about gene doping. He himself, would not like to use it though, because one cannot oversee the consequences.
Moniek Nijhuis
Being rewarded for your hard work is valuable for sporters. Moniek Nijhuis, finalist Olympic Games 2012 and medalist at multiple European and World Championships, told us her story about one of the bronze medals she won at the European Championships 2013. Two years later, this bronze medal turned out to be worth silver due to doping usage by one of her opponents. However, her moment of euphoria on the stage, which is the moment that sporters are striving for, will never return.
‚ÄúI just wanted to know that what I achieved is purely due to my own power and efforts. That still makes me feel good and at peace.‚Äù

Sports Organizations and Athlete Surveys
We contacted several sports organizations including the Court of Arbitration for Sport and a sports psychologist, Jef Brouwers. Both were not aware of any cases of Gene Doping. Mr. Brouwers did indicate however that he is aware of athletes carefully selecting their partners to have children that hopefully will perform well in sport again.
Apart from this we contacted the National Dutch sports organization, the NOC*NSF, to hear about their experiences with gene doping. However, as they pointed out, they are not very familiar with the concept and the idea of it actually happening. They wanted to help to find out about the prevalence of gene doping though and set the initial steps to send out our athlete survey to all Dutch top level athletes. What became apparent from the athlete surveys we had already send out is that athletes highly value quick detection with a result within a few days. Furthermore, athletes tend to not mind privacy invasive tests, since they see it as inherent to the desire"

Figure 4: Template DNA species
A reaction with template species as its reactants, modifiers or products is a Template Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into functional groups -- a reaction template describes the interaction mechanism of these functional groups. For example, pTetR promoter is deactivated in presence of TetR dimer. The template species are pTetR DNA template and TetR dimer protein template (see Figure 5) and the functional groups are pTetR promoter and TetR dimer. All the parts of ANY should also be counted as a functional group, though they don‚Äôt have functions in this reaction. Any pair of species which partially contain pTetR DNA and TetR protein dimer respectively would bind according to the description of this reaction template. Modeling with templates allows users to define species and reactions only once for one certain family without rewriting them again in database.
Figure 5: Template reaction
We are still looking for more substituents. We are planning to have more detailed substituents that can replace certain number of parts on certain number of chains. Even the arrangement of parts and chains can be specified. We believe it will make our template modeling more powerful.
A Standard Language
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. We will discuss a few relevant topics in the following sections.
Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language
With plenty of information for automatic modeling needs to be stored, we design our database, and develop a standard language of describing the database. We call the language: MoDeL.
MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is a database representation format for synthetic biology automatic modeling. This project of MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulations, and so on.
MoDeL is developed as a machine-readable format in XML fashion, programming languages with XML library API (such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization"

The protein crude extracts were diluted with breaking buffer, to get 10¬µl samples containing 30¬µg of protein crude extracts. The samples were mixed with 2,5¬µl Laemmli (non reducing) and boiled for 5 min. Afterwards, the samples were loaded on the gel, together with 6¬µl of prestained protein marker (PageRuler Plus) and 6¬µl unprestained protein marker.
The gel was performed at 120V, ca. 2h.
Western blot analysis of isolated protein crude extract
Investigator: Roman, Saskia
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the detection of the expressed enzyme CaDXMT1 in the isolated protein crude extract, having been separated on SDS page before (see above).
The proteins were blotted on a PVDF membran for 1h with 50mA. The membran was activated before blocking by 10min incubation in 100% methanol.
After blotting the proteins, we performed a reversible staining of the membran with Ponceau's reagent, to make the unprestained marker visible and to be able to assign it with a pen.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2013,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Consideration#human#CC_-_-_TEXT.html," the iGEM competetion. Many undergraduates and teachers proposed various questions about synthetic biology and our 'Membrane Magic' system construction.  Students from TJU as well as ECNU showed much interest in iGEM competition. They are planning to join our iGEM family in 2014. We also got lots of new ideas from other future-biologists through our communication!
Communication with New Friends
In this year we communicated with many new friends, including many iGEM participants.
Discussion with USTC iGEM team
We keep connection with iGEM team from USTC. We had a short meeting concerning team development as well as brain storming methods.
We also sent several parts, including BBa_K771002, BBa_K771003, BBa_K771004, BBa_K771005, to Zhejiang University and Chinese University of Hong Kong to help their project in this year.
Jun Yin, the undergraduate student from Shandong Univeisity, who kept contact with us since May 2013
And in May, an undergraduate student from Shandong University, who is also interested in iGEM, got to know one of our teammates in a conference held by Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China in University of Science and Technology of China. From then on, they communicated a lot. Since there was no iGEM team in Shandong University at that time, our teammate gave a lot of useful information to students of Shandong University, such as the process of participating in iGEM, the preparation for iGEM, and some communication conferences held by differnt 2013 iGEM teams in this year. Besides, in August, another student from Shandong University visited our team. Partially because of our help, our new friends from Shandong University have done a lot to construct their own iGEM team, and may participate the 2014 iGEM competition.
2013 iGEM conference in NCTU
In August, we attended the 2013 iGEM conference held by National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. In the conference, we made friends with students from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan University, National Yang Ming Universiy, Hong Kong University, and Zhejiang University. We talked about iGEM, synthetic biology and even daily life with our new friends, learned a lot from them, and helped each other to improve the projects. Really thanks to NCTU's treatment! Besides, we made hundreds of beautiful bookmarks as a gift,"

They must go through the same safety training as all other team members, but are required to redo the training each time we recruit new members in order to keep up-to-date with safety considerations. In addition, they maintain contact with the supervisors of the workspaces, usually in the form of a weekly check-in, to discuss any safety concerns that have arisen and ensure that equipment continues to be used properly.
Team members who violate safety rules are required to work under supervision of the safety officers for the remainder of the week, or until the safety officer believes the member is capable of perform the task unsupervised. For multiple infractions or complete disregard to safety protocols, a member may be restricted from laboratory work until he/she undergoes EHS chemical safety online training again, and demonstrates proper performance to a team leader of failed technique(s) in a controlled setting.

‚ÄúScience communication is vital to our quality of life. It helps everyone understand the problems that we face, and shares the ideas and solutions that can improve life for us all.‚Äù ‚Äì Chris Hadfield.
Aims
Many great ideas in science often don‚Äôt come to light if they are not well received or understood by the public, which is why education and engagement is such a vital part to science. We have worked to close this communication gap between our research and the public by taking part in numerous outreach activities.
When designing our activities, we considered discussing the science underlying synthetic biology to inspire and encourage curiosity from school students. We also wanted to inform the public on the great applications of synthetic biology and our project with the intentions of beginning a dialogue between us and those with differing backgrounds and opinions.
Workshop Engagement and Education
Dr Egg Adventures
The event was part of Australia‚Äôs National Science Week 2017, with our project aptly relating to this year‚Äôs theme being ‚ÄòFuture Earth‚Äô.
Our team members collaborated with a group of game developers and artists from Dr Egg Digital, as science consultants for a game testing and puzzle planning event. Led by Dr Catherine Fargher, the concept of the video game was based from her successful theatre show Dr Egg and the Man with No Ear.
A class of 8-12 year olds from the Queenwood School Catalyst Program were audience to an age appropriate lecture led by the Macquarie iGEM team on the basics of synthetic biology and its applications, and the possible future prospects of our project in renewable energy. The lecture spurred the creativity of the children who then brainstormed game puzzles and character scripts for the Dr Egg Digital game that is being designed to incorporate the national school science curriculum for grades 3-8. The resulting ideas from this collaboration will be incorporated into this educational videogame that is set to be released in February 2018.
Impressed by how this event engaged their students, Queenwood School shared information of our iGEM team and the community outreach we have participated in on their social media channels and their school publications.
Thanks for your AWESOME work yesterday! Lindy the main teacher from Queenwood said she has never seen them so engaged.‚Äù

This experience makes us learn much about membrane proteins which we believe would work sooner or later. More importantly, it helps us two teams communicate frequently and therefore develop a tight relationship eventually.

BIT-China for BNU-CHINA
This year, we collaborated with BIT-China team and BIT-China held a meeting on 11st. Jul. In this meeting, we exchanged our ideas and communicated about our project. Finally, we confirmed our collaboration relationship between our two teams.
Fig. 1.4 Meeting with BNU-CHINA
Because most of our members are fresh, we did not have enough experience on iGEM competition. After the discussion, BIT-China decided to help us finish part of our gene circuits. Meanwhile, they suffered some difficulties in characterize two basic parts, NhaA and NhaB. They also meet some problems in modeling, so we helped them with characterization of their parts and modeling part of their project.
They helped us finish the light regulation system (Pcons+B0034+PcyA+B0034+ho1). In this system, Pcons is a constitutive promoter family member (from BBa_J23100 to BBa_J23119) which can be used to tune the expression level of express part and what they choose is BBa_J23100. BBa_B0034 is strong ribosome binding sites (RBS). PcyA and ho1 are two requisite genes which are required for the transformation from heme into PCB. Ho1 will oxidizes the heme group and then generate biliverdin IX alpha, and PcyA converts biliverdin IX alpha into phycocyanobilin (PCB).
Fig. 1.5 Gene circuits of light regulation system
The overlap extension PCR (OE PCR) was used to finish our gene circuits. However, there are secondary structure in this part. So they could not get the part at first. Then they changed DNA polymerase Pfu to PrimerSTAR, another kind of DNA polymerase which performs better than Pfu. Finally the construction of light regulation system is successful.
Fig. 1.6 The construction result of light regulation system
In this period, we also had some discussions about experiments and modeling face to face. Through these discussions, we learnt more about each other and made progress together.

End of 2004 Luc Brunsveld received the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, with                 which he established his own research group at the MPI of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, beginning 2005. He worked                 on the combination of supramolecular chemistry with protein biochemistry and cellular biology, generating new                 approaches to modulate biological processes. In 2006 he became group leader at the Chemical Genomics Centre of the                 Max Planck Society, Dortmund. Here he was working on the chemical biology of nuclear receptors to understand and                 modulate the nuclear receptor-cofactor interaction, in close collaboration with Bayer-Schering Pharma, Merck-Serono,                 and Schering-Plough. In the middle of 2008 Luc Brunsveld received an ERC starting grant and became full professor in                 chemical biology in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In his                 research Luc Brunsveld uses chemical biology approaches to study protein-protein interactions. Two general themes                 are: 1) Supramolecular Architectures are being pursued as instruments to modulate protein-protein interactions and                 2) the Nuclear Receptor ‚Äì Cofactor interaction is being investigated as a specific protein-protein interaction with                 many unsolved questions, possibly amendable via chemical biology.

Zhejiang Province Distribution
According to the above result, Zhejiang is one of the most regions of termite occupation and plagued by them.
Harmful Dominant Species
Around the World
2013 reported in the literature, 371 destructive termite species occupy 12.5% of current total species. Among them, 104 species such as Coptotermes formosanus; Coptotermes rhinotermitidae; Cryptotermes domesticus; Cryptotermes dudley are harmful dominant and subdominant species, which occupies 3.5% of the total numbers.
Mainland China
In mainland China, Coptotermes formosanus is the kind of species doing harm to housing constructions even on 20 floors; woods; communication facilities ect.
Zhejiang Province
As for urban housing, Reticulitermes speratus is the main species followed by Coptotermes formosanus. As for rural country housing and landacapingÔºå Coptotermes formosanus is the main species.
Taking factors of distribution and dominant damage into account,
we choose Coptotermes formosanus as our major target to control terminate.
Damage of Termite
Termites feed on woods, and can digest lignocellulose. When they feed on housing construction, landscaping and other commercial products, they become economic pests.
These are the following characteristics of damage:
Overview
The harm that termites bring to human mainly reflects in two aspects. One is that termites take materials rich in lignocellulose as food, which causes property damage to human beings. It is reported that, the direct loss induced by termites is beyond 220 billion dollars per year. The other is that, the holes left by termites crawling could affect the integrity and security of buildings, dams and trees. What‚Äòs more, the hazards caused by termites to communal facilities such as large reinforced concrete bridges, gas lines, are frequently reported these years. It really influences public safety and people‚Äòs life in a negative way.
Concealment
Because of the photophobic habit of termites, they always move in a covert condition. It often takes a long time from termites invasion to being discovered. The special hazardous way of termites makes people ignore their invasion at the early time. But once been discovered, they usually have caused a certain financial loss or major accidents. This habit also makes termites one the city pests, which are the most difficult and expensive to control.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)

3.2  Effect of lux pR efficiency
Lux pR, a promoter which is activated by AHL-luxR complex, is a critical part we use in our project. We planned to generate various mutated forms of lux pR, and we seek to modify and improve its efficiency. But before we do any experiments, we need to confirm one thing: does the efficiency of lux pR matter?
There are a lot of promoters, activators and repressors in the system, so any one of them likely contributes little to the whole story. How to make sure? By using our mathematical model, naturally!
We assume the mutations alters the transcription efficiency. Efficiency refers to the relative rate of transcription driven by the promoter when AHL-luxR complex is bound. First of all, we reset the transcription efficiency of activated lux pR on the Neon plasmid to 20%, 50%,100% and 150% compared to the default value we used in previous parts. The initial concentration of AHL is 10-6 M. A series of plots are generated.
Figure 6     Impact of lux pR efficiency (on Neon Plasmid) on the Performance of the System
Clearly, the efficiency of lux pR on the Neon plasmid significantly affects the behavior of the system. An efficient/sensitive lux pR promoter results in a faster increase of GFP concentration. This also accords with our further experimental data.
Tuning the activity of the lux pR on the safety catch promoter also alters the behavior of the system. We set the lux pR on the Neon plasmid as the original one, while remaining AHL concentration as 10-6 M, and then tune the efficiency of lux pR on the safety catch plasmid to produce the plots below.
Figure 7     Impact of lux pR efficiency (on Safety Catch Plasmid) on the Performance of the System
Obviously, the effect of lux pR promoter on both plasmids can interact can produce a variety of results. A heatmap shows how their interaction alters the productivity of GFP. The color indicates the relative concentration of GFP at ‚Äú30000 s‚Äù time point.

You can interact with the plot down below. Use mouse to drag the slider to tune the lux pR efficiency and observe how this will influence GFP production in the cells!

These researchers conveyed to us the inestimable value of origin of life research on other planets.  This research helps us better understand and appreciate our position in the universe.  It forces us to reconsider our definitions of life (if we found ‚Äúlife‚Äù on another planet, would we recognize it?) and confront the precariousness of human existence (what were the conditions that allowed life to appear and evolve on Earth?).  NASA research on Mars also explores the possibility of human interplanetary colonization.
Interplanetary research is expensive both in terms of money and of time. It depends upon sturdy, efficient research tools that can supply information to current scientists without compromising future studies.  Biological research tools (like our balloon) that could be developed onsite and thus eliminate transportation costs would, in theory, propel research forward.  However, any potential benefit to this technology would be quickly negated if those tools were to contaminate the planet with Earth life.
Developers of biotechnology for space research therefore need to go to great lengths to mitigate the risk of interplanetary contamination. NASA‚Äôs Office of Planetary Protection has established a set of guidelines by which to evaluate appropriate precautions for planetary research.1 These guidelines are designed to protect ‚Äúsolar system bodies [‚Ä¶] from contamination by Earth life, and [to protect] Earth from possible life forms that may be returned from other solar system bodies.‚Äù   The policies most relevant to our summer research include ‚ÄúNPR 8020.12D: Planetary Protection Provisions for Robotic Extraterrestrial Missions‚Äù and ‚ÄúNPG 8020.7G: Biological Control for Outbound and Inbound Planetary Spacecraft.‚Äù Since our bioballoon would ideally be used for research on planets with the potential to support Earth life, it would need to comply with the Mission Category IVb and IVc regulations designed for landing/probe missions investigating extant life on Mars.
After reviewing these documents, we quickly realized that if we wanted to develop a practical tool for interplanetary life research, that tool would need to be completely devoid of life.  Though our materials could be produced in living organisms, the final balloon mechanisms would need to work in vitro.  We then determined our project"

Summary
Our team aims to fully exploit our university‚Äôs advantage in pharmaceutical science to design an effective treatment of a disease. By comparing the data collected, we chose rheumatoid arthritis and other refractory autoimmune diseases for our project. Conducting thorough field studies and understanding the current clinical status of rheumatoid arthritis were very important to our design and optimization.
Through field studies, we knew that Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy satisfies the patient's desire for new                 therapies, and through a questionnaire survey of physicians, we concluded that Syn-Notch CAR -Treg cell therapy                 just hold the advantages of the minor side effects and lower recurrence rate compared to existing drug treatment.                 In designing the therapeutic method, we were also fully dependent on the patient's request for new therapies                 to meet current clinical needs.
We actively design, perfect and verify our own project. In the meantime, it is an opportunity for every                 single person to understand the competition, together with a new frontier in life science. What‚Äôs more, we                 communicate with other iGEM teams and help each other.In addition, all of the members actively organized                 various academic activities, and actively participated in disparate meetings inside and outside school to                 promote the majority of teachers and students to comprehend the field of life science, as well as to improve                 the international influence of iGEM. At the same time, it also made our team members accumulate cutting-edge                 knowledge, and provided a strong guarantee for the improvement of the subject
Survey data
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that may exhibit chronic synovitis, synovial hyperplasia and fibrosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, synovial fluid T, B lymphocytes and plasma cells, increased collagenase, etc. It‚Äôs a chronic disease with high morbidity. There are several new therapies that have been used for the treatment of RA, but due to low awareness and low recovery rate, many patients fail to receive a proper treatment in RA‚Äôs preliminary stage which not only afflicts the patients, but also brings a heavy financial burden to their families.

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Citrobacter-Freundii#2-Growth-in-sea-salts_-_-_TEXT.html,", we wanted to asses growth of C. freundii on media plates. For this purpose, M9 minimal medium was made up, using glucose as a carbon source, and varying amounts of sea salts were added to these media. Unfortunately, at higher (>40g/l) sea salt concentrations, the agar did not solidify so growth above this concentration could not be assessed. The plates that did solidify had 100 Œºl C. freundii spread on them and were put into the 37¬∞C incubator overnight.
1.2 Liquid M9 medium was then made up using varying amounts of sea salts. These media were not clear as expected but what whitish precipitates floating in the medium, so we speculate that the M9 salts did not react well to the presence of sea salts. The precipitate is probably magnesium and calcium phosphate, as M9 is very high in phosphates. Nonetheless, we inoculated these bottles with overnight cultures (grown in LB) to see if any growth would occur. After overnight incubation at 37¬∞C on a shaker, the ODs were measured (using the appropriate sea salt concentration M9 as blank for each culture to prevent interference of the precipitate with the readings).
1.3 Next, LB medium was made up, using yeast extract (5g/l) and tryptone (10g/l) and varying concentrations of sea salts (replacing the normal NaCl). These bottles of media were inoculated with overnight cultures, incubated overnight at 37¬∞C with shaking and the ODs measured as described above.
1.4 Finally, we wanted to compare the ability of C. freundii to grow in the presence in sea salts with that of E. coli, so we set up 250ml flasks with 25ml of LB or LB with 40g/l sea salts, inoculated them with overnight cultures of E. coli MG1655 or C. freundii and measured OD every 30 minutes over the course of a day.
Close the method.
Results
1.1 All the plates that were inoculated showed a lawn of cells, suggesting that C. freundii can grow well in the presence of sea salts. Unfortunately, the sea salts + M9 salts formed a white precipitate, so the plates could not be photographed in a way that would actually show that there were cells growing on them.
1.2 A graph showing the OD readings taken from bottles of M9 + varying concentrations of sea salts can be seen in Figure 1.

To deal with cost and efficiency issues, we had designed a large scale factory model based on our modeling and small scale device. After the recycled paper was sent into the factory, classification was first done before all the process has started. Papers would be separated into different lines by the type of printed ink, the color of printed ink, dirtiness and the percentage of ink area. Then the paper would be pictured and sprayed with yeast using massive yeast spraying system. the paper would go onto conveyor and shine with red light. The paper would be fluently sent into the pulping step for further treatment. The design of the factory would lowered the cost and raise the specificity and efficiency. We wish to make a change of current reprocessed paper manufacturing process.
SWOT
Strength-Preserve high percentage of paper fiber. Up to 80% of paper fiber can be preserve theoretically by using this method.
Weakness-Relative high cost and low efficiency due to the treatment.
Opportunity-The politic restriction of deforestation and water pollution. This raise the cost and tax of the company. Developing eco-friendly technology gives the company good advertisement and image.
Threat-All coming up eco-friendly technologies that improves the deinking process. However, in short term plans, companies like enzymatic deinking companies promotes eco-friendly buying habit. This makes the threat a collaboration in short term.
Innovation
In the future world, we won‚Äôt just improve the deinking process, the whole paper-making industry would be changed. Printing and paper industry needs to change to a more eco-friendly way to make products.
Printing means to attach ink particles or complexes on to the paper fiber, the ink particles would bind to the paper fiber normally with van der waals force. Ink particles may be made of organic or inorganic compounds. This makes it difficult to find a general enzyme or chemical that could detach the ink and protects the paper fiber at the same time. Thus we think ink must be special designed for specific enzyme deinking, this would make the whole process easier and make higher profit to the ink company.
For one of the steps of reprocessed paper making ‚Äúflotation‚Äô‚Äô, we had cooperate with team iGEM17_TAS_Taipei. They are currently working on building up a protocol to test whether biofilm can attract nano-gold particles. We had collaborate with them, we are trying to test whether the biofilm could attract ink particles. The results shows that the biofilm may have the potential of attracting ink particles. Which makes the biofilm a candidate material"

He and others believe that this possibility could translate into billions of dollars in a market that sees revenues of hundreds of millions of dollars annually for some drugs [13]. Fascinatingly, nanomaterial delivery technologies motivate companies to invest. The global RNAi drug delivery market using nanomaterials is expected to grow to nearly $24 billion by 2015 at a 5 year compound annual growth rate of 27.9% [14].
Hopefully, in the long run, gene therapy using RNAi will become common practice in treating a range of diseases, particularly those associated with oncogenesis and infectious disease. And we chose this technique to regulate our target gene.

3) tPep: CKGGRAKDC
tPep is a targeting peptide that actually serves as the ligand of the prohibitin, a multifunction membrane protein in white fat tissues. [8] We can take prohibitin as a marker of adipose tissues, which makes tPep a perfect targeting tool.
4) exosome
The biggest obstacle for successful clinical application of siRNA is to develop a safe and effective delivery system directed at the target tissues only. Current techniques for small RNA transfer use viruses or synthetic agents as delivery vehicles. The replacement of these delivery vehicles with a low toxicity and high target-specific approach is essential for making siRNA therapy feasible.
Recently, increasing attention has been given to the use of endogenous exosomes as a novel siRNA delivery system. Exosomes are natural, nano-sized intraluminal vesicles with a diameter ranging between 40 and 100 nm [15]. Released by most cell types, exosomes are present in almost all biological fluids and function as natural transporters of bioactive molecules (proteins, mRNAs, and small RNAs) between neighboring cells. The cargoes that exosomes carry can be gene expression-regulatory functionally in the recipient cells; thus, exosomes are known as the communicators of the microenvironment.
The detailed process of exosomal siRNA transfer is shown as follows. First, cytosolic siRNA is incorporated into the exosomes during invagination of the endosomal membrane. When the MVB fuses with the plasma membrane, exosomal siRNA is released into the circulation simultaneous with the release of exosomes. Subsequently, exosomes bind to the plasma membrane of a target cell, and then exosomes either fuse directly with the plasma membrane or"
