Some of the groundwork was laid for the modelling too – mainly skill learning today – and primers were designed.
Many people seem stressed about the amount of time left  - probably more because we have only a vague idea of how long things will take rather than any actual shortage of time. Time will tell.
Wednesday 18th
We finished making our cells competent today, and learnt how to make up the TSS buffer necessary to do so. Transformations should begin tomorrow. We also really need to source more materials and pieces of equipment for our lab – it has a real ‘abandoned’ feel.
Meanwhile a number of problems with the theoretical aspects were worked on. Four of us met with Dr. French to see if he had a workaround for a problem with our sugar logic system – the problem that each strain is too sensitive to false positives because it doesn’t rely on the prior strain for precursor. He didn’t have a solution, but did offer a possible solution to the secondary problem of signal quenching – make the enzymes unstable rather than use a degradation tag (which wouldn’t work outside the cell). We also looked for a way to source E. coli cells with the tetR gene as the strain we are working with is missing it, and we sort of need it for all our IPD circuits.
In addition, more organised circuit diagrams were made alongside matching plasmid diagrams, which will hopefully make the transition to multi-cell IPD easier, and a more in depth investigation of the Hbp operon (required for the metabolic wiring) was done. Philip and Cesar left us today to go and attend the Oxford iGEM meetup as our representatives. Good luck guys!
Finally, it was far too hot today. We almost denatured.
Thursday 19th
The first transformations were done today, which was exciting. They’re being incubated overnight, ready for a miniprep tomorrow. We were also very kindly given some TetR+ cells by Dr. Garry Blakely (once we’d prepared the tetracycline plate for him).
Meanwhile there was a discussion about what our ultimate aims should be, and some questions from the dry team about the specifics of metabolic wiring were answered. It was felt we need to make sure we are all on the same page, so to speak, lest we drift apart into different, unrelated subprojects.
Elize is looking into a Synthetic Biology Film Festival which previous iGEM teams have entered into with some success. The deadline for entries is in 11 days however, so this might not"

Attraction (butyrate pathway)
The chassis we used is Escherichia coli, and this bacterium is not able to naturally produce butyrate. That is why we introduced genes from others bacterial strains to synthesize this molecule.
Basic parts
tesB (BBa_K1587001)
A gene from Escherichia coli (Accession Number: EG10995 ) involved in the butyrate pathway that enables its production directly from acyl-coAs. This group of enzymes catalyzes the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs into free fatty acid (in our case, butyryl-coA into butyrate) plus reduced coenzyme A (CoA-SH).
crt (BBa_K1587003)
A gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum (Accession Number: GJIH-2688 ) introduced in our  bacterium after codon optimization in order to obtain a better  expression in our strain. The crt enzyme substrate is 3-hydroxybutyryl CoA,  and the product is Crotonyl CoA. This reaction does not need any coenzyme.
Other parts

Description
The command iCG filter is executed on basecalled Nanopore data before any further analysis can be performed with iCG. It uses the information generated by the ONT basecaller albacore to filter a set of sequencing reads for sufficient quality, length and the existence of the position of interest. After the reads have been filtered, they are divided into sense and antisense reads regarding their orientation relative to a given reference sequence. Afterwards, the reads are ""re-squiggled"" using nanoraw (Stoiber, 2016), meaning that every read is aligned to the given reference sequence in order to correct bascalling errors and to normalize the raw read signals in terms of duration and amplitude. This filtering procedure is mandatory for the subsequent analysis with both iCG model and iCG predict.
For subsequent analysis, it is particularly important that the filtering process is performed irrespective of the position of interest. The potential influence of the unnatural bases on the sequencing signal may lead to bascalling misbehavior which in turn could lead to falsified analysis results if the position of interest and the neighboring sequence context is considered during filtering. Therefore, the presence of the region of interest in a read sequence is checked by regular expression pattern matching, omitting the immediate sequence context of the position of interest, called ""blur region"". Figure 2 illustrates how the position of interest, the region of interest, the blur region and the regular expression are connected with each other.
Fig. 2: Terminology and regular expression used for pattern matching.In order to identify reads containing the region of interest, a regular expression is used for pattern matching that is omitting the immediate sequence context of the position of interest, called ""blur"" region. The displayed regular expression is resulting from the default parameter settings for the exemplary reference sequence.
Every aspect of this pattern matching approach is adoptable by optional arguments passed to iCG on execution, including the size of the region of interest, the size of the blur region and the amount of mismatches allowed during pattern matching. Additional parameters define whether insertions and deletions (indels) are allowed and how much the length of a match is allowed to deviate from the length of the region of interest as a consequence of indels.
In addition to pattern matching, the defined region of interest is also used for evaluating the read quality in the neighboring sequence context of the position of interest. Assuming that the quality in the blur region is high if the quality of its surrounding sequence context is high too, this criteria can be especially assessed by setting the --min_mean_context_qscore parameter accordingly.

Overall project
This year at Purdue, our goal is to make a bacterial UV sensor for commercial application.  By exploiting existing E. coli DNA repair pathways (photoreactivation and SOS); we want to eventually create a ""patch"" that will change colors as UV exposure increases.  Thus, one would be able to test when new sunscreen needs to be applied based on actual DNA damage.  Other applications could include Bacterial ""tattoos"" that only show up in the sun, color-changing T-shirts, etc.
Biologically, we are planning to attach the phr (photoreactivation) promoter to a gene creating some kind of red color, such as RFP, prodigiosin or LacYZ on MacConkey agar.  As a result, as pyrimidine dimers are formed, the natural photoreactivation pathway will be activated by the bacteria and red color will develop alongside natural DNA repair.  Once more severe DNA damage occurs, the E. coli will naturally switch over to the well-documented SOS (recA) pathway.  By combining the promoter for this pathway (a part used by Bangalore in 2006) with the lacZ gene and plating on X-gal, severe UV damage will make beta-galactosidase which will cleave X-gal which will create a blue pigment.  Thus, our device will slowly turn red and eventually blue as the DNA damage resulting from UV radiation increases.
Project Details
Unfortunately, there is insufficient documentation regarding the phr pathway.  Because this pathway is not present in humans, very little research has been done on the subject.  As a result, there is no definitive source for the specific genetic code that makes up the promoter region of the system.  Because of this and other funding problems, the Purdue team has decided to focus on just the SOS side of the project.

Pitching of idea in front of professors:
The  shortlisted  ideas  were  presented  in  the  form  of  two  long  presentations,  followed  by  a  detailed  question­answer  session.  All  faculty  members  of  our  department  were  present  and   were  actively  involved  in  it,  putting  forth  their  ideas  and  queries. After  a  2  hour­long  debate,   finally one of the ideas was chosen to be feasible for the project. However, due to lack of any   available prototype at that point of time, many of the professors rejected the idea of participation   in this  year’s  competition,  stating that it would be unwise to give  consent to  something which   had  no  proof  of  materialising  within  a  week’s  time.  As  the  deadlines  for  registration  were   approaching,  we  had  serious  troubles  in  convincing  the  professors  that  we  would  be  able  to   deliver the results in the right time. This session was to be followed by a meeting with the dean and a panel of high­ranked officials   of our institute. But that too got delayed due to the absence of the dean on some urgent matter.   We had no option in hand but to request the iGEM office for an extension in the deadline on the   plea of delay in arrangement of funds. To our luck, the iGEM office responded positively, and   extended the deadline by a few weeks.
Registration, consolidation of idea and selection of guide:
Not all the professors had opposed to the idea of our participation in this year’s iGEM. Prof. Dey   and Prof. Ganguly were in strong favour of the idea. This prevented us from losing all hope and   we kept on the struggle. With their help, we were able to rearrange the meet with the dean and   after a lot of effort, the plan was approved. As a result, funds were sanctioned by the institute   and we were able to register towards the end of April. All the registration formalities were carried   out  and  Prof.  Ganguly  was  chosen  as  the  principal  guide  of  our  iGEM  team  because  of"

The function of the BioBrick device containing a constitutive promoter and RBS in front of the genes were verified by protein analysis and enzyme activity assay. The application of prototype was demonstrated by a modeling experiment in an electrochemical simulator.
We always performed the gene cloning following the standard procedure as below. To make sure the DNA sequencing is correct on the vector, our instructor, Dr. Pei-Hong Chen, developed a rule followed by Mingdao iGEMers. We’re taught and learned the skills of gene cloning based on this strict procedure.

The DNA sequences of AOX1 and AOX2 genes in Pichia pastoris were got from the genomics database created by The Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics Research Group at Ghent University. The gene ID and sequences were double-checked with NCBI database (AOX1: CAY72092.1 ,AOX2: CAY71377.1)
The DNA sequences were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) with gBlocks® Gene Fragments method. Before submitting sequences to IDT, we optimized the nucleotide sequences for E. coli by IDT Codon Optimization Tool and removed the possible secondary structure analyzed by online software (called Test Complexity ) provided by IDT to prevent the difficulty of DNA synthesis.

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," taught does not always include synthetic biology. Throughout the day, we did our best to show these students a different side of the field of biology and convince them that we can hack life!
Presentation
We welcomed the students with a presentation that consisted of three parts. The first one was about iGEM, the modalities and principles of the competition, the number of participating teams, the contribution of each team, etc. The second part was about Synthetic Biology. After introducing them to common lab techniques and procedures, we talked about our project, Bio LOGIC.
After the presentation, we separated them into three groups for three different activities.
Ethics debate
The future use of novel technologies is a matter that every scientist with integrity has to think about. To make the students reflect about actions and consequences, we prepared an ethics debate during which we gave the students a role with a specific opinion. The goal was to make them think of opinions that diverge from their own and to make the activity more fun with a little drama. At the end of the debate, we took some time to discuss the activity without the roles. We were pleased to see that what we had opened their eyes on different aspects concerning the responsibilities linked to research in the field of synthetic biology.
Lab immersion
Even the most renowned scientist started by pipetting water, this is why we prepared a few activities in the lab to let the students see how it is to work in the world of synthetic biology. After giving them safety guidelines and safety equipment we made them plate chromophore cells to introduce them to cell manipulation techniques (you can see the 3 best results below), run a gel colony PCR to teach them about plasmids, PCR and gel size separation. The last proposed activity was a workshop using a website to design logic circuits.
Mini iGEM
As we wanted to give them an overview of how the competition works, we made them imagine iGEM projects. In this activity, small groups of students worked together to create iGEM projects and then explained them to the other groups. They were asked to think about feasibility, usefulness, safety and ethics. During the brainstorming, each group was coached by one of our team members. We introduced the concepts of kill switch, biobricks, motility, transcription pathways, transporters and bio-informatics to them. The ideas that they shared with us were surprisingly smart and imaginative for students who had received little technical and background information on the matter. Some teams even brought up and discussed projects that had already been realized in previous iGEM competitions.

Ligation
Ligation perform according to protocol.
Transforming E. coli cells with Plasmid DNA
Competent e.coli cells were first prepared, according to the protocol here.
Sample C,D,E,H,J,L and N to be transformed, according to the protocol here.
Day 4
Growth and Culture of Bacteria
For the protocol please click here.
Plates incubated overnight show that vectors corresponding to C,D,E,H,J,L and N were taken up [however, later we find that ligation had failed, and so gBlocks C,D,E,H,J,L and N were never inserted]. There are at least 5-7 colonies for each biobrick.
Choose three colonies from each plate. The colony should not be too small or too large and should be reasonably spaced from the others.
Separately incubate each colony in test tubes overnight.
This process would significantly increase the amount of plasmids containing biobricks that we want. Plasmids can be extracted later.
Transformation of J and G (24/06 PCR Product) into competent E. coli cells
Competent cells are already made in stocks and can be found in the -80℃ freezer: we don’t need to prepare them again. J and G comes from repeat PCR done in Day 3.
Primer Design
Since A, B, F, G, I, K, M have repeatedly failed to be PCR-amplified, longer primers were designed to replace the old primers for the PCRing of these gene sequences.
Primers that would give the sequences new restriction sites to allow their insertion into pBAD33 and pBAD/HisB expression vectors were also designed.
Day 5
Plasmid Extraction
For the plasmid extraction protocol see here.

Every time the intensity of the light changes to a certain extent the bacteria replicates. And there are restrictions to how the bacteria replicates. When the bacteria replicates it does not have the same information to that as the real.  As it moved closer and closer to the light it replicates with lesser info each time leaving it to its final form.  The bacteria and its functions with all its restrictions, has been used as a metaphor to represent the karmic cycle. The karmic cycle, is the theory of the Indian philosophy, that, in order to achieve nirvana, a being has to go through a series births and rebirths, which is the result of one’s karma (actions and motives). We introduced the concept of shadow as a metaphor. It being the bacteria’s indicator depicting its path to the light source. We could also relate it to a general human behaviour.It is our natural tendency to follow the light and leave the darkness behind. We tend to run away from the darkness but it does follow it. But the more we go toward enlightment , the intensity of darkness reduces.
The Holy Trinity (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva - Creator, Preserver, Destroyer)
""The Holy Trinity – Brahma, the creator, Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the destroyer. These are the first and foremost gods that rule the heavens, earth and hell. As you’re reading this don’t those three words –creator, preserver and destroyer burst out of your imagination and find its way to synthetic biology? Well, that’s exactly what happened to us. So here’s our idea.
In a over populated culture of bacteria. There is ‘imbalance’ since there more bacteria to eat than the nutrition available. So the ‘gods’ are summoned! The VISH-gene bacteria (the preserver) now gets into action by producing a chemical to which ONLY the SHIV-gene bacteria (the destroyer) can read. This then activates the SHIV-gene bacteria to in turn produce a chemical which start disrupting the bacterial cells in the colony. The ‘gods’ bacteria are of course resistant to this chemical. The SHIV-gene bacteria once activated has no control over killing the other cells. So once he has destroyed ample number of cells, he needs to be stopped, which ONLY the BRAHM-gene can do. So now the VISH-gene bacteria produces another chemical which ONLY the BRAHM-gene bacteria can read and this in turn activates the BRAHM"

Abstract
iGEM Kyoto suggested a nationwide survey to all the iGEM teams in Japan this year.  Five Universities (including Kyoto) participated in this project.   We Kyoto team led other teams in the project, and successfully got over 1,500 answers in total! "
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," free system (Fig. 5B) along with scFv in order to compare how well scFv accomplishes its function alone or binded to other protein. In this case MstX-scFv_antiVLY fusion did not show superior activity than scFv_antiVLY alone (Fig. 6). These results also reveal that scFv_antiVLY is very sensitive and loses its activity with time. Ist and IInd attempts were separated by 1-2 hours. This amount of time is enough to measure decreasing activity. This must be taken into account when performing future experiments.
Fig. 5 A- MstX-scFv_antiVLY expression in Escherichia coli. B- scFv_antiVLY and MstX-scFv_antiVLY expression in cell-free system.
Fig. 6 Percentage of erythrocyte lysis at different scFv/MstX-scFv dilutions.
Conclusions
We successfully expressed scFv_antiVLY antibody and MstX-scFv_antiVLY construct in E.coli cells as well as in a cell free system. We demonstrated that our scFv anti-vaginolysin can bind to its target antigen vaginolysin and inhibit erythrocyte-lysis reaction. Based in scFv general properties in IVTT activity, we conclude that scFvs are an elegant addition to SynDrop liposome display system.
Discussion
Small size of scFv makes it a widely researched antibody. It’s ability to penetrate deeply into tissues and trait to elicit low to none organism’s immune response, makes scFv the one of the best candidates for medical, diagnostic, and research applications [3]. Efficient and fast method for scFv generation is in demand. SynDrop liposome display system offers an ability to produce scFv in IVTT system and display them on membranes to facilitate rapid antigen binding. scFv on the other hand can also help us prove that our system work either cost efficiently or with extreme precision. scFv surface display is compatible with using fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS) to detect well functioning liposomes. [4] This would reduce amount of time needed for mutant sorting compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Second, scFv display is compatible with the experiments described in this section. We have performed erythrocyte-lysis tests to prove the functional activity of scFv anti-vaginolysin that was synthesized in the IVTT system"
UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," the DCBA restriction system means that any brick can be placed in any position in the plasmid which allows expansion of possibilities whilst maintaining randomness of insertion later. Bricks can be joined together via amplifying each randomly assembled brick through common amplification sites and then cutting them using a set of restriction enzymes which give each plasmid a specific order of bricks, depending on which are cut and then ligated together.
This was then used for the promoter library.
After this, the same method as above was used for the final dCas9 including vector. However with an addition of dCas9 in the final ligation phase. In this way two promoter libraries were produced.
Results
For results check steps 3 and 4.
STEP 3: Promoter Library
Why
To establish the relative strength of every single promoter, each of them must be tested and their expression level measured throughout the bacterial growth. This will provide data to demonstrate it is possible to differentiate between them, proving that our key will work effectively by having identifiable spectral states. Getting unique spectral profiles is a cause of concern as the excitation and emission spectra of RFP, CFP and GFP overlap somewhat and cross excitation will occur, perhaps masking CFP’s emissions and reducing the potential for separate keys to be identifiable. To fully address this, a promoter library was constructed to assess the promoter’s strength.
How
This growth curve was carried as described in week 15 of the lab book, please refer for full details. To summarise, overnight cultures of each specimen were inoculated into a new batch of media. These were then grown at 37°C for 24 hours, with measurements of OD600nm absorbance and fluorescence carried at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. The promoters were paired with a downstream RFP reporter gene.
Results
Figure 1. This graph shows the relative fluorescent intesnity of strong and weak RBS promoters SP1-E and WP1-4. These were grown for a 24 hour period and measurements were taken at 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 24 hours.
Figure 1 illustrates the strengths of each set of strong (SP) and weak (WP) RBS promoters, the first graph being the SPs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and E. E is a null promoter which will produce no expression, providing an additional control like sgRNA0 is for the gRNA parts design. It will help making sure no unspecific interference happens when no promoter is present"

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," more about other non-planned ethical aspects that came out to debate click here .
Below you can find the general analysis and conclusions we came up with from the five debates:
Integrated HP: Lying bacteria?
Since our project consists of talking with microorganisms, we asked ourselves the question “what would happen if they lied to us?” Not consciously, of course, but mutants who give different answers to the same question could be evolutionarily favored in a bacterial culture. Our HP team addressed this issue in an integrated fashion: both in public debates and in the lab.
Our Human Practices team and topics play a central and integrated role in our iGEM project. Not only did we explore ethical concerns of our activity, but also we coordinated our work in the lab to test our “lying bacteria” vision. We addressed the questions above in two ways:
1. Debating: We decided to shoot a short film to give insight and a jumping off point to our integrated vision. We discussed it with different audiences in public debates in three different European countries. We then analyzed their comments and response to the short film. We wanted to discuss ethical issues such as: What if this talking technology was used in everyday devices and they lied? How would people react to this? Should the blame be given to companies developing those devices? How frequently would mutants appear? Imagine that this technology was hackable. What ethical issues would arise?
2. Modeling and wetlab : Together with the modeling team, we carried out experiments in the wetlab to predict how often those liars or cheaters would appear in cultures and compared the fitness of cheaters against the original culture.

LABORATORY WORK
1.Cloning
To achieve our Curdlan production by Escherichia coli, it was necessary to integrate our interest gene crdS controlled by the promoter OsmY in two types of plasmids:
✵ in pSB1C3 plasmid for the characterization of our biobricks
• OsmY promoter only
• crdS gene only
• promoter and gene
✵ in pUC for production steps
• promoter and gene
3.Curdlan production
The production is done on two steps (in two Erlenmeyer flasks) in order to scale up bacterial biomass and then, to obtain a lot of Curdlan.
In stationary phase, we proceed to a temperature change in order to minimize the persistent bacterial growth, the Curdlan being a secondary metabolite.
2.Transformation
These plasmids are then transferred into competent bacteria E. coli DH5α by transformation. The selection of transformed bacteria is done by chloramphenicol resistance for pSB1C3 plasmid and by ampicillin resistance for pUC plasmid.
To check that cloning work, plasmids are digested with EcoR1 and Pst1 restriction enzymes.
Figure 3:Agarose electrophoresis gel
Figure 3. As we can see, the band corresponding to the piece of linearized plasmid containing OsmY promoter and crdS gene is a bit higher than the band corresponding to the piece of linearized plasmid containing crdS gene only.
4.Purification and Quantitative analysis
To obtain Curdlan, cells were chemically destroyed by NaOH and many centrifugations.
Curdlan purification was performed by neutralization after adding acetic acid.
Quantitative analysis was done before and after purification to compare and eliminate non significant measures (background signal).
N.B. Also, we use a polarimeter to characterize our Curdlan molecule produced.

(2) Drawbacks of Traditional Molybdenum fertilizer
In order to decrease nitrogen fertilizer’s usage, molybdenum fertilizer is commonly applied in cereal plants fields, because molybdenum is a microelement that in both important for azotobacter and cereal plants and the mechanism is discussed in the introduction part.
The Application of molybdenum is usually in two ways. The first way is seed dressing and the second is plant spraying. Liu (1987) did research in Xinxiang about the application of molybdenum fertilizer ((NH4)2MoO4).
Method 1: no application of (NH4)2MoO4.
Method 2: put the peanut seeds in 0.1% (NH4)2MoO4 solution for 12 hours before planting
Method 3: dip the peanut seeds in 0.5% (NH4)2MoO4 solution for a short time

Guelph,2008,Team:Guelph#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," cut gene via ligation. The last gene will have transcription terminators on the end. Next we would add promoters, and uing EcoRI and XbaI, then cut the transcriptional unit out and transfer to other plasmids using EcoRI and PstI.
The promoter that first interested us was the strong constitutive promoter from  herbicide tolerant Amaranthus weeds which is unregulated (and therefore constitutive) in prokaryotes.  To get this we should PCR up the promoter from the pDSK-GFPuv plasmid (introducing an SpeI site after the native NdeI), and put it into BBa_E0240 to test promoter activity by visually checking GFP levels.
With a strong, constitutive, biobricked promoter having an NdeI on the start codon followed by an SpeI site, we're ready to build the operon. The gene order for the operon has already been optimized. This paper explains we should have E-B-I-Y. Check it out:
http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/AEM.02268-06v1
The initial gene, crt-E, on plasmid p3-10-10 will be amplified and appropriate flanking , XbaI and NdeI (on or before the start codon) and SpeI (after the stop codon) restriction sites introduced. There is also a ribosome binding site present in front of each of the carotenoid genes, and thus we will conserve them in our cloning strategy.  We will cut the plasmid with XbaI and SpeI then dephosphorylate it with antartic alkaline phosphatase, kindly provided by our sponsor New England Biolabs. Likewise, the PCR product will be cut with XbaI and SpeI, and ligated to the dephosphorylated plasmid.
The Biobricked crt-B PCR product will also be flanked with XbaI and SpeI, and ligated into its own pSB1A2 plasmid where it will attain the EcoRI and PstI sites as well. To insert this crt-B after crt-E, we will cut it with XbaI and Pst, while cutting the plasmid with SpeI and PstI. This will destroy the SpeI site on the plasmid and the XbaI site on the PCR product, but these complementary sticky ends have the benefit of decreasing the rate of background ligations; the complementary sticky ends act as 'heat seeking missiles', seeking out their complementary"

Figure 4: Skim milk plates assay. Cells containing the empty backbone (left) and cells containing the expression system for native subtilisin E (right) after incubation for 3 days at 30°C.
Comparing the clearance of the skim milk plates, a proteolytic activity could be proven for the cells containing the expression system for native subtilisin E. As a result, we concluded that within three days these cells are able to produce the native protease, which will then digest the skim milk in the agar plates, resulting in a clearance. In conclusion, we were able to express subtilisin E in E. coli and to prove its proteolytic activity via skim milk assay. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

EPFL,2016,Team:EPFL#Medals Criteria_-_-_TEXT.html," have helped any registered iGEM team from another university, or another institution in a significant way.
Collaboration has been a central point to our project. We developed a website ( igem.today ), bringing together in one place the descriptions of projects and interviews of more than 30 different iGEM teams (see also human practices; igem.today ). It helped people not only to get to know better the projects of various teams, but it also promoted collaboration between them. Indeed, by knowing what the other teams were working on, finding the perfect collaboration was made easier. We also suggest such a platform to be taken over by iGEM HQ itself and have it implemented in future iGEM years.
Moreover, we created a platform on our site for sharing surveys made by different teams and helped to spread them to the iGEM community. We also took part in different surveys to help other teams gather information of interest for their own project.                           We also took part in the newsletter that the XMU-China team created (read more here ) by providing a description of our project and of our team. It was a great way to contribute even more on spreading iGEM to the world.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
We took all of these aspects very seriously during our project. More specifically, we interviewed Dr. Yolanda Schaerli, a young expert in the field of synthetic biology currently employed at University of Zurich.                             After discussing her current research, we delve into the ethical dilemmas facing synthetic biologists. Ranging to suspicion from the public to preventing bioterrorism, we tried to give you a sneak peek into this complex world where philosophy meets pragmatism. We wrote an article on our website about the interview and commented those critical points to share our experience with the world.
We also went to a High School in Geneva and met with 40 students. We presented iGEM, our project, and raised awareness about safety in the lab. We also warned them about the risks of irresponsible attitudes when dealing with genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Not only did we talk about the risks of GMOs, we also educated the students about the advantages of using GMOs in various applications and asked them how they portray the future of GMO usage.

Valencia_Biocampus,2014,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"1, and Biobrick part 2 were analyzed. XL1-Blue E. coli cells containing no plasmids or empty plasmids were used as                   controls. Both green (505 nm) and red (592 nm) fluorescence intensity (FI) were measured for all samples and normalized by the optical density at 600 nm                   (OD600).
When in co-transformation, Bb1 and Bb2 showed a clearly asymmetric expression . Bb1 was highly expressed in comparison to Bb2 (2-fold in strain XL1-Blue and 3-fold in DH5α). A                similar phenomenon was observed when either Bb1 or Bb2 were cotransformed with empty plasmids. Again, less fluorescence was detected in comparison to the                simple transformants. Surprisingly, this fluorescence decay was strikingly different between both E. coli strains: Bb1 strongly lowered its                expression in DH5α, whereas Bb2 showed a higher decay in XL1-Blue cells.
However, the result was completely different when Bb2 and Bb3 were present in the same cell. In the XL1-Blue strain, the fluorescence intensity of Bb2 was                as high as that of the single transformant, whereas the fluorescence of Bb3 –containing a less strong promoter- dropped dramatically. Fluorescence                intensity of Bb3 was not detectable in strain DH5α under our experimental conditions.
With these results with co-transformants, we have to conclude that Biobrick parts, even if controlled by the same promoter and cloned into the same                plasmid, are not expressed at similar rates. But, is this lack of orthogonality stable and reproducible? In other words, is the asymmetric output always the same or does it fluctuate in time or among cells? We were able to answer this question by using flow cytometry. Check our results below!
2. Flow cytometry
To study cell-level fluorescence we used flow cytometry.  To prepare the samples, XL1-Blue cultures (wild type, simple transformants for Bb1 and Bb2, and cotransformants with Bb1+Bb2) were grown in LB with the appropriate antibiotic, harvested and resuspended in 1mL PBS.  From now on, we will refer to Bb1 as GFP, and Bb2 as RFP.
Orthogonality at the cell level
Our first result, shown in Figure 3, is the confirmation of non-orthogonal behavior as deduced by a higher expression of"

Investigation and Improvement of Our Insoles
we need to know how our products perform in the market. Therefore, we completed the Insole 1, we do a user survey. Then we return to the laboratory to think about the new design which is based on user’s feedback. Ultimately, we have adopted the third Insole 3.
Insole 1:
Insole 1 was a resin and sponge based insole, the main body of which was a honeycomb like resin skeleton with sponge inset. The sponge was filled with culture liquid so that the engineered E. coli strains can grow in it. This insole had four layers, in the middle was the main body. It was covered by the bacterial filter membrane which can prevent the bacterial from escaping. Outer were the sponge layer and skin care cloth layer.
When we finished it. We took some samples to do an investigation out of our lab. People said: OK. Interesting, yet your insole was so tough and inflexible that may be uncomfortable for people to use. After thinking deeply about people’s feedback. We decided to make a thorough change. So we designed another hydrogel based insole—the second insole.
Insole 2:
This insole was made of a kind of high mechanical strength hydrogel, which was tough enough for people to stand on it as well as flexible and soft enough to provide a better user experience. Also it had four layers, yet there was only one sponge layer which was beneath the hydrogel main body.
When we produced it, again, we went to the community to chat with people to collect the feedback of it. When we brought the samples to people, they were highly think of. People said: well, amazing soft insole! And they showed great willingness to try it on. Also, we had collected several constructive suggestions. Such as: “Your hydrogel insoles maybe a bit cold for people to use in winter.”Or “"

1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: Researcher safety, Public safety, or Environment safety?
For the researcher safety, our members are trained by all the safety regulations before we start the experiments. Based on our experimental design, all facilities in the laboratory are performed in Biosafety Level 2 and the materials we use are E.coliTop 10, Salmonella typhimurium VNP, Melanoma B16F10 and the laboratory mice.  Since the Salmonella Typhimurium VNP is infectious, we take some measures to ensure the safety of our team members when we conduct the experiments with the bacteria.  During all the experiments, all the instructions are posted and the workers are requested to wear the nitrile gloves, lab coats and masks.  Moreover, a room is separated for the experiments and the bacteria are kept in a special place.  Normal safety protocols are observed for experimental procedures.  Except for those normal procedures that the team can deal with on a daily basis, we will also use the ultraviolet light in our experiments, so we arrange different people to do this work to reduce the average time each member contacting with it.  As for the public and environment safety, we always keep the products in the cell cultures to avoid their spread to the outside and check their conditions regularly.  At the same time, we also dispose those products according to the protocols.
2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues?
NO, none of the new BioBrick parts we made would raise any significant safety issues since all the genes we use commonly exist in E.coli Top 10 and Salmonella Typhimurium VNP. Although the modified bacteria have some advantages compared with the wild type, their abilities are only enhanced in terms of tumor targeting.  Therefore it’s still safe for us to use and manipulate the bacteria.  Given that we always keep the bacteria in the cell cultures, there is no chance for them to contact with the outside so it’s harmless for the environment.
3.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, our team is supported by the Department of Life Science, NanjingUniversity.  So we are"

Troubleshooting for Lack of Proper Tube Labeling
We plated our constructs in all three cell types(DH10, Keio Wild, and Keio ClpP) on Kanamycin, Tetracycline, Chloramphenicol, and Ampicillin. We were testing to verify what backbones the plasmids were in.  As the image shows, our cells grew in most of the plates resistant to the specific antibiotics.  We are in the process of figuring out how we obtained these results, but we hypothesized that our cells contain constructs with all the vectors with backbones resistant to those antibiotics.
Sequencing Results
The R0011 ClpX part of our DNA construct was sent in for sequencing and confirmed to be matching DNA through Eurofins MWG Operon.
The ClpP B0033 CI part of our DNA construct was also sent in for sequencing and confirmed to be matching DNA through Eufofins MWG Operon.
Expected Results
Keio Wild Strains: In the Keio Wild Strains, we assembled two constructs - one with a degradation tag, and one without a degradation tag. Since ClpXP can only degrade proteins that have been tagged, we expect our plates with the degrons to have a lower concentration of purple cells than the plates without the degrons. The following graph shows the relationship between time and expected concentration of purple cells for the Keio Wild strain; “T” represents the time at which the cells were induced by IPTG.
Keio ClpX Knockout Strain: In this strain, ClpX will be knocked out and ClpP will be allowed to function. ClpX is responsible for de-linearizing the target protein into its primary structure and then translocating it into a proteolytic cavity in ClpP. Since ClpX will not be expressed, the chromoprotein will not be de-linearized and hence prevent ClpP from degrading the primary structure of the protein. With this in mind,"

Any cells that express streptavidin on the surface of the cell should fluoresce in their assay - concordantly, when cells were incubated with this biotin-oligo-fluorescein aptamer, the author saw fluorescence on cells expressing Lpp-OmpA-Streptavidin, but not on Lpp-OmpA negative control.  However, cells that expressed streptavidin on the surface also bound to the negative aptamer control (oligo-fluorescein) that lacked biotin, indicating that the oligo aptamer itself (and not biotin) may have been responsible for the association of the fluorophore to the cell surface.  Thus, the Harvard 2006 iGEM team was never able to definitively show specific affinity of their Lpp-OmpA-streptavidin construct.

Based on these experiments, we decided to try using this display system for our project.  But since binding of the system to streptavidin had not be definitively shown, we wanted to verify binding of the Lpp-OmpA-streptavidin construct to biotin for ourselves, and characterize this interaction.

What's more , they designed a new way to help E.coli grow better by using VHB and the TorA signal sequence. After that, they combined with another group to build up the plasmid with CI system and explore its effect. At last, they tried their best to fuse all our basic parts to create the final part.

MODELING
We attempt to describe, in a precise way, an understanding of the elements of a system of interest, their states, and their interactions with other elements.
Overview
We perform deterministic and stochastic mathematical modeling alongside wet lab experiments, and the calculated channel capacity values from models and experimental data fit well with each other. The ability to precisely transmit information is crucial for biological process, which is quantitatively evaluated by channel capacity, a novel concept in information theory. Structure differences of gene regulatory circuits give rise to different capacities and, in turn, different levels of information certainty and reliability. Specifically, although splitting the expressed protein into two halves that can assembly to form dimer provides more flexible functions and other regulatory benefits, it curtails the information capacity compared to expressing the undivided protein. Adding intein sequence to the two parts, however, compensated for the loss of capacity by making the association process irreversible. Simulation results tie in with data measured from synthetic gene regulatory circuits"

Collaborations
How can Iron Guardian affect the world? This is the question we asked ourselves. And how can synthetic biology affect the world? That is the question we want to ask all iGEMers. To answer this, we collaborated with different teams from different parts of the world and learnt different lessons. Though the subjects iGEMers are working on vary from team to team, we all wish to utilize synthetic biology to solve practical problems and create a positive contribution to the world, and collaboration, without any doubt, is the best way for us to NOT ONLY KNOW MORE about other projects, BUT TRULY PLAY A PART in them, and unite us together to serve the world.
3+ net
As an increasingly powerful tool, synthetic biology can help us solve many practical problems, and the use of genetically engineered bacteria for environmental bioremediation is currently one of the most economic methods. However, the limited application scenarios and biosafety concerns always pose a barrier to the practical use of genetically engineered bacteria. As a team under the track of environment, ECUST raised the new concept of “3+ net” (Applications+, Biosafety+, Society+), collaborated with other teams under the same track and put forward some guidelines in order to help us better understand our situation and improve our projects. The Application+ part consists of two aspects. One is to develop specific protocol on how to eliminate the resistance of chassis and utilize essential genes to prevent the plasmid loss, and the other one is to make a list to summarize the non-antibiotic selection systems for different chassis organisms and make detailed records on how to construct them. Biosafety+ involves developing biosafety regulations on remediation by genetically engineered bacteria (RGEB) based on opinions from iG"
Cambridge-JIC,2015,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Autofocus_-_-_TEXT.html," and multiple methods exist for calculating the focus score. In addition, there are many ways to scan around for the best focus score. The challenge was to find the most robust solutions. Below is an outline of the development process:
Tested out focus scores based on variance, as this was recommended by both sources [1][2] on artificially blurred out images (Gaussian blur with different standard deviations). This worked well. Variance was chosen as the focus measure to implement since it is quick to evaluate (speed being an important priority), and numpy (a Python library) has a function that does this already.
Implemented an autofocus method for multi-resolution search (described in source [2], section 16.3.3).
Implemented DWT ( Discrete Wavelet Transform ) to decompose image to low resolution versions. This was expected to allow for faster computation and autofocusing. In practice, there was no significant computational advantage to this, so low-res images were not used in the final algorithm.
Having been able to determine a focus score for an image, the next step was to develop methods for finding the most in-focus position. This involves several important issues:
Delays from moving the motor to receiving an updated frame - this is a common issue with feedback loops, everywhere from biological systems to adjusting the temperature of the shower. Failure to deal with this can result in oscillations around the set point, with the image remaining just out of focus most of the time. We dealt with this by introducing a delay between sending a ""move motor"" command and a ""read focus score"" command to attempt to match the two. Reading a focus score when the motors were no longer moving is not an issue, but reading a value before the desired position has been reached is. Thus, it is beneficial to err on the side of an increased counter-delay, though at the expense of the time for autofocus to take place.
Unreliability of motor positioning - when moving +400 steps and then -400 steps, there is no guarantee of returning to exactly the same position.
Local maxima not being the global maxima - A more theoretical issue than the practical ones above. Once reaching an area of high focus value, there is little guarantee that this is the most focused plane in the image. This is in contrast to the issue above - if we ""give up"" an area of high focus, we may find it difficult to retrieve it. We ignored this issue in favour of the more practical ones above - attempting to account for global maxima of focus scores would require the autofocus procedure to be far longer than desirable. We also implemented a naive dynamic"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Air Samples Testing for ICT-Mumbai
ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

BGU_ISRAEL,2016,Team:BGU ISRAEL#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," an insult to the creation of the world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care for God's creation. However, humans are regarded as having a special place in the created order, and their well-being is                                  paramount. Humans are not seen as just another part of the ecosystem, so moral decisions about environmental issues have                                  to take account of their well-being.
After meeting Prof. Glick, we were eager to learn more about how Judaism deals ethical issues regarding scientific research                                 and progress. We found a quote from Rabi Moshe Ben Maimon (Maimonidas), a philosopher, scientist, polymath and one of the                                  most important adjudicators in the Jewish religion that lived in the Middle Ages :""If men possessed wisdom, which stands                                  in the same relation to the form of man as the sight to the eye, they would not cause any injury to themselves or to others,                                 for the knowledge of the truth removes hatred and quarrels, and prevents mutual injuries"". Maimonidas didn’t see any future                                 harm in the search for wisdom as he derived that the search and common goal cancels any violent notion.
Judaism holds an ambivalent opinion regarding genetic engineering and technologic innovation. It indicates the need of                                 finding a balance between the human's wellbeing and preserving the creation. These principals are much alike some aspects                                  in the modern approach towards bioethics.
Ethical concerns regarding the PlastiCure project
Familiarizing with the GMO concept, we discovered that there is a discrepancy between the way the public perceive bioethics                                 and the way it is studied and practiced. Reaching the public in various events, we made an effort to explain the safety                                  precocious we took in order to prevent health and environment hazards. Furthermore, we explained our motivation for working                                 with modified microorganisms to solve the problem of plastic pollution. We realized that measured ethical risks must be                                 taken in our project. Therefore, we designed several approaches to address these risks. For example:
Bacterium self - destruction switch mechanism that was developed by BGU iGEM Team 2013,                                      And allows to control the life time of the modified organism.
Enforced symbiosis between our two types of bacteria that do not allow them to survive                                      separately on PET out of our controlled system.
PlastiCure, BGU iGEM team conducted research from pure motives. Our goal was to find plastic waste a solution.                                 One of our main guide lines is to create a safe and controlled work environment. Therefore, we followed strict                                 safety rules that enable us to ensure minimum mistakes"

After the meeting, we talked about our project and he praised our achievement so far. From the visiting, our team get a lot of information, we consider the different strategies to promote the completeness of project.
The Central China iGEMers’Consortium(CCiC),Wuhan,China
OUC-China has received the invitation mail from Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.
In 23th Aug.2014,We arrived at Huazhong Agricultural University, and begin the two days of communication and presentation.
It is a good chance for us to share our ideas with others, and then we got more advice and comments. These information we gain is the greatest wealth. Our project will get better in the other team's encouragement
In this time, we have established a link with the other team and promoted our friendship.
Communication with other iGEM teams
We invited Beijing Normal University iGEM team to visit our university. We had a discussion on our projects, and exchanged gifts to each other.
We activated and sent two standard biological parts of gas vesicle genes , GvpA and GvpC to Peking iGEM team. And we have helped Peking to test the function of the two parts to make bacteria float.
Camps & Class & Lecture
4th summer camp of life science and technology
This is our fourth year organizing the Science and Technology Camp, aiming at the new sophomore students. In order to let them know more synthetic biology knowledge, we gave them a speech about Synthetic biology. The speech is meanly about what is synthetic biology? What is iGEM? How synthetic biology benefits our life? What if synthetic biology is misused by terrorists? During the camp we gave them a small jamboree. We created the right atmosphere as a International meeting. We should believe the members get a lot about Synthetic biology.
In order to raise the association about team members, especially to the sophomores who are full of enthusiasm to study synthetic biology, we organized some games. It could make them get along better.
Small jamboree. In this spirit of harmony and peace，we talked about all kinds of things. The poster reception attracted many students around the campus, filling the members with satisfaction from completing their own project.

Therefore, the assembly was concluded to have yielded properly assembled plasmids for all inserts, except insert 2. However, both assembly of insert 2 and insert 4 were discarded due to time constraints. Finally, the colonies 1.5, 3.5, 5.1 and 6.2 were picked for further sequencing, where all of them were confirmed to contain the exact desired sequence.
Purification of four TDPs
After the sequencing results had corroborated a successful cloning, the next step was to evaluate whether the resulting plasmids would produce the expected proteins. For protein purification, the assembled plasmids were transformed into the protein expression strain BL21 (DE3). Subsequently, the TDP purification protocol was executed and the final protein concentration was measured with a Bradford assay . The concentrations of the resulting protein solutions ranged from 1 to 3 g/L.
We ran SDS-PAGE gels for all four proteins. Additionally, we included a protein solution resulting from the purification of the bacterial strain featuring the same backbone as our BioBricks. As depicted in Figure 26, the samples from the purified TDPs led to a series of additional bands absent in the control, indicating that we successfully produced and isolated all four tardigrade-specific proteins.

In addition to SDS-PAGE of the purified protein solutions, the identity of the proteins was also confirmed by mass spectrometry. To do this, a sequence unique to each TDPs’ amino acid sequence was chosen and screened for their presence in the proteome of the expression strain, BL21 (DE3). Subsequently, four cell cultures expressing a different TDP each were used to screen for all chosen sequences by mass spectrometry (MS) (see samples preparation) and an additional culture only featuring the same backbone (pSB1C3"

Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, P(3HB), a kind of PHAs is synthesized by three enzymes.
The A gene encodes for the 393 amino acids protein, 3-ketothiolase(PhaA).
The B1 gene encodes for the 246 amino acids protein, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase(PhaB).
The C1 gene encodes for the 589 amino acids protein, PHA Synthase(PhaC).
These three enzymes can use Co-A as a substrate to produce P(3HB). iGEM team Tokyo Tech2012 designed and synthesized phaC1-A-B1gene sequence BBa_K934001, and expressed via constitutive promoter.
In order to make the production process more controllable, we added heat-sensitive promoter(BBa_K873002) and arabinose inducible promoter(BBa_I0500) to phaC1-A-B1 gene sequence(BBa_K934001), constructing the heat and arabinose inducible parts(BBa_1891015) and(BBa_1891016). Finally we linked the newly synthesized parts to the standard vector pSB1C3. The new plasmids can be used directly for heat shock and arabinose induced expression in E.coli.

Plasmid proliferation
We transformed the official plasmid phaC1-A-B1(BBa_K934001), HSP(BBa_K873002), and pBAD(BBa_I0500) into Trans 5α for plasmid extraction. The agarose gel result showed that the plasmids were all in their correct size.

After ‘assembling’ their new BabbleBricks together, another group had to decode this sentence. The participants said that doing the interactive activity helped engage them and as non-experts at biology they felt it made our project clearer to them.
Over the course of our Fresher’s Week and first week of Lectures we gave talks to various student groups. The first was a talk to new Biological Sciences first years as part of their welcome talk. This was great as we were able to introduce iGEM to a cohort of new students and explain to them what we had been working on over the summer.
We also gave presented to two student societies: Synthetic Biology Society and Edinburgh University Young Scientific Researchers Association. This was great as we were able to share BabblED with those interested in synthetic biology and scientific researchers from disciplines ranging from biology to computer science to physics to psychology. It was great to hear everyone’s feedback and get them excited about what were doing!
Doors Open Day
Every year, Edinburgh hosts its Doors Open Day: a day in which many paid attractions in the city open their doors to the public for free. The University of Edinburgh King’s Buildings opened their doors to the community and invited anyone that was interested in the research happening at the University to come and learn more.
Here, we had a stall set up with our poster, a demonstration of our encode/decode software and an interactive game. This was a fantastic opportunity for public engagement as we interacted with a wide audience. Some people to vist our stall were adults or young students looking to study at the university; this was a great time to present our poster to them and let them know about the potential opportunities for research as an undergraduate. Others were children that approached our stall to play with our blocks (pictured). This was good fun because we were often able to engage the children with the interactive activity while chatting to the parents in more detail about our project.
Public Debate with Dundee iGEM
In October, we hosted a public debate in collaboration with the Dundee iGEM team and the Dundee and Edinburgh University Debate Unions. The motion of the debate was “This House Would Ban the Development of GMO Food and Products”. As synthetic biologists and scientists we obviously already have our own opinions on this topic, however, it was very engaging to listen to the debate team and their arguments. Each side was composed of a mixture of Edinburgh and Dundee debating students and within this, there was a variety of academic backgrounds.

Through the school visits we achieved two aims: firstly, we educated pupils about synthetic biology and promoted iGEM and secondly, we were able to inspire students about biology, biotechnology and synthetic biology.
United Kingdom
In September we teamed up with Warwick iGEM to give five lessons at Newman College in Oldham. We designed two different presentations to present to different age groups; one on going to university and studying science for ages 14-15 as well as one on synthetic biology and our iGEM projects for ages 16-17.
As many of the students were of an age where they start thinking about whether or not to go to university, we thought it was important to give them an insight into university life and how exciting it can be to study science. Furthermore we wanted to show them how the science they learn at school can be relevant and related to real life problems and projects such as iGEM. We also had the chance to teach a year 11 science class taking the chance to talk in a bit more detail about synthetic biology and our projects.
We found the whole day to be a great experience during which we got the chance to share our passion for science and guage interest for synthetic biology in young people. The feedback and questions we received from both students and teachers were very positive and showed us that our presentations were successful. It was also a great pleasure to be able to meet another iGEM team ahead of the Giant Jamboree and get an insight into their project.
Open Day
In June we had the chance to spread the love for synthetic biology and spark an interest in Parkinson’s disease at a two day event hosted by the Faculty of Life Sciences. At our stand we offered activities such as optical illusions to show how the brain works. We explained the disease process of Parkinson’s as well as the current treatment and how our project might benefit patients.
800 people visited the Community Open Day day over the two days including school children, families as well as academics.The University of Manchester Faculty of Life Sciences Community Open Day allowed the team to educate general public on synthetic biology, genetic engineering, genetically engineered microorganisms and neuroscience. During the day the team distributed a sociological survey for later analysis and received preliminary feedback on DopaDoser.

Ischemic and hypertensive heart disease were the leading causes of death in the world over the past decade. Over 7.4 million people were dead of these diseases in 2012 and the number is increasing. Patients and their families suffer from the diseases. It also left a heavy burden to government and society. This summer, we tried to solve the problem with our knowledge in synthetic biology.
The discovery of Nitric oxide (NO) as an endogenous signaling molecule and as a mediator of the cardiovascular effects was acknowledged by the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine in 1998. NO activates sGC by binding to its prosthetic heme group and thereby catalyzing the synthesis of cGMP. As a critical second messenger molecule, cGMP regulates many vital homeostatic mechanisms, i.e. endothelial cell permeability, vascular smooth muscle contractility and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
Understanding of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway has initiated significant translational interest, but this was almost exclusively embodied by the use of NO donors and PDE5 inhibitors. NO donors are not ideal for chronic treatment of heart diseases because of partial patient response, development of tolerance over time and short retention in the plasma. The use of PDE inhibitors is also likely to be limited as the efficacy of such molecules is dependent on endogenous cGMP generation. We therefore thought that it may be beneficial to ‘think outside the box’ to target the NO-sGC-cGMP axis using molecular medicines.
3. Project
3.1 Over Expression of sGC
Dysfunction of NO signaling is related to many pathological disorders, such as myocardial hypertrophy, arterial hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, atherosclerosis and restenosis. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is a critical enzyme in NO-sGC-cGMP pathway, which catalyzes the production of cGMP from GTP. In this project, we aimed to up-regulate the concentration of cGMP by the overexpression of sGC to enhance the function of NO signaling pathway. SGC is a heterodimeric protein, contains two subunits: α and β. Both α and β subunits have a few different isoforms. We overexpressed the α3 (GUCY1A3) and β3 (GUCY1B3) isoforms because they are the most abundant forms in the cardiovascular system.

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," biofilms. The same regulations do not apply for printing biofilms, because experiments do not involve any human or other living test subjects (except bacteria). In this sense, it is easier and cheaper for industry to work with biofilms. Another dimension is safety. Clinical testing is strongly regulated because it poses significant health and environmental risks. When testing a printed biofilm, there is no live test subject, and therefore minimal safety risks.
Another regulatory field we consider is bioprinting. Bioprinting is a highly debated topic, because it is new and unexplored, with various moral, financial and political interests at stake (Mearian, 2014). Conflicts mostly exist in the area of tissue printing with human cells (or other living cells). Bacterial bioprinting is not yet regulated - we propse that bacterial bioprinting adopt regulations of different fields. By merging regulations of bioprinting and biofilms, we assume that environmental and human safety, biodiversity, and legal ownership issues are taken in account. One field offers control over printed items while the other control over bacteria used to print items. Moreover, the open-source character of our project allows for transparency - science,  regulatory and societal stakeholders can contribute to shaping 3D biofilm printing in a responsible and safe way for the future.
In conclusion, our 3D biofilm printing may be a future alternative to clinical testing, a safer and less controversial option for testing biofilms and anti-biofilm products.There is less controversy because there are no living test subjects involved. The Biolink project is driven by regulations that help control harmful bacteria and ensure that no ownership issues arise with printed items. Depending on what types of bacteria are used to print the biofilms, if the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status is granted, 3D biofilm printing is allowed.
Synthetic Biology & Biolink: Risks and ethical aspects
It is important to address relevant social and ethical issues right from the start of any project. We will describe the ethical issues related to iGEM in general and to the open-source technologies we have developed: the DIY printer in combination with the bacterial bioink.
Let us begin with an example that illustrates why it is essential to consider ethical issues. In 2014, the Belgian firm Ecover announced that they wanted to shift from palm kernel oil to a more sustainable basic ingredient for their soap products; an oil produced by algae (The Ecover Team, 2014). These algae were a product of synthetic biology. Palm kernel oil is considered to be an important cause of deforestation of"

We taught them basic biological and engineering concepts as well as presented our project and most importantly gave them an insight into the everyday life of an iGEMer and into a synthetic biologist’s world. Furthermore, video interviews were conducted of the team members to be put on their website.This insight will be used on their web page, reaching a large audience of non-biologists. This collaboration not only helped put synthetic biology at the forefront of the general public but it also gave us an opportunity to interact with people who will be affected by the research outcomes and applications of our project, giving us both context to our work and allowing us to take a reflexive step back.
Our presentation to the research club
CIUP  Research Club at Cité universitaire
We presented at the monthly reunion of CIUP, the club of international young researchers based in Paris. We were able to introduce our project as well as talk to many researchers about applying our tool in their respective fields. We talked to bioinformaticians about how data can be lacking for population genetics and how our tool could be used to study the specific evolution over time of populations within a microenvironment. We talked to Neurologists about using protein photocaging to help map the brain in fine resolution. We talked to civil engineers about creating remote controlled building surfaces using light controlled bacteria. This chance gave us the opportunity to better understand the impact of our tool and forced us to broaden our vision in terms of the applications of our device.
Solutions for open Sciences at Institut Pasteur
We went to the Solution for open Sciences at the Institut Pasteur, where we had to present a poster about our project. We introduced MEDUSA to scientists from various fields, mostly not familiar with synthetic biology, which led to very interesting discussion. Furthermore, we were able to talk about our poster itself, and obtained real advice on how to improve it for the Jamboree.

This part  is designed for immediate generation of large amount of curli fiber after the adding  of the inducer, and a stronger promoter for CsgA was chosen to parallel with  BBa_K1361002. This part cannot function alone without expression of CsgEFG  genes in the same cell, for they coding the outer membrane channel secrete  system for CsgA and CsgB.
BBa_K1361007
This part contains the major subunit of  curli fiber CsgA-his CsgA modified by His tag) and its  nucleator CsgB, in which CsgA-his is constitutive expression whereas CsgB is  under the control of Pbad promoter. This part is designed for immediate generation  of large amount of curli fiber after adding of the inducer and the purification  of CsgA by Ni-NTA reign, or absorbing Au-NTA-Ni nano partical. This part cannot  function alone without expression of CsgEFG genes in the same cell, for they  coding the outer membrane channel secrete system for CsgA and CsgB.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Secret_-_-_TEXT.html," team decided to share its enthusiasm with the other teams to participate in the Interlab Measurement Study. The aim of this study was to construct specific devices combining a promoter with the GFP and subsequently to measure and to analyse the fluorescence. By carrying out this study we hope we could join the scientists around the world to contribute to the worldwide fluorescence database.

Wiki
It is important to record the scientific discoveries and make it available to the public to keep them updated about our findings. But the most challenging job is to make the wiki user friendly and interactive. We tried our best possible to make our wiki simple and easy to understand. Creating an iGEM wiki takes a lot of work from the entire team: creating, writing, proof reading to make sure everything is in the right place and no errors where made. We can only say that we used some fingerspitzengefühle in this wiki.
Survey
Can synthetic biology have a positive influence on the environment? Can DNA be patented? What kind of applications are socially acceptable? These are the kind of questions which often characterize a social debate. The social debate about synthetic biology is in a much further stage in the USA than in Europe. On top of that, there are numerous important social organisations and public groups who didn’t formulate a clear opinion about synthetic biology. This implicates that the current debate didn’t evolve in a particular direction which makes it even more interesting to carry out a survey on the current perception of synthetic biology. This survey was conducted among Belgian citizens, older than 18 (focus group) and led to 352 responses. For more information, please check out the outreach page.

The power of Models
The fascinating properties of pattern creating bacteria may be translated into the language of mathematics. In this subsection we are investigating the equations behind the behaviour of the genetically modified organisms created in the wetlab. We do so using a layered approach. Colony level modeling employs partial differential equations to describe large cell groups which are treated as a continuum. Internal level models describe the interactions that happen within single cells. Finally the hybrid model merges the two approaches into a final description of our pattern forming cells.

Creating an iGEM project requires hard work in many fields. Obviously research in literature, simulations executed by the modeling team and practical work in the wet lab are necessary. We also want to pass our knowledge to future generations and iGEM teams. Therefore we developed a wiki, communicated our project in the media and taught primary and highschool students more about our project and"

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#blogtest_-_-_TEXT.html," Plasmid assembly, Bead production
Wednesday, July 30th
We designed two possibilities for the chip: either cells laying on agar or punched cylinders in the agar.
Comsol simulations of a part of the future chip, in two different designs : droplets of cells laying on the agar or introduced in a punched cylinder in the agar. Cells are producing AHL which diffuses through the channels.
8 out of 21 plasmids were positively sequenced. 7 further plasmids are sent for sequencing.
We will start cross-talk experiments this week. It should help us choose an orthogonal AHL pair among three different quorum sensing systems.
We have started to learn bead production.

Week 9: First simulations, Skype with Paris Bettencourt, Chip fail
Wednesday, July 23rd
We started to simulate diffusion experiments on a Comsol model. We consider cells will lay on agar for the moment.
We will have a chip with these four different channels 1 to 4 mm long. The model still has to be refined because at the moment it doesn't take into account internal/external concentrations of AHL.
Our first mold didn't enable us to peal the PDMS correctly. We have to make it less deep.
5 of 8 regulator plasmids are done. We have to repeat construction of producer plasmids.
Parameter estimation for integrases is not working at the moment.
We skyped with Paris Bettencourt for human practice collaboration and are participating to their newsletter project.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,", our project will be continued by the group supervising us (the Brouns lab, TU Delft), with a perspective for funding through the Partnership for Clean Competition collaborative. Regardless of this grant, they will continue with one highly important part of our method: the targeted sequencing method based on our innovative Transposase-dxCas9 fusion protein . With this method effective and validated, a complete method for gene doping detection is possible.
Our final step
Our final step is implementation by convincing the WADA Laboratory Expert Group of the efficiency and scientific validation of the method. Taking into account the time needed to be awarded the PCC grant and to optimize our experimental protocols, we aim to convince this group to implement our method within three years.
Broader Interest
During our customer discovery process, we spoke with other parties that could be interested in implementing (part of) our project. We investigated both doping use in the equestrian sports with the Dutch Trotting and Flatracing Association and application of our targeted sequencing approach outside of the anti-doping field with Dutch Blood bank Sanquin , exploring opportunities for less invasive prenatal screening, and the Dutch Research Department for Food Safety at Wageningen University and Research (RIKILT) for food safety applications.
Dutch Trotting and Flatracing Association
We investigated the need for and interest in a gene doping detection method for equestrian sports with the Dutch Trotting and Flatracing Association (Nederlandse Draf- en Rensport, or NDR). We spoke with Mr. Camiel Mellegers of the NDR, who is in charge of doping testing for the Dutch matches in Trotting and Flatracing. He has explained to us that anti-doping policies differ in quite a few ways between human and equestrian sports. We will shortly discuss the differences that are relevant to the case of gene doping.
The threat of gene doping is a worrying topic in equestrian anti-doping. It is one of the topics discussed on October 8th of 2018 in the 52nd International Conference of Horseracing Authorities in Paris, France ( Chesser, 2018 ).
The anti-doping criteria in horse racing are stricter than in humans. The human anti-doping list consist of substances that check two of the three criteria of increasing performance enhancement, endangering athlete or community health and being against the spirit of sports. Equestrian sports are stricter; they do not allow any substance that is not naturally present in the body of the horse or that is present in elevated concentrations. Mellegers explained to us that this is because horses"

Feasibility Assessment
Due to the large scale use of our test, calculating a cost was important. Cell free kits are currently expensive to buy. Due to time constraints this is the method that our team used during our project, a method that would not be sustainable if our test was to be manufactured and used. To understand and try to combat this, we collaborated with Bielefeld iGEM 2015, a team who have been working on developing their own cell free kit. After multiple Skype meetings they sent us a spreadsheet with a cost breakdown for each cell free reaction using what they have developed. See the cost section on the design page of our wiki for more information.
End-User Assessment
One of the most interesting aspects of our project is how our test would be used. For vets it offers a faster and more accurate way to diagnose bTB infected cattle. Currently with the Tuberculin skin test there is a 72 hour period from injection to detection. This means bTB testing is highly time consuming and also limited. Phil explained how his practice can only bTB test from Monday to Wednesday in order to allow for sufficient time to pass before the second part of the test can be done during his practices working week. As our test would offer a result in a matter of hours, a whole farm could be completed within one day of bTB testing. Dick explained how his vets are able to test up to 1000 cows a day, yet these cows then have to be diagnosed three days later. The benefit of our test for his practice was the idea that our test would mean the whole testing routine could be completed within one day. Not only does this save his vet's time, it also saves a lot of hassle for the farmer as herding and bringing in cattle only once as opposed to multiple times is significantly easier.
Furthermore containing our test within the current blood sample collection tubes means there is no new technology being introduced to the primary end user, the vets. Blood collection is uniform across veterinary practice and our test does not require any additional training, due to the considerations we made when designing our prototype .
Away from the veterinary side, our test could have potential application for use by farmers as an animal health management tool. Michael Ross explained to us how the UK is in a situation with bTB where everyone has a reliance on everyone else. Farmers have to rely on the testing regime that is run by vets, and the testing regime is set centrally at a government level by the Department for Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs. In New Zealand the Animal Health Board (the body responsible for the mass progress in bTB"

We saw the results of our second electroporation today. Again, strains TT9901 and TT9907 took up the plasmid by electroporation, but the TT25281 transformation was again unsuccessful. We don't know what's wrong. Last time around I failed to push the cuvette entirely into the probes of the electrophorator. This time however, we know we followed the protocol correctly ...
In reference to strains TT9901 and TT9907, which were successful transformations from the first time, yesterday we swabbed these strains and grew them in overnight test tubes at 37 degress. The medium we used was LB Amp/Arabinose. We were hopeful that the following day (that's today) we would not see any turbidity, because the arabinose would have induced the expression of CRO, inducing Lambda to its lytic cycle. However, today we found disappointing results: our overnights were saturated with bacterial growth. This assay isn't of course the best way to test whether our system is working, but as it was intended to at least give us a ballpark gauge as to the functionality of our clone, we are concerned that something is not right.
5/29/13
-KP KK Today we plated TT9907 and TT9901. We plated them on LB arabinose/amp/x-gal plates. We plated different concentrations of TT9907 and TT9901 on each of the plates. We added 50, 100, and 300 microliters onto each plate. We will check"

Valencia_Biocampus,2014,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," RNAP-promoter do not change significantly (for example, the promoter     specific interaction only changes 16%, from 33 oC to 44 oC). We did not find any significant difference in the nucleotide     compositions of E. coli under stress [2]. Therefore, main variations in the transcription rate are due to the probability of RNAP-promoter bounds  $$ \begin{equation} r_T (T)=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{r_I(\Delta\epsilon)}+\frac{1}{r_E}}Prob_B (\Delta\epsilon, T) \propto Prob_B (T). \nonumber \end{equation} $$     On the other hand, down-regulation affects the expression level of our Biobrick, because it works as a housekeeping gene (with a normal constitutive promoter for the RNAP). For example, E. coli has a common σ factor for housekeeping genes (σ70), and, another one (σ32) for temperature     stress. In the case of temperature stress, the bacteria will synthetize σ32, which will bind RNA polymerase (RNAP) cores that won’t be free for σ70, and so     they will not be able to synthetize mRNA of the normal housekeeping genes.
Therefore, we just need to find a relation between the amount of σ factors and the expression level, which we derive next with thermodynamic arguments, and     also the variation of σ factors with temperature, which can be determined experimentally.
The RNAP is bound to a promoter (unspecific DNA) with $\epsilon_{S}$ ($\epsilon_{NS}$) free energy. There are  $N_{NS}$ nonspecific sites on the E. coli genome (sequences of 41bp) and R free E$\sigma$70, with $R \ll N_{NS}$ . The combinatory number of unbound states, with energy R$\epsilon_{NS}$, is  $$ \begin{equation} \frac{N_{NS}!}{R!(N_{NS}-R)!} \simeq    \frac{N^R_{NS}}{R!} . \nonumber \end{equation} $$ Similarly, the combinatory number with one bound state, with energy $\epsilon_{S}$+(R-1)$\epsilon_{NS}$, is  $$  \begin{equation} \frac{N_{NS}!}{(R-1)!(N_{NS}-R-1)!} \simeq    \frac{"

Peptide Aptamer Screening using Two-hybrid system
This is a project focusing on finding an alternative to the traditional antibody production. Currently, all marketed antibodies are made in vitro, by exploiting mammalian cell's immune system and its ability to produce antibodies against a certain antigen. Increasing demands implies the necessity of quicker methods to drive down the costs of production, both because of economical issues and the expense of animal lives. These are exactly the issues that we have been trying to accommodate. Sounds interesting, right?

Abstract
    Synthetic genetic oscillators have long been of interest to the scientific community. Our team has constructed a special oscillator gene circuit manipulating two quorum sensing autoinducers to change periodically, and reach their peak value alternately. Inspired by Enigma machine, we intend to use our oscillator circuit to make a biological cipher machine, which is able to encrypt and decipher information consisting of two basic elements. In our design, blue and red fluorescence stand for two basic elements of input and output. When one protein reaches its threshold value, a corresponding gene circuit will be triggered, either to retain the original element, or to change it to the other one. Using this method, we could realize the periodic conversion of a code book, which is hard to be deciphered. We hope this design can be an innovative attempt to apply synthetic biology to information safety from the aspect of interdiscipline.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Project#Appendix_-_-_TEXT.html," areas remain contaminated with explosive remnants of war (ERW). These are explosive weapons that somehow failed to detonate and are left behind. They pose dangers similar to landmines. These weapons continue to cause casualties long after the conflict has ended, and they hamper development and post-conflict reconstruction. Large stretches of land cannot be cultivated, medical systems are drained of resources by the cost of helping landmine/ERW casualties, and money must be spend on clearing mines instead of, for example education [8].
The amount of mine contamination as of October 2013 is shown in figure 1. As depicted in the figure, the most affected countries are current (Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan,Palestine) or former (Vietnam, Cambodia, the Balkans) war zones[9].
An example of the impact of old landmines and ERW is Vietnam. Although the Vietnam War is already over for decades, Vietnam is still suffering from the large-scale use of landmines during that conflict. In the period 1999-2012, landmines caused 1683 casualties, of which 630 were killed [8]. Another example of this problem can be found in the Balkans. Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina recently (May 2014) suffered major flooding. Due to landslides caused by this flood, landmines from the Bosnian War (1992-1995) resurfaced and dislodged, adding to the dangers of people living in the areas as well as rescuers [10][11].
SURVEY OF CASUALTIES
In 2012, a total of 3628 mine/ERW casualties were recorded; adding up tothis is more than ten casualties per day. At least 1066 people were killed and 2552 people were injured; for 10 casualties it was not known if they survived the incident. However, the true number of casualties is likely to be significantly higher, due to the fact that,because in many areas, plentya lot of casualties go unrecorded. Despite of this alarming factof this, the number of casualties decreased to the lowest level since 1999 (the start of documentation of casualties by the Landmine Monitor). The majority (78%) of the landmine casualties in 2012 were civilians. A substantial amount (47%) of the casualties in 2012 were children [8].
From all the countries affected, Afghanistan is the country with the most landmine casualties:766 killed and injured in 2012. Other countries with an alarming number of large casualties numbers include"

The goal of the iGEM InterLab Study is to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability                     in synthetic biology measurements, so that eventually, measurements that are taken in different labs                     will be no more variable than measurements taken within the same lab. 
This year, we use two orthogonal approaches to compute the cell count in our samples.
Converting between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads.
Counting colony-forming units (CFUs) from the sample.
Plate reader and CFU
Calibration protocol
Before we started the plate reader measurement, we obtained the OD600 reference point, the                         fluorescein fluorescence curve and the particle standard curve in the microplate reader to                         standardize the absorbance reading, cell-based fluorescence reading and the number of                         cells.
Our model was a SpectraMax M2e Plate Reader. For the plate reader our excitation and emission                         settings were 485 nm and 525 nm respectively (Same setting was used for all experiments                         below).
Cell measurement protocol
Transformation
We transformed the plasmids (listed below) resuspended from the Distribution Kit into E. coli                         DH5-alpha cells. Colonies were given 16 hours to grow.
2 colonies of each device were inoculated over night into 5 ml Luria-Bertani media with 25 μg/mL                         Chloramphenicol in a 37°C, 220 rpm shaking incubator. Cell cultures were diluted to a target                         OD600 of 0.02 into same LB medium in 50 mL falcon tube covered with foil before use Diluted                         cultures were further grown at 37°C and 220 rpm. At 0, and 6 hours of incubation, 500 μL aliquot                         was taken from each two colonies of the 8 devices and were placed immediately on ice to prevent                         further growth. At the end of sampling point, 4 replicates 100 μl of each sample was pipetted                         into a 96-well microplate with the arrangement. Data was imported into the Excel Sheet for                         submission.
Protocol: Colony Forming Units per 0.1OD600 E.coli cultures
This protocol can be calibrate OD600 to colony forming unit(CFU) counts, which are                         directly relatable to the cell concentration of the culture. At this protocol, we first Dilute                         our overnight culture to OD600 =0.1in 1ml of LB+Cam media. We further diluted the                         culture according"

Modeling Bacteria
Let´s get a closer look to the modeling of our Bacteria constructions.
Are you hungry?
The first model we did addressed our glucose-sensitive construction. We carried out three different experiments changing the carbon source, to see its influence.  First we used glucose (1) as the only carbon source. Then we added galactose (2) as an extra carbon source. Finally we put sodium acetate (3) as an extra carbon source instead of galactose. The use of alternatives to glucose is explained because  in previous tests we observed that low concentrations of glucose compromised cell growth. With the experimental data we fitted the following repressible Hill-like function.
And we estimated the following parameters for the 3 different conditions.
In figures 1, 2 and 3 we plot the models and experimental data for the three experiments with glucose (1), added galactose (2) and added sodium acetate (3) respectively. IPTG was added to all the experiments to induce expression.
Figure 1.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations.
Figure 2.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations with 3 g/l of Galactose added to the medium.
Figure 3.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations with 3 g/l of Sodium Acetatee added to the medium.
It is interesting to notice how the Hill coefficient increases  when adding Galatose and Acetate. From here we can hypothesize that having another source of carbon  makes the promoter more sensitive to changes in the glucose concentration, as the slope of the Hill function gets larger. Also the constant K decreases, which tell us that less glucose is necessary to de-activate the promoter when there is another carbon source.
Compare this results with Are you hungry? results .
Are you hot?
When analyzing the Heat Shock promoter, we decided to model the static transfer function of the Fluorescent Intensity as a result of the Temperature following the Hill-like equation:
In order to estimate the parameters of this model we performed a heat shock experiment.
Our first analysis corresponds to a heat shock applied during 10 minutes at different temperatures, ranging from 20ºC to 51ºC. For each temperature three samples were tested. Fluorescence Intensity (FI) and optical density"

Arshia controversially said, ""I don't think scientists should be given the use of metaphor - just like I, as a literary scholar, shouldn't be given the use of the red button!"". Samrajni asked, ""What if genetic engineering is like science's imagination?"". Arshia suggested, ""Synthetic biology is the construction of a causality, we are then a hair's breadth away from a narrative"". Zack countered, ""Synthetic Biology is taking myth and making history."" In fiction, we don't need to make it real to tell the story, but in science, we normally do. Synthetic biology is indeed built on a myth, that we can engineer life rationally, that the promises being made will come true. It's reverse engineering - now we have to fill in the truth to this mythology. Narrative can create many versions of the truth, opening up the space. There are many ways of being right.
In narrative, there is the celebration that what is being told isn't true, in science it's the opposite. The pursuit of science is constructed on the belief that it is for the greater good, it is not intended to hurt someone else (normally).
""Like giving to a blind man eyes"" From Darwin: A Life in Poems by Ruth Padel
Arshia suggested that synthetic biology perhaps is not about the creation of life, but about the translation of transferable identity. Could you clone a bacterial and transfer it's identity? This brought us back to the discussion about epigenetics, and Karma. ""Part of the discourse in India about cloning was what happens with karma.""
Precision is key - to work in this way we must know the mythology well, we must know its variants and the stories in detail. Each story has many ways to be told, from Valmiki to your grandmother's version, to the sanitised Amar Chitra Katha comics we've been looking at! You shouldn't tell a myth without knowing what it is about. But where do artists and amateurs come into the story? Do you have to be an expert? The interchangeability of vocabulary is something to consider... 'hybrid', 'transformation', 'experiment', the meanings of these words change. In science, each has a clear meaning, but we can use them in different contexts. You need to be an expert in the language to use it - its use differentiates science and art. How does that affect inter- or trans-disciplinary working?

Amino acid stock solutions were prepared according to Table 1. Briefly, amino acids were weighed in 2 mL tubes, dissolved in 5 M potassium hydroxide, and stored at -20oC. A 10x amino acid solution was prepared by mixing the stock solutions together in amounts according to Table 1, and the pH was adjusted to 7.9 with acetic acid. The solution was aliquoted to 1.5 mL and stored at -80oC.
Table 1: Concentrations for amino acid stock solutions (first column), 10x amino acid mix (second column), and for each CFPS system (third column).
The following solutions were prepared in autoclave sterilised MiliQ water and stored at -80oC: 100x magnesium glutamate solution (1.2 M magnesium glutamate), 10x salt solution (1.3 M potassium glutamate, 40 mM sodium oxalate, 10 mM ammonium acetate), 25x NTPS & co-factor mix (37.5 mM spermidine, 30 mM ATP, 21.25 mM GTP, UTP, and CTP, 25 mM putrescine, 8.25 mM nicotinamide diphosphate, 4.25 mg mL-1 E. coli tRNA (Roche), 0.85 mg mL-1 folinic acid, N xX co-enzyme A), 25x sodium pyruvate solution (825 mM sodium pyruvate, pH to 7.3 with potassium hydroxide), unless stated otherwise. A 5x CFPS supplement solution premix (5% v/v nuclease free water, 5% v/v magnesium glutamate solution, 50% v/v salt solution, 20% v/v NTPS & co-factor mix, 20% v/v sodium pyruvate solution, unless stated otherwise) was prepared and stored at -80oC. CFPS activity of systems prepared as above were tested by expression of 1.7 μg pSB1C3-J23100-sfGFP (Figure 2). Firstly, enough CFPS master mix was prepared for 7 reactions by mixing 112 μL cell extract, 70 μL CFPS supplement premix, and 21 μL amino acid solution in a 1.5 mL tube"

↓ GFP intensity was measured by a microplate reader at Ex/Em = 480/520 nm.
RESULT
The data represented in C6/36 cells showed that GAM1 promoter was not only activated by Gram-negative E. coli but also induced by Gram-positive B. subtilis.
GFP signal increased with bacteria concentrations
To verify the application of GAM1 promoter as a biosensor to measure the amounts of pathogens, E. coli at various concentrations were added onto the mosquito cells transfected with the GAM1-GFP-polyA / pSB1C3
EXPERIMENT
↓ C6/36 cells were seeded at the density of 1.8 x 105 cell/well in a 96-well plate
↓ Cells were transfected with GAM1-GFP-polyA or Ac5-GFP-polyA vectors
↓ E. coli at MOI=2, 4, 8, 16, 32 were added on 2 days post-transfection
↓ GFP intensity was measured by a microplate reader at Ex/Em = 480/520 nm.
RESULT
As figures shown above, the green fluorescence intensities driven by GAM1 promoter were increased dose-dependently in the presence of E. coli at MOIs from 2 to 32. The fluorescence expressed by Ac5 promoter was not influenced at the same condition. These results demonstrated GAM1-GFP reporter system can used in the mosquito cells as a biosensor in response of different concentrations of bacteria.
CONCLUSION
Taken together, we created a GFP reporter system driven under AMP promoter by Toll signaling. The expression of GFP can be induced by bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. The green fluorescence observed under microscope further proved the concept of GE mosquito cells as a pathogen surveillance tool.
Glowing mosquito with GAM1-GFP reporter and bacteria
To demonstrate in adult mosquitoes, we collaborated with iGEM Team NCHU_Taichung to microinject DNA into Aedes aegypti. We prepared the plasmid of GAM1-GFP-polyA / pSB1C3 and heat-killed E. coli. A member who works in Entomology Department of National Chung Hsing University take us to the mosquito lab and helped us inject the materials to the midgut of Aedes aegypti.
The mosquito injected with DNA plus E. coli showed fluorescence signal in Gel Imaging System and Blue LED Box.
