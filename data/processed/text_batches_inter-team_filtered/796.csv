Wetlab
The wet lab started at the beginning of summer and lasted for three months. Our wet lab work is divided into four parts, namely: (1) cell viability and fatty acid quantification, (2) fatty acid sensing mechanism, (3) mitochondrial leader sequence, and (4) construction of glyoxylate shunt. During the summer, lab work such as primer design, digestion, and ligation was carried out extensively and useful data were collected. These can be retrieved from Notebook and Protocols pages for details of experimental flows. The BioBrick, researcher, environmental and university safety issues can be found in Safety page. In terms of project process, some experiments could not be completed due to time constrains and they are outlined in Future Work page.

Leiden,2016,Team:Leiden#RNASeq_-_-_TEXT.html," RNAs observed in the 0.4g treatment include cold shock protein, heat shock protein and acid resistance membrane protein.
Difference between partial and microgravity
In the 0g treatment, multiple instances of antisense fliC showed trends towards overexpression, of which one was significant at p_FDR < 0.1. Antisense fliC inhibits flic mRNA, which codes for a part of the bacterium’s flagellum. Interestingly, previous research by NASA led researchers to conclude that flagella do not work in microgravity. It would appear that E. coli quickly adapts by saving energy on flagella development in microgravity, but not in partial gravity.
Conclusion
Genome annotation (GO) of the genes inhibited by the affected antisense RNAs in the 0.4g treatment shows that E. coli specifically appears to suffer from carbon-deprivation and acid stress. This could be attributed to the reduced or absent convection in partial and microgravity, respectively, leading to build-up of waste products. Additional evidence for this claim can be seen in the affected outer membrane lipoproteins, which are both significantly underexpressed for four antisense RNAs (p_FDR < 0.05) and significantly overexpressed in one mRNA (p_FDR < 0.1).

NKU_CHINA,2018,Team:NKU CHINA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," this, in our project PopQC was developed as a plasmid-based gene circuit, which continuously selects high-producers to optimize the biosynthetic performance for large-scale industrial production.
3. Introduction of Chassis Organism  
In our project, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 was chose to be the host of the plasmid of PopQC. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3, which is a gram-positive bacterium, was originally isolated from traditional fermented foods by Dr. Cunjiang Song’s lab to produce poly-γ-glutamate(γ-PGA). γ-PGA is a high value-added product which has good hydroscopicity and can be chemically modified. It has the potential to be applied into cosmetic, food, drug carrier and other fields. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 has a clear genetic background as our lab has already finished its genome sequencing in 2011. Its synthesis of poly-γ-glutamate (γ-PGA) is independent of exogenous glutamate, which can reduce the cost of production.
4. Our Design  
Here is the basic mechanism of PopQC we designed. In specific, we use the  promoter gltAB, the promoter grac, lacI gene and tetA gene to construct our circuit. In Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3, there exists the Glt operon which is responsible for intracellular glutamate synthesis. With a specific extracellular tetracycline concentration, if the intracellular glutamate concentration of this individual is low, the concentration of GltC protein will go up, which activates the promoter gltAB to express lacI. LacI protein furthermore repress the promoter grac and as a result, repress tetA expression. On the contrary, for high-producers, the concentration of intracellular GltC will go down, which represses the promoter gltAB to express lacI. Meanwhile, the tetA expression pathway is not affected. Therefore, high-producers will synthesize enough amount of tetracycline efflux pumps to maintain alive while low-producers won’t be able to survive. Consequently, the average intracellular concentration as well as the yield of glutamate among the population was enhanced, which will finally lead to the yield enhancement of γ-PGA in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3.
Our experiments are consisted with 4 parts.
Part 0 is to enhance the yield of glutamate by traditional metabolic engineering. We expected to enhance the promoter of icd and gltAB genes by constructing promoters in"
Wash_U,2009,Team:Wash U#Biological Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," absorbance spectrum of the engineered cells.
Though the context of the model can extend back to the transcription of PrrA/B genes involved in integration oxygen and light signals, a preliminary testing model was developed using assumptions of certain initial conditions to isolate the light signal's effect.  Since Cph8 and OmpR are located on the same transcript downstream of the puc promoter region, it was assumed that their associated protein and mRNA had already reached steady state concentrations, and the phosphorylation reaction had already reached steady state.  Moreover, the concentrations of the factors were assumed to be equal at this state.  The model whose diagram was constructed in the Simbiology Toolbox distributed by MathWorks details key reactions leading to the translation of the pucB/A genes.  The reaction rate equation used for the lack of phosphorylation of OmpR when the light signal reaches Cph8 bound to OmpR is captured in a modified form of Michaelis-Menten kinetics.  A logic function that corresponds to light ON/OFF (1/0) multiplies the maximum reaction rate in the numerator of the phosphorylation equation.  Thus, the model assumes that no phosphorylation occurs by this mechanism in the presence of light.  The OmpC promoter binding equation was based on the Hill Equation for an Activator(1).
Component characterization steps and literature searches are underway in order to obtain quantitative parameters for the reaction rates.  In order to simulate behavior of the system, putative values were included that exaggerate true concentrations and time scales.  OmpR was given an initial concentration normalized to one, and all other components were assumed insignificant initially to this value. An ideal light pulse was introduced at an instant and removed thirty simulation seconds later. From this rudimentary simulation it can be drawn that the nonlinearities of the phosphorylation and transcription factor binding kinetics effectively smooth the sharp light input.  By design, the light switch ON yields no phosphorylation of OmpR and repression of the pucB/A genes which would give rise to LH2.  Conversely, when left OFF, the concentration of pucB/A recovers and increases until the steady state determined by its translation and degradation rates.

Basic Circuits
○ Resistance subsystem
In this circuits, three functional genes, NhaA, NhaB and glsA, are employed for resisting both acidic and alkaline environment. NhaA and NhaB can encode two kinds of Na+/H+ antiporter, ensuring the survival of bacteria under alkaline circumstances. Under acidic condition, bacteria can maintain homeostasis due to the function of glsA ( details in project ). Since all these proteins of functional genes can be regulated by pH ( details in project ), the strong constitutive promoter J23119 is applied to guarantee the steady transcription of three functional genes. Thus, our resistance subsystem can make E.coli survive in an expanded pH range.
○ Regulation subsystem
In this subsystem, two pH-responsive promoters, P-asr and P-atp2, are employed. P-asr induces transcription in acidic environment from pH 4.0 ~ 5.0, and shows low activity at neutral pH. P-atp2 can respond at pH 7.0 ~ 9.0, especially at alkaline pH. These two pH-responsive promoters are applied to open the synthesis of acid and alkali. ldhA encodes an lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) which converts pyruvate to lactate. gadA, one of a functional genes for producing alkali, is used in our circuit to convert glutamate to GABA(γ-amino butyric acid), a certain kind of alkaline substance. This subsystem is used to regulate the external environment pH.
Fine-regulation circuits
○ Cre-LoxP & Flp-FRT circuits
In fermentation process, the environment usually turn acidic, so we produce alkali (γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) in the primary state. And alkali-induced promoter P-atp2 and acid-induced promoter P-asr are employed to produce the recombinase Cre and Flp respectively. When the pH of environment reaches the P-atp2’s responsive range, Cre would express and recognize the LoxP"

Agarose gel electrophoresis
To separate DNA fragments of different sizes, agarose flat-bed gels were casted in various concentrations (0.6% to 2% agarose in 0.5x TAE buffer). By applying an electrical field (10 to 20 V/cm), these gels were used for analytical or preparative separation. Therefore, the desired amount of agarose was boiled up in 0.5x TAE buffer until it was completely dissolved. After the solution cooled down to 50 to 60°C, it was poured into a flat-bed tray and ethidium bromide (EtBr) solution (0.5 µg/ml final concentration) was added. Finally, a comb was inserted to create pockets while solidification. The gel was put into the running buffer (0.5x TAE buffer) before the DNA mixture with loading buffer was loaded into the pockets and separated by electrophoresis. As ethidium bromide intercalates with the DNA (GC nucleotides) the resulting DNA-EtBr-complexes are visible under UV irradiation at 265 nm. As standard ladder for fragment sizes, 1kb+ ruler, 2-log ladder or 50 bp ladder were used.

Putting it to the test!
Having a circuit is only the start! Now we must test how well our circuit functions. For the Antibiofilm circuit, we need to test specifically for three things: the function of the Asr promoter, the function of YebF, and the function of lysostaphin and dispersin B.
Testing the Function of the Asr Promoter
For this test we constructed the following circuit in E. coli. We aim to elucidate the exact pH-activity relation by subjecting the circuit to conditions of various pH, and measuring activity via RFP fluorescence intensity, quantized in OD.
Here is the details of our method:
Transform the circuit to E. coli, and grow the modified E.coli on agar plates overnight.
Prepare three of each liquid culture tubes for pH values 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, and 7, and grow the selected strain in all tubes. Use the growth data from each tube to plot the precise effect of pH on the Asr promoter.
Measure the fluorescence value (RFP), and plot out curves.
Testing the Function of YebF
Since we also used YebF in [Control: Target] , we have done our functional assays there. Feel free to check it out if you’re interested!
Testing the Function of Lysostaphin and Dispersin B
For this part of the test, we designed a novel apparatus we called the [HOPErfusion] , which allowed us to culture S. mutans in real saliva (yes, real saliva!) and observe their biofilm formation. The HOPErfusion provided us with the most accurate representation of the human mouth that we could obtain!
Experimental Design
We have designed two circuits to treat the biofilm formed by S. mutans.
We cultured S. mutans overnight for 12 hours, and move cultured S. mutans to the modified slide glass which was coated by saliva(37°C, 1 hr). Then we used peristaltic Pump to drop BHI and saliva on slide glass to simulate the flowing atmosphere of oral cavity. All the experiments are conducted in our designed device, which is closed atmosphere mimicking the anoxic atmosphere.
To test whether our modified E. coli has the ability in decreasing formed biofilm, we put modified E. coli (circuit 1 and 2) to treat S. mutans for 12 hr, 24hr and 36hr. Finally, we did biofilm grow assay via crystal violet stain. biofilm"

Origin Story
The team was selected over a five day sandpit event, from February 16th to February 20th. About 30 keen volunteers showed up, and over the week we learned about iGEM, its mission, and what we would be setting out to achieve. We pitched ideas, looked at Human Practices for the first time, and got to know everybody. At the end of the week, the chosen project was voted as ‘radiation-sensitive bacteria’ that would be sent up into space to do… something.
The following week, the ten members who were chosen got the e-mail they were hoping for, and the team was born. It was glorious.
We were eager for fresh ideas, and many proposed projects were considered at informal meetings. We met with the supervisors on April 30th, and our list was whittled down to five promising ideas: building a novel one-gene toggle switch, building a sensor for metabolic load, looking into ‘bacterial glowsticks,’ getting bacteria to make dyes from plants, and getting them to make L-glucose. We split into five two-person groups to look into each one in more depth.
At this point in our story the record goes dark, as we all entered into the exam period and our attentions turned away. We emerged from the exams intact, ready to devote our time to iGEM. We did the research, read the papers, and"

Yes, they do sense the input level of Dox concentration. The transfer curves of all seven groups are illustrated below. All values are in logarithm space. Note that for the convenience of plotting, the points where Dox=0 are plotted at Dox=0.01. (or the point will fly out far to negative infinity)
In the leftmost figure, EBFP2 without intein sequence show relatively low affinity and thus low expression level. Nevertheless, their leakage level is low as well, and Dox induction leads to approximately  fold change. As for the middle and right figures, both split EBFP2 with intein and intact EBFP2 have about  fold change when induced by Dox, but split EBFP2 have lower leakage level.
Meanwhile, if one half of EBFP is driven by constitutive promotor CMV, the leakage level remains the same but the induced multiple suffers. This is expected beforehand because with one constitutively-expressed part, the circuit can only sense the input with one half of the split proteins, thus becoming slightly less inducible.
Normalizing the curves lead to more interesting discoveries. Even though TRE-EBFP2N + CMV-EBFP2C leads to poor fold change, the transfer curve is significantly steeper when the dimerization process is reversible. This means better switch-like properties. With the presence of intein, the effect is weaker but still visible.
Normalize transfer curves to the range of 0 to 1, we can find that the shapes are different. Lines representing split proteins are later to rise and steeper.
If we normalize the initial EBFP2 level to 1, split EBFP2 with intein displays better properties than the other two settings. From fig. we can clearly see that it has the highest multiple among the three, even significantly higher than that of the intact EBFP2. The result shows that split proteins, with high binding affinity, can defeat original undivided proteins for their low leakage level and high induced multiples, that is, high sensibility to inputs.
How well do circuits perform as evaluated by channel capacity?
Seven circuits are evaluated in our experiment. Calculated channel capacities are displayed in fig.
Come on, this not as dizzying as it is at the first glance. Let’s look at it step by step.

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#Project Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html," the Targeting system is combined with the Sensing system. In the absence of Yersinia enterocolitica, the activator YenR will interact with the yenbox and induce the expression of cheZ..
Stage 2
Since we did not know how different expression levels of cheZ would affect motility, we decided to combine cheZ with constitutive promoters of different strength to see if we could find the optimal expression level of cheZ. The promoters were all from the Anderson family of constitutive promoters available in the iGEM registry of parts. The promoters were the following, with their relative strength within parentheses:
J23100 (2547)
J23113 (21)
J23114 (256)
The same RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) was used for all constructs.
Stage 3
This final stage was simply our regulatory system, the Sensing system, combined with the RBS and cheZ. The idea was that transcription of cheZ would be increased when far away from the pathogen and reduced when close to the pathogen.
Result
All motility tests were carried out on tryptone swarm plates (10g/L bactotryptone, 5g/L NaCl, 2,5g/L agar) based on a protocol from 2011’s WITS CSIR team [2] . Overnight cultures were grown to mid-log phase (OD600 = 0,5) in LB medium and then inoculated on swarm plates.
In figure 1, a selection of the results of our swarm plate assays is presented.

Virginia,2017,Team:Virginia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," nitrify ammonia.  Denitrification of nitrates and nitrites at partial capacity, producing more nitrous oxide than nitrogen. During the aerobic cycle, the sludge is also mixed.
Figure 3: Device Implementation During the Anaerobic Cycle: Mixing of the sludge is ceased along with aeration and secondary sewage influx to minimize oxygen influx. Pc. denitrificans consumes the remaining oxygen. Under anaerobic conditions it performs comprehensive denitrification to nitrogen gas. The effluent tertiary sewage is then released.
Early Characterization
Early in the project timeline, we attempted to characterize the growth properties of Pc. denitrificans by creating a standard growth curve in both LB broth and recommended ATCC broth for Pc. denitrificans. The goal is to construct a growth curve of the relatively uncharacterized chassis for use in future protocols that require Pc. denitrificans to be at a certain stage in its growth. The use of both LB and paracoccal media is for two main goals: first, LB is needed so that Pc. denitrificans and E. coli be directly compared. Second, the ATCC media is needed so that Pc. denitrificans growth can be characterized under ideal conditions. After these are established, work towards characterizing part activity within the chassis will begin. Growth curves will also be constructed for N. europaea so that comparisons can be made between the final device and the original nitrifying strain it borrows from.
Paracoccus Transformation
Our search for relevant methods for Paracoccus transformation yielded few results. Most references of the transformation of Pc. denitrificans describe conjugation with a donor E. coli strain (Spence et al, 1981). Due to time constraints and limits in technical expertise, we had to find an alternative method. This method came in the form of an electroporation method developed by Holo et al for general use and more specifically in lactococcal strains. Work by Barak et al picked up on this research and reported successful transformation ofPc. denitrificans using a modified version of the original protocol. We successfully attempted to replicate the results reported by Barak et al and Holo et al to transform Pc. denitrificans with our biobricks of interest.
Comparative Expression
Once we have successfully transformed Pc. denitrificans, we transformed E. Coli in with reporter constructs designed to help characterize the behavior of certain promoter elements in Pc. denitrificans. Our initial plan was to tie a standard GFP coding sequence to a termination sequence"

Solubilization
The resilience of silk to many different solvents is well known. In order to dissolve silk, we used lithium bromide, a strong chaotrope[1] that disrupts the hydrogen bonds and thus secondary structure of the silk.
We dissolved our silk in 9.3M LiBr at 60 C for 4 hours.
Silk solubilized in 9.3M lithium bromide.
Deionizing Dialysis
Silk solution dialyzing against DI water
Following the dissolution of silk, we dialyzed the solution to remove the LiBr and any other salts to obtain a purely aqueous solution of silk.
We dialyzed our silk in SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing of 3.5 kDa molecular weight cutoff against double deionized water. We dialyzed for 48 hours with a total of 6 dialysis bath changes. Following dialysis, we centrifuged the solution to remove any flocculents and other insoluble proteins.
Concentration Dialysis
The previous dialysis results in an aqueous silk solution with concentration ranging from 4% w/v to 8% w/v (40 - 80 mg/mL). This is too dilute to spin into a fiber, so the solution must be concentrated by dialyzing against a highly concentrated polymer solution. The polymer solution draws water out from the silk solution by osmotic pressure.
To concentrate, we dialyzed 10 mL of aqueous silk solution in a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette of 3.5 kDa Molecular weight cutoff against a solution of 10% w/v 10,000 molecular weight PEG for 18 hours. This will yield an aqueous silk solution of 15-18% w/v (150-200 mg/mL) concentration. Dialyzing the solution for too long will overconcentrate the silk dope, which will lead to the silk forming a gel in the cassette. Once a silk has gelled, it is no longer usable in any further processing steps.
19% w/v silk dope after concentration dialysis.
Spiking with the GFP co-spinning module
GFP co-spinning module was added to the silk dope such that the resulting solution had a 1:750 mass to mass ratio of GFP co-spinning module to native B.mori silk.
Spinning the composite silk
In order to form fibers from silk, soluble silk protein solutions must be much like how they are in natural spider spinnerets. The majority of spinning methods entail pushing, or extruding, silk"

Also, Dennis and Mark don't necessarily know our faces, so they won't necessarily know that we aren't actually trying to rob the USB. Additionally, our own Marc wants to know when we will be in the lab so if possible he could come in and help. If you are going to be in the lab unplanned, please email both Marc and CC Dennis.

Make sure you bring your Mcard so you can get into the building after hours if that is needed. Also, the elevators in the USB change at night. One goes from P up to 4 and the other goes from P down to parking. Just keep this in mind. If you have your Mcard, you'll be able to get around the building.
⇒ A few other people that won't be expecting us if we are in the lab all night are the custodial staff, who will most likely call DPS on us. While this would make for a fantastic story, we don't want it happen. If there comes a time when we are in the lab past midnight, also let Dennis know at a decent hour so he can ensure we don't get DPS called on us.

We consider the public's voice
Public Survey
 
In order to understand our project affects the world and the world affects our project design, we did a series of surveys with School’s students, teachers and staffs, as well as team members’ friends and parents, and also for the public in using online Google forms. Totally more than 900 people participated in this survey. The graphs in the following are the results sorted into different genders and ages. In this survey, we wanted to see what people of different ages and of different genders prefer their sugar intake to be, what people will do to burn off the calories after drinking a bottle of Coke, and whether people like the idea of our genetically engineered product eating away the excess sugar. And also, we want to know how much do the public welcome our design and the engineered product.
- Conclusion -
We can see the survey shows that doesn’t intake of carbonated beverages of the female population is twice the male population, and, as people age, their preference of sugar is reduced. In this survey we can see that women take their health more seriously than men, and that men need more energy for their hard labor. Children are usually hyperactive and need a lot of energy, so we can see that children and younger people under the age of 18 have the highest consumption of sugar, but the older the person, the less energy is needed, so their consumption of sugar is lower than children.
In the second part, we asked them what exercise would they do to burn off all the calories from a 500mL Cola. Most of them chose to jog for 30 minutes or ride a bike for an hour. After some research, we found out people would have to walk for two days without sleep to burn all those calories. However, due to the fact that we only have 24 hours in a day, and that we are sleeping ¼ of the 24 hours, we don’t have much extra time to exercise and burn off the calories. We concluded the survey by asking them that if they could have a probiotic that absorbs the sugar taken in, so they wouldn’t have to worry about their health, would they take it? 76 percent of people said that they would take the probiotic. We can see that people would prefer to use our solution than to take the time to exercise.

4.3 Nanopore Targeted Sequencing
Sequencing by ONT MinION Rapid Adapter kit: random adapter integration
Design: To prove the potential of targeted sequencing, we used our fusion protein during library preparation of  specific DNA samples and sequenced them with ONT MinION. We run sequencing tests to determine whether different types of DNA molecules can be identified during data analysis. Once this analysis was done, we tested the DNA product from an integration reaction with our fusion protein and sequencing adapters.
Results and interpretation: We prepared a solution with a mix of different DNA molecules that ranged from plasmid to linear DNA of different sizes. This solution was used during library preparation, and after transposase reaction was stopped, an extra DNA molecule was added to assess whether unadapted DNA is sequenced. The total number of aligned reads for each reference molecule, presented in figure 21 indicated that small linear DNA molecules (600 bp) are not identified during data analysis. This does not mean that these DNA molecules were not read, but their alignment was not possible with our working pipeline, probably due to the size of the reference. These results also indicated that, when DNA molecules are added without the first transposase reaction (the case of PCR 3 that is unadapted), the reads generated are much lower (> 3%) than equimolar concentrations of molecules that were fragmented by the transposase reaction (PCR 1).

Each bar represents a different DNA molecule added in the sample solution from either plasmid or linear DNA of different lengths. DNA molecules used were EPO biobrick (Plasmid 1), EPO + Ampicilin biobrick (Plasmid 2), pACYCduet-1 (Plasmid 3), EPO + Kanamycin amplification (PCR 1), EPO cds amplification (PCR 2) and dxCas9 amplification (PCR 3).

Before the team was granted access to a labspace all team members and advisors underwent several safety training courses from Northeastern University’s Environmental Health and Safety Department. Team organizers worked closely with EHS and other faculty throughout the summer to ensure a safe working environment. Training courses taken by team members included chemical hygiene and laboratory safety, autoclave safety, and biosafety. These courses covered all of the fundamental skills of lab safety including proper use of personal protective equipment, proper treatment of chemicals and biological materials and proper disposal of all of the materials that we would be using in the lab.
Safety hazards were kept to a minimum and no notably dangerous chemicals or biological agents were used.

It occurs more often in the light-skinned population of northern European countries as well as in highly UV–exposed regions such as Australia or New-Zealand. The incidence increased threefold over the last 30 years in Germany. The five year-survival rate is 90 % for women and 85 % for men. Another attribute of the malignant melanoma is its relatively early development at a mean age of 64 years for men and 58 years for women in Germany [Parkin2005].  The therapy of the malignant melanoma is usually surgical removing of the tumor in early stages, which requires an early detection of the melanoma. In later stages also removal of the sentinel lymph node is performed to avoid metastasis via the lymph system. Other forms of the therapy for higher stages are palliative chemotherapy with dimethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (DITC) and, since the malignant melanoma is immunogenic, immunotherapy [RKI2010]. Both therapies do not show a high success rate: stage four melanoma with distant metastasis to organs such as liver, lung, brain, bones and skin have an unfavorable prognosis and lead to the death of the patient within a median of six to twelve months [Parkin2005].

By summing the $\mathcal{R}$, the cleavage probability relative to the on-target, over all off-target positions on the plasmid, we compute the $P_{FP}$, the probability of a false positive output, provided that there is a positive output:
$$ P_{FP} = \frac{ \Sigma _{\textrm{off target}}\mathcal{R} }{\Sigma _{\textrm{off target}}\mathcal{R} + \Sigma _{\textrm{on target}}\mathcal{R}} = \frac{1}{1+ \frac{\Sigma_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\Sigma_{off}\mathcal{R}}} \tag{8}$$
Computing $P_{FP}$ for crRNA 1-4 (Figure 5) shows that crRNA 3 has the lowest probability of yielding a false-positive result on the TcR plasmid, i.e. being activated by a non-target site on the plasmid: 1 in 100 billion. Interestingly, experiments in the lab show that Cas13a also performs highest collateral cleavage activity when loaded when crRNA 3.
Figure 5: Off-target cleavage probability (relative to on-target) for crRNA 1 to 4 on TcR plasmid. Off target cleavage probability (relative to on-target) for crRNA 1-5 on the TcR plasmid ($\Delta C=0.25$,$\Delta I=2.5$). crRNA 3 (orange) is the crRNA with one on-target site that further displays the lowest probability of false-positive activation on the TcR plasmid itself (i.e. on the non-target sites). Interestingly, crRNA 3 also results in best Cas13a performance in the lab .
Rewriting the implementation of the model into a command line utility allowed us to use the TU Delft computer clusters for simulating the off-target effects of our crRNAs on the genomes of different relevant organisms: E. coli BL21 (4.5 mln basepairs (bp)), Staphylococcus aureus (2.8 mln bp), Staphylococcus epider"

Moreover, they explored how it broadens disease treatment options, as well as discovered which diseases can be treated with this technology and how it can be used in other fields.
DIY Workshop
We organised a workshop on enzyme production in biotechnology during the international DIYBio Network meeting in Vilnius. We showed how enzymes are detected in nature, transformed into bacteria and purified for the best activity.
DIYBio Network connects researchers, makers, artists, and scientists via their interest in DIYBio and the desire to shape their own future by the process of creating. Collaborating with the latter our team created a project for the DIYBio Network of Nordic and Baltic region international meeting in Vilnius, under coded name ""siNbiosis"".
One of the project events was a workshop, where members of the network as well as other interested people explored the main steps in enzyme production. Around 20 people gathered to try to identify enzymatic activity in nature, to test new functions of transformed Escherichia coli bacteria and finally to check the purified enzyme activity. We also tried to answer questions on how the scientists ""domesticated"" microorganisms, what new tricks they taught them and which biotechnological advances await us in the future.
Media
As part of our science communication activities, we presented ourselves in the mass media by giving interviews and attending radio shows.
By representing our team in the media we were able to spread the message about us, the iGEM competition and synthetic biology and to reach a bigger audience.

Hydroponics is the future of agriculture.  Compared to traditional farming, hydroponics demands less maintenance, fewer resources, and most importantly, less land.  It is a rapidly growing industry that is projected to be a $31.4 billion global market by 2022, with a growth rate of 6.7% annually [1].  As the population inches ever closer to carrying capacity, as the resources become ever scarcer, and as the climate becomes ever warmer, hydroponics is the most promising solution to ensure a sustainable world - one where no one is left hungry.
But despite its immense potential, hydroponics is severely limited by diseases, nutrient imbalances, and other environmental stresses.  In particular, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known for affecting crop growth by hindering nutrient uptake, damaging cellular structures, and inducing undesirable immune responses [2].  Even though the current market offers technologies that can measure oxidative stress, they are often fragile, expensive, and lacking spatial resolution.  Moreover, little effort has been made to improve existing technologies.
At Cornell iGEM, we believe that we can do better.
ROS may be notorious for being correlated with cancer and aging, but perhaps paradoxically, research has also shown that a sufficient level of oxidative stress is critical to the growth and survival of any organism, whether it’s bacteria, humans, or plants [3].  Therefore, the essence of successful hydroponics is not the removal of all external stress, but rather its optimization.  We seek to control oxidative stress - to respond to any minute change in the environment rapidly and efficiently, and to modulate the ideal equilibrium state for each and every crop.  We accomplish this feat through a novel platform with dual functionality.  First,"

Survey
Our team understands that a survey with such a small sample size is not the most reliable of methods to gain information. However, we still decided to conduct a survey in order to gain a general public opinion on various aspects of our project. Applying synthetic biology components to open wounds can be a very sensitive subject that needs to be carefully evaluated. In addition to considering the ethics of our project, we also wanted to examine how exactly people in our community would respond to our proposed blood clotting agent.  Mainly we wanted to gain an opinion on possible application methods for our product. We created paper copies of the survey, that we handed out to respondents in the city as well as a digital copy that we shared on social media in the hope of collecting a more diverse sample. In total, 40 individuals respondent to our survey. From the survey, we gathered that a bandage form is the most popular form for applying our product. This informed our final decision on the application of our product. We also learned that people have heard of snake venom being used for clotting blood, and are somewhat comfortable with using components of snake venom to heal a wound. People would also consider using synthetic biology as a clotting method. Overall we conducted this survey out of curiosity to learn what others would think of our product.
School Presentations
We believe an important aspect of iGEM is to spark interest in synthetic biology and iGEM in other students. This year, we decided to present to Grade 11 classes in several High Schools in Lethbridge about our project and the iGEM competition in general. As part of the Grade 11 curriculum, students learn about the components of blood and the blood clotting pathway. Our project and presentation therefore integrated very well into the their curriculum. Through our presentation, we raised students’ awareness for the application and significance of some of the concepts they learned in school and made them more interested to become involved with iGEM in"

After 2 hours of conjugation on solid LB medium, the cells are collected and diluted in PBS 1X before being spread on LB/Xgal/IPTG plate per 100µl. Colony counts are carried out three times for each dilution.
Table 1: Count after conjugation (transfer of mobilizable plasmid pK18mob).
The ratio of donor (D) to recipient (R) is 0.172, i. e. D:R ≈ 1:6. The effectiveness of the conjugation is calculated by the ratio between the number of conjugated recipients (R+) divided by the total number of recipients (R+ and R-),           i.e. 61% effectiveness, of recipient bacteria having received the mobilizable plasmid.
Efficiency of our Crispr/Cas9 system.
Test #1 of our Crispr/Cas9 efficiency
To verify the efficiency of Crispr/Cas9 system of our plasmid, we have transformed the killer plasmid in a DH5ɑ strain carrying the RFP reporter plasmid (pSB4A5_J04450). If our CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid system work well, it will cut the RFP gene         and the recipient bacteria (red and fluorescent) will appear white.

A vial of specially modified GFP scaffold that could accommodate up to two short-peptide fragments was procured from Dr Tej V Pavoor from the university of Wisconsin-Madision, USA. Several amino-acid residues had been altered so that it could withstand the addition of peptide loops without compromising the fluorescence capacity significantly.
We intend to insert the peptide interacting with the membrane protein of the fungal pathogen to dummy loop 1 (which, along with dummy loop 2, are so called because of them just being present as a filler to be replaced) of the GFP scaffold. In our case it was IGP4, the peptide interacting with SSR1 from Candida glabarata.
The GFP scaffold without IGP4 will be used as a negative control, to rule out any interaction between the modified GFP scaffold and SSR1. Wild type Candida glabarata will be used for in vivo studies with a SSR1 knock out strain as negative control.

-PCR amplify Region I (RI) of GFP scaffold with primers that would exclude dummy loop 1 using PfuS PCR.
-PCR amplify Region II (RII) scaffold of GFP with BamHI restriction site PfuSPCR.
-Amplify IGP4 with left and right flanks that would overlap RI and RII regions of GFP PfuSPCR.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#safety-c_-_-_TEXT.html," due to the extremely fragile nature of the E. coli strain that we are using in our project. Should it somehow find its way outside of the lab, it would die within a very short timespan.
If there exists an emergency safety protocol in case of accident (i.e. unintentional release of GMM's into environment)
The emergency protocol is still a work in progress, but although it is unfinished it should not pose a breach in safety, as we're only working with a level 1 GMM, which due to its extremely fragile nature cannot survive outside of laboratory environment. This coupled with adherence to the standard laboratory safety protocol, should at all times ensure the safety of the environment.
Overall  Assessment
We have at all times upheld the laws and regulations imposed upon us by UN and by the Working Environment Group. We have performed a risk-assessment of our project as required by the UN, as well as following the laws regarding to personal safety and to substitution of potentially harmful host and donor organisms. The work safety group has assessed our project to be a class 1 project, as they have perceived no risk associated with our work. They see no apparent way of weaponizing or in any other way using our project for malign purposes. Thus our project should not pose any threat to the security of the world at large. Although most of the genes inserted into our bacteria are harmless, hyperflagellation is in fact something that increases pathogenicity. Furthermore the bacteria we work with are unable to survive and reproduce outside of laboratory conditions. Should it accidentally be released into the wild, it would lose its plasmids within a very short time span and thus return to a non-GMO state. And as the bacteria we have been working with, namely E. coli MG1655, is a naturally occurring bacteria, it should not pose any threat to the environment at all. As long as the normative work safety protocols were followed they could not perceive any danger due to the work being performed by relatively inexperienced students. Thus they perceived neither security nor safety issues with our project.

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," is thought the Pdu BMC shell adopts an icosahedral shape, with multiple flat triangular faces and 12 vertices. With the exception of PduN, the above Pdu shell proteins form a mosaic of hexagonal building blocks that associate into flat sheets to form the facets of the icosahedron. While the single-BMC-domain proteins PduA, -J, -K, and -U (Figure 2) form protein hexamers, PduB, -B’, and -T have tandem BMC domains so instead form hexagonal protein trimers. [4]
Figure 2: Crystal Structure of the PduU Shell Protein. [5]
Small pores, approximately 10Å in diameter, run through the centre of some hexagonal units and are thought to allow transport of molecules across the protein shell.[3] PduN forms pentamers that occupy the 12 vertices of the icosahedron and is therefore considerably less abundant than the other Pdu shell proteins which contribute hundreds of copies to the faces of the BMC. [4]

New Biobricks and Improving Old Biobricks
The Grand Plan: A Synthetic Microcompartment - ''The Sphereactor''
To begin with, our team aims to produce a BMC comprised of the eight Salmonella Pdu shell proteins (Pdu-A, -B, -B’, -J, -K, -N, -T, and -U) in Escherichia coli, which itself is a close relative of Salmonella. This involves expressing seven Pdu genes, as PduB’ is expressed from the PduB gene sequence. Our intention is to add a poly-histidine affinity tag onto the C-terminus of several compartment proteins, which will aid in determining whether the proteins have been expressed and may allow us to isolate complete compartments from the cell by affinity purification.
In order to achieve expression of the BMC in E. coli, we will construct a biobrick that contains all seven genes for the Pdu shell proteins, including sequences encoding the poly-histidine affinity tags. In order to create our biobrick, we will employ a progressive strategy involving construction of individual Pdu gene biobricks and sequential addition of these biobricks to form our complete synthetic operon (Figure 4). As the majority of the Pdu shell genes lie adjacent to one other shell gene in the Pdu operon of Salmonella, it is possible to clone these genes as pairs. Therefore our initial individual bi"
Illinois,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Notebook#Week4_-_-_TEXT.html," enzyme can perform can necessarily occur in Ecoli. Therefore, I discovered I must find another way that will be organism specific throughout the whole process of going from organism to reaction.  My new flow was now from organism, to gene, to ko number (orthology?? not fully uderstood), to pathway, to reactions that occur in pathway.  I got all the way through to reactions for Ecoli, but I realized I had another problem.  Yes, I had a list of reactions for Ecoli, but I did not know which gene was associated with what reaction. That I realized is very important to know; what genes are associated with what reactions.  This will be very useful for our program.  To my dismay, I could not think of a way to get reactions by gene and vice versa through the KEGG API alone.  Therefore, I used the KEGG FTP to obtain a list of reactions, that I hope to get enzymes for, and then the genes for all of those enzymes.  This I will work with next week.  On a side note, I thought of some fun features that we could have as a part of our program.  One idea I had was converting genes that qualify from the KEGG database into biobricks by basically adding the DNA needed to fulfill the state of being a 'biobrick'. Another idea I had was to optimize all of the genes that are to be outputted by our program for the host organism that is chosen by user through codon optimization.  Each organism has varying levels of charged tRNAs.  The idea would be to alter the codons so that the percentage of each codon reflects the percentage of the charged tRNAs.  Right now, these ideas are still being considered, they might be fun to do once our program is finished.
Palak This week the changed the direction of our project slightly. We decided that we would add an option that allowed the user to choose a shortest path depending on a chosen factor such as lowest energy usage or least number of cofactors. This allowed us to create graphs of the reactions with weights. We would then find the path of least weight for the given factor. This eliminated the need to find all paths, which we found wasn't feasible. Due to this the need for flux analysis functions was not crucial right away. I put this part of the project on hold and started working on another aspect, creating databases. We found that it would speed up our program if we had our own database of reactions and their properties. I explored different possibilities to create this database. We work with"
Virginia_Commonwealth,2009,Team:Virginia Commonwealth#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," variable regions we determined that changing a single base to the second most frequent nucleotide would allow us to quantify the relationship between nucleotide frequency and UP-element strength.
Sequences of designed UP-elements
These UP-element designs were directly synthesized to include a well-characterized constitutive promoter and BioBrick ends on either end of the UP-element promoter sequence.  We also synthesized an UP-element as a modular BioBrick part to study the effect of the added nucleotide spacing between the UP-element and the promoter due to the BioBrick assembly scar.  It is likely that the additional spacing of the eight base pair BioBrick assembly scar may have a significant effect on part performance.
Future work
Higher understanding
From our results, we would potentially be able to more accurately predict the transcriptional effect of the UP-element with each nucleotide change. From this, we would like to create and characterize more UP-elements and possibly come to a more precise consensus sequence.
It has been suggested that both alpha subunits located in the RNAP bind to the UP-element at once. We would like to test this theory by measuring the binding strength when both alpha subunits are present and when only one is present.
Regulated promoters
We would like to study operator sites and redesign them as biobrick parts to tighten the control at the transcriptional level.
T7 Promoters
T7 phage promoters have long been utilized as a way to create orthogonal gene expression.  There is very little variation in the strength of T7 promoters available via the BioBrick registry.  Our goal is to identify a consensus T7 promoter sequence and use our bottom-up design approach to create a library of T7 promoters which we will characterize and upload to the registry.

The BTI
Overview
Due to the temperature sensetive property of the SUP35NM, our system can be applied for a Biological Temperature Indicator. In the Proof of Concept section of our project, we have showed the relationship between the temperature and the intensity of the fluorescence, so we construted a standard cure using our prototype, and tested the standard curve with a specific temperature. Furthermore, if we introduce the GdnHCl, we can alter the standard curve and locate the peak of the intensity of the fluorescence in any chose temperature.             In the process of industry production,engineers find that             incrustation has harmful effects on the device especially the boiler. When there is a certain number of incrustation aggregate on the pipe it will cause a serious accident.           Therefore,when and where we should clean the incrustation is a headache to all the engineers. Our BTI presented here provides a novel method to solve this problem.
The Prototype
As the pipes in industry are cylindrical in most cases, we also design our hardware in cylindrical to fit it.
We design a clearance in our hardware to contain the yeast medium.
In order to prevent other microbes from coming into the device, we also design a cover over the device.
We design our device by SOLIDWORKS and make it into reality by 3D printing(3DP). Considering the light transmittance and economics, the material of our hardware is transparent photosensitive resin and the material of the cover is ordinary resin.
Before we put the prototype into use, we had done lots of mathematical modeling to show the working properties of it. See more details in our modeling section.

We combined a thermostatic water bath and a pump to simulate the working conditions.
The room temperature was around 24 ℃. The pump was set at"

Interview with Prof. Kalua - Director and Founder of BICO
Prof. Khumbo Kalua served many years as an ophthalmologist, before founding the Blantyre Institute for Community Ophthalmology in 2008. The Institute expanded rapidly, enganging with over 50 employees in multiple projects, such as the national Trachoma Elimination Project, an antibiotic effect study and assessing visual impairment in children. In the context of Trachoma elimination, BICO has organized Trachoma Impact, Surveillance and Drug Coverage surveys, as well as implemented mass-drug treatment (MDA) in collaboration with the Health Ministry from Malawi.
For our team, this interview gave us a clear understanding of the local circumstances, which helped us improve our diagnostic design. Also it was essential to us, whether our device would serve a use as such in the field.
Finding Chlamydory:
Introduction and description of our project.
Daniel C.:
[…] So this is more or less our project.
Prof. Kalua:
You are thinking of this more as a field-test?
Daniel C.:
Yeah. […] I mean, these are genetically modified bacteria, so the question of course is then if it is allowed to use [them] out in the open. They are incapsulated in alginic acid […] but if the device breaks, they might get out. They are not dangerous, but…
Prof. Kalua:
But you’ve got bacteria there.
Daniel C.:
Exactly.
Prof. Kalua:
So would you recommend this to be used in the lab then? That’s what I am asking.
Daniel C.:
Generally you could use it in the field. The problem is the perception of the people. Especially in the USA or from our judges from the competition. They say: „You can have an idea but you can’t take bacteria out in the field.“ […]
Prof. Kalua:
So in theory it is a rapid test, but it has to be done within the lab...

Kyoto,2014,Team:Kyoto#Project#Magnetosome Formation_-_-_TEXT.html," induced the magnetosome-like vesicles in E. coli. We will next try to fulfill these empty containers by magnetites. mamM gene is the next candidate to be introduced, as it works as iron transporter with mamB [10] . Addition of mamM to our synthetic operon will enable us to observe bioremediation of iron ions into the vesicles.
Introduction of the full of 4 operons (mms6, mamGFDC, mamAB, mamXY, 26-kb in total) is a technically challenging but intriguing experiment. Since our study revealed that the first step, vesicle formation, can be achieved by the expression of the subset of these genes, we believe that the total formation of functional magnetosome in E. coli is also feasible.
The induced vesicles shown in this study can be applied for other systems, too. Expression of other types of transporters will expand the use of these vesicles. If the specificity of the iron transporter is modified by mutation(s) properly, one might collect precious metals, rare metals, or toxic compounds in the vesicles. Using the magnetosome formation system in parallel, these technologies will provide us a novel tool to concentrate various compounds more efficiently from nature.

Edinburgh,2013,Team:Edinburgh#Human Aspects#Independence_-_-_TEXT.html," is able to offer a very quick turnaround on the approval times for commercial clinical trials. Also, although Scotland is a small country of 5 million people, we have 14 geographical health boards. So if you were doing multi-centre clinical trials, you would have to go through a separate process for each of the health boards, whereas now there is a single point of entry and approval. So that’s positive.
In Edinburgh, they have their own research and innovation company, which helps to spin out companies from university, which has a very impressive success rate. For example, since 1969 the university has created more than 262 spin out companies. Now that’s an impressive number, but the real test is whether those companies have been able to sustain the business, you can start up a company and then it doesn’t fly, for whatever reason. The success rate has been 81% of those companies. I was surprised when I saw those figures; I thought that there would be a much higher attrition or failure rate. But 81% are still trading. Of that 81%, 89% are still in Scotland.
J: So Scotland is providing quite a good base for setting up business.
A: We heard from academics at the University that there was a feeling that if Scotland became independent people would lose funding which was coming from the UK.
JE: Let me address that point. The issue is that Scotland punches above its weight in terms of scientific research, and citations in scientific papers for a country of our size. At the moment Scotland gets more than our population share from the UK research funding pots. So if we think about the Medical Research Council, the Bio-Technological Council, the suggestion is that if Scotland were independent we would no longer be eligible for those. The response is that the Scottish government is absolutely working on this to make sure that that research funding is sustained after independence. We think that it would still be attractive. People want to collaborate across borders, be that within the UK or within Europe, there are also European funding pots that Scottish institutions are able to access. We will have a more definitive response on that when the government publishes its white paper for the referendum, around November time. We will need to put the reassurances in place, and the government has appointed the former principles of one of the Universities in Scotland to look at that.
A: Scotland has one of the best Universities in the world; do you think that people would still be attracted to come to Scotland if it weren’t part of the UK?
JE: I think that people want to do good, high quality research, and those opportunities"

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#PromoterCharacterization_-_-_TEXT.html," called merOP as a whole. MerR always binds to merOP as a homodimer and enhances the occupancy of PTPCAD by RNA polymerase regardless of the presence of Hg(II), although only after Hg(II)’s binding can the dimer stop preventing the formation of the open complex by RNA polymerase. Also, MerR repress its own expression at Pr independently of Hg(II).  In our design, merR was isolated from the operon and assembled with constitutive promoters of some strength to maintain its expression intensity at certain level. For the same reason, the divergent promoter PR was also removed by deletion of its -35 region (Fig 1).
Fig 1. DNA sequence of the Tn21 mer operon promoter region. The MerR binding site on PmerT is marked by a box. The -35 and -10 regions for both PmerR and PmerTPAD are marked with boxes, and the dyad symmetrical DNA sequence that MerR recognizes and binds to is marked with arrows under the DNA sequence. (A) The divergently oriented promoters are marked by blue box and purple box, respectively.  (B) In our project, the expression intensity of MerR should be maintained exogenously, so the divergent promoter PR (of MerR transcript) was also removed by deletion of its -35 region. The resulted promoter sequence is marked with a dark purple box Modiﬁed from (Hobman, Wilkie et al. 2005)
As shown in Fig 1, the key sequence for MerR’s binding is a region of interrupted dyad symmetry (19bp) located between the -35 and -10 haxamers of PTPCAD (The top strand). And the structure of PR (botton strand) is similar to PTPCAD in a divergent orientation. The -10 hexamers of PTPCAD and PR actually overlap by four bases. (Park, Wireman et al. 1992).
Fig 2. A generalized mechanism of MerR family regulator transcriptional activation. (A) The dimeric MerR regulator binds to the operator region of the promoter and recruits RNA polymerase, forming a ternary complex. Transcription is slightly repressed because the apo-MerR regulator dimer has bent the promoter DNA such that RNA polymerase does not contact it properly. (B) Upon binding the cognate metal ions (shown as cyan circles) the metallated MerR homodimer causes a realignment of the promoter such that RNA polymerase contacts the"

Initial Stages
During recruiting for members of the 2011 team during winter quarter, interested students participated in weekly journal sessions in which they read articles regarding recent advancements in synthetic biology, as well as took part in brainstorming sessions. During spring quarter, newly recruited members participated in weekly ""boot camp"" sessions in which they learned cloning techniques such as transformations and miniprepping, as well as continued to brainstorm additional ideas. The following list of generated ideas was developed throughout this time.

BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," our model.
After constructing the primary model, we met some difficulties in proving the accuracy of these equations, as well as simulating these equations by software. Some members of Jilin_China majored in physics, math, computer science and chemistry, they were familiar with solving these problems and kindly provided us with much useful advice.
[Click to see details]
We provided them with the condition and equations of each stage of chemical reactions. They added some chemical reactions to improve our model and got the analytic solutions of the linearized equations.

Based on the equations we provided, they added some modification.
Fig.2 The equations improved by JLU
After discussion, we found it’s hard to measure some parameters. They suggested us to simplify the equations, making it more close to the linear relationship.
The picture has two parts, one is about the equations replaced by other symbols (Fig.3), the other is about the linear equations to avoid measuring the parameter (Fig. 4).

Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," trials conducted by both teams, the ElectroPen was demonstrated to successfully electroporate GFP into E. coli, as seen with the trials conducted by Lambert iGEM. The transformation efficiency obtained from these tests is also on par with those from commercial electroporators, thereby confirming the data obtained across all trials conducted. Through this, we demonstrate that the ElectroPen (patent pending) is a powerful ultralow-cost device that can be applied in various settings from low-resource high school groups to equipped university laboratories, and we envision the application of this device in these settings across the world.
In order to ensure effective implementation of this device across the world, we have received feedback and design inputs for improvements and suggestions for the ElectroPen. From both the TAS Taipei and UGA teams, we received suggestions to increase the length of the wires and create terminals on the cuvettes such that the ElectroPen can connect to it. We also received recommendations to create a latch for the toggle to remain secured within the casing. In recognition of these suggestions, we will soon develop another iteration of the ElectroPen as an improvement.
We recognize the importance of collaboration in the validation of the ElectroPen's functionality, and in next year's project, will conduct a larger international collaboration study with the ElectroPen to further demonstrate reproducibility and the versatility.
The tutorials and instructions to build the ElectroPen system have not yet been released as an open-access publication comprising of these documents will soon be released. However, all interested teams may visit our booth during the exhibition session at Jamboree to register to participate in a mini-InterLab Study for the ElectroPen with supplies provided by us!
Figure 7: a We worked with TAS_Taipei to validate the ElectroPen’s efficacy, and through two trials conducted, they successfully demonstrated that electroporation using the device was successful. b Collaboration with the University of Georgia team on 3 different trials also indicated the same results, validating the performance of the ElectroPen.

Project Description
What is a Fatberg?
After hearing on the news about giant ""fatbergs"" that have clogged sewer systems around the world, our team - Notre Dame Collegiate (NDC), decided to try to tackle the problem. A fatberg is a clump of non-biodegradable solid matter such as wet wipes with solidified grease or cooking fats holding it together. Local waste water treatment facilities experience issues with fats that cause inefficiency and extra steps in the treatment system, as they must mechanically break apart the fats which often end up coming back together.
Project Overview
Our team is working on getting our E. coli to express the EstA gene. The EstA gene codes for an esterase (an enzyme) that breaks bonds found in common fats so that the fats will breakdown. Our current promoter is BBa_R0011 that will be turned on by the addition of IPTG, but will hopefully one day be turned on by triglycerides in a sample.
To test that our bacteria is working correctly, we plan to use a compound called esterified 4-nitrophenol that has the bond in fats that we are looking to break. When the bond is broken in this compound, it will turn green; the more green colour in our sample (bacteria and esterified 4-nitrophenol), the more bonds have been broken by our esterase. We are also exploring a few more ideas such as adding our bacteria to an agar plate with triglycerides (fats) on it, and  measuring the acidity of the sample (as one of the products of fat breakdown, fatty acids, will decrease the pH).
We have a few options when it comes to delivering our bacteria into the system; one is to introduce it to the rich E. coli population that is already a part of the treatment process. The second will use their current method of vacuuming the fat layer off the wastewater, but instead of them mechanically breaking apart the fats and putting them back into the wastewater, they would put them into a separate container where we would add our bacteria. The benefit to the second option is that our bacteria are contained, and we"

Fig. ?: Colony formation efficiencies of E. coli JM109 engineered with marA on geraniol overlaid plates.
E. coli JM109 and E. coli JM109 (marA) were spotted on LBGMg agar plates in serial ten-fold dilutions (10⁻¹～10⁻6), overlaid with 30.0 % (v/v) fanesol hexane solution (farnesol solution), and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. This figure shows that E. coli JM109 (marA) cells that overexpress the marA product is more survived on 30.0 % farnesol solution overlay plates than the counterpart control E. coli JM109  wild type cells.

Reaction-Diffusion model
Reaction-diffusion equation proposed by A.Turing, 1952.Turing is the famous mathematician of England, as who invent “Turing machine”. This equation describe reaction and diffusion of two substances, and they form specific pattern autonomously. pattern which read by these substances are similar to animal specific skin pattern such as spot pattern of Panther, stripe pattern of zebra, and so on. But the relationship between equation and animal skin pattern was not clear for long days. in 1995,Kondo.S demonstrated that skin pattern of Pomacanthus can describe by using reaction-diffusion equation. Kondo  our purpose is, to demonstrate existence of Turing pattern in organisms, by reproduce patterns using E.coli. and verify the theory.
approach
We described that Reaction-Diffusion equation shows reaction and diffusion of “substances”. To form patterns, these “substances” whould be important. We need morphogen, “Activator” and “Inhibitor” as substance. When these substance fulfill some conditions, patterns would reproduce such as spot patterns like panther, or stripe patterns like zebra and so on. this is already demonstrated in computer simulations. (References) We suppose that a bacteria as an individual cell. These “cells” express the genes which cording patterning substance. and reproduce autonomous patterns by their interact. We have some ideas to make these patterns more interesting. One is use of temperature-sensitive bacteria, to make different patterns by temperature in same culture. Another idea is use of multiple substances. Increasing types of substances, we expect that can make more complicated patterns.
the model
How we meet the condition?
We described that to reproduce the model, we need two substances, Activator and inhibitor. but we need more conditions about relationships between Activator and inhibitor;
1. There are two components- the activator and inhibitor

To be attached to the fungal cell wall
Project   >   Binding
Figure 1: Schema of the binding module
In order to be highly efficient in the fight against the pythopathogen Ceratocystis platani, our optimized bacterium has to be anchored to the fungus.    Thus, we designed a chimeric protein ( BBa_K1364005 ) capable of building    a bridge between the bacterial peptidoglycan and the fungal chitin, the main component of the pathogen’s cell wall.    According to the work of the Imperial College 2010 iGEM team,    we used the Cell Wall Binding (CWB) domain of the LytC protein (coding for a N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase) to attach our chimeric protein    to the Bacillus subtilis cell wall. On the other side of our protein, we added the domain 4 of GbpA from Vibrio cholerae, which is known to    recognize chitin.
More information about this module
The open reading frame of the Binding Module is composed of 3 sections:
Anchor section: the CWB (Cell Wall Binding) domain is extracted from LytC gene and composes the 5' side of our binding module. As previously described by the Imperial College of London 2010  iGEM team, we kept the first 318 bp. We can note the presence of the signal peptide at the beginning of the sequence, from 1 to 24 bp.
Chitin Binding Domain (CBD) section:  the domain 4 of GbpA from V. cholerae is able to bind to N-Acetyl Glucosamine oligosacchararides. Also,  the 3' side of our gene is composed by a part of the GbpA sequence (from 423 to 484 bp).

Our team was founded this week! We met and communicated with each other. Through our team leader’s presentation, we knew iGEM a lot. Each member was assigned his/her mission in the team.
We broadly read paper and brainstormed this year’s project. At first we came up with several different ideas, later we reached an agreement that the most interesting and meaningful one was about nitrogen fixation.

Human  Practices, Collaboration&Society:
We learned about the advancement of nitrogenous fertilizer production in China. In order to better understand the actual demand of nitrogenous fertilizer in agriculture, we decided to visit farmers in Xiaohe Bei Village.
We distributed brochures about our project at NJU.
Having learned of the dearth of efficient and affordable fertilizer, we spared no effort to seek a cost effective nitrogen fixation method. Inspired by our previous work(Nanjing-China 2016), we creatively proposed an idea of “whole-cell photocatalytic nitrogen fixation”.
We helped Nanjing Forestry University build their team.
We held conferences with Nanjing Agricultural University and China Pharmaceutical University to share experiences of being iGEMers.
Technical works Wet& Dry labs:
Wet Lab: Having confirmed the theme of our project, we began to work on our design. We read latest papers about biological nitrogen fixation, focused on the method sections and discussed what we didn’t understand in details. During the last week of this month, we worked out the first version of our design.
Dry lab: We communicated and exchanged ideas frequently in order to identify possible modeling directions which could provide useful guidance to our wet experiments. Later we proposed a few directions. The idea of developing homologous modeling of nitrogenase didn’t work successfully because we couldn’t get access to relevant software.

Description
Background
Biology and life are tightly interrelated. After investigation (For more details, please view Human Practice ), we found that huge amounts of people had little biological knowledge base. For instance, base pair, DNA, protein, organelle, cell, tissue, organ, system, individual, population, community, ecosystem, biosphere, these are important concepts in biology. The distance between ordinary people and those is so long that they nearly cannot touch it. Therefore, it’s imperative to spread the biological knowledge of the mass then to improve the quality of life.
Overview
In order to popularize biological knowledge and draw the public’s attention to biology from the basic level, UESTC-Software decided to adopt a more acceptant way to make more people be aware of the subject. We developed an Android game named Bio2048 based on the Grabriele Cirulli’s “2048”, a popular sliding block puzzle game. Instead of the numbers, the blocks are labeled with some common biological patterns, such as gene and protein. All the patterns form a biological ladder. If two patterns with the same biological terms collide while moving, they will merge into one pattern with a new biological term which moves up by one on the biological ladder.
Design
As we know, the core of the game “2048” is adding adjacent and same numbers by moving fingers in one direction. We took the core into our design and choose 12 elements: basic group, DNA, protein, organoid, cell, tissue, organic, system, individual, population, community, ecosystem, biosphere, to replace numbers. Besides, we hoped the game interface more three-dimensional, it may have some Chinese elements to get close with users and enrich itself. When those ideas came together, we created the game——Bio2048.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Future#Economic potential analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," such as banks                 and venture capital firms. (6) The need for government stimulants through                 specialised funding programs is clearly present. (10) This is underlined by the                 fact that publicly funded venture capital firms are more willing to consider                 investing in early-stage university spin-outs than private ones. (5)
Next is the pre-seed funding phase that further explores                 managerial and organisational aspects of the project in order to make it more                 attractive for potential investors. (10) In the proof-of-concept phase,                 government funding mainly serves the role of reducing the technological                 uncertainty while the reduction of the organisational uncertainty is mainly the                 purpose of pre-seed funding. For this phase we are currently fully relying on                 sponsorship from the industry and university organisations. The option of applying for a governmental grant remains possible for further stages.
The third major phase or seed phase takes place when the company is established,                 but basically it does not generate enough cash flow to survive on its own. For                 their early investments, investors are often given an equity stake in return.                 Attracting venture capital investors remains difficult because they prefer to                 invest in university spin-outs after the seed phase, when the research and                 following application proved to be robust. (14) Possible investors should be                 found in the industry, angel investors, crowd funding, government, etc.
When a company grows, at some point in time there will be an immediate financial                 need that is too high to bear for traditional investors. Often regional and                 national venture capital firms are then the only option to turn at. However                 involving venture capital firms should be a well-considered decision. They bring along a                 new working culture, make demands (e.g. hiring professional managers and                 administrators) and put pressure on the firm to get the necessary in-house                 competences. All of this is done with respect to the return-on-investment they                 need so desperately regarding their 10-year horizon. (13) This could lead to tremendous progress for the company or they can break up with the                 company in the long term if they don't receive a high enough return-on-investment. (13)
Regulation gap
A lack of regulation can be considered as double-edged, where it shortens the                 product innovation cycle but at the same time makes marketing your product more                 complicated. Orthopaedic devices are normally classified as a medical device                 and fall within the European medical device regulation. To be issued with a CE                 mark, medical devices must achieve high quality, safety and performance                 standards. (9) However the specificity of"

As the error prone polymerase I is mostly specific for ColE1 plasmids we used a reporter on a plasmid. Therefore, we decided to     perform reversion assays with a stop beta-lactamase on a ColE1 plasmid.
First steps
Before going on and quantifying the mutagenesis rate we wanted to show that, our mutagenesis process yield functional revertants.     Therefore, we applied a modified version of the mutagenesis protocol described in the literature (Alexander et al. 2014). In     summary, we transformed the stop beta-lactamase plasmid pLA230 into E. coli JS200 cells carrying pHSG-EPPolI plasmids.     After regeneration, the cells were used to inoculate a 37 °C prewarmed LB culture. After 24 hours, cells were plated in     various dilution level at LB plates containing ampicillin. 10 colonies were picked, grown at 30 °C, the plasmids were isolated and sequenced.
Figure 1: Sequencing of  revertants, showing reversion of the stop codon. revertant colonies were grown in selective media       and sequenced.
The sequencing results show that the obtained revertants are really revertants, which mutated one base inside the stop codon to obtain     fully functional beta lactamase. In some cases the reversion is not completely obvious and is only hinted as two different peaks at the same position in the interferogram.
Error Prone Polymerase I
The function of the error prone polymerase I in our experimental setup was validated by the identification of E. coli clones     with different mutations. Further characteriation of the error-prone polymerase I involves the determination of the mutation rate     and adapting for optimal use in the Evobody generation system.
A literature review revealed the technique of mutation accumulation, where the fraction of revertants f at two points with a large     difference in cell count N is measured. Examples are measurement in the beginning and in the end of a cultivation.
Equation 1: Determination of mutation rate by mutant accumulation (Pope et al. 2008). and sequenced.
However, critical points have to be considered, when calculating the mutation rate. The reporter is encoded on plasmid with copy     numbers per cell ranging from 100 to 300. We postulate that one reversed beta-lactamase gene can confer ampicillin resistance to     the cell. Therefore, the observed mutation rate is 100"

Abstract
To make Saccharomyces cerevisiae compatible with the co-culture, the plan was to exchange two promoters involved in glutamine synthesis and excretion. Since one of the targeted genes, GLN1, is at a branching point in the S. cerevisiae amino acid metabolism, we were worried that a too strong promoter could cause auxotrophy for glutamate [1]. Hence, we were looking for intermediate strength promoters. Further, we were interested in how the promoters perform when cells grow on acetate, since the carbon source in our planned co-culture is acetate. While researching different promoters, we realized that information on different promoters’ characteristics on acetate is very sparse. Therefore, we planned and performed a promoter study where we investigated the expression of four promoter candidates compared to the native promoters we wanted to replace. GFP and the different promoters were inserted into a p416 backbone and the resulting plasmids were used to transform S. cerevisiae. The GFP expression was viewed with a fluorescence microscope and quantified spectrophotometrically in a plate reader. The promoter strengths were measured for cells grown on both acetate and glucose. Except for enabling a good choice of promoters to exchange in S. cerevisiae, this kind of information could be very useful to other parts of the iGEM community that needs information on promoters and thus serves a purpose in itself. The results of the promoter study are available here on our wiki and we encourage other iGEM teams as well as anyone else to use it for future projects.
Introduction
For the promoter candidates a total of four promoters, pTEF1, pPYK2, pPCK1 and pFBP1 were initially chosen for testing. Along with this, the promoters native to the genes we wanted to overexpress, pAQR1 and pGLN1, were investigated. However, problems with the construction of the plasmid with pFBP1 resulted in it being dropped from the study due to time limitations. pTEF1 is generally regarded as a strong constitutive promoter ["

Tryptic digest of gel lanes for analysis with MALDI-TOF
Note:
Make sure to work under a fume hood.
Do not work with protective gloves to prevent contamination of your sample with platicizers.
Reaction tubes have to be cleaned with 60% (v/v) CH3CN, 0,1% (v/v) TFA. Afterwards the solution has to be removed completely followed by evaporation of the tubes under a fume hood. Alternatively microtiter plates from Greiner® (REF 650161) can be used without washing.
Cut out the protein lanes of a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE using a clean scalpel. Gel parts are transferred to the washed reaction tubes/microtiter plate. If necessary cut the parts to smaller slices.
Gel slices should be washed two times. Therefore add 200 µL 30% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0,1 M ammonium hydrogen carbonate each time and shake lightly for 10 minutes. Remove supernatant and discard to special waste.
Dry gel slices at least 30 minutes in a Speedvac.
Rehydrate gel slices in 15 µL Trypsin-solution followed by short centrifugation.
Gel slices have to be incubated 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by incubation at 37 °C overnight.
Dry gel slices at least 30 minutes in a Speedvac.
According to the size of the gel slice, add 5 – 20 µL 50% (v/v) ACN / 0,1% (v/v) TFA.
Samples can be used for MALDI measurement or stored at -20 °C.
Trypsin-solution: 1 µL Trypsin + 14 µL 10 mM NH4HCO3
Therefore solubilize lyophilized Trypsin from Promega® in 200 µL of provided buffer and incubate for 15 minutes at 30 °C for activation. For further use it can be stored at -20 °C.

Prepared 1 litre of LB-Agar and separated in 4x500 ml beakers and sent for autoclaving with a beaker of eppendorfs. Since it was not received before 18:00, we couldn't perform transformation for the the 6 plasmid backbone biobricks today and hence just diluted the frozen DNA of them. These biobricks will be used in all the modules of this project Looked into the protocol that will be used for transformation of them in ccdB resistant competent cells.
Ran the agarose gel electrophoresis with the 10 biobricks [R0040, J23008, J23031, B0015, K081013, S03335, S03473, I714031, E0840, J23100] for 1 hour to check the extracted DNA. It must be continued tomorrow hence the gel was preserved in fridge.
Inoculated the top10 cells for preparing competent cells, λp-GFP [R0040] and one of the two colonies got from RBS[B0034] and pLacI[R0010] plates, in 5 ml culture tubes for plasmid DNA extraction.

Used mfold to produce 3 locks: one with weak RBS, one with weaker RBS and one with strong RBS.
Using the 2-state hybridization server, combined the key3c with each of the 4 locks (lock3c, weak lock, weaker lock and strong lock) to obtain the hybridised structure.
Created weak key, weaker key and strong key sequences for each of the last three locks by taking the hybridization of each lock with the key3c and correcting the kinks by changing the key3c sequence.
Biobricked the weak, weaker and strong keys into the registry.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Detector_-_-_TEXT.html," negatives. To increase the binding affinity of the TALEs, we picked the pyrimidine-rich regions of the stx2 gene. The relative binding affinity of different RVDs to their respective nucleotides is as follows: NG (1)> NN (0.18) ~ HD (0.16) >> NI (0.0016)> NK (0.00016) where they bind to T, G, C, A, and G, respectively (Meckler et al. 2013). Therefore, picking regions rich in thymines and cytosines would greatly enhance the binding affinity of the TALE to the DNA segment.
Another important factor in the selection of the two TALE target sequences was the distance between them. The distance had to be great enough so that the TALE and the FerriTALE could bind without steric hindrance but short enough so that the possibility of these two target sequences shearing and separating is reduced. In order for our system to work, the two regions of DNA that the TALEs bind to must remain contiguous, i.e., on the same stretch of DNA. Therefore, we picked target sequences as close to each other as possible to decrease the chances of a cut between the two target sites. We determined the ideal distance between the two binding sites were 200 bp.
The TALEs were designed to be extremely specific. Based on the considerations explained above, a number of possible target sites were selected. To determine the most specific pair, we conducted BLAST searches on each candidate TALE target sequence separately. As expected, we observed a huge number of alignments with EHEC strains. We also found some partial alignments in non-EHEC organisms, which were screened to determine if they can be found in the environment of the cattle. For example, consider the two selected target sites to be [1] and [2]. If [1] had a 90% alignment to a region in the human genome, we checked to see if [2] could also be found in the human genome. If it was found, then we checked to see whether both [1] and [2] were found on the same chromosome; if they were found on different chromosomes, meaning they were not physically attached, the system would not detect it as a false positive. If they were found on the same chromosome, we determined which end of the target sequences aligned with the similar DNA sequence. This is important as TALEs are polar and bind significantly stronger to the 5’ end of their target sequence compared to the 3’ end (Meckler et"
SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#K343004_-_-_TEXT.html,"40 generations. All data can be seen under Raw data
As seen in the graph, almost all of the bacteria had lost the plasmid after 20 generations, suggesting that the plasmid is only stable within the cell for a few generations (<20). This is presumably due to the strain brought upon the bacteria by the plasmid. Thereby when the bacteria are carrying a high-copy plasmid like pSB1C3-K343004 it is to be expected that the bacteria will quickly lose the plasmid when no longer exposed to a selection pressure. It is likely to believe that pSB3C5-K343004, since being a low-copy plasmid, will not exert as much strain on the bacteria, and might therefore be stable for more generations than pSB1C3-K343004. Therefore a stability assay of this plasmid might be of interest.
Growth assay
The purpose of this assay is to see if our transformants deviate from the wild type in growth rate. In the growth measurement assay we have measured OD at 550 nm every hour for 12 hours and at hour 24. In the experimental set-up we used no lag phase was observed in any of the measurements. The graph below shows the growth of our wild type E. coli strain MG1655, the MG1655/pSB3K3-K343004 and MG1655/pSB1C3-K343004.
Figure 9: Growth curve of E.coli strain MG1655-pSB1C3-K343004 and MG1655-pSB3K3-K343004 compared with the wild type E. coli strain MG1655 showing no significant difference between the three curves. No Lag phase observed. All data can be seen under Raw data
From our data we see no significant difference between the plasmid carrying bacteria and the wild type. This can be said to be quite contradictory to our results obtained from the stability assay. The transitory stability of pSB1C3-K343004 suggests that it is highly unfavorable for the bacteria, wherefore it might be expected that the growth of the bacteria containing this plasmid would be affected. Thus, however much disadvantages the plasmid pose to the bacteria, their growth are not significantly influenced by the plasmid. The added reproduction load due to the plasmids, might also prolong the lag phase of the bacteria. Whether this is the case can not be concluded based on this experiment as no lag phase was observed in this experiment.
