Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," We told him that some people are precarious if visual impaired students are able to work in a laboratory where they are confronted with many chemicals and different sources of dangers.Our PI answered us that of course, it is important to label some bottles and equipment in braille or with other haptic marks. In addition, it is necessary to have a well-structured and organized workspace with clearly defined places for the equipment.  According to him, it did not cost much effort to prepare a special workspace for a visual impaired student because anyway lab spaces should be well organized.
He never had the feeling, that visual impairment was a barrier in daily lab work for his student. He confirmed that his students was working independent, efficient and was reliable. Prof. Dr. Gert Bange strongly believes that no matter if, someone has a handicap, everyone should get the same opportunity to show his or her expertise and knowledge.
The complete scientific community would benefit of all those talents, if we start encouraging people with disabilities to study STEM-fields. In order to do so we would like to lay the foundation stone for a scientific world without hindrances for visually impaired people with our barrier-free Wiki.
We thank Prof. Dr. Bange for sharing his impressions and experience with us and supporting our ideas.
Visit of chemistry lesson in the Carl-Strehl-School for the Visually Impaired
Students are working in groups with their customized laptops.
In the context of our human practices project, we had the opportunity to visit the chemistry lessons of a 12th grade from the Blista School for pupils with visual impairment. About 15 students were taught about the nomenclature of alkanes. The teacher catered for students with different needs using various methods. One of these methods attracted our attention when we entered the classroom. Every student possesses his or her own laptop. Asking the students, we figured out, that the school is providing laptops for each student.
Dr Tobias Mahnke explaining the content of the lesson in one-on-one conversation.
The teachers upload worksheets on their intranet and using their laptops, the students are able to use these worksheets by scaling them up or using a screen reader. Additionally, he printed the worksheets in normal print with a big font size and in braille depending on their individual handicap. Another haptic method is the usage of magnets or models in different shapes, to give the students an idea of atomic bonds and orbitals. Additionally, auditory methods were used to distinguish between different chemicals in tubes.
After the lesson, we had some time to talk to the teacher and he confronted us with a very interesting question: “How do you explain"

We used an agarose gel to test if the digest from the day before had worked successfully and also to find out if the PCR had worked. We also prepared our samples for imaging.
Day 42 18/08/15
We set up overnight cultures of the transformed ligations.
Day 43 19/08/15
We miniprepped the overnight cultures of the ligated pSB1C3 and pVS72 that were cultured overnight. Following the miniprep, we digested the plasmids. Simultaneous to the digest, we transformed 1µl of the plasmid into VS45 competent cells.
Day 44 20/08/15
We ran an agarose gel of digested plasmids from the night before. Overnight cultures of ligations of pSB1C3 and pVS72 were also set up.
Day 45 21/08/15
We miniprepped the overnight cultures. Following the miniprep, we ligated pSB1C3 and pVS72 as the previous ligations did not work. Alongside the ligations, some of the team members used Gibson assembly to fuse fragments containing CsgAss and Sup35NM to pSB1C3. The Gibson assembly products were then transformed into competent cells and incubated at 22ºC over the weekend.
Day 46 24/08/15
We carried out Gibson assembly of fragments containing CsgAss, Sup35NM and Cytochrome b562, followed by transformation into competent cells. The ligations from the day before were digested and run on a gel. We set up overnight cultures of the Gibson assembly product from 21/08/15.
Day 47 25/08/15
We carried out PCR of fragments and set up overnight cultures of the Gibson assembled fragments that grew overnight. We then miniprepped and set up a digest of the Gibson Assembled fragments containing CsgAss and Sup35NM from the overnight cultures. From the digest, an agarose gel was run.
Day 48 26/08/15
We did Gibson Assembly of fragments containing CsgAss and Sup35NM with pSB1A3 and Gibson Assembly of fragments containing CsgAss, Sup35NM and Cytochrome b562.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," Even gradient illumination profiles are possible, setting the illumination intensities individually for the leftmost and rightmost wells of microtiter plate.
Hashing for control of data integrity. A hash function is used to ensure the data integrity of illumination protocols transmitted from the Bluetooth application to the LED panel. Only if the hash1, which is created by the Bluetooth application, is matching hash2 created by the LED panel after data transfer, the LED panel starts the illumination.
After the desired illumination protocol is created, the data is submitted to the LED panel via Bluetooth. Especially for sensitive experimental setups, it is extremely important that no data gets lost or corrupted during the transmission to the LED Panel. Otherwise, the illumination protocol could differ from the one created in the Bluetooth application. In order to prevent this from happening, we implemented a hashing algorithm to the transfer protocol. The hash function creates an individual identifier for a given input String, in this case the complete program sequence that is going to be submitted to the LED panel. This ""fingerprint"" is added to the transfered data stream. When the Teensy receives a program sequence via Bluetooth, it applies the same hashing function as the Bluetooth app to the received data and compares the resulting identifier with the transmitted fingerprint. Only if both are the same, the data transmittance was successful, and the LED panel begins the illumination protocol.
LED panel: Applications
This device enables the sophisticated irradiation of samples with a high resolution of light of different wavelengths and intensities. We demonstrated and evaluated the functionality by exciting and bleaching GFP and inducing conformational and structural changes of non-canonical amino acids by irradiation at 367 nm and 465 nm. After initial testing, the panel was applied for various crucial experiments. We envision several applications like mutagenesis, fluorescence studies, opto-genetics, opto-proteomics, photo-biochemistry and surface decontamination.
GFP-Excitation
The LED panel we created can be used to visually detect cultures expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) through excitation with the blue LEDs. They emit light with a mean wavelength of 465 nm which is close to the absorption maximum of GFP at 485 nm, so that fluorescence will be visible. In this case the LED panel can be used as a small portable blue light table to screen your cultures or just make cool pictures. To get the best fluorescence signal, the panel should be on low brightness between 10 and 20 %. Additionally, a matching filter should be used to filter the light emitted by the panel itself and increase the contrast.

Calgary,2011,Team:Calgary#Outreach#Report_-_-_TEXT.html," standard for the analysis of NAs in tailings samples is performed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). FTIR involves a filtered acidified sample of tailings that is put into a rotarytumbler apparatus, using hexane to extract NAs. The absorbance of the NAs sample is then compared to commercially available NA mixtures of known concentration. This particular quantification method measures the amount of carboxyl groups in the sample. Since the composition of the commercial mixture is not likely to match that of the sample, there remains some bias in the total NA value of the sample. Lab/analysis companies, such as Maxaam Analytics, charge around $200 per sample. This price may vary based on the amount of business supplied by the client, and so would be less for those companies practicing regular testing/analysis.

The Use of Synthetic Biology in the Oil Sands
One of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act of 1999’s guiding principles is based on ""precautionary principle"". The principle, which states that “where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation"". Without implying threat or serious consequences from the use of synthetic organisms, it remains that synthetic biology is a relatively new area of science. In particular, considering that by its very nature, the broad-spectrum technology may be employed for an exhaustive number of very specific applications, it is difficult and still controversial to determine the technology as generally safe. Instead, case-by-case assessment of the safe-use of applications may be more logical. As it remains, the overall technology still requires much time and testing to prove its safe-use, and this is an obstacle that could very well have to be overcome even before individual applications are investigated. Since the Government of Canada operates"
XJTU-China,2018,Team:XJTU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," we do diretecd evolution for more times, we will get the same result and the increase of conversion rate with directed evolution is stable, while the conversion rate of DTE in natural evolution system fluctuate in a certain range.
If we have a system with a stable psicose production of 50,what happens in directed evolution system is the slight increase in the production with the times of producting increasing. Whereas, the production of natural evolution system is still in the original production and vibrate in a small range.
With more simulations ,we can find that although the production is not always increasing all the time, the main stream of the directed evolution is to have a good production of psicose. The production of natural system will increase or decrease due to the vibration of the conversion rate, and if we select the positive strain each evolution process,, we will get the same production results which is the factory method for strain selection.

Procedure
Part 1: Casting the gel (optimized for large gels)
Add 0.5g agarose and 50mL of 1X TAE buffer to an Erlenmeyer flask.
Note that the TAE buffer in the stock has 50X concentration and needs to be diluted with autoclaved Milli-Q water.
Place the flask into the microwave. After this step flask will be hot. Use heat gloves.
Set the timer to 2 min. Start the microwave oven but stop every 30 sec to swirl the contents of the flask. This helps suspend the undissolved agarose. Continue until agarose particles are dissolved.
While hot, add 3µl of 10,000X SYBR Safe into the agarose solution and mix throughly.
Set the flask aside for cooling. Occasionally swirl to make the cooling even.
Set up the gel tray and make sure that there is no leak by testing it with dH20 and KimWipes.
When the flask is cool enough for you to handle easily, pour the solution into the tray.
Wait until the gel solidifies.
Part 2: Loading the gel
Make 400mL of 1XTAE buffer per gel.
Note that the TAE buffer in the stock has 50X concentration and needs to be diluted with autoclaved Milli-Q water.
Make a note of what is going into each well and put that in your lab notebook.
Determine the DNA concentrations via Nanodrop. (Approximately 100ng DNA per band is required.)
Cut a piece of parafilm to use as a mixing surface. Alternatively, you can use PCR tubes.

Aachen
Aachen 2017 was doing a project to recover Na + from factory wastewater. Its design was close to our objective and there were data to be helpful in many respects. We contacted them, taught their unpublished data, and got advice on our experimental plan. Please see the link for details : Aachen 2017
Knock-out-strain
Initially, we were planning to make ΔENA1 strain, ΔNHA1 strain and ΔENA1ΔNHA1 double knocked out strain with reference to team Aachen’s previous report that ΔENA1  and ΔNHA1 strain frequently take in salt. Then when we were consulting with Prof. Uozumi, about one salt resistance gene (HKT 1), we learned to use a strain named G19 (ΔENA1-4) which expects to have greater ability to absorb salt. Experiments with this strain revealed that the amount of salt absorption was quite large, but G19 strain could not be used because of the limited number of the marker. So we made our own standard ΔENA1,2,5 knockout yeast which lacks same corresponding gene as ENA1-4.
Soy sauce yeast
We were thinking of what should be good for salt resistance genes to put into yeast. As we looked through many papers, it turned out that soy sauce yeast is a promising candidate. So I went to ask Dr. Watanabe of Japanese soy sauce maker Yamasa Soy Sauce. Dr. Watanabe taught the experimental method of dealing with soy sauce yeast and also introduced us a few soy sauce yeast strains with salt tolerance. As a result of using the soy sauce yeast, we found that it shows very strong salt tolerance, and the effectiveness of the experiment to introduce the resistance gene of soy sauce yeast into budding yeast was supported.
It turned out that using soy sauce yeast genes to create seasonings that we normally use is effective for obtaining salt tolerance!

Only free scientists are able to question the issues of our world and advance towards new and sustainable innovation to better and protect society’s prosperity. By marching on the streets with so many other like minded people we also want to demonstrate our support for scientists living in countries where they oppressed by their governments.
Society and Science in Context
Moreover,  our modern days face a divide between opinions and scientifically proven facts. People spend a lot of time discussing amongst themselves or in the digital world coming to conclusions more based on someone’s opinion than on validated research. The buzzword “alternative facts” refers to fabricated lies and they harm the trust in researches and diminish the perception of science in peoples minds. However, opinionism cannot protect us from the consequences of our denial. By marching on the streets people could see that we are normal citizens like everyone else. We wanted them to put a friendly face to all the science they might fear. A person they can talk to and restore the trust in experts’ advice.

Background
Normally, bacteria cannot survive in extremely acid and alkali. So before producing acid or alkali, the bacteria should be able to tolerate acidic or alkaline environment. Two devices are applied to achieve it.
The first is alkali-resistance device, consisting of Nha protein family.
Nha is a family containing a number of bacterial sodium-proton anti-porters. These are integral membrane proteins that catalyze the exchange of proton for sodium in a manner highly dependent on the pH. To resist different pH, we select two genes, NhaA and Nha, from this family.
NhaA is the archetypal Na+/H+ antiporter and the only member of the family that is required by E.coli for survival under alkaline stress[1,2]. It is a membrane protein consisting of 388 residues[3]. NhaA excretes Na+ from the cytoplasm using the energy from the cotransport of protons down their electrochemical gradient into the cell, with a characteristic electrogenic stoichiometry of two protons to one Na+[4,5](Fig.1). Like many other Na+/H+ antiporters, NhaA is regulated by pH. It is essentially inactive below pH 7, and the Na+ efflux rate increases by three orders of magnitude between pH 6.5 and 8.5[6].
Fig.1
Fig.2
The NhaB gene encodes Na+/H+ antiporter catalyzing the exchange of 3 H+ per 2 Na+(Fig.2). [7]NhaB has a high affinity for sodium. In the absence of NhaA, NhaB confers a certain tolerance to Na+ which decreases with increasing pH. Essential for regulation of intracellular pH under alkaline conditions, NhaB is crucial when the level of NhaA activity is limiting, when NhaA is not sufficiently induced, and/or when NhaA is not activated[8]. Unlike NhaA, the activity of N"

LCG-UNAM-Mexico,2008,Team:LCG-UNAM-Mexico#Notebook#2008-August 2_-_-_TEXT.html," Andersen et al (1998) conclude that the LAA and LVA tails confer about the same time of life  to GFP.
Reaction rate:
Once we get the half-life time of the protein, how do we calculate the rate of reaction and the flow?
The half-life of a reaction (t1/2) is the time it takes for half of the reagents to become  products. In a first order reaction, t1/2 is a  constant and can be calculated from the rate constant, as follows:
t1/2 =-ln(0.5)/k=0.693/k
This reciprocal relationship between the half life time and the rate constant is very useful when making an estimate of the time a reaction will take to occur. Thus, for k = 0.01/s, the half life time would  be about 70 s. For k = 10/s, the half life would be of about 0.07 s or 70 milliseconds. The average life of the reactions of first order is also independent of the initial concentration. If the first half of the molecules react in aprox 20 s, half of the remaining  molecules will also take 20 s to react, and so on. The fact that the average lifetime in an unimolecular reaction is a constant means that, at any time of the reaction, a constant fraction of reactive molecules have enough  energy to overcome the kinetic barrier and become molecules of product. This makes sense because the energy of a set of molecules is distributed randomly according to a Boltzmann distribution.

NOTE: A first order reaction is the type A → B.
Today we sent an e-mail to Dr. Peter Chivers, an expert in RcnR, to ask him for information in regards to RcnA.
Our mail to Dr. Peter Chivers:
Dr. Peter Chivers,
Hi! My name is Carlos and I'm a student of the Undergraduate Program in Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and currently I'm on the fourth year.
The main reason of this e-mail is to get in contact with you, I'll explain you why as briefly as I can. Several students of the program decided to participate in a systems biology competition known as iGEM, and our project focuses on regulating nickel efflux in e. coli. We have to both build the circuit and design a mathematical model to accurately predict the behaviour of our system.
Taking several issues in consideration we decided to regulate RcnA.

What is the Blood Clotter?
When our team started meeting, we had many great project ideas, such as taking on autoimmune disorders or treating fetal alcohol syndrome. We also considered bacterial fuel cells, terraforming bacteria, biofilm inhibitors, and synthetic ivory production. After a gladiator-style fight to the death, we narrowed it down to clotting blood. We asked ourselves who we wanted to help, what kind of wounds we wanted to treat, and how we could interact with our community. We decided that we want to focus on the medical field, more specifically medical treatment in emergency situations. We recognized that in most emergency situations, excessive blood loss is a threat that could result in hypovolemic shock, anemia or even death. Preventing or reducing blood loss would greatly increase the chances of survival as well as speeding up the healing process. After discussing different wound sizes and how our project could be applied to each, we decided we would focus mainly on treating medium to large sized wounds. Then, we started designing a construct based around snake venom. Some snake venoms are very effective at inducing blood clotting by skipping many steps of the clotting pathway and thereby greatly increasing the rate of blood clotting. The Cerastes cerastes snake venom acts similar to thrombin in the blood clotting cascade, causing inactive fibrinogen to be converted into active fibrin monomers. Along with Factor XVIII, the fibrin monomers form a crosslink structure that traps red blood cells, resulting in a blood clot.
For human practices we have been contacting professionals in relevant fields to ensure that our project is applicable in real-world emergency situations. Another component of our human practices is the community outreach we have been conducting. For example, we have gone to schools in Southern Alberta to educate students with respect to our project and iGEM."

ANNIE PEI
If you’re fortunate enough to get the chance to meet Annie Pei, your first impression will mostly likely fall along the lines of how incredibly kind she is, and how extensive her knowledge of celebrity gossip is. Even so, only those lucky enough to become close to Annie know that she is one of the most fiercely loyal and dedicated friends anyone could ask for. Her vivacious personality and willingness to go out of her way for others make her an irreplaceable addition to our iGEM team. Not only does she sacrifice sleep for the outreach committee, she also dedicates her time to being a competitive dancer, an ambitious student, and a connoisseur of red bean popsicles.
SRI PINNAMAREDDY
Sri is the baby of our group (yet still somehow super mature). She is literally the definition of well-rounded. Class president, athletic, insanely smart, artistic, AND passionate. It’s like the gods just dumped all the positive attributes into the mixing pot! However, I strongly advise against getting in an argument with Sri because her debating skills are legendary. She could probably convince you that you are half unicorn. Sri’s addictions lay with anything organic and pocky sticks (even though they’re not organic). Being the super compassionate person she is, she hopes to dedicate her life by serving others as a healthcare professional.
COURTNEY TAING
As a first-year iGEM member, Courtney is a great addition to the team because she gels perfectly with any group. She is not afraid to face new challenges and difficulties head on and assume the position of leadership, which makes her crucial to the success of our team. Outside of her iGEM duties, she also participates in varsity cross country, where she tries to outrun all her responsibilities. There has also never been a greater lover of donuts. Seriously. If your donuts ever mysteriously go missing, Courtney is probably shoving them down her throat.
VICTOR VALBUENA
Hey, Vsauce! Victor here. And so is iGEM. But what is iGEM? Well, as we all know, iGEM stands for “ingenious glorious exceptional machines” - but where did this competition start? In 2003, iGEM was conceived at MIT. By 2005 iGEM had gone international, and now in 2018 iGEM is the single greatest organization every created in the history of our species.

This ensures that it is binding to a specific RNA sequences and not just the PolyA tail. - Applications: the PUF library is obvious and useful, but could also use PUF as a scaffolding tool in the style of zinc fingers. - How about engineering different kinds of PUF? First need to make sure it works in prokaryotes, then test the first type of PUF and optimize where the binding site should be. Then and only then we should look at making different versions of PUF and starting the library. - For this to work at all, it is necessary to make really sure that PUF works in E. coli. o It is possible to make this work with cDNA. Are we sure that we can get the cDNA from UNC? - It is a small protein. It might be easier to just synthesize it rather than clone it. We should definitely start with cDNA.
iGEM Weekly Meeting Minutes 4/22/12 Announcements Angela – New advisors! Kori Dunn, Angela’s graduate advisor in Prof. Rao’s lab. Prof. Joe Bradley of Business and Administration is our new Entrepreneurship advisor. Everyone needs to sign up for the iGEM dropbox, there are important papers and documents there that are useful for everyone. We will video chat with Dr. Wong will happen this Tuesday from 3-4 at the 2nd floor of the gatehouse. If the advisor’s are available, we will have a normal advisor’s meeting from 4-5 (this is tentative, watch for a confirmation email). Angela has received the PUF plasmid from UNC and is looking to see if the transformation is successful. If the transformation is successful we will move onto designing the construct. University of Michigan iGEM president is coming down this week. When will we meet with him? Isiah – not present, but everyone needs to send him the categorized inventory information! Adi – Met with Joe Bradley. PUF and Phat projects were discussed, but mainly PUF. If the PUF project is successful, we will have made steps towards making a toolkit. We have the option of marketing our toolkit or targeting a specific disease. Our first step is intellectual property. The patent database, USPTO, and Espacenet will be searched to see if any patents exist already. If we choose the business plan model, we will market our team as though we are a company"

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," order to optimize our project and have a well-developed plan of human practice activities, we held weekly discussion panels. These panels were extremely helpful in optimizing the design and implementation of our project. It is worth mentioning that most of discussion panels we held were really inspiring where a few experts in synthetic biology kindly attended our panel meetings which were made of 21 undergraduates majoring in biology, biochemistry, chemical engineering, pharmaceutical engineering and etc. Meanwhile, these experts also advised us on human practices.
2015 Bioeco
On July 23rd, we participated in 2015 International Conference for Bioeconomy, which is China's most influential technology platform and professional exhibition about life sciences and medical technology. At the opening ceremony, we heard experts' reports and thought a lot about bioeconomy and our project. Professor Sang, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, pointed out Chinese pharmaceutical enterprises lacked pharmaceutical innovation and investment in research and development, so Chinese new drug market was monopolized by large international companies. Then, Professor Marshall, the winner of Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 2005, told us his story about research and industrialization in Tianjin. We learned about the thought about transfering scientific research results into efficient industrial production capability and putting products into market.
What experts said makes us think about product design of our project, we've been thinking about that our project is also bio-economy, the protein chip can fast and accurately detect condition of patients' health and the plastic degradation can save a lot of resources. It's possible we can create something for bio-economy as long as we do our utmost in research. Meanwhile, inspired by the Professor Sang and Professor Marshall, we began to concern about whether our project was creative in cancer treatment and could be put into practice we plan to go to local hospital to consult with stakeholders and address the problems. (Local Hospital Visit)
The 10th Seminar On China's Plastics Industry
On 31th July, in order to know more current information concerning Chinese plastics industry and seek experts for assessment of our project, we attended the 10th seminar on high technology and industrialization of China's plastics industry hosted by CPPIA(China Plastics Processing Industry Association). The guests and speakers in attendance were a mix of academics from universities interested in plastic and industry representatives. From the seminar, we obtained a lot of information such as the status quo of Chinese recycling of waste PET, the difference between domestic and abroad recycling of waste PET. Finally, we had some brief talks with some experts, introducing our iGEM team, what's more, two experts told us their opinion about"

Depending on the GOI, different means for read out of gene expression come into play. At first, we applied dual-luciferase assay , since we used Luciferase as a reporter for a proof-of-principle approach. Later on, semi-quantitative immunoblots were prepared for testing of therapeutic genes. However, all the received information fed our models, thereby creating an integrative feedback loop between experiments and in silico simulation.
miTuner Kit components
The miTuner Kit consists of three basic components:
a) A kit of standardized synthetic microRNAs, corresponding binding sites, promoters and luciferase expression constructs as well as measurement constructs assembled in the BB-2 standard. As the miTuner kit was enabled
b) Protocols for engineering synthetic microRNAs, synthetic single microRNA binding sites as well as microRNA binding site patterns
Please find basic information about the kit components and engineering of the kit here

Results
All gene regulatory constructs for tuning, Off- or On-targeting can easily be assembled using BBB standard cloning from our miRNA Kit parts . After successful cloning, the constructs can be transfected onto a cell line of choice or transferred into a virus backbone for in vivo experiments. For our proof of principle, we used firefly luciferase normalized to Renilla luciferase on miTuner to characterize knockdown efficiencies of different binding sites and show Off- and On-targeting by mouse infection carried by an AAV virus.
miTuner: Expression Fine-Tuning by Synthetic miRNAs
The data shows a precisely tuned expression from almost 0% to 100% (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Lowest expression refers to complete knockdown through fusion of perfect binding sites (always green bar on the left hand side of the figures) to the reporter gene. Expression from a construct without binding sites is set as 100% (always orange column on the right hand side of the figures). In presence of the specific shRNA miR, gene expression was mediated to various levels through interactions with the different imperfect binding sites. Whereas, when an unspecific shRNA miR was expressed, gene expression remained unaffected (see raw data below). This reference shows that the binding sites were correctly designed, since they seem to interact specifically with a referring shRNA miR.

Motivation for Igem Participation
The idea of creating new constructs and improving those previously made which may help improve all fields of science is very exciting. I had to grab the opportunity to work together with other young scientists and learn from those who have been in the field.
The global community is approaching a time where it will require innovative ways to maximize its resources. Synthetic biology is going to play a major role in an age where resources are limited and life depends heavily on science. Participating in iGEM will give me the opportunity to get a glimpse into this amazing new branch of science.  I’m hoping that my participation in this will inspire others to go into the field of science and explore the world.

Motivation for Igem Participation
I was pleased to be informed of the iGEM competition, because it provides a perfect opportunity to interact with my peers and learn from the mentors. I am eager to improve my skills in a lab environment and to adapt myself to such a working environment. I perceive this opportunity as a significant advancement in my University career and I value the experience I can gain from taking part in this competition. Furthermore, I can gain a lot of extra knowledge on subjects that do not necessarily form part of the undergraduate syllabus.
I believe that I am passionate about biology and I do enjoy working in a team environment. I realize that this is a perfect opportunity for me to gain valuable experience while I am still busy with my undergraduate studies, experience which will also be valuable in the future when I apply for work after I am done with my studies.

Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Humanpratices_-_-_TEXT.html," also presented at the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines competition on Sep 15-16, 2012. aGEM, currently in its fourth year, is a western Canada gathering of iGEM teams, where they present and receive feedback from a star-studded panel of judges. Although patterned after iGEM, aGEM attracts its own audience, including more than 100 largely local luminaries who came to hear about advancements in synthetic biology at the hands of Canadian students. Although this year Calgary won aGEM (boo! hiss! the University of Calgary is a traditional rival to the University of Alberta), we received encouragement and a slate of useful suggestions for the remainder of our project.
High school students who took part in our team will be an important component of our outreach. Their experience, paired with the fact that they are still active in the local high school community will allow them to be powerful proponents of high school iGEM, and will hopefully allow them to have a part in setting up future high school iGEM teams in Edmonton.
Collaborations
Interaction between iGEM community
We would first like to thank Uppsala 2011 iGEM team, for introducing amilGFP to the iGEM universe. Although we did not need to contact them directly, the data and sequences they contributed to the parts registry formed the core of the colors we used this summer.
We have supplied strains and plasmids to a number of other iGEM teams. Both the University of British Columbia and University of Calgary iGEM teams relied on E. coli knockout strains we had access to and provided to them. Additionally, the CINVESTAV-IPN-UNAM_MX iGEM team used a number of BioBricks first made by the 2007 and 2008 University of Alberta iGEM teams, which we provided to them along with technical suggestions. (Parenthetically, we note that the border issues faced by some teams pales in comparison to those faced by Canadians.)
Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
      Biosafety regulations are national, international and local measures installed to minimize any risks involved in biological research.  When determining the dangers that one’s research poses to their fellow researchers, the public at large, and the surrounding environment, we must first refer to the World Health Organization (WHO) biosafety manual to determine the risk level of the microorganisms involved.

Once the plasmids are resuspended, the experimentalist mix them together in a mix containing the BsaI enzyme and T4 ligase and put them in the thermocycler for 5 hours. At the end, the product can be directly transformed and plated. A first round of screening on the good polymerization length can be made using colony PCR with the standard VF2 and VR primers. If required, a second step of screening can be made after miniprepping using BbsI. Given the very small rate of mutation, only two clones with the good digestion or colony PCR signature can be sent for sequencing; they will contain the correct construct with a very high probability.
This technique however requires to screen an important number of clones because we don't have a total control over what is assembled inside the cassette, because of the freedom we left for the RBS-Protein entities to polymerize. We will show in the next paragraph how we can gain a relative control over it. To reduce the costs of screening, we encourage the use of colony PCR over mini-preping and digestion when possible.
Other advantages of GoldenBricks over any other standard cloning techniques
Non standard assembly and ""split-construct"" vectors
If you are willing to create a non standard assembly or to control very precisely RBS-protein pairing over a polycistrons, you might like to create the construct in two times and assemble them together in a second step. This is why we have created the ""split-construct"" vectors. The split-contruct vectors are similar to the goldenbrick vectors except that they contain the OH2-OH5 or the OH1-OH4 overhangs instead of the OH1-OH5 overhangs as the GoldenBrick plasmid.
These vectors enable the assembly of shorter casette containing only a promoter, and a serie of RBS-protein for the ""split-construct"" 1 vector, or RBS-protein terminator for the ""split-construct"" 2 vector. This way, if a non standard biobrick assembly has to be carried out in between the two pieces or if a long polycistron has to be created, they can be assembled using the standard EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI cloning or Gibson assembly, but several cloning step will be saved by using GoldenBricks compared to the standard assembly of the full cassette.

How does it work?
NsrR action is lifted by Nitric Oxide, allowing transcription
The BBa_K381001 BioBrick is normally repressed by proteins in the cell native to E. coli. However, when cells containing the BioBrick are exposed to Nitrates, these will diffuse into the cell, and be converted to Nitric Oxide.
This in turn interacts with the proteins blocking BioBrick expression and allows the production of GFP. For more information on how this works, refer to the detailed promoter page here
Performance
Graph 1: relationship between KNO3 level and fluorescence
Performance of the promoter specifically was assessed using a Miller Assay. Whilst performance of the BioBrick as a whole was characterised with an assay measuring change in GFP expression with changes in Potassium Nitrate levels. Graph 1 shows a GFP assay of the BioBrick between 0 - 10mM, indicating a clear trend of increasing fluorescence with Nitrate levels.

How do we engage the general public to understand the problem and the solution?
The #UncolourMeCurious Campaign
Our #UncolourMeCurious campaign was created so that awareness of the problem of azo dye pollution could spread hence breaking down the responsibility of the problem to anybody and everybody as suggested by our Citizen Synbio panel discussion. The #UncolourMeCurious campaign comprised of three fantastic art collaborations, a conceptual short film and social media campaign.  This culminated in the #UncolourMeCurious Exhibition with works from numerous BioArt collaborators including Central St Martins, Natsai Audrey, Linden Gledhill and The Slade . On the opening night the spread of attendees ranged though the Ethical Fashion Forum, Jack Wills, Guardian Newspaper and many more.
Central St. Martins Collaboration: Breaking into Bioart
We approached the Central St Martins textiles department with our ideas of synthetic biology and science and they asked ‘When does technology like this become accessible?’ This question yielded a set of beautiful visualisation of the way our bacteria could be used to create art if controlled by light. These pieces by second year Textiles Design BA students Cameo Bondy and Barbara Czepiel exhibit the textiles that could be created if our bacteria contained optogenetic biobricks that switched their dye breakdown capacities on and off via light cues.
See samples of their work below:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html,"We wanted the syringe pump to look more appealing, that's why we made significant changes to the design.
The teflon coated lead screw in this project is unnecessarily complicated and hard to find. Similar results could be achieved with a simple trapezoidal threaded spindle and lubricant.
The new baseplate's form enabled us to make a cable channel shaped like a spline. We interpolated it in a way, so that it has the least slope possible. The cable can now simply be pushed through the channel without having to use a large opening.
Hall sensors as end stops are difficult to calibrate and were replaced by push buttons.
Instead of the copper bearing that easily wear out, we obtained linear ball bearings.
The syringe is now mounted with a bayonet that makes it a lot easier to operate
User Feedback from our Collaboration with the iGEM Team TU Darmstadt
We convinced the iGEM team from TU Darmstadt (also in Germany) to test our syringe pump as beta-testers, so that we can get direct feedback from the iGEM community concerning our most complex part. As all the other parts are far more simple we assume that iGEM students that manage the printing and assembly of our syringe pump will also be able to assemble the whole biotINK bioprinter. Here is their feedback after they assembled our syringe pump:
The pump is neat and stable. The idea of using buttons as end stops is in principle good. You took the necessary holes into account and we were able to assemble it according to the instructions. The click system for the syringe was well made and worked straightaway. The linear bearing could be used right away as well.
We utilized a homemade 3D printer on highest gear for printing the parts. As you might know this leads to relatively many ""aberrations"" and errors in the prints. They made the assembly difficult and we had to post process several of them.
Your construction is designed quite closed, which renders it difficult for any passionate tinkerer to make adaptations after the printing. For instance we noted that you had sent us a printed clutch though the stepper motor was not shortened and did not fit. Therefor we drilled a hole in the front, enlarged the clutch and clued the parts together. In general there are different stepper motors in use in the DIY community, hence we suggest to concept a more general clutch to ease this problem. Furthermore the suspension device for the syringe could be improved, though the varying design of DIY printers makes finding a ""good"" solution rather difficult.

Construction and optimization of PC reporter system
Considering that dCas9 is a huge protein and is structurally complex, we need to figure out the configuration of PC reporter system. We first fused split luciferase to either N or C terminus of dCas9 (Figure 5a) to see its influence. Then, provided that initial binding of dCas9 depends on the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM, a short 3’ motif adjacent to target sequence) [11], four sets of sgRNA orientation settings were also tested (Figure 5b). One set placed two PAM sequences distal from the spacer sequence between the sgRNA pair, with the 5' end of the sgRNA adjacent to the spacer (PAM-out) while another set put both PAM sequences adjacent to the spacer (PAM-in). PAM-direct 1 and PAM-direct 2 combine both sgRNA orientations with one PAM sequence adjacent to and another distal from the spacer (Figure 5b).
In total, 16 pairs of split luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complexes were constructed and tested (Figure 5c). Most of these pairs worked very well.  Among them we selected N-luc-dCas9/C-luc-dCas9, the most robust protein construct with minimal intergroup difference, and PAM-out, the sgRNA orientation exhibiting the strongest luminescence, for the following study.
Figure 5. Construction and optimization of PC reporter system. (a) 4 different split luciferase-dCas9 fusion strategies.  (b) 4 different sgRNA orientation settings. In orientation PAM-out, the pair of PAM sequences are distal from the spacer sequence, with the 5' end of the sgRNA adjacent to the spacer; in orientation PAM-in, the pair of PAM sequences are adjacent to the spacer sequence, with the 3' end of the sgRNA in proximity to the spacer; in orientation PAM-direct 1 and PAM-direct 2, one PAM sequence is adjacent to and another distal from the spacer. (c) The experimental results of PC reporter systems using 16 different (4 different constructs X 4 different sgRNA orientation settings) configurations.

Identifying Safety Issues
Probability
Could there be an unplanned event or series of events involving your project, resulting in either death, injury, occupational illness, damage to equipment or property, or damage to the environment? How likely is that going to happen?
There could always be some sinister series of unfortunate events that leads to disaster, however given the nature of our project, we believe that that little beyond minimal environmental exposure is the scope of catastrophe. Our BioBricks parts are mainly enzymes. These enzymes catalyze reactions that are already found in nature in a wide variety of environmental niches. As such, they are nothing new. Nature has found ways of balancing their actions, so even if they were to be exposed dramatically, the perturbation should be minimal and easily self-correcting.
Does your project require the exposure or release of the engineered organism to people or the environment (e.g. as medicine, for bioremediation)?
Our project does not require exposure or release to either people or environment. In fact, this project is meant to be tested under extreme biological, chemical and even thermal isolation. One of the points we want to prove is the fact that we can communicate information where there is no possible biological, chemical or even thermal bridge spanning our communicating entities. They will be isolated, both from each other as from the environment.
Hazard
Could your device, when working properly, represent a hazard to people or the environment?
We do not believe our device represents a hazard. If working properly, our devices will stress the host organism without generating any short-term benefit. As such, they are only an added metabolic process to the host. At most, our devices would generate a higher-than-average amount of reactive oxygen species, but not in a significant manner. Perhaps, should the reactions be extreme in number, the light emission could be a hazard to the naked eye...
Is your engineered organism infectious? Does it produce a toxic product? Does it interfere with human physiology or the environment?
Our engineered organism is not infectious, nor does it produce toxic products. The only dangerous product of our devices are reactive oxygen species, however their net production is not significant. Moreover, human physiology (as well as most other physiologies to our knowledge) is quite capable of dealing with reactive oxygen species so long they do not exceed a certain threshold.
What would happen if one or several bioparts change their function or stop working as intended (e.g. through mutation)? How would the whole device or system change its properties and what unintended effects would result thereof?
Mutation of our BioBrick parts would most likely result in loss"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of"

OMVs
Background
Outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) are lipid vesicles commonly produced by Gram-negative bacteria, which are filled with periplasmic content and are 20-250 nm in diameters. The production of OMVs allows bacteria to interact with their environment, and OMVs have been found to mediate diverse functions, including promoting pathogenesis, and enabling bacterial delivery of nucleic acids and proteins. [1-2] A recent paper by Kojima R et al. 2018, demonstrated an EXOtic device that can produce exosomes with specific nucleic acids cargo. [3] We were impressed by the amazing OMVs and EXOtic device and came up with an idea to design a cell-free system to enable specific siRNA to be encapsulated into OMVs for cancer treatment.
Abstract
Not only eukaryotes but also prokaryotes can produce nanoscale bubbles to fulfill diverse functions, such as cellular communication, surface modifications and the elimination of undesired components. Additionally, because of this functional versatility, OMVs have been explored as a platform for bioengineering applications. This year, we XMU-China decide to utilize OMVs as a cell-free platform to deliver our nucleic acids agents to facilitate therapeutic targeting of oncogenic KRAS in pancreatic cancer. [4-5]
Figure 1. We utilize a split protein SpyTag/SpyCatcher (ST/SC) bioconjugation system to create a synthetic linkage between protein OmpA and archaeal ribosomal protein L7Ae. We fuse SpyTag with OmpA at its C-termini and N-termini respectively. [6]
Figure 2. After the induction of IPTG and Arabinose, we can get L7Ae-SpyCatcher and siRNA-C/Dbox. Archaeal ribosomal protein L7Ae owns the ability to bind with C/Dbox RNA structure.

Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#Kill Switches_-_-_TEXT.html,". Even in the presence of arabinose, the molecule which should activate the kill switch, it can be seen that the cells have grown. However the shape of the growth curve produced is altered from typical sigmoidal or ‘S’ shape to something more linear with a peak in optical density after around 7 hours before appearing to begin a plateau or slight decline.
Interestingly, there seems to be no lag phase in the transformed culture and the population begins to grow straight away. This seems to suggest it was taken from an exponentially growing population. However all of the samples in this experiment were taken from overnight cultures which should have reached stationary phase. It could potentially be the case that what we are seeing is just the top of a sigmoidal curve. This would suggest that the population of transformed cells grows in a normal manner but just much more slowly than the untransformed cells.
This raises the question of stability and retention of function. If the cells are able to grow even in the presence of high concentrations of the inducer molecule it may be indicative that the part is not functioning correctly and failing to kill the cells as intended.
Future Plans
If Exeter were to design and make our own kill switch for this project this year, it would be desirable to incorporate the synthetic promoter construct capable of indirectly sensing TNT. The absence of which would activate the killing function.
For Exeter 2014 our work on kill switches is only a small side part of the project though it would be interesting to investigate in more depth in future.  Other teams have in the past looked at preparing synthetic biology for the world and whole iGEM projects could be built around this idea, for  for example Imperial’s development of the geneguard system in 2011.
Stop using antibiotics as markers – Engineered Auxotrophs
No reliance on kill switches
No genetic pollution – prevention of cell lysis
Modularity – plug-in parts
Engineering dependency of plasmids on their host strains
Making plasmids disadvantageous for the hosts
Conditional origins of replication
It would be desirable to look at the long term function of these sorts of devices and use this information to make a much more informed decision on how trustworthy these parts are. If synthetic biology is to be applied to the real world we must be able to correctly predict whether, and if so how, these organisms will change over time.

Applications
Our project is fundamental in nature. However, some promising applications for our project do exist. One of these applications is the usage of cold resistance as a selection method instead of antibiotics. The more obvious application is the ability to grow bacteria, or other organisms, at lower temperatures. This could be useful for the production of biofuels with a better efficiency. Finally, other iGEM teams could also benefit from our CryoBricks.
Biosynthesis
We consider biosynthesis -- that is, the production of various biological compounds through cell factories -- to be an area of interest, where our project can find many useful applications. Equipping cell factories with CryoBricks and successfully culturing them at lower temperatures may increase their efficiency in three different ways. These relate to the effect of temperature on three different levels: whole cells, enzymes, and the product. Note that while the effect of lowering the temperature can be divided into these levels, actually lowering this temperature is facilitated on the enzyme level, by the proteins encoded in our CryoBricks.
The first level is that of the population and whole cells. Addition of a plasmid containing our CryoBricks may allow cell factories to grow faster at temperatures below their optimum. This may reduce the costs of a production process by saving energy on heating, or it may increase the yield if culturing the cell factories at their optimal growth temperature isn't an option for whatever reason.
The second level is the enzyme level. Certain heat sensitive enzymes can function better at lower temperatures. If a cell factory comprises heat sensitive enzymes, lowering the temperature may increase their kinetic activity. In extreme cases, temperature governs not just the kinetic activity but also the solubility of the enzymes. If the heat sensitive enzymes are involved with the production of the compound of interest, lower temperatures may directly increase its rate of formation or its yield. Alternatively, if the enzyme is involved with cell maintenance or growth, product yield or formation speed may still be influenced indirectly by facilitating a higher cell density or growth rate.
The third scale is that of the"

ShanghaiTech iGEM Day for Public Interests (iDPI)
Aiming at spreading the iGEM as well as dedicating to various  social engagements, ShanghaiTech iGEM Day for Public Interests (iDPI) was found in 2016, along with the establishment of the first ever iGEM team at ShanghaiTech University. The iDPI at ShanghaiTech is set up to encourage every iGEM team to devote themselves not only into advanced scientific researches, but also active social practices.
In the acronym name iDPI, “D” stands for dedication, “P” stands for passion, and “I” stands for inspiration. We expect that with the establishment of iDPI, every iGEMer at ShanghaiTech would bear a strong social awareness in mind, yielding profound contributions and achieving valuable social interests.
This year, the iDPI collaborated with Shanghai Coordinate International School, holding an iGEM Lab Open House Day on Zhangjiang campus.

Self-developed Movie for Propagation Purpose
To better illustrate our strategy and mechanism behind the Solar Hunter, our team self designed, filmed and edited a movie. The movie can be viewed in the following to help you build a better understanding on our project.
Meanwhile, this video is used as propagational and educational tools to spread the iGEM competition as well as synthetic biology. Multimedia approach is undoubtedly the best way to arouse interests when it comes to the young generations. Through our efforts, we expect more and more people, especially young kids could know deeper about synthetic biology, eventually resulting in more social contributions and significance."

Grenoble-Alpes,2018,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," multiplication rate even less time is needed to eradicate the bacteria population.
We can also see here two “bumps” in the number of phages and DNA released, they occur after one and two TL (latent time). Those bumps can be seen because of the very high number of phages released after lysis, called the burst size and set here to 500 instead of 20 for the average behaviour.
6) Slow lysis
Figure 12: Growths in slow lysis case over 24h
In this case we switched the latent time TL from 36 minutes to 10 hours (compared to the average behaviour). We can here see that the number of phages takes more time to achieve the tipping point where the bacteria population start declining.
The bumps linked to the release of phages after TL and described in the previous case are also very easy to see here.
7) Low phages binding
Figure 13: Growths in low phages binding case over 24h
In the case of a low phages binding rate Ki there is a slower decline of bacteria, or even an equilibrium state with both phages and bacteria as it is the case in this situation.
This shows the importance of the binding rate for a phage therapy.
8) Low carrying capacity
Figure 14: Growths in low carrying capacity case over 24h
Interestingly an equilibrium state can also occur when the carrying capacity is too low. This situation is explained by the fact that the number of infected cells I is equal to the product of the binding rate Ki, the number of phages V and the number of susceptible bacteria S. Therefore if the number of bacteria S is capped by the carrying capacity, the number of phages and infected cell is also limited.
9) C. difficile
Figure 15: Growths in uneffective phages case over 24h
This figure shows the result of a phages-bacteria interaction where the phage is not effective at killing the bacteria. This case was inspired by the work of Nottingham 2018 iGEM Team, who worked with lysogenic phages. Lysogenic phages end up by multiplying and killing their host, but not in every case, and with a long latent time.
We implemented this situation in our MATLAB modeling by changing the lysis time, but also by adding a lysis probability factor pL: only in a few percentage of the case will the infection end up in a lytic cycle.
As we can see the phages-bacteria interaction has a cyclic behavior: once the phage reduced the number of bacteria there is an"

SEAMLESS Cloning
1. Construct primers for the desired construct with 15 bp overhangs for homologous recombination later.
2. Amplify DNA fragments, purify them and measure concentration.
3. Calculate the amount of PCR product amount you need with the formula:
     ng of insert = (2 x bp of insert x 100 (ng vector))  /  bp of vector
4. Pipette 100 ng of vector and the calculated amount of insert together. Scale down the reaction from 20 µl to the smallest volume possible.
5. Add 5 fold buffer and last the 10 fold enzyme mix.
6. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.
7. Cool the sample on ice for not more than 5 minutes.
8. Use the whole sample for transformation.
Peptide Library Construction
Starting with GFP scaffolds (Denoted pRS 316-GFPM), random loop libraries were created. Randomized  amino acids were inserted at Asp-102/Asp-103 and Glu-172/Asp-173 by using the NNK method in order to create the random loop libraries. NNK sequences in primers number 13 and 16 were used to create regions I and ӀӀӀ. After having randomized DNA sequences, these two regions were assembled with region ӀӀ which remained intact. In each of the amplification and extension steps, Pfus PCR protocol was used. For the assembly of the three regions, a modified fusion PCR was used.

The team was extremely fortunate to meet at the Pentagon with representatives of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), as well as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering in Washington, D.C. Additionally, we conducted our work at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) with funding from DTRA. These organizations ensured we kept our focus on the anti-biological warfare nature of our project. In coming years we hope to test the effectiveness of the sense and respond mechanism in E. coli in the lab with actual conotoxin. The extreme toxicity of conotoxin makes testing hazardous, however our unique relationship with NRL allows us access to resources which reduce the danger sufficiently in order to conduct future lab testing. As we integrate our sense and respond mechanism into a simulated human microbiome, we hope to predict the effectiveness of the sense and respond mechanism in the human environment."

Summary: As our simulation program becomes more and more mature, we encounter more problems in consistency of our database. We all want to make major changes and make it right this time, but sadly we don’t have the time. So we make minor changes, add patches to fix the bugs, but we have to let go of the unconsistency in substituent, compartment and other places. Now the DB looks not beautiful or elegant, but usable. This is good enough since our first goal now is to make our software work, and a DB that can properly describe simple reaction networks should be enough. We plan to leave major changes to further development.
Most of our team members work intensively during the 7 days off, and the achievement of their work is rich. DB of both EFP-Lausanne and Synchronized Ecoli are basically finished. Tables and graphs on DB structure has been published. Our software core seems finally begin to function right. UI is under constructing. All the codes are now on github.
We schedule our trip and book plane tickets to Beijing, Chicago and Boston. Jue Wang is now in charge of money and team wear.
We dined together on Oct 1, but without a relaxed mind, it was not fun for me. What actually thrills me up is to explore my potential and to find how much can be done in the 7 days. I do have fun working beyond my limit.

Optimisation Considerations: Engineering a Biosensor
Scalability
The initial prototype or production of this biosensor must be easily scaled up for widespread use over time. Key factors to consider include the upscaling of cells required to produce the mechanism required. Bioreactor sizing is crucial, and having successive reactor tanks of increasing size will allow for a large batch of cells to be grown under optimal conditions in order to meet a larger scale production requirement.  The technology should also consider scale of application. This technology has potential uses for an individual consumer at a household level as well as industrial or quality assurance applications for large produce players all the way up the supply chain. By designing a biosensor that can take many forms, a wide scale of users can be catered for.
Selectivity and specificity
Selectivity refers to the competition of various molecules to a receptor, whilst specificity refers to the unique activation of a receptor by a certain molecule, and they go hand-in-hand in biosensor design. Many sensing devices do not respond to one sole molecule, but rather to a feature of that molecule. For example, a common infrared carbon monoxide sensor operates on the function that doubled-bonded carbons absorb energy of a particular wavelength. It would, however, pick up a signal from other compounds that also contain a double bond attached to a carbon (Sberveglieri 2012). Other sensors may instead be specific to a metabolite of a molecule of interest rather than the molecule itself, or having competing selectivity to multiple compounds of a similar physical structure. The sensitivity and specificity of a biosensor is one of the pillars of its characterisation.
Recyclability
Waste is another particularly critical parameter to take into account during the biosensor design process. Following our discussions with OzHarvest, creating something disposable but not biodegradable would be irresponsible from an environmental point of view. Recyclability or biodegradability allow for a better reception of our final product, which is a positive for the synthetic biology movement as a whole. Given that one of the driving motives behind our biosensor is to minimise produce wastage, it would be even more redundant to create a wasteful product.
Sensitivity
Whilst sensitivity is inherently important in any sensor, talks with Zespri Kiwifruits enlightened us on exactly how important sensitivity is in the case of our biosensor. For kiwifruit in particular, coolstore ethylene levels must be less than 30ppb. Currently all chemical sensing devices with the exception of a gas chromatographer fail to detect ethylene at a concentration"

Jul 26 ~ Aug 1, 2010 Talk together with Hao Jiang and Liao, write the second edition of oscillator database and database format. In order to deal with the real reactions and real species, we add virtual biobricks to our database, together with a bunch of new attributes. The database is constructed by 3 lists, the single compartment list, the species structure list, the reaction list, relationship of the 3 lists is shown in the following picture.[pic]

Design Process
Establish feedback system
Feedback exists between two parts when each affects the others. In our system, these two parts are the light sensor and the concentration of the light generator protein. By involving the light sensor in the loop, we can establish the feedback.
Light generator
Approach
Next issue we placed our focus on the properties of the candidate parts. At the beginning we laid eyes on the luciferin illumination system. But the engineering bacteria we were using do not have the luciferin producing enzyme system or the luciferin cycle. Fortunately the 2010iGEM Cambridge has successfully deliver this cycling system into the E.coli. But the wave length does
not fit the light sensor which we will discuss later. So we picked another well-known bio illuminator, the Lux operon. It is also presented by 2010 Cambridge.
Lux operon
The Lux operon is a set of genes active in bacterial luminescence. The genes encoding the luciferase and a fatty acid reductase complex which synthesizes the substrate are contained in a single operon. When cloned into a recipient host, the lux operon facilitates the generation of a
blue-green light with a maximum intensity at 490 nm without the requirement of adding exogenous substrate, which was the prime reason why we chose it to be our light source in this study.
In our project, we using PCR extracted the DNA sequence from the BBa_K325909, and cloned it under the controllable promoter. The coding device relieved from the original promoter is also available as the BBa_K785003. The growth curve of the Lux"

Picture of the gel with the digest of B0015, J23022 and J23032 with Xba I. The faint ladder shows that they were not properly cut.
Only one ligation succeeded ( R0084 + B0032 ). We think that the others failed because the vectors weren't properly cut. Therefore, we did another digest. This time we cut the vector with Xba I, and only when this worked, we cut it with EcoR I. We did this because Xba I has problems with cleaving close to the ends of DNA fragments. The problem is that Xba I doesn't seem to cut at all. Perhaps there's something wrong with the enzyme. We are trying to overcome this problem by allowing the restriction with Xba I to continue overnight.
Some more plasmids were isolated from the cells using the Qiagen Miniprep Kit. It concerns parts used in the filter and in the inverter ("

Finally, Moson met HKUST members Miss SUN Fei & Mr. WANG Yuqi on July 25th afternoon after several times of postponement. To begin with, Moson gave a brief introduction of our project E.Lumoli this year, and they also talked about their one. To enhance understanding of the two teams, they exchange ideas about human practice as well. Then, thanks to their full trust, Moson paid a visit to their lab and took joint pictures with them, including one of their supervisors. When entered the lab, HKUST iGEMers were busy with their experiment -- enzyme cleave and electrophoresis etc. The fundamental apparatus and devices in HKUST were very similar to ours, but lab manage regulations were not parallel exactly. For example, as undergraduates, they were not allow to conduct experiment alone in the lab after 6 pm while we always stay in our lab late into midnight doing research. When it comes to the organization of team members, XMU iGEMers are largely junior students but HKUST's iGEM team is mainly composed of freshmen and sophomores.
Moson, on behalf of XMU iGEM, have built up intimate friendship with 2012 HKUST iGEMers. Additionally, he also brought them the postcards of XMU as souvenirs.
Visit to Peking iGEM 2012 Team
On July 6th, Muxin attended Summer Camp of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering in Peking University. As a member of XMU iGEM, Muxin grasped the opportunity to visit the Peking iGEM team, one of the earliest and most outstanding Chinese iGEM teams. Having contacted with Zhilei ZHAO, the captain of Peking iGEM 2012, Muxin came to their iGEM laboratory on July 9th. Although it was summer time, most of them still stayed in the lab preparing for the competition.
   
After the self-introduction and changing information about the 2012 iGEM project separately, including the team theme, constitute, experimental progress etc., they showed Muxin around the lab warmly, there being a darkroom under construction. They said they would like to construct cell sensor that could program cells to achieve some function, which seemed fascinating. After chatting, Muxin and they took a photo together. Thanks to their warm hearts, the whole visit was circumfused by a cordial and friendly atmosphere.

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#MSDS_-_-_TEXT.html," all contaminated waste is autoclaved before disposed through controlled routes. The used pipette tips are soaked in 10% RBS 35 detergent for at least one hour before disposal into the contaminated waste bags. In addition, the windows are shut at all times, preventing release of the bacteria and toxic reagents to the outside. Outside the labs, we remove gloves and lab coats. We also wash our hands after finishing experiments and before exiting the lab.  Moreover, when collaborators visited the labs, they were asked to wear lab coats and gloves.
3. Do the biological materials used in the lab work pose any risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
The niches of E. coli K-12 strains are within human or animal bodies. Non-engineered E. coli has very limited survival in natural environment [6] . Nevertheless, our engineered E. coli has the ability to break down a wide range of plastics, and can potentially use them as food source, providing the right conditions including humidity and temperature. This might cause damage to many objects used in our daily life and industry. Moreover, ethylene glycol, as a product of polyurethane (PUR), might be released in the environment and cause risks to human and animal health.
As described in Question 2, we plan to contain the engineered bacteria within a bioreactor. We have carefully thought about the design of the bioreactor to prevent bacteria from escaping to the environment. For example, add basic buffer to limit cell replication, and set up kill switches that kill all the bacteria if the bioreactor is opened when operating. After digesting and synthesis of bioplastics, the engineered bacteria in the bioreactor will be killed to harvest bioplastics produced within the cells. For implementation within recycling facilities, where a large amount of bacteria will be used, we can design an extra compartment for the bioreactor to further prevent releasing bacteria into the environment.
4. Do the biological materials used in the lab work pose any risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
The enzymes were taken from natural bacteria such as Ralstonia eutropha. These bacteria are already responsible for plastic degradation. Despite this, global plastic waste is still a huge issue throughout the world and will remain so for many hundreds of years.
A major concern would be the use of the engineered bacteria as a bioweapon to rapidly degrade the infrastructure of a society if it was coated by an aerosol attack. This stems from many of our modern products having plastic built into them, this is from phone casings to table finishes to"

Light Sensing System
Approach
Balancing Bacterial Dormancy Requires Accurate Regulation of the System
The genes needed for inducing dormancy when the bacteria are not exposed to light, are found in the photocontrol device part, BBa_K519030 . This part is composed of three genes named ho1, pcyA, and cph8, all of which are essential to ensure the cells ability to respond to red light. When the photocontrol device is exposed to light, a phosphorylation cascade activates the transcription factor OmpR, which in turn induces transcription through the OmpR-regulated promoter, BBa_R0082 . This system is combined with the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system in the endeavour to mediate light-dependent dormancy in bacteria. In the first considered design of the light-dependent dormancy system, the aim was to clone the photocontrol device, BBa_K519030 , under control of a constitutive promoter, RelE under control of the OmpR-regulated promoter, BBa_R0082 , and RelB under control of a constitutive promoter, all into one high copy BioBrick assembly plasmid pSB1C3, as seen on Figure 1.
Figure 1. All three components of the light-dependent dormancy system cloned into one high copy plasmid.
The Photocontrol Device was Placed under Control of a Constitutive Promoter
From the constitutive promoter family the weak promoter, BBa_J23114 , the two medium promoters, BBa_J23106 , and BBa_J23110 , and the strong promoter, BBa_J23102 , were tested by fluorescence microscopy to determine which one to use for expression of the photo"
BIT,2015,Team:BIT-China#project Basic circuits.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"utive promoter J23119 controls the transcription of GlsA. The function of glsA will be activated under acidic environment and it will play a critical role in ensuring bacteria’s survival with the anticipation of glutamine (Gln). The activity of GlsA will be repressed when the environmental pH is below 6.0. The dependence on pH makes it a suitable tool to respond necessarily.
Fig.10 The gene circuits of acid resistance device
○ Experiment Results
Firstly, we cloned the gene GlsA through PCR from the genome of E.coli str. K-12, and constructed it on the vector pSB1C3 as a standard part(Fig.11).
Fig.11 The construction result of GlsA
Adding sequences through designing primers, the promoter J23119, strong RBS B0034 and our functional gene GlsA are combined together. Then we transformed it into E.coli BMTOP10, and selected positive strain from them (Fig.12). We have measured the sequence of No.10 and it turns out to be completely right.
Fig.12 The construction result of JBG (J23119+B0034+GlsA)
After the construction of acid-resistance circuit, we measured the OD600 under different pH to test the efficacy of acid resistance. The growth curve is shown in Fig.13
Fig.13 The growth curve of experimental group(JBG) and control
The difference between the testing group and the control group is not evident. We employed a strong promoter T7 to check whether the protein has been expressed. The functional gene GlsA was constructed on plasmid pET28a and the plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3). 0.5% IPTG was added to induce the expression of the protein. The following is the picture of SDS-PAGE (Fig.14). It shows that our target protein has been expressed successfully.

Asr promoter
Asr promoter belongs to asr gene encoding acid-shock RNA. It is a pH-responsive promoter native to E.coli which induces transcription in acidic environment from pH 4.0 ~ 5.0 , and shows low activity at a neutral pH[15]. This year, we chose asr promoter as the base of pH regulation system.

Two endoglucanase genes - cenA and cenC - and an exoglucanase gene - cex - from Cellulomonas fimi have been sequenced. All three enzymes have been expressed in E. coli. We will need to order a stock of Cellulomonas fimi and design primers for cex and an endoglucanase. Please see me (Adler) for the relevant papers/sequences as they are not freely available online.
The nucleotide sequence for Clostridium thermocellum beta-glucosidase is also available. The existence of beta-glucosidase in Cellulomonas fimi has been confirmed and a putative amino acid sequence has been released. However, I have not found any papers documenting its nucleotide sequence*. We should decide whether we want to use beta-glucosidase from Clostridium (probably easier, since we have the complete gene sequence) or Cellulomonas fimi (probably more effective, since all three enzymes would come from the same species, but also more time-consuming).

Stuttgart,2018,Team:Stuttgart#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," coli strain. The nisin is further modified to incorporate a tyrosine for linkage. We aim to insert a tyrosine residue into the sequence of nisin as a starting point for enzymatic linkage to the chitosan matrix. A special challenge is the creation of new BioBricks because multiple different genes and features need to be introduced. First an inducible promoter with strong RBS is placed in front of nisA. Next, a tyrosine tag for linkage and a His6-tag for purification are introduced between the leader peptide (cleaved at export) and the functional nisA gene.
To create an antimicrobial surface, the mentioned compounds are linked by chemical or enzymatic reactions. Hereby, the chitosan polymer works as a scaffold structure to which nisin and the rhamnolipids are coupled. There are two different approaches for linkage.
The first option is the transesterification with divinyladipate [5] . Hereby, rhamnolipids and chitosan are connected using divinyladipate as linker. The chemical reaction takes place in ionic liquid as solute because chitosan is slighty soluble in other liquids.
Nisin is coupled to chitosan enzymatically by tyrosinase [6] . The method works for the connection of tyrosine containing proteins to chitosan. For this method a nisin variant bearing a tyrosine residue was created. The tyrosinase oxidizes tyrosine which can react with the amine group of chitosan after oxidization and form a covalent bond. As a proof of concept the green fluourescence protein (GFP) was linked to chitosan. The reaction can be analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

To implement audiogenetics, we chose two (Piezo1 and TRPC5) from hundreds of mechanosensitive(MS) channels for their sensitivity to mechanical stress and selective permeability to calcium ion. We used genetically encoded calcium indicator (R-GECO) to quantitatively examine the sensibility of Piezo1 and TRPC5 channels. We used hypoosmolarity as a positive control stimuli and validate the function of the MS channels and Calcium sensor.  We designed a microfluidic chip to quantitatively tune the shear force exerted on cell membrane, and both channel are responsive to such mechical stress. Surprisingly, we discovered that Piezo1-expression CHO cell response to shear force in an biphasic manner and a maximum responsive of ~0.3 pa. We haven't found similar report in the past.  We also examined the intracellular calcium response to various combination of frequency and intensity of sound.We discovered that Piezo1-expression CHO cell are very sensitive to"

KULeuven,2008,Team:KULeuven#Model#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," take place in the subsystems can be described by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) like Mass-Action laws, Hill Kinetic laws and so on. An extensive search for parameters involved in these ODEs has resulted in the discovery of almost all necessary quantities for the simulations.
For every subsystem, we made a PDF-file with all the ODEs involved in modeling the subsystem, together with a clear overview of the used parameters (with coherent links to our references).
Models
We implemented these ODEs in both Celldesigner and the MATLAB Symbiology Toolbox .  A nice tutorial for modeling in Celldesigner can be found on Imperial College Computer Modelling Practicals Spring 2008 . These 2 environments offer a grapical user-interface which makes it easy to implement biochemical pathways (and the kinetic laws which govern these). In the pictures in each of the subsytems you can see clearly the influence of the different species: activation, repression, complexation, ... We also provide links to the actual implemented diagrams which can be freely downloaded to simulate the subsystems yourself.
Simulation(s)
The implemented models are simulated using inputs as close to reality as possible. In each simulation the typical assets of each subsystem are clearly visualized and described extensively. For example in the filter we simulate the influence of different noisy signals on the output of the filter (and on the output of the system).
Sensitivity Analysis
Good modeling practice requires that the modeler provides an evaluation of the confidence in the model, possibly assessing the uncertainties associated with the modeling process and with the outcome of the model itself. Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis offer valid tools for characterizing the uncertainty associated with a model. Uncertainty analysis (UA) quantifies the uncertainty in the outcome of a model. Sensitivity Analysis has the complementary role of ordering by importance the strength and relevance of the inputs in determining the variation in the output. Sensitivity analysis lets you calculate the time-dependent sensitivities of all the species states with respect to species initial conditions and parameter values in the model.
A sensitivity analysis is needed e.g. when some of the parameter values are not known. The true value of a parameter is unimportant when the most essential species states are insensitive to the unknown parameter. Only for the sensitive unknown parameters are experiments needed to determine their true values. In our project we have been able to find hypothetical values for all used parameters, but a sensitivity analysis is nevertheless always valuable to detect critical parameters. These are the parameter values on which our project critically depends and which should be analyzed/characterized as exact as possible.
Our analysis is based upon the following formula"
USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the relationship between the temperature and the intensity of the fluorescence, so we construted a standard cure using our prototype, and tested the standard curve with a specific temperature. Furthermore, if we introduce the GdnHCl, we can alter the standard curve and locate the peak of the intensity of the fluorescence in any chose temperature.           In the process of industry production,engineers find that           incrustation has harmful effects on the device especially the boiler. When there is a certain number of incrustation aggregate on the pipe it will cause a serious accident.         Therefore,when and where we should clean the incrustation is a headache to all the engineers. Our BTI presented here provides a novel method to solve this problem.
The Prototype
As the pipes in industry are cylindrical in most cases, we also design our hardware in cylindrical to fit it.
We design a clearance in our hardware to contain the yeast medium.
In order to prevent other microbes from coming into the device, we also design a cover over the device.
We design our device by SOLIDWORKS and make it into reality by 3D printing(3DP). Considering the light transmittance and economics, the material of our hardware is transparent photosensitive resin and the material of the cover is ordinary resin.
Before we put the prototype into use, we had done lots of mathematical modeling to show the working properties of it. See more details in our modeling section.
The standard curve
We combined a thermostatic water bath and a pump to simulate the working conditions.
The room temperature was around 24 ℃. The pump was set at 63 rpm. We set the temperature of the water bath at 34 ℃, 38 ℃ and 42 ℃. At each temperature, we cultivated the yeast in our prototype for 1 hour, and then extracted the yeast for fluorescence testing. The prototype was washed thoroughly before adding new yeast to it and used for the test of another temperature.
We chose 36 ℃ as the test point. Other conditions were set as same as the points on the standard curve.
We took five photoes of each temperature through the fluorescence microscope. the photos are showed below.
Using the quantitating method we introduce in our Proof of Concept section, we get the figure below, showing the standard curve and the test point.
The data of the points above is showed below.

Conclusions
Introduction
During the development of CAT-Seq, we have met various biotechnology field experts with the hope of finding design flaws and improvements to our system. One of these experts was Audrius Laurinėnas. At that time we had a big problem of not having enough amplified DNA in each droplet for robust sequencing. Audrius has suggested the MDA reaction. Yet, he also knew that using modified nucleotides might inhibit the MDA reaction, as phi29 DNA polymerase does not incorporate many modified nucleotides. It is a logical assumption to think that some of the Substrate Nucleotides might somehow inhibit the DNA replication reaction. We have hypothesised that the inhibitory effect of modified nucleotides might skew the amplified DNA fragment size and product yield distribution. This an important aspect to consider, as long fragments are crucial for high quality when Nanopore Sequencing is employed. Yet, if we don’t use a high enough concentration of Substrate Nucleotides, the dynamic range of our measurement might decrease dramatically.
Modelling of inhibitory nucleotide incorporation
Therefore, we have written a mathematical description of Phi29 DNA amplification which takes into account the possibility of the Phi29 inhibition by Substrate Nucleotide, in order to investigate the maximum amount of substrate nucleotides we can use without worrying about short sequencing reads.
The mathematical Phi29 model imitates the amplification of the CAT-Seq Esterase DNA template with random hexamers. First of all, random hexamer primer sequences are generated and aligned to the DNA template. This maps the beginning of the DNA amplification. After that, newly synthesized DNA templates can be immediately primed again with random hexamers. The re-priming of DNA template happens every few iterations of synthesis. Each site housing"

Furthermore, co-expression approximates the condition we were attempting for our first condition – namely, the formation of microcompartments around tagged proteins. We were also able to measure the condition where lumazine synthase was expressed in the absence of fluorescent proteins, which were expressed after the production of the lumazine synthase microcompartments. We interpret the results to indicating that tagged proteins have more difficulty entering pre-formed lumazine synthase microcompartments.

Introduction
Lumazine synthase (LS) from Aquifex aeolicus forms icosahedral microcompartment (MC) assemblies of 60 or 180 monomeric units that self assemble and are capable of isolating proteins from their local environment. As shown in previously published work (1), the LS protein has been mutated so that the interior of the MC is negatively charged; the UL 2009 iGEM team has submitted the mutated LS gene to the parts registry (BBa_K249002). A negatively charged interior allows for preferential compartmentalization of positively charged molecules, which can easily be engineered through the addition of a poly-arginine tag to a target protein (1). The size of the cavity of the Lumazine Synthase microcompartment was enlarged and the negative charge was increased via directed evolution (2). The compartment formed by this polypeptide has a larger cavity and a larger net negative charge, thus allowing a larger loading capacity into the cavity of the compartment.
The part was synthesized by Bio Basic Inc. into the pET28a plasmid vector (which allows for expression of ELS with an N-terminal His-tag). The Enhanced Lumazine Synthase (ELS) was moved into the pSB1C3 vector by the Lethbridge 2011 team.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to"

Whether the Freiburg's design is efficient or not
According to the experimental record of Freiburg, the success rate is higher than 95%(32/33). However, this result, to some degree, lacks statistical significance.
In the result section, they emphasize that there is a light band at 1200bp, which they believe could indicate that the Golden Gate connection works well. However, after conducting several experiments by ourselves, we find that the key point to indicate whether Golden Gate connection works is not the band at 1200bp. If the band is not clear and specific in the gel, it indicates the experiment doesn’t go well. We can easily find several light bands under the band of 1200bp. Moreover, the second light band is somewhat lighter than the band at 1200bp. Although the Freiburg can explain the results with the repeatability of the TALE sequence, we suppose that the possibility of the mismatch of the sticky ends still can’t be excluded. Frankly speaking, we try to believe that they really made it, but if the success cannot be repeated, there must be something wrong with their system. You can view Detail information in iGEM2012 Freiburg wiki.

Our Model 101
We sought to model fish population depletion.  We succeeded.  The result: unless we work together on a global scale and make drastic changes to our fishing habits, only a fraction of the total fish population that existed in 1950 will be present in our oceans by 2100.  The work of our team in the laboratory - the creation of Omega-3 using E.coli - could be exactly the measure necessary to save our oceans.
Our approach:  we took one of a multitude of different possible approaches to population modelling and our project can be broken down into approximately four different stages:
We performed meta-analysis to obtain information about the variation of total fish biomass in our oceans over time. We scaled our result to Villy Christensen’s (University of British Columbia) prediction of total fish biomass for 1950. We, thus, created a time series of total fish biomass in our oceans between 1950 and 2006. We believe our time series to be one of the first of its kind and certainly one of the first to be generated, largely, from real world data.
We hypothesised a differential equation model which we believe incorporates the key features responsible for fish population growth and decline. Our final model takes into account recruitment of fish into the adult fish population, death of adult fish due to fishing and death of adult fish due to natural causes.
We changed the parameters in our model until its predictions closely replicated the real world fish biomass data.
Content that our model could predict fish biomass in the past and present, we enabled our model to forecast future fish biomass. We discuss how alternative sources of omega three could influence this outcome.
Fish biomass data – collection and manipulation
Motivation
In order to model the future of the global fish population, we chose a differential equation modelling approach.  Such an approach, however,does rely on precise parameter definition – and,"
